            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Lake Ekala Nurra is a picturesque spot on the Mid North Coast, NSW. A privately owned 'convention centre', previously called Camp Obadiah, is set back off the Pacific Highway 'north' of Moorland.&lt;br/&gt;There is no need to enter their main property (so, no need to go over the railway line), and permission has been given for cachers to access the cache where it is hiding, which is well maintained area worthy of a picnic.&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint one (a micro) will 'tell you' where you need to go, which isn't very far away. (It may be an advantage if you're of Italian heritage). But you will be very much in the shade.</groundspeak:long_description>

But if you have a family and they're not too keen on the trail, that's okay, They can spend their time at beautiful Spalding park, while you head off to find your cache, and then return to the family once you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">No climbing or negotiating fauna in this one - a straightforward locate and log.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fun about this cache is that it's location is in full view of muggles. (Though, I've been to this location many times - including when I placed cache - and there was no-one in sight. If you get there and they are there one benefit is that they'll likely be concentrating on something else so, if you don't make too much fuss about locating and replacing cache there shouldn't be any problems). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be invisible by being confident. Look like you're supposed to be there. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dendy Park Tennis Club is one of the leading tennis clubs in Victoria and Australia. The Club has a great history and traditionally used for competition, junior development and sense of community. Many of the greats of Davis Cup, Federation Cup and Grand Slam tennis have graced our courts including Wimbledon champions Frank Sedgeman, Neale Fraser, Pat Cash and Evonne Goolagong-Cawley. It's one of the state’s strongest Tennis Victoria Pennant clubs, providing tremendous opportunities for adult and junior players to develop their game, or simply enjoy the game. The Club currently waives the Joining Fee for new members in all categories except Playing, offering significant financial savings. The Senior mixed social group on Friday mornings are currently looking for new players. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a small waterproof plastic sandwich container. It's at eye level and easily retrievable without the need to ferret around in any bushes. Container holds only pencil, sharpener and log-book right now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also - there are other geo-challenges nearby - one of which requires a night visit, so you could spend a bit of time in this area. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

An ammo box filled with trinkets from our Antiques Store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A place I think people may not know is here and may like to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a kid after swimming at the Olympic pool we would go over to the park and wait for our parents to pick us up. It took a lot of guts to be able to jump across into Australia, (a big gap if you only had little legs). It took a long time before I got the guts to do it, and once I made it across I remember crying for quite some time before finding a way back across.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes this place is very quiet, especially in the Winter, but at other times it can be over crowded with muggles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little Australia was designed and built by Mr. Arthur Higgenson who later died on the Burma Railway during World War 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The history of the Lawson Swimming Pool (across the road) began with the building of the Railway to the area in 1867, as it was necessary to supply water to the locomotives traveling in both directions. An earth-wall dam was constructed in the gully north-west of the Railway Station. The water supplying this dam was from springs on the surrounding hillsides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On February 16th, 1880, the area where the dam was situated was notified as a Reserve for Water Supply and Railway purposes, but this was changed and proclaimed for Railway Purposes only on June 10th, 1891. During the 1877-1884 drought, the dam ran dry, and during this time, actually in 1881, the dam was enlarged and the wall raised 7 feet and a timber spillway provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more info on the very interesting history of the pool please go to the site below. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.midmountainshistory.org/lawson_swimming.html</groundspeak:long_description>

Found by Mark, we were coming up to Yallingup today for Chloes's 10th birthday to the Maze. 
I decided to check for any caches in the area and saw this one which i had not seen previously and downloaded to gps to go and look for. 
Gps sent me off course into sand dunes which i thought was a bit strange and then i remembered the hint and soon found cache. It was out in the open so when i had signed the log i hid a bit better under some bushes, still in the same spot. NO need to go over fence to find this one! TFTC. TNLN. 
Love the location, thanks for bringing us back to this beautiful spot. </groundspeak:text>

Small Black 35mm Film Cannister.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fenton Hall at Merricks North began as a school for the local children when the owner of the farm house being leased as a school, Percy Huntley, indicated in&lt;br/&gt;1938 that he no longer wished to lease the farm house. The Education Department offered £60, the equivalent of five years' rent, towards the erection of a new school building and a local committee decided on 11/2 acres owned by the Country Roads Board as the site for a school, at the junction of Merricks Road and Bittern-Dromana Road. Local committee members sought pledges of&lt;br/&gt;financial support from the local community and working bees erected the hall, under the supervision of a builder. It was officially opened on 22 October, 1938.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fenton Hall served as the Merricks North School between 1938 and 1951, when the Area School was opened at Red Hill. It also served many other concurrent purposes for the local community, being used for church services, social occasions, a baby health centre, a branch library, youth club, etc. A tennis court was added to the grounds in 1951 and an additional front room in 1958. A bus shelter was added in 1958.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fenton Hall became the focal point for the community at Merricks North. The Merricks North Coolstore was opened on the opposite side of the Bittern- Dromana Road in 1948. The hall was also located opposite the Merricks North Post Office which was built by local working bees in 1931.</groundspeak:long_description>

Point Leo Foreshore Reserve provides excellent waves for surfing and is one of the closest surf beaches to Melbourne. At the 2006 census, Point Leo had a population of 328.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History. &lt;br/&gt;The area was known as Bobbanaring to the local Bunurong people prior to European settlement. The area was first surveyed in 1841, and a town was proposed here in 1869, but the area did not develop until after World War II, when the Woods family built a house and store. Facilities were developed in the 1960s, including hot showers at Point Leo foreshore. Point Leo Post Office finally opened on 8 December 1969, but closed in 1974. By the 1980s the area was still dominated by holiday homes and weekend travellers with few permanent residents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy your visit and watch out for muggles during peak season.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Godric Gryffindor was a wizard and one of the four Founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was good friends with Salazar Slytherin, but opposed him when he later thought that they should not accept mudblood students at Hogwarts&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gryffindor's birthplace became known as Godric's Hallow, in his honour.&lt;br /&gt;
Godric Gryffindor's portrait still remains at Hogwarts.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Each of the four founders were later commanded by the Ministry of Magic to hide a secret Cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Any Wizard or Muggle that was able to seek out and find these four Caches and answer the questions which they held, would have the power and knowledge to then seek out a fifth and FINAL cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Legend tells us that
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
may have hidden his Cache a few paces from S31.50.ZZZ E115.55.ZZZ

&lt;br /&gt;
Any Wizard or Muggle that was able to seek out and find these four Caches and answer the questions which they held, would have the power and knowledge to then seek out a fifth and FINAL cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Legend tells us that
&lt;br /&gt;

hid her Cache in a large object two score paces SSW from S31.50.WWW E115.57.WWW

PLEASE ensure this stamp remains sealed in the letter box.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If this is your first &quot;Letterbox&quot;, and you don't have a personal
stamp, then you can still record your visit but you must draw a
realistic stick man figure of each of you attending the box on one
of the post cards provided and then sign and date it
accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Box 2: Geocache&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A Traditional Cache, containing a log book and pencil and has room
for a few Trackables or Coins, but please no swaps at his
site.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Box 3: QR CODE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Just contains a personalised QR CODE for you to capture to confirm
that you have visited the &quot;Therapeutic Threesome&quot;. Please also
record a journal online prior to submitting your capture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Your Directions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. Using your GPSR navigate to the spot identified by the above
coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Mark this as a Waypoint.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Look SOUTH and you will see a prominent hard surfaced
path.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Start to walk on this path, it meanders in different
directions.&lt;br /&gt;
5. It then takes you in a general Easterly direction.&lt;br /&gt;
6. DO NOT leave the path.&lt;br /&gt;
7. When you are 775M (as the crow flies) from your starting WP you
will reach a crossroads.&lt;br /&gt;
8. Do not turn, but cross over and continue in an Easterly
direction.&lt;br /&gt;
9. Keep your eyes open&lt;br /&gt;
10. A short distance after the crossroads you will reach this tree
stump along side the pathway.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
11. Look to the NORTH.&lt;br /&gt;
12. The Letterbox is hidden in a very traditional manner just 12M
North of the pictured stump.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations to SpatialRiq for being the FIRST to find, the

To make the most of this trail, it's advised that you start at #1Testing Tube, &quot;for it's a very good place to start&quot;..... (reminds me of a song I once knew)...

All the Caches are about 15cm in size, not camouflaged, so &quot;should&quot; be quite easy to spot.&lt;br /&gt;

you on a short stroll over Heirisson Island.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Firstly you need to attend the above &quot;coded&quot; coordinates
and search out a pouch.
&lt;br /&gt;
This pouch contains a second set of coded coordinates which
is the final location of the Cache.
&lt;br /&gt;
However the large object that you find at GZ is NOT
actually the final prize...
&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to LOOK a little harder to find
that.
&lt;br /&gt;
BYOP, a signature on the log is required for your

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When I was just a little tacker I used to love going places that my mum and dad didn't want me to. A special favourite of mine was the tree out the front of my house. I could climb all the way to the top and I could see for miles, but my mum was always scared I would fall.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is named for a particular quality that the tree has. Tap at its roots and they make a nice drumming sound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If the water in the creek is high you might not be able to get to it without getting your feet wet. Also, a lot of kids walk home after school through this park, so pick your timing and use stealth if required. When you do find it, be prepared to sign the logbook without moving the cache too far as it is tethered in location. Please don't untie it. There is a pencil provided for logging your find in the original stash, along with some things that were common when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Take bug spray and use caution when climbing trees.&lt;br /&gt;

This cache has been placed with the permission of DERM, Rockhampton.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Charles Archer explored the Fitzroy and Dawson River areas looking for suitable grazing lands in 1853-4. He tendered for the Farris Run in Gracemere and travelled overland with livestock to arrive in 1855. His brother Colin was to bring much needed supplies by sea and the two met when the ketch &quot;Ellida&quot; sailed up the coast from Maryborough and along the Fitzroy River. This became the site of Rockhampton. Sleipner, Archer`s horse, was named after Odin`s fabled eight legged horse in Scandinavian mythology.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Approximately 9 km north-east of Rockhampton's city center and standing 604 meters above sea level, you cant miss it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Featuring spectacular views of the Rockhampton region you will view deeply incised valleys, dry rainforests, fleeting glimpses of forest inhabitants and feasting cockatoos which feature strongly in a visit to Mount Archer National Park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mount Archer National Park protects bushland remnants in the Berserker Ranges, a scenic backdrop to Rockhampton. The park covers 4250 hectares of open forest and woodland communities dominated by eucalypts, with a large pocket of dry rainforest in the deeply incised Moores Creek valley. The dry rainforest communities are areas of high conservation value and include several plant species with restricted distributions.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
From the Sleipner lookout you can see Mt. Risien, Mt. Badger and Mt. Sleipner. It is a 1.2km walk to the lookout on uneven terrain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a camo plastic jar with an &quot;official geocache&quot; sticker on it. It is tethered to a log so you wont be able to move it far. Recent DERM policy regarding geocaching in National Parks has required that all caches contain only a logbook and pen. Please do not leave any swaps of trackables. Make sure you conceal it well once you're done, as it may otherwise be visible to passing muggles.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for small container tethered to a fallen tree so you wont be able to move it far. It should be fairly concealed to muggles due to the distance from the main trail. When you get to the river crossing about 60meters upstream you can walk down the riverbank to the cache. To continue onward after the cache,you will need to go back to where you left the trail or you won't find it again.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Possum 1901-1982. 'The Possum’ was Australia’s first cacher (1928). He lived as a recluse on the riverbanks mostly between Wentworth and Renmark. He had a large number of caches (plants) where he stored essential supplies for life in the bush, usually one day’s walk from one other. You are looking for my interpretation of a possum cache. The log is loose diary pages (as the possum kept his notes). Feel free to add  but please don't take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;David James Jones came to Australia from New Zealand at the age of 27. He arrived as a shearer during the great depression, denied work (because be didn’t have a union ticket) he turned his back on society and took to life on the river bank until his death 54 years later. He walked everywhere, refused charity, lived off the land, swam the river regularly and was very rarely sighted. He loved the freedom of life in the bush. He had a special relationship with animals, he rode horses bareback, fed birds and let dogs off chains because he didn’t like to see them tied-up. He was nicknamed ‘The Possum’ because he was often up trees getting honey and hiding from anyone who might be around. He avoided human contact at all costs, very few people ever saw him. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Possum kept essentials hidden in hollow logs, trees, under bridges, in hollows, under overhangs and beneath old metal drums (sound familiar?). He kept diaries detailing the contents of each store (logs). His plants contained various items including Fish hooks, gill nets, soap, rabbit traps, salt, matches, billycans, needles and thread, glasses, jars of honey and shear blades.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PS30AMJ - Possum Statue&lt;br/&gt;S 34° 06.408 E 141° 55.367</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Australian Magpie - Quick facts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listed below are some interesting facts about this bird:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magpies are actually from the same family as the Butcher bird (&lt;em&gt;Cracticus torquatus)&lt;/em&gt; and not related to the Pied crows from which they got their name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are highly intelligent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magpies generally mate for life , although the alpha male generally has more than one female with which to mate and they live as a type of family commune.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are very territorial and will fight with other Magpies to keep their neck of the woods. However they will share their space with other species without a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike other birds they walk fairly upright and do not hop or waddle like most other birds.&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Elizabeth North Training Depot is Commonwealth land as it is owned by the Department of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area is approximately 33 hectares in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2007, the future of many Defence Force Bases was considered under the Force Disposition Program. This program was established to consider proposals for base collocation aimed at creating larger, more operationally effective and cost efficient military bases around Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government continued to review the studies which were conducted in relation to the remaining bases under consideration through the Force Disposition Program. These bases were Defence Establishment Berrimah in the Northern Territory, Borneo Barracks in South Queensland, and Elizabeth North Training Depot, Hampstead Barracks and Keswick Barracks, all in South Australia.  Given the size and complexity of this review of Defence basing, and the costs involved in future Defence estate planning, the Defence-prepared studies, along with other considerations, continued to be reviewed and were considered by the Government as part of the 2008/09 Budget deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Consequently, the Elizabeth North Training Depot is currently considered to be 'surplus property' and it is expected that around 2013 to 2014 this land will be sold off. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another housing development in the north, I assume!  &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Driving Main North Rd one day, I spied someone who was acting like a geocacher. I parked the car &amp; wandered off, in pouring rain, to give him a hand. However by the time I arrived, the log had been signed and the cache replaced. We stood across the road from this park and chatted and he said something about 'park' and 'cache'. I thought he said 'that park needs a cache'. So here it is: a spur of the moment random cache just because C4 suggested it!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is NOT one of my usual caches. It is not a pretty or unusual container.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is not big enough for swaps. It is not even big enough for a scribing implement. :(&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is however bigger than a nano (bison tube) and big enough to give you a smiley when you find it. :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a couple of seats to sit upon while signing the log and rolling it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are pretty roses and a mural on the wall to admire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a brick plinth in the middle of the park but I have no idea what may once have been displayed upon it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Beware lunchtime muggles enjoying the view and the sunshine and the passing traffic, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please do not dismantle the hedge or the wall. Considerate caching shows respect for all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You may need a tool for retrieval from its hidey hole!</groundspeak:long_description>

Please bring your own pen. Happy hopping around dirt roads ... and caching :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha, found in several parts of the world. There are eight different genera in the family classified as rabbits, including the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), cottontail rabbits (genus Sylvilagus; 13 species), and the Amami rabbit (Pentalagus furnessi, an endangered species on Amami Ōshima, Japan). There are many other species of rabbit, and these, along with pikas and hares, make up the order Lagomorpha. The male is called a buck and the female is a doe; a young rabbit is a kitten or kit. The rabbit's long ears, which can be more than 10 cm (4 in) long, are probably an adaptation for detecting predators. They have large, powerful hind legs. The two front paws have 5 toes, the extra called the dewclaw. The hind feet have 4 toes. They are plantigrade animals while at rest; however, they move around on their toes while running, assuming a more digitigrade form. Wild rabbits do not differ much in their body proportions or stance, with full, egg-shaped bodies. Their size can range anywhere from 20 cm (8 in) in length and 0.4 kg in weight to 50 cm (20 in) and more than 2 kg. The fur is most commonly long and soft, with colors such as shades of brown, gray, and buff. The tail is a little plume of brownish fur (white on top for cottontails). Because the rabbit's epiglottis is engaged over the soft palate except when swallowing, the rabbit is an obligate nasal breather. Rabbits have two sets of incisor teeth, one behind the other. This way they can be distinguished from rodents, with which they are often confused. Carl Linnaeus originally grouped rabbits and rodents under the class Glires; later, they were separated as the predominant opinion was that many of their similarities were a result of convergent evolution. However, recent DNA analysis and the discovery of a common ancestor has supported the view that they share a common lineage, and thus rabbits and rodents are now often referred to together as members of the superclass Glires. Rabbits are hindgut digesters. This means that most of their digestion takes place in their large intestine and cecum. In rabbits the cecum is about 10 times bigger than the stomach and it along with the large intestine makes up roughly 40% of the rabbit's digestive tract. The unique musculature of the cecum allows the intestinal tract of the rabbit to separate fibrous material from more digestible material; the fibrous material is passed as feces, while the more nutritious material is encased in a mucous lining as a cecotrope. Cecotropes, sometimes called &quot;night feces&quot;, are high in minerals, vitamins and proteins that are necessary to the rabbit's health. Rabbits eat these to meet their nutritional requirements; the mucous coating allows the nutrients to pass through the acidic stomach for digestion in the intestines. This process allows rabbits to extract the necessary nutrients from their food. Rabbits are prey animals and are therefore constantly aware of their surroundings. For instances, in Mediterranean Europe, rabbits are the main prey of red foxes, badgers, and Iberian lynxes. If confronted by a potential threat, a rabbit may freeze and observe then warn others in the warren with powerful thumps on the ground. Rabbits have a remarkably wide field of vision, and a good deal of it is devoted to overhead scanning. They survive predation by burrowing, hopping away in a zig- zag motion, and, if captured, delivering powerful kicks with their hind legs. Their strong teeth allow them to eat and to bite in order to escape a struggle. (Thanks to Wikipedia)</groundspeak:long_description>

These things are popping up all around the area so please also take care getting to and from this, and other, caches. Please also keep a close eye on children and animals as this is a high traffic location.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There used to be a quite regular SAPOLpresence just near here but it appears that technology has now made SAPOL redundant.&lt;br /&gt;
Since this is a location that many people I know pass on a daily basis, I thought a cache here may just remind us all to be mindful that flashing may occur at any given moment and may have unwanted consequences.&lt;br /&gt;
Extremely high muggle factor due to Womma Station (the real station and not the cache) being so very near so please use extreme caution, in the hope that this cache may last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When hiking the Parosa Trail in Cobbler Creek I came across this lovely rest spot that has been put up by the 'friends of Cobbler Creek'.  It is a great spot to stop, rest, sit, admire, drink, eat and reflect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;40 Years ago there was plenty of native bush in this area.  Today wedged between the suburbs of Golden Grove and Salisbury.  Cobbler Creek recreation Park contains some of the last stands at Mallee Box Grassy woodland in Adelaide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since settlement in the 1800's new houses and suburbs have gradually encroached on Adelaide's natural areas.  Cobbler Creek is not only a precious reminder of the plants and animals that used to be around Adelaide, but also an important example of a grassy woodland, one of the most poorly conserved habiats in South Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why are grassy woodlands important? Unlike the denser native forests of the Mount Lofty Ranges, grassy woodlands are usually opened spaced providing plenty of light for rich understory of shrubs, grasses and herbs.  The diversity of plants makes grassy woodlands perfect habitat for many animals such as the Eastern Bearded Dragon, Sleepy Lizard and Black-shouldered Kite, species that are more commonly seen in drier, open habitat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Park Code&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Help protect your national parks by following these guidelines:&lt;br/&gt;•Restrain your dog on a lead at all times and clean up after it&lt;br/&gt;•take your rubbish with you&lt;br/&gt;•observe fire restrictions 1 November to 30 April .&lt;br/&gt;•camping is not allowed in this park&lt;br/&gt;•respect geological and heritage sites&lt;br/&gt;•keep wildlife wild - do not feed or disturb animals or remove native plants&lt;br/&gt;•keep to defined vehicle tracks and walking trails&lt;br/&gt;•be considerate of other park users&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Sometimes driving down a 'no through road' can take you to places you never knew were there which is exactly what I did when finding this spot to place this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one thing that will take you by surprise with this cache is the views of the surrounding areas and the drive - its a short drive but honestly you wont forget this road in a hurry. It is a fully sealed road with fantastic views and bends. I did consider calling this cache 'Kurrajongs Rollercoaster' but did not want to take anything away from the amazing views on your travels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please take caution if you are driving up here at night, with no street lights this would be a very dark and windey road and there is not too many barriers near those edges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small sistema container and can take small swaps. I am hoping you will find this an interesting little drive-by cache. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Still very pretty though. 
So if no one else has logged this here, then I guess I got FTF on opencaching ;)

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Mount Crawford Forest is situated about an hours drive north of Adelaide amongst the Northern Adelaide Hills, just south of the Warren Reservoir. Both towns Gumeracha, well known as the home of the Big Rocking Horse and Williamstown bordering the Barossa Valley are close townships to the Mount Crawford Forest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Land was first purchased for forestry at Mount Crawford in 1909. The plantation mainly consists of native eucalyptus species (South Australian Blue gum, Narrow leaved Ironbark) and Pine species (Maritime pine and Radiata), these plantations started to progress from 1914. The current reserve area is 12,367 hectares and the annual timber harvested at Mount Crawford is about 70,000 tonnes. Along with the impressive size and the beautiful and peaceful environment that surrounds, there are many activities you can do at Mount Crawford Forest. Many people come to enjoy the serenity such as campers, bushwalkers, cyclists, horse riders, fossickers or even those wishing to do a simple activity such as walking their pets throughout one of the many tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exploring the Mount Crawford Forest is a great adventure, and you are bound to come across some of the native wildlife. Regular sightings can include the Gray Kangaroo, bird life and feral deer. Conservation and bio-diversity are under constant protection at Mount Crawford Forest, so if you are to bring along your pet make sure to keep them on a leash and keep to the walking trails on your weekend outing. There is plenty to explore keeping to the permitted areas and trails, and this also ensures visitors, plantations in forest and the native wildlife are all kept safe. As you drive, walk, ride or cycle through the tracks you must also be conscious that there are multiple use trails in the forest so it's a good idea to always take due care.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

His work influenced generations of artists and although many of his works were not finished and others had not survived, he was considered to be a universal genius.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a painter, Leonardo used innovative techniques in order to convince viewers of the reality of what they were seeing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He wanted to inspire ideals of beauty, especially in his portraits and his religious works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple slightly artistic cache in a well themed area.

&lt;br /&gt;
Football, cricket, netball, kiteflying, dog walking, pushbike, skateboard, roller skates and scooter riding too. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
HIGH muggle potential here, especially at certain times of day and increasing during certain playing seasons, so PLEASE take extreme care!
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Argana Park is home to the Elizabeth Eagles Football Club, the Elizabeth Netball Association, the Elizabeth Downs Soccer Club and the Penfield Central Districts Turf Cricket Club.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is a busy place at most times of the day due to people enjoying the open space while allowing their dogs to run free.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So please be careful when seeking this cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is accessible with a little walk from the car park over grass.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
A playground for the children and lots of shady trees for hot days.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All that was missing was a cache. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a small park, so it is also a small camoflagued cache! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So small, that only very tiny swaps will be possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please just be aware that people's backyards are very close to this cache and keep night time noise to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;

So, thanks to ma7:7hew's What Were They Thinking?, here is a nano to welcome you to Elizabeth :)&lt;br/&gt;Is it a boy or a girl is the ongoing discussion regarding the gender of the smallest figure on this artwork.&lt;br/&gt;Please use the car park (additional waypoint) and be careful with children as the cache is close to Main North Rd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6 years ago, Playford Council developed a Regional Centre signage strategy and decided to place entry to Playford - welcome to Elizabeth signs in the middle of Main North Road near Elizabeth City Centre. &lt;br/&gt;Initially, Playford Council had planned to use the letter ‘E’ however as the cursive ‘e’ was already being used by the Elizabeth City Centre shopping precinct, the council decided to obtain some artwork instead. They searched and found Will Hendriks and subsequently he created these two art pieces. &lt;br/&gt;These pieces are the first artwork purchased by Playford council in 50 years since ‘the tusks’,  which now reside at Munno Para train station. &lt;br/&gt;Installation of these artworks was delayed due to ‘red tape’ and eventually the art pieces were installed in 2011 but NOT in the middle of Main North Rd due to DTEI regulations. &lt;br/&gt;The red frame around these artworks represents the harmony experienced despite the diverse regional areas of Playford council and also the building blocks of the families and the people who create this community.&lt;br/&gt;The shapes of the human beings who represent the families and the people of Playford’s community are bright and stand united as you enter their world. &lt;br/&gt;Fremont Park has car parks (additional waypoint), toilets, playgrounds and BBQs. &lt;br/&gt;This park has held many birthday parties, get togethers and spur of the moment picnics and I hope that you enjoy the short walk past the duck pond to the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;CP3GVV2 - Car Park&lt;br/&gt;S 34° 43.121 E 138° 40.542</groundspeak:long_description>

cache with the many others along this trail.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Bushy Park Wetlands is a 30 hectare conservation park nestled at
the north eastern edge of Glen Waverley. The Park is bounded at the
north by a remnant orchard accessed from the eastern end of
Highbury Road. The southern boundary, near the pony club at
Drummies Bridge Reserve, is accessed from High Street Road. The
Park's eastern boundary is Dandenong Creek and its western boundary
is formed by residential properties in King Arthur Drive and
Knights Drive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A section of the Dandenong Creek Trail provides vantage points
overlooking the scenic wetlands.&lt;br /&gt;
Originally, the land was timbered with Yarra Gum (Eucalyptus
yarraensis) and about 65 other species of native trees, shrubs and
grasses. The Woiworung Aboriginal tribe roamed through the area in
search of food for thousands of years before European
settlement.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1839, Thomas Napier obtained a lease to run cattle, but just a
year later he transferred the lease to Alexander Scott, whose wife
Madeline named her home on the east of Dandenong Creek &quot;Bushy
Park&quot;. A succession of owners cleared the timber. Acacia bark was
used in the production of tannin to tan hides. The land was used to
run cattle, as a market garden, for cut flowers and as an orchard.
By 1981, the land was acquired by the former Melbourne Metropolitan
Board of Works for use as a park and wetland. Today Parks Victoria
designates most of the area as a conservation zone, although some
of the area is agisted for equestrian needs.&lt;br /&gt;
An amazing 90 bird species have been recorded in the area, ranging
from water birds to bushland and farmland birds. You are likely to
see pelicans and ducks on the northern and southern lakes.
Spoonbills and herons may be observed searching for food at the
water's edge. Use the bird hide and interpretive signage to help
see and identify as many birds as you can (also accessible for
wheelchairs). On the grasslands, insects, perhaps stirred up by the
cattle, attract Willy Wagtails, Magpies and Cattle Egrets. White
Cockatoos, Galahs and White Ibis are often seen perched on tree
branches. Overhead can be spotted the Black-shouldered Kite
featured on the brand image for Bushy Park and other birds of prey
like Brown Falcons and Australian Kestrels.</groundspeak:long_description>

With the need to close out our 30 August hole, I thought I'd try for this one as it was the closest to work that I hadn't done.  There were myriad potential hidey-holes in this grand old dame and sure enough, 15 minutes had elapsed before I was finally logging the find at 13:45 (and that was more by good fortune than good management [:O]) just as I was about to give up the ghost.  A tough 1½ star hide (and I thought Bendigo was 130 odd km away [;)]).

Anyway, with the FTF well and truly smashed, it meant that I could take my time heading home (and I sincerely thank solomonfamily for doing their in-field iPhone logs [:D]) so I headed to GZ where a short search soon had me with the cache in hand at 18:25 – our 36th STF [:)].

Gardens&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;*WARNING - CAUTION
REQUIRED*&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please use extreme caution if your GPSr has you heading into a
garden bed. As there have been quite a few needles found in this
area. The cache is not located in this garden bed&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The name &quot;Staley's: recalls Andrew Gray Staley (1890 - 1981), a
flamboyant super salesman, an innovator in the textile industry,
and in 1930 a founder of the famous Australian clothing
manufacturer &quot;Holeproof, (Australia)&quot;
&lt;p&gt;In 1942 Holeproof established a factory near this site, with a
frontage on what is now known as Maroondah Highway. Holeproof
donated parts of this reserve to the City of Ringwood in 1969.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache will have in an area that is undergoing a very
drastic and major change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area has a Skate park, Rotunda, Picnic tables and free
electric BBQ's&lt;/p&gt;
Please stop and enjoy a break here or head off to the local
shopping centres for some great coffee and eats.</groundspeak:long_description>

We've been so close to this park on so many occasions, being rather big fans of the sports shop across the road - But today turned right instead of left and visited here. Some muggle hoodlums in hoodies at the nearby skate park,  but that didn't affect us as we fumbled around (glad for the warning about the garden bed), before logic took hold and the cache was cleverly found.

Wonder what they'll do with that big slab of land next door?

Follow the gypsum trail to the Native Birds
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hopetoun is a small town of about 800 people in the southern
Mallee. Surrounded by rolling sand hills and grassy plains, it is
situated on the Henty Highway, 404 km north-west of Melbourne and
62 km north of Warracknabeal.
&lt;p&gt;The town stands on Yarriambiac Creek, near Lake Corrong.
'Yarriambiac' is said to mean 'creek tribes' while 'corrong' is a
bark canoe. Both words presumably derive from the language of the
Yarrikaluk people who inhabited the area prior to European
settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Things to see in the area:&lt;br /&gt;
Corrong Station Homestead&lt;br /&gt;
Hopetoun House&lt;br /&gt;
Lake Lascelles&lt;br /&gt;
Lake Coorong&lt;br /&gt;
and Wyperfeld National Park&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stealth is required as Muggles appear very quickly from all

eastern suburb
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The original Ringwood village emerged in the mid to late 19th
century, following the initial sale of land in the 1850s and the
local proliferation of grazing, fruit growing and brick making
activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction of the railway from Hawthorn to Lilydale
(through Ringwood) in 1882 resulted in a consolidation of township
facilities, including the provision of local churches, banks and
schools to accommodate for a growing village and regional
population. In 1889, Ringwood Station was erected as a symbol of
the increasing importance of the township along the railway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proclamation in 1924 of the Borough of Ringwood coincided
with the electrification of the railway line, providing a stimulus
for Major Township development and subdivision. Considerable
suburban expansion during the post-war period gave rise to the
declaration in 1960 of the City of Ringwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point Ringwood gained formal recognition as part of the
broader metropolitan region, emphasised by the erection of Eastland
in 1967 as a major 'new format' retail Centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is located near one of Victoria's oldest hotels that was
built in 1840.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a micro cache that will take some small swaps.&lt;/p&gt;

Having the perk of birthday leave, I arrived home after an outing (in which my one plan to treat myself today got cancelled on me :( ) to see this one pop up, so decided to try and see if a FTF would cheer me up.

Arrived there soon enough, and had a little problem with elevations, but soon had the cache in hand. And scored a lovely FTF.... Thanks Datruk - ever since this opened I've been wondering when a cache would appear here!

After finding the nearby Datruk hide I took a nice short stroll up here. Grass is long so was wary of the snake warning, although the weather said I shouldn't be. Until a rabbit rustled the grass ahead of me as it sped away and scared me half to death! Wandered over to GZ and spotted the cache straight away (it's been a good day for spotting!). Retrieved cautiously to avoid spider risk and then signed, took geocoin, and returned.

Thanks again Datruk. This park is clear of caches at last!!</groundspeak:text>

The wetlands are a Ramsar wetland because they support a large population of the migratory Sharp-tailed Sandpiper and also birds of state significance such as the Australasian Bittern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Edithvale Birdhide is located on Edithvale Road, Edithvale and is currently opened between 1-7 pm Saturday and Sunday and also between 6pm to 7.30pm on Wednesday this will continue until the wetlands dry out. The hide, which is two stories high, is manned by volunteers and contains all sorts of interesting displays and information including a range of nests and eggs. If the bird hide is closed you can also get a good look at the wetlands from a platform situated in the car park next to the hide.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Australia hosted the successful 16th World Scout Jamboree and the
31st World Scout Conference in 1988. Some 15,000 Scouts from 94
countries attended the Jamboree at Cataract Scout Park near
Sydney.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 
&lt;br /&gt;
The conference held in Melbourne dealt with the theme of Scouting
as an education for life. Adapting to the general changes in
Australian society,&lt;br /&gt;
Scouting admitted girls and young women to its Venturer Scout and
Rover Sections in 1973 and its Cub Scout and Scout Sections in
1988. The Joey Scout Section commenced on 1 July 1990 and is open
to boys and girls aged between six and seven-and-a-half years of
age.&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is near 1st Woodend Scout group which was founded in
1927</groundspeak:long_description>

The starting location is just west of an amazing playground for the youngins'. Shady trees and running water to cool your feet in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To find the cache you can take a leisurely bike ride over a reasonably flat terrain. This cache should take approx 90 minutes to complete.&lt;br /&gt;
You can also access all waypoints and the final location by car.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A recent bike ride discovered these amazing Trolls who reside in structures that we humans just walk all over. If we rattle their roof too hard you can hear them call out in a gruff voice, &quot;On ya bike!&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I also noticed that rabbits (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/cache/gchnx8&quot;&gt;GCHNX8&lt;/a&gt;) have been along this track before...and may have seen the Trolls. Oh, and if you have bounded along here before... read the Hint.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Start at BOOKWORM TROLL S37' 53.364 E145'17.380&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, you will have to drop in and pay the ROWVILLE GUARD TROLL a visit to collect the Cash!

scouts we have in Australia.&lt;br /&gt;
My kids are part of this great movement and I am a leader as well.
Some of these kids have shown an interest in geocaching so why not
help them participate.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Scouting came to Australia in 1908, the year the
first Boy Scout training handbook &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; was published
in England.&lt;br /&gt;
Baden-Powell visited Australia in 1912 and in later years (1927,
1931 and 1934) to encourage the extension of the movement in
Australia. Initially each Australian state branch was directly and
individually responsible to scout headquarters in London.&lt;br /&gt;
A federal council of state branch nominees was formed in 1922 to
achieve co-operation and coordinated at a national level. The
national body later appointed an Australian Commissioner. The
Federal Scout Council functioned as a branch of the British Boys
Scout Association. Australia became a member of the World Scout
Organisation of Scout Movements (WOSM) in 1953 in its own right,
and not as a branch of the British Scout Association.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1958, the adjuration of the Australian Boys Scout Association
took place. In 1967, the national organisation was incorporated by
Royal Charter. In 1971, the association changed its name to the
Scout Association of Australia, although the official name was not
changed until 2001, when the Royal Charter was amended through an
Act of Parliament. The organisation is unofficially known as Scouts
Australia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The lefthand handshake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
WHEN COLONEL BADEN-POWELL entered the capital city of the Ashanti
people in 1890 he was met by one of the Chiefs who came to him
holding out his left hand. B.-P. held out his right in return but
the Chief said: &quot;No, in my country the bravest of the brave shake
with the left hand.&quot; So began the &quot;left handshake&quot; of the
world-wide brotherhood of Scouts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This hall is now used by the Gilbert and Sullivan society of
Victoria as a home base.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Onto the cache, it is about twice the size of a film cannister and
very well camo'd</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Glenfern Valley Bushlands&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This area comprises 40 hectares or 100 acres, 35 km east of Melbourne. It is bounded on the south by Glenfern Road, on the west by New Road, the north boundary is Ferny Creek and the eastern boundary is 'Depot Track'. The land has a Grassy Forest and Herb Rich Foothill Forest on high ground to Riparian Forest at the creek line. It is in the Southern Fall Bioregion, and contains a large area of remnant vegetation.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;No tools required to get this cache. Please DO NOT disassemble anything at GZ&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Glenfern Valley Bushlands is continually evolving in both nature and facilities. It has important conservation values and opportunities to provide for a range of recreation activities in pleasant natural settings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 In 1873 John Buckley was granted 73 acres of land, which is part of the current 'Glenfern Valley Bushlands'. It was owned briefly from 1898 to 1901 by William Ward whose property totalled 117 acres, encompassing the current Bushlands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 In 1901, 97 acres was sold to Alfred McFarlane who still owned this land in 1958. The land was cleared and used as a dairy farm. There was a farmhouse on the corner of New Road and Glenfern Road, the only remaining evidence of this are some fruit trees (Prunus spp), roses (Rosaceae) and Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), which are naturalised over the property.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Investigation is continuing to find out who owned the land after the McFarlane Family passed away. The only information available is that the last remaining family member left his money to the Angliss Hospital, but it is difficult to find out who became the owner of the land at that time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 From around 1977 to 1987, the land was owned by Albion (Boral) Quarries. Rock was quarried on site for only a short time due to complaints from neighboring properties, about noise and house damage from blasting. The land was then handed to the Victorian Government in a land swap, to eliminate quarrying from the Dandenongs. The result was to bring about a land swap with another site in Lysterfield (Wellington Road).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the time that this land was untended, it was used by 4 wheel drives and trail bikes for recreation and consequently the area was badly eroded with deep culverts from these vehicles. Local people had also used the area as a convenient rubbish dump for several years, and many tons of rubbish and car bodies have been removed from the site over the past 5 years. The area was in extremely poor condition in 2000 when a group of interested people got together to have this land preserved and rehabilitated. Many hundreds of hours of both volunteer and council contractor time has gone into the works to date, which have seen spraying of Chrysanthemoides monolifera (Boneseed) and Rubus fruitcosus (Blackberry) that are prolific on the site.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
The Association is a Founder Member of the Asia-Pacific Region. In
the field of support and co-operation with other member countries
of the Asia Pacific Region, the organisation has contributed to a
number of international friendship and community development
oriented projects. Over the years, Australian Scouts have supported
emerging Scout Associations in the South Pacific. A twinning
project with the Bangladesh Scouts, known as the
&quot;Bangladesh-Australia Child Health&quot; (BACH) project made a dramatic
impact on child health in project villages during its operation
from 1986 to 1992. The Scout Association has a twinning project
with the Nepal Scouts known as NATURE Project and involves the
reforestation of the Kristi Landslide.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Australia hosted the successful 16th World Scout Jamboree and the
31st World Scout Conference in 1988. Some 15,000 Scouts from 94
countries attended the Jamboree at Cataract Scout Park near Sydney.
An Australian Scout Jamboree has been held every three years since
1934 except for the years of the Second World War. The scout
jamboree is the largest national scout event but there is also an
Australian Rover Moot and an Australian Venture are also held every
three years.&lt;br /&gt;
In response to World and Regional Scout Conferences held prior to
2000, Scouts Australia established a National Youth Council to
engage youth members in national operations and to provide
opportunities for these representatives:&lt;br /&gt;
• to advise on the relevance of Youth Program to young
people;&lt;br /&gt;
• to advise Scouts Australia and external agencies of internal
and external issues it should address;&lt;br /&gt;
• to provide further youth input into all strategies including
membership and marketing;&lt;br /&gt;
• to be a sounding board for new initiatives;&lt;br /&gt;
• to make recommendations to national committees; and&lt;br /&gt;
• to continue to develop members' own skills, experience and
knowledge in line with the movement's aims.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;World Chief Scout&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Lord Baden-Powell was proclaimed World Chief Scout at the first
Jamboree at Olympia in the UK in 1920; he was raised to the peerage
(given the title of Lord) in 1929 and was awarded the order of
Merit in the Coronation Orders in 1937. He travelled widely,
encouraging Scouting in every country he visited. He came to
Australia three times, in 1912, 1931 and to the first Australian
Jamboree in 1934-35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile Scouting had become established as a most
successful scheme for the training of boys, and it spread rapidly
worldwide because it was what boys wanted to do. Soon a
headquarters was set up and leadership provided by recognised
leaders in the community. Honours were showered upon the Founder by
many countries but his last acclaim was the World Jamboree in
Holland in 1937. He retired to Kenya, where he spent several happy
years with his family. He died there on 8 January 1941.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was described as 'The Piper of Pax' because of his tremendous
contribution to boyhood and world peace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The world's largest youth
organisation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
From its English origins Scouting struck an enthusiastic chord
among boys in so many countries that it is now coordinated globally
by the World Organisation of the Scout Movement (WOSM). From its
headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, the WOSM provides unity
amongst the 155 national Scouting organisations (representing a
Scout membership of over 28 million).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Got to love these finds - Stopped the bike and turned on the GPSr in what seemed like a likely area. On turning on it read '11 metres'. Yay. Then wandered over and parked the bike nearby to see it say '2 metres'. Reached down, moved something, there it was [:)]. All just came together!

&lt;b&gt;Scouting in Australia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The visits made to Australia by Baden-Powell in 1912 and in later
years (1931-34) encouraged the extension of the Movement in
Australia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although each State Branch in Australia was directly and
individually responsible to Imperial Headquarters in London, there
grew a desire to achieve co-operation at a higher level so a
Federal Council of nominees from each State Council was formed in
1922. This body later appointed an Australian Commissioner. For
more than 30 years, Scouting was co-ordinated by the Australian
Federal Scout Council which functioned as a Branch of the British
Boys Scout Association.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1958 the adjuration of the Australian Boys Scout
Association took place and in 1967 the National Organisation was
incorporated by Royal Charter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The name of the Association was changed to the Scout Association of
Australia in 1971.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Australia was made a member of the World Organisation of the Scout
Movement (WOSM) in 1953 and is a Founder Member of the Asia-Pacific
Region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the field of support and co-operation with other member
countries of the Asia Pacific Region, the organisation has
contributed to a number of international friendship and community
development projects. Over the years, Australian Scouts have
supported emerging Scout Associations in the South Pacific and
around the world. A twinning project with the Bangladesh Scouts,
known as the &quot;Bangladesh-Australia Child Health&quot; (BACH) project,
made a dramatic impact on child health in project villages during
its operation from 1986–1992.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Baden-Powell was encouraged to set down his views on how he would
apply Scouting to the training of boys. He first conducted an
experimental camp in 1907 on Brownsea Island off the Dorset coast
of the UK. With some 20 boys from all walks of life and suitable
adult leaders, Baden-Powell taught the boys what he meant by
Scouting. They lived in tents, cooked their own food and learnt
many valuable skills through games.
&lt;p&gt;1 August 1907 is regarded as the beginning of the Scout Movement
worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camp was a great success and proved Baden-Powell's ideas, so
he tackled the task of writing down his experience in a book.
Scouting for Boys was first published in fortnightly parts,
beginning 15 January 1908. Every issue sold out as soon as it hit
the news stands, despite the cover price of 4d which was expensive
at the time. In fact, Scouting for Boys ranks fourth in the
best-selling books of the 20th Century after the Bible, the Koran
and Mao's Little Red Book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every other Wednesday until the end of March, boys (and girls)
all over England eagerly awaited the next issue of Scouting for
Boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the fourth cache in this series to show just how many
scouts we have in Australia&lt;br /&gt;
My kids are part of this great movement and I am a leader as well.
Some of these kids have shown an interest in geocaching so why not
help them participate.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;The Movement is born.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It was suggested that boys form themselves into
Patrols within other organisations but boys didn't want to be
school-Scouts, cadet-Scouts or brigade-Scouts, they simply wanted
to be Scouts. Long before the last instalment of Scouting for Boys
had hit the book stands, Scout Patrols and Troops had magically
appeared all over Britain. Baden-Powell finally bowed to the
inevitable and accepted that Scouting would have to become a
Movement in its own right. Two years later Baden-Powell retired
from the army as a General to devote his life to this new Movement
called Scouting. A rally at the Crystal Palace, London, drew
together 10,000 boys. Scouting expands and grows&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The Girl Guides were formed in 1910 by
Baden-Powell's sister, Agnes. In quick succession came the Sea
Scout Branch in the same year, Wolf Cubs in 1916, Rover Scouts in
1918 and the Special Test (now &quot;Extension&quot;) Department in 1926. The
Group system of Cub Scouts, Scouts and Rovers under the leadership
of the Group Scoutmaster was established in 1927, Deep Sea Scouts
in 1928, Air Scouts in 1941 and Senior Scouts in 1946 (now known as
Venturer Scouts).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Meanwhile Scouting spread to Australia, New Zealand and India in
1908 and other countries followed shortly after. In 1909 Chile was
the first country outside the British Empire to take up Scouting,
followed closely by France, the Scandinavian countries and the
United States in 1910. By 1937 over two and a half million Scouts
from nearly fifty countries were affiliated with the International
Bureau which was set up to safeguard Scouting and to prevent
control drifting into the hands of the purely religious, political
or military bodies.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great little community not far from Wodonga in
Victoria&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My kids are part of this great movement and I am a leader as
well. Some of these kids have shown an interest in geocaching so
why not help them participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache is larger than a film canister&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The founder of Scouting, Lord Robert Baden-Powell (B-P) was born
in 1857 in England. He lived a busy and adventurous life, and as a
boy spent much of his spare time in open-air pursuits, hunting in
the woods, and joining his brothers in expeditions by land and in
their boats. Thus he developed his powers of observation and
resourcefulness and acquired many useful skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He won a scholarship which gave him entry into the British Army,
where he was sent to India and served for many years. He tried out
his ideas of training soldiers in &quot;Scouting&quot;, teaching them how to
develop experience in stalking and fending for themselves and to be
observant of all signs that would give them an advantage as
soldiers. He set down his ideas in the book Aids to Scouting, which
was used as a textbook for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a soldier, Baden-Powell rose to public prominence during the
war against the Boers in Africa at the end of the 1800s. Most
noteworthy was hisleadership of the defending force in the siege of
the South African town of Mafeking. Baden-Powell returned to
England as a national hero in 1899 having successfully defended the
town against the Boers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baden-Powell was encouraged to set down his views on how he
would apply Scouting to the training of boys. He first conducted an
experimental camp in 1907 on Brownsea Island off the Dorset coast
of the UK. With some 20 boys from all walks of life and suitable
adult leaders, Baden-Powell taught the boys what he meant by
Scouting. They lived in tents, cooked their own food and learnt
many valuable skills through games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 August 1907 is regarded as the beginning of the Scout Movement
worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

No need to enter the garden what so ever with this cache, stay on the path, check the clue and it will be obvious to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Playford Council has developed this public seed orchard to allow the convenient, safe and rapid collection of high volumes of local-native seeds with minimal impact on remnant populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This seed orchard allows the use of high volume collection techniques such as planting and weed matting to allow falled seeds and fruits to be collected by sweeping and the use of trellising that greatly facilitates the access to seeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These local plants in turn provide habitate and food sources that attract local native birds, insects and animals.  Unlike most of its namesakes this orchard has been specifically designed to encourage and accomodate these visitors! Heavy mulches, logs  and locally sourced quarry rubble provide additional shelter and opportunities for fauna to make a temporary or even permanent home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A lovely spot and I have never been into this place before, despite having lived nearby for about 18years.  
A quick locus cache and a FTF for me. Woohoo!!  :)  :)  
Thanks for the PT too. 
I am now heading over to do the multi which you placed nearby!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Covering more than 292,000 hectares, Nitmiluk National Park is&lt;br/&gt;located north-east of Katherine. Its northern edge borders Kakadu&lt;br/&gt;National Park and shares the magnificent Arnhem Land escarpment.&lt;br/&gt;Nitmiluk is home to the spectacular Katherine Gorge, a series of 13&lt;br/&gt;sandstone gorges carved over thousands of years by the Katherine&lt;br/&gt;River. The impressive gorge walls and white sandy beaches can be&lt;br/&gt;explored on foot, by canoe or on a cruise and are stunning from the&lt;br/&gt;air on a scenic helicopter flight. The Nitmiluk Visitors Centre,&lt;br/&gt;located at the start of the first gorge, is adjacent to a serene&lt;br/&gt;picnic area. Previously known as Katherine Gorge National Park, the&lt;br/&gt;Park was handed back to the local Aboriginal people and renamed&lt;br/&gt;Nitmiluk, meaning 'Cicada Place'. The Park is jointly managed by&lt;br/&gt;the Northern Territory Government and the Jawoyn people in&lt;br/&gt;accordance with traditional Jawoyn law. Aboriginal culture is&lt;br/&gt;strong in the area and there are many Aboriginal rock art sites&lt;br/&gt;dotted throughout the Park. There are many adventure activities on&lt;br/&gt;offer in Nitmiluk National Park. It is a haven for nature lovers,&lt;br/&gt;with its rugged landscapes, dramatic waterfalls and lush gorges&lt;br/&gt;providing an abundance of flora and fauna. During the Dry, roughly&lt;br/&gt;from April to October, the Katherine Gorge waters are placid in&lt;br/&gt;most spots and ideal for swimming and canoeing. There may be&lt;br/&gt;freshwater crocodiles in parts of the river but, unlike their&lt;br/&gt;saltwater cousins, they rarely attack unless cornered and provoked.&lt;br/&gt;Park your car at the car park at S 14.18.843 E 132.25.382 &amp;&lt;br/&gt;proceed up the walking track for about 20 minutes to the lookout.&lt;br/&gt;You will encounter quite a lot of steps to get to the top of the&lt;br/&gt;gorge so a reasonable degree of fitness is required &amp; it is&lt;br/&gt;recommended that you take something to drink &amp; sun protection&lt;br/&gt;as well. You have the option of doing the round circuit back to the&lt;br/&gt;information center but turning off to the car park before reaching&lt;br/&gt;the info center. This will take well over an hour or you can&lt;br/&gt;retrace your steps from GZ back to the car park if you can’t&lt;br/&gt;spare as much time. The cache container is an ammo tin that should&lt;br/&gt;be quite easy to find. Please be mindful of muggles when retrieving&lt;br/&gt;the cache &amp; make sure that the cache is not left visible when&lt;br/&gt;you return it to its hide. Enjoy this beautiful place &amp;&lt;br/&gt;don’t forget that there are a few other caches nearby to&lt;br/&gt;discover if you haven’t already. &lt;a href=&quot;http://s07.flagcounter.com/more/I19&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">HISTORY&lt;br/&gt;Perth Modern School was established as the first government senior secondary school in Western Australia in 1911, after lengthy representations to the State Government. Selection from 1912 was by scholarship. Both male and female students studied science and modern languages as part of their courses.&lt;br/&gt;The sphinx, representing wisdom and knowledge, was adopted as the school symbol; together with the motto &quot;Savoir c'est Pouvoir&quot; (&quot;Knowledge is Power&quot;).&lt;br/&gt;In 1958 Perth Modern School ceased operating as an academic scholarship school and became a comprehensive high school. Academic standards, the traditions of the past and the establishment of the special Music Scholarship in 1968 continued to have significant influence on the school.&lt;br/&gt;The decision by the State Government to return Perth Modern School to a fully selective government school has attracted record enrolment inquiries. Parents of students enrolled at Perth Modern School, and the wider community, have recognised that by gathering students of high ability in the one school encourages students to “be themselves” with like-minded peers allows opportunity for the development of higher-order thinking skills and meets the social, emotional and educational needs of gifted students.The gifted program is based on Professor Francous Gagne's Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;Located near West Leederville station. At the start and end of school time, students from Perth Modern frequent this station. The cache is a micro in a camo outer, so BYOP and micro tools. Muggles may be abundant at times.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This replaces our old multi that did not get many visits. Hopefully people will make the short detour for a quick find and enjoy the location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the location: Swan Bay is a shallow, 30-square-kilometre (12 sq mi) marine embayment at the eastern end of the Bellarine Peninsula in Port Phillip, Victoria, Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The township of Queenscliff lies at its southern end, and St Leonards at its northern. It is partly separated from Port Phillip by Swan Island, Duck Island and Edwards Point. Most of the area is included in the Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park as well as being listed as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention as part of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar Site. Matthew Flinders named the bay &quot;Swan Ponds&quot; after its Black Swans, up to 2,700 of which can be seen in summer and early autumn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swan Bay contains a variety of ecosystems that make it environmentally important for waterbirds and migratory waders. These include salt marsh, intertidal mudflats and vast seagrass beds on which, almost everything living in the bay relies on for food. Although much of the surrounding land is farmland, some remnant woodland survives in the adjoining Edwards Point Nature Reserve and Swan Bay Itself. The bay has been recognised as having international importance and the Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park almost entirely occupies the bay. Nearly 200 species of birds have been recorded in Swan bay. Birds of conservation significance for which the bay and its shore are internationally important include the Critically Endangered Orange-bellied Parrot as well as Little Tern, Fairy Tern, Eastern Curlew, Lewin's Rail and White-bellied Sea-eagle. It also supports over 1% of the Australian population of four wader species: Grey Plover, Pacific Golden Plover, Double-banded Plover and Eastern Curlew.[2] Other birds found in the region include the Australian Pelican, Silver Gull, Royal Spoonbill, Caspian and Crested Terns, White-fronted Chat, Sacred Ibis, Red-necked Stint, Little Pied Cormorant and Pied Oystercatcher. Some of these birds travel from as far away as arctic Siberia and Alaska where they breed, to feed on the intertidal mudflats of Swan Bay.(info from Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above picture is of a very high tide blocking access to the pier, that eliminated that hiding spot!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the Portarlington Flour Mill. The Mill is on the
National Trust of Australia (Victoria) Register with a State
Classification.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; First settlers in the Port Phillip District needed grain for the
staples of life, and found the Bellarine Peninsula suitable for
grain growing. The first flour mill was built at Drysdale, but the
difficulty of land transport made Portarlington's water access
attractive, and its handsome stone, steam flour mill, was built in
1857. It was a substantial sandstone building and equipment was
steam powered.
&lt;p&gt;The notice of the formation of the Portarlington Steam Flour
Mill Company (Capital £7,500, Chairman John Henderson) appeared in
the Geelong Advertiser 1st August 1856, the public being invited to
purchase shares. Andrew McWilliams, a Geelong municipal engineer,
designed the building, which was built by T.H Widdicombe, a local
identity, from stone quarried on site, and beams from a large stand
of blue gum at Swan Bay, now extinct. Within a year the completed
mill was open for business, and a short jetty built to facilitate
loading of the small traders which carried the flour to Melbourne
and to Tasmania. Later the jetty was extended into deep water and
the bay steamers were able to call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life of the building as a mill was only seventeen years, as
in the 1870's the wider Wimmera lands were opened for cultivation,
and in 1874 the mill was closed and the machinery used for milling
was sent to the Wimmera. Tom Widdicombe the builder was the next
occupant, using the mill as part of his brickworks. Later it had
other industrial uses - the processing of seaweed for upholstery
and insulation, ink production, and then artificial fertiliser. In
the twentieth century the growth of Portarlington as a seaside
resort brought conversion of the mill to residential use. In 1962
the owner Mrs. Dye, was served with a Housing Commission notice to
demolish the 105 year old building, condemned as unfit for
habitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In due course this came to the notice of the National Trust,
which conferred with the Shire of Bellarine with the aim of saving
the building. In 1970 the Shire purchased the building and gave it
to the National Trust, which spent over $40,000 restoring it,
opening it to the public in 1977. Since then it has been managed by
a committee of local volunteers, and fitted as a local folk museum.
Local residents have collected a number of artefacts and these are
displayed on the three floors of the mill. Archaeological digs
around the mill have given evidence of the old boiler house at the
rear, and also earlier aboriginal activity in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can tour the mill if it is open for a small fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache you are looking for is a magnetic nano and is outside
the locked gates so is available all the time. It is painted to
match its surrounds. Please be careful of muggles in the nearby
houses. The clue will help you out if it is busy, please only use
if really stuck. This will be a premium member cache for the first
few weeks. This is to thank those that help support the system by
having a membership.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Loved the camo coordination with this one Unfortunately, the mill wasn't open today, but we were so impressed that we'll definitely be back to check it out another day. Thanks for the tip, VKC1SR. Found @ 16:20hrs. Obviously a busy hide, as we were one of a few finders today according to the log, which we also signed. Luckily, all the muggles were over at the reserve watching the very full footy game, but we were still stealthy. Ninja Wasabi strikes again! *hehehe* Thanks again for another goodie, VKC1SR.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Inverleigh Churches. This cache will give you history on
3 churches in Inverleigh.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;You are standing outside the Presbyterian Church. A wooden
building was erected for church services and schooling in 1855. On
31/1/1862 the current bluestone building was opened for worship by
the Rev. A. Campbell of Geelong. Following Scottish custom of
planting a fir tree near the front door of a new church, Mr J.
Venters of Murgheboluc had a fir tree sent from Scotland and it was
planted on the west side of the church in line with the front of
the building. On the 125th anniversary of the opening of the
church, Stewart Venters, great-great-grandson of J. Venters,
planted a cedar tree on the east side of the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look 30 metres to the east you will see St Paul’s
Anglican Church. The first Anglican Church was built near the
cemetery in 1854. In 1858 a combination church and school was built
of bluestone on the same site. In 1869 that building was demolished
and much of the stone was transported to the present site. Mr A.B.
Clark of Melbourne was the architect, Mr Stevens was the builder
and contractor for the stonework, while Messrs. Arthur &amp; Tom
Alderson and Jim Dale were the carpenters with Mr Fred Hawes as
apprentice. The foundation stone was laid by Mrs Moriarty who
contributed 1,200 pound to the project. A solemn dedication service
was performed by Bishop Field Flowers Gow on 2/2/1890.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third church is about 200 metres to the west (same side of
the street). It is the Sacred Heart Catholic Church. The first of
three Catholic churches was built near the original Anglican church
in the vicinity of the cemetery. It was burnt down in the late
1860s or early 1870s with children from the nearby Anglican Sunday
School being blamed. The present church was opened by Dr. Mannix on
the 19/11/1933. The cost of the building and furnishings was 1,050
pound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information from Inverleigh Progress Association and Inverleigh
Historical Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the cache, you are looking for a 35mm film canister with
a log only so bring a pen. You may have GPS trouble due to trees so
the hint is fairly descriptive to assist if required. Please
remember you are in a country town and there may be plenty of
muggle eyes watching you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache will be for premium members only for the first couple
of weeks, as will all new VKC1SR caches.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It was overcast, but not too cold, and we had a great time soaking up the small town feel. Had never visited here before. Found @ 15:45 hrs. Signed log and returned to hiding place. Testament to the fact that we often don't see things in (almost) plain sight in our day to day lives, and/or venture off the beaten track at all often.

      &lt;strong&gt;A
      nice simple cache you can pretty much drive up
      to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 The Windmill Reserve is named after the
Windmill family who were quarrymen and tanners who built their
house near a 19 acre quarry at this
location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Their house is actually located at 245 Noble
St, Newtown and is Heritage Listed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The quarry, originally known as James
Austin's quarry, was brought and worked by the Windmill Bros. who
established a stone crushing plant there, supplying metal and
screenings for many years.&lt;br /&gt;
 The Windmill Reserve created in recent times re-used the old
site which was used as the Newtown tip in the intervening
years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Have a seat and enjoy the views over
the river and down the
valley.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You are looking for a small
camouflaged cache with enough room for the log. BYO
Pen!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You can park your car right at the
cache and use the car as cover if you
want.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Be careful with children as there is a
cliff face in front of you and nil
fencing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 If you are lucky you may get to watch a game
of cricket or footy at the oval behind
you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy the views.&lt;/strong&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Lovely to see some of the spring flowers coming out in the garden. Loved the bridge(!!), cool and springy... although His Furriness loved it slightly less coming back again! Nice and camouflaged cache. Took nothing, left nothing, signed log. Returned to spot as found, before heading to the Inverleigh Hotel for a well-earned beverage to quench our thirst. Great afternoon on the chase. Ninja Wasabi strikes again! :)

Take a seat!! and watch the world go by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this location you will see a large River Red Gum tree.&lt;br/&gt;These are very common along rivers and can grow upto 45 metres tall.  They have large twisting branches and an open spreading crown.  Their trunks are wide as can be seen by this tree.  The wood from these trees is red and resistant to decay and termites.  It also burns well on a hot fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a micro cache with a log only, please no stamps!!&lt;br/&gt;You do not have to touch Big Red or destroy the ground around it to locate this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

Took our time, and enjoyed taking our furry cacher for a nice river walk en route to finding Big Red. Found at 15:15 hrs. Have to say, thought the hiding place was very smart! :) And, were very pleased to be able to be the first cachers to sign the log on this one. Know it wasn't the first log, but this one was new, and we were on first! Sometimes it's the small things.... :)
Thanks vkc1sr, another great cache. Cheers.</groundspeak:text>

Waypoint 2 took a while with Geko pointing me to the wrong side but eventually I had the final co-ordinates keyed in after finding the sneaky hide.  By now, I was committed (or needed to be [;)]) so I headed off to find the cache.

That also took a while but after much persistence, I had the stash in hand at 15:30.

The cache looks like it has been found by muggles although it is still quite intact and the messages in the logbook just note that they found it.  Maybe however, I just didn't recognise their names.

TNLNSL.  Thanks for this great series VKC1SR.  ssmc4 (and us) are going to have some fun doing the whole thing in a day, especially with this one in the mix.</groundspeak:text>

Of course, road was quiet until we found cache and were trying to be surreptitious(!) *lol* Took nothing, but left green tricerotops, and signed log. Cache in good knick. Afternoon was still sunny at this point, paused for a 'family' photo, then we hit the road again. Cheers, vkc1sr!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A Grand Tour of Winchelsea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winchelsea is a pleasant small town of 1000 people which is located on the Barwon River 112 km south-west of Melbourne on the Princes Highway between Geelong and Colac. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wathaurong tribe originally occupied the land from Ballarat to the Otways and 80km west of Lake Corangamite. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several historic homesteads in the area and a number of old bluestone buildings in town although they tend to be scattered about and hence do not form as strong a focal point as they might. The shire relies principally on pastoral and agricultural activities for its income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite its inland location, Winchelsea is named after one of the Cinque Ports on the south-east coast of England. The first Europeans to reside in the area were squatters who established grazing runs here c.1837. The town developed around the Barwon Hotel and a general store, both of which were established in 1842 on the coaching route between Geelong and Warrnambool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first church was built, with the help of the local grazier, Thomas Austin, in 1846.&lt;br/&gt;In the manner of the wealthy country squire, Austin loved shooting and, in 1859, he imported quails, pheasants, foxes and rabbits for that purpose. &lt;br/&gt;In this way he became responsible, in the eyes of many, for Australia's substantial rabbit problems.&lt;br/&gt;So profuse did they soon become that the Duke of Edinburgh's 1867 hunting party shot either 400 or 1000 rabbits in an afternoon, depending on which source you want to believe. Shooters were subsequently hired for the express purpose of eradicating the vermin and a rabbit-meat factory even operated for a time at Colac.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Austin was a noted and wealthy sheep-breeder, being the first to import Lincoln sheep. His wife, a great benefactor, founded the Austin Hospital in Melbourne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Albert Jacka, the first Australian to win a Victoria Cross in World War I, and future mayor of St Kilda, was born at Winchelsea is 1893. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a four stage multi-cache – it requires you to arrive at the initial waypoint and then make your way around the beautiful town Winchelsea, learning about it’s history in order to arrive at ground zero. Ground Zero comes with a Muggle warning, especially in the warmer weather.  You can bring a picnic to enjoy at the final destination or just a short walk away you will find the tearooms, hotels and a bakery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOW ONTO THE CACHE!!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WP1:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At WP1 (S 38 14.074, E 144 00.792) you will find a sign to know you are in the right place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Welcome to ??&quot; Number of letters in town name = AB&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Sister town is in East ??&quot; Number of letters in suburb = C&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now apply your calculation to determine WP2&lt;br/&gt;where S 38 AB+3.CA3&lt;br/&gt;E 144 BB.(C-4)(C+3)A&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WP2:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At WP2 you will find a sign indicating that you are at a structure built in 1869 for Thomas and Elizabeth Austin. This was gifted by Sydney Batson in 1973 to the National Trust who currently maintain the property and open it to the public every Sunday and Wednesday from 11:00am to 4:00pm (just in case you would like to look inside, but there is a charge to enter the building).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need to find two phone numbers listed on the board – the phone number on left should be attributed to ABCDEFGH and the phone number on the right is attributed to IJKLMNOP when reading the numbers from left to right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find the WP3, complete the following calculations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AB = L x 2&lt;br/&gt;C = O&lt;br/&gt;DE = (C x 10) + (D + L) - O&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FG = (A x 10) + B + D&lt;br/&gt;H = (L + O) - J&lt;br/&gt;IJ = (M x 10) + (D + H)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now apply your calculations to determine WP3&lt;br/&gt;where S 38 AB.CDE, E 143 FG.HIJ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WP3:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The co-ordinates will take you to a famous construction in Winchelsea that was built as a memorial to local soldiers who died in WW1. This building was constructed using the “Knitlock” pre-caste concrete block system patented by famous architect, Walter Burley Griffin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take note of the year of construction and the cost before you proceed through the gates to see the construction from the front. &lt;br/&gt;Once in front of the construction count the number of steps on the RIGHT HAND SIDE that lead to the viewing deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You’re nearly there.&lt;br/&gt;To get to WP4 you will need to calculate the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Year of construction = JKLM&lt;br/&gt;Cost of construction = NOP&lt;br/&gt;Number of steps on the right hand side (Including the top step but not the concrete step) = QR &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AB = (N + O)	&lt;br/&gt;C = (M + Q)					&lt;br/&gt;DE = (M + N)	&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FG = (P x 10) + K&lt;br/&gt;H = M&lt;br/&gt;IJ =  (O x 10) + (K-R)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now apply your calculations to determine WP4&lt;br/&gt;where S 38 AB.CDE, E 143 FG.HIJ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WP4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The above co-ordinates will take you to the best place to park your car in order to collect the final information to get you to ground zero and a 1.2L sistema container painted black that is full of goodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A short distance from where you park you will find the child’s equivalent to heaven. Here you will need to find the answers to these questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now apply them as follows to get the co-ordinates for Ground Zero:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AB = How many half holes on the end wall.&lt;br/&gt;C = Number of red fireman's poles&lt;br/&gt;D = Number of yellow telescopes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For your final task, apply your calculations to determine GZ&lt;br/&gt;where: &lt;br/&gt;S38. AB - 8.(A + D)(C - 1)(B x 3)&lt;br/&gt;E143.(AB x 2)+ 15.(D + 2)(D - 1)(B - C)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please make sure to hide the cache well as it is in an area visited by muggles regularly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a FTF prize.. but just remember who gave you the scratchie if you win!!!&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN1BMWM - GC1BMWM FINAL&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Final Location of Cache&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S11BMWM - GC1BMWM WP1&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;1st Waypoint&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S21BMWM - GC1BMWM WP2&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;2nd Waypoint&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S31BMWM - GC1BMWM WP3&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;3rd Waypoint</groundspeak:long_description>

Apparently there is a dolphin lurking near WP1 at the moment but I caught no sign of it while collecting the clues.  Darn.

TNLNSL.  Thanks again VKC1SR.</groundspeak:text>

MAKE SURE YOU TAKE A COPY OF THE PICTURE FROM GALLERY, WILL HELP
WITH NAVIGATION!!! Welcome to the Inverleigh Flora &amp; Fauna
Reserve. Please take your time and enjoy the natural beauty of this
bush land. There is plenty of wildlife about if you stop, look and
listen.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a multi cache with no clues, hence the difficulty rating.
There are plenty of hiding spots and tree cover. You do not have to
venture off road in your car, the roads are all driveable in a 2wd
vehicle just take your time. You will have to walk no more than
about 10 metres off any track.&lt;br /&gt;
It may help you to remember track names as some of the clues may
help you navigate!!!&lt;br /&gt;
Onto the cache (This is the only lot of maths required,
promise)&lt;br /&gt;
In front of you and to your left there should be a sign:
&lt;p&gt;How many words on the sign = AB&lt;br /&gt;
How many letters in the first word = C&lt;br /&gt;
How many letters in the last word = D&lt;br /&gt;
How many letters in the second word = F&lt;br /&gt;
How many letters in the first word of the third line = G&lt;br /&gt;
Head to:&lt;br /&gt;
S 38° 05.ACF E 144° 02.F (A+D) G&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you will find a small container with your next set of
instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your final goal is to locate the ammo tin containing the usual
goodies.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, while we located the first cache without problem, there were no contents, and so we couldn't go any further. Great concealment (we even took a photo for posterity), so we were disappointed our hunt was cut so short. Also, there were some dodgy people in the area, so didn't stick around to leave a note saying we'd passed by. Loved solving the code, and enjoyed our walk at any rate - we parked in Inverleigh, and walked up with our furry cacher. Just feel we have unfinished business with this one! </groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Welcome to Bambra Wetlands and another cache brought to you by Mrs
1SR. 
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I can not find any info on the wetlands. It is a
bit dry at the moment but that has not stopped the bird life. There
is a small gravell path (few weeds on it) winding its way around
native flora. The majority of trees and bushes have small name
plates so you know what they are. Take your time and walk around
(doesnt take long about 200m circuit) and watch the birds. We
spotted an owl in one tree while placing the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

 
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a 1lt sistema container with the usual
goodies. Enjoy!!!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was meant to be the meeting point for those who were doing the second half of the ride today. Maybe they were blown away, washed away or a combination of both but there were only 3 &quot;locals&quot; to meet us and the only place they were going was to a nice warm fire. That was incentive enough for LZZ(m) and me to bail as well but not before nabbing this one.

With the hail coming down and the temperature plummeting, we had to make it a quick one. Thankfully it was and we were soon logging the find at 11:40. We figured that the best place to write our logs was under shelter but, amazingly, that was about 3 metres east of the end of the actual roofline [:O] !!!!

TNLNSL, although a few geocoins in our possession had a visit to mark this momentous occasion. Thanks VKC1SR but to paraphrase Arnie, &quot;we'll be back&quot;  [;)].</groundspeak:text>

For more info check www.bpr.org.au &lt;br/&gt;These caches are placed so you can park and have a short walk to each or if you like bring your bicycle and ride the lot and catch a train back or if you are fit enough ride the round trip.&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a 300ml clear container with some small swaps, log and pen.

Geelong in a relatively unknown lookout.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Located in a park which used to be an old homestead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a nice little lookout from which you can get
uninterrupted views of&lt;br /&gt;
Geelong and area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park on street down the hill from the cache and walk from
there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short stroll of about 100M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a 200ml Clip Top Sistema painted black&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have found the cache you might want to walk up the park
and have a look at&lt;br /&gt;
the foundation of the old homestead.&lt;/p&gt;

Bushfire&lt;/a&gt; for the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk to the top of the park to get even better views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good spot to take hairy cachers for run or frizbee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*** Bring a pen just in case the pencil inside is having a bad

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt; Please make sure that
you replace cache properly and&lt;br /&gt;
it is well hidden. Many a time I have had re-hide whilst out

Found cache easily, and returned to where we found it, but did wonder if we should have hidden it a bit more. Decided not to, as we weren't the 'owners'. Signed the log, and didn't take anything - mainly because we had to nothing to add. Must up our geocaching game, and remember next time! Only second ever geocaching expedition, so learning as we go. Enjoyed a walk with our furry companion up to the ridge and around. Thanks to vkc1sr for taking the time to get us up here to enjoy the views. Another great time out and about in Geelong! </groundspeak:text>

This was my 54th GC find and my very first FTF just before midnight so I returned today and found this cache in a different location but a better position as the previous hide was muggled. So I will claim another FTF as I have revisited and signed the log again not like the other cacher who cut and pasted their log from 17 Feb 2007, I think this is defeating the purpose of this new cache site.At least I know the identity of dessek which is a new username for a very successful GC cacher. I may be old fashioned but I believe you should have to find the cache again to claim a find. If it's a new cache multi listed then that is different story.Thanks again to the VKC1SR team for bringing the ageing Bushfire back to this wonderful location where some of my relations owned the original homestead before it was destroyed.</groundspeak:text>

reserve.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome to Murgheboluc reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache has been placed in memory of 1SR's granddad, who used
to play cricket here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother and I never knew why he kept bowling us out when we
had a game with him, after all you should be able to hit granddad
for a 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he died, there was an article in the local paper where it
showed his bowling record. He took 5 wickets in 5 balls, a triple
hatrick. There were other figures which I will update when I can
find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the cache!! You are looking for a 1 litre sistema
container with log book, pen and some swaps. It should be quiet
here during winter but they still use the ground in summer for
cricket. Pick your day carefully in Summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the bird lovers there are wetlands behind the park and
numerous large trees in the reserve. While placing the cache, there
were birds everywhere. Take the time and have a stroll around the
reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Please rehide carefully to prevent
kid muggles finding&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Loved the bird life that lives in the trees here. Parrots very raucous and colourful. Cool little cache. Took nothing, but left a very scary shark and signed log (although we did get a day ahead of ourselves when dating it - doh!). Thanks to VKC1SR for another cool cache, and for grandad's!! :)
N.B Was a little concerned to see that someone had set a camp fire very near to the cache (cache was not harmed in anyway). Returned cache to where we found it, but did wonder how safe it was if people are going to keep lighting fires. Not sure if this affects anything? Just a thought! </groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;This is a lovely stroll around the river that shouldn't take you
long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't know what a Sudoku puzzle is goto
&lt;b&gt;www.sudoku.com&lt;/b&gt; and have a look because you will need to know
on this trip. The difficulty rating is set reasonably high due to
the high muggle factor. Especially at weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SAFETY NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; This cache is along side a river and also
runs beside a very active golf course. Small children will need to
be supervised at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be at a wooden fence where you need to answer a
simple questions to get you on your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many wooden posts (upright)make up the fence? = AB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now head to S 38.08.((A+B)*A)(A*A)A*3 E 144.19.B(A*4) (A*A) Here
you are looking for a 200ml sistema with a puzzle for you to take
and solve on your walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please advise in log if the puzzle sheets are getting low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint Wp2 if required. This puzzle will also have your next
co-ordinates. Good Luck!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please read the instructions on how to access cache and close
it again carefully. They are on the bottom of the puzzle
sheet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look out for a dead tree on your walk there are lots of parrots
in it. This appears to be a nesting site so please respect that.
See photo.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a round clip lock container painted

We got within 200m of the first cache, but couldn't continue due to the Barwon having breached its banks, and flooded the path - and a lot more besides. We could've cut through the golf course, as a few muggles were doing, but my offsider - let's call her, &quot;Pickled Ginger&quot; - didn't fancy the (small) trespass, esp with our furry cacher in tow! Thought about approaching from further upstream, but weren't convinced that the flooding wouldn't have thwarted this attempt, too. Will leave this one for another day, at a time when there are fewer water tortures. Just hope the cache survives the floodwaters! Apart from the excess river, it was a lovely sunny day out, and lovely walking weather. </groundspeak:text>

St Wilfrid's Anglican church, the consolidated Mount Duneed primary school (with almost 200 students from neighbouring districts), a small wooden meeting hall and the bus shelter are the only public buildings at Mount Duneed. Closer to Grovedale, the Geelong Airport, a caravan park and restaurant are on the west side of Surfcoast Highway. In recent years, larger farm properties have been subdivided into 10 and 20 acre lots. There are also some three and four acre blocks. The area is attracting a mix of young families and retirees. The highest hill in the region has views over the entire district, south towards the coast and north to Geelong. Mount Duneed is next to the Geelong Airport, less than 10 minutes drive from the Surfcoast and 15 minutes from Geelong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History&lt;br/&gt;Originally called Mount Disappointment, a disused hotel was moved from nearby Germantown to Mount Duneed to serve as a manse for the first Presbyterian church in the 1860s. Primarily a farming district, the people first gathered on holy days around the church and cemetery. Palmer's Beer Shop, serving Surfcoast travellers, opened on the highway nearby. A school was established in the Anglican church in 1862 and a building was finished in 1863. A small Presbyterian school opened soon after. In 1890, Mount Duneed was described as a postal hamlet and had two stores as well as a school and churches. A 1944 bushfire razed the early town buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hokay then.. onto the questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many uprights are there on the pergola? = AB&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many brown tables/chairs (picnic tables)? = C&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the South/East picnic table.. how many pieces of wood make up the table top? (not the seat)= D&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is located at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S 38.14.(ABx55)- 3&lt;br/&gt;E 144.19.(Cx14)+ (Dx84)+25&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gloves are recommended when searching for this cache.  You are looking for a 1.2 litre Sistema container with the usual goodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for the name of this cache: Think of the Caped Crusader (BatMan). Don't ask why.. as there is absolutely no relevance to bats and this cache. Just the strange way my (VKC's) mind works.

Well, we certainly got all three, the first two in spades [:O], and even had a screaming tail wind thrown in just to make things interesting [:O].  I had done most of this half of the trail after the fantastic [url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=c3044b69-41b0-444b-a329-07057262420c&amp;log=y&amp;decrypt=]Geelong event[/url] of a couple of years ago so for most of this part, I was just a traveller with my only &quot;partner-in-crime&quot;, LZZ(m) (if the weather had been only half-way decent, we might have had a dozen or more fellow riders but dem's da breaks [;)]).

This cache was first on [i]my[/i] list.  We spent quite a while trying to find it and the wind was making it impossible to even hear each other!  Finally, we decided to check the hint [:I] and had the stash in hand straight away at 11:20.  We quickly signed the log and scarpered before the massive gum tree decided to drop a limb or two on top of us [:O].

Theres no hidden treasure, when you reach the clearing at the top of Passage Peak the real treasure is all around you so take a look - take a few more steps North and behind a large rock you will find what you are looking for, if all you have come for is the cache... but don't forget to sign the log - there's a pen inside with the sheets of waterproof paper... oh and if you are going for the splendid views as well as the cache make sure you take your camera... </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Woke up this morning and found an email notification in my mailbox that a new Opencaching cache had been published. This is a very very rare event. In fact I don't think I've ever recieved one before. Anyway decided that I wasn't in a position to race out to try for the FTF and would just pick it up as my daily cache before work in Lyneham,. 

Got to the site and groaned that it was in a playground. Went all over the equipment several times before finally expanding my thinking and finding a quite nasty (but good) hide. Took a while to encourage the lid off and then a virgin logsheet. I know Opencaching is barely looked at but I also know that TE and MBO certainly do (or did)

A wander back down to Mac House and all's good with the day.

TFTC and the swoopers.

(BTW you will get many many more visits listing on the GC site)

Being a small city it is already pretty much covered in GC caches, if you do some crop circles there are very few spots available left to hide a cache.  Hence the reason when I found this spot just metres from my work it just seemed too perfect for me to leave it without a cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have decided to have a look at all the alternative Geocaching sites and list this cache on them, and conduct an experiment as to see who looks at the geocaching alternatives, whether it is more tourists finding the cache or if it is the locals which are giving it a go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you log your cache, please therefore give me a brief description of which sites you choose to use and where you are from, please also let me know if you are a tourist or a local.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As this cache is not being listed on the GC site, please do not leave trackables, but feel free to drop a pathtag or two to entice the next person to find the cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THIS IS A VERY BUSY LOCATION - STEALTH IS DEFINATELY REQUIRED</groundspeak:long_description>

I do enjoy the rating system of opencaching.  It lets the users create a consensus rating of a cache. After the first few though, it has averaged out, so to make it count, you have to get on early.
Interesting experiment. I shall keep an eye on it.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is an excuse by La Perouse (who was once a pilot) to write
about his favourite aviation era. You don’t have to read the
essay below on “Chilla”, although there are clues to
the cache in the images attached. The container is a 250ml systema
with room only for small TBs - not swaps. BYO pen. The place is
easy to access by 263 bus, or the ferry to Neutral Bay wharf. Sats
were not brilliant - only 4. It is not necessary to trespass on the
Sydney Water Board property.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The late 1920s and early 1930s was an era when aviation suddenly
shrunk the World. It could be compared to the way computers changed
our lives from the 1960s onwards, or to the spin offs from the NASA
space, shuttle, and satellite programs - from which we geocachers
benefit so much to-day. Aircraft technology moved very rapidly from
high drag canvas &amp; wood biplanes to streamlined monoplanes,
designed by clever young men who strove to make each creation go
ever faster and farther. It was all very experimental, the era of
the air race, the long distance flight, and intrepid pilots risking
their lives to be first for fame and fortune. By 1934, honorary
RAAF Air Commodore Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, Kt, M.C., A.F.C.
(known to the public as “Smithy” but always to his
close friends and family as “Chilla”) was a national
hero – an aerial Don Bradman. A small pugnacious 37 year old
with ever ready repartee, a beer &amp; a cigarette in his hand, a
prankster always with a pretty woman at his side, Smithy was said
to offer his female groupies “a ride for a ride”. A
proper larrikin, he lived life hard, fast and dangerously. In WW1
he survived Gallipoli as a signals dispatch rider, and then became
an Royal Flying Corps fighter pilot and was wounded and shot down
by Von Richthofen. After the War he was a Hollywood stunt pilot, a
bush pilot, a performer in an aerial circus and founder of Western
Australian Airways. Smithy was the first to cross the Pacific from
America to Australia, the first around the world, the first across
the Tasman, the fastest solo flight from England to Australia etc.
Smithy held more long distance flying and speed records than anyone
else on earth. Nancy Bird Walton, that national treasure of
Australian aviation and founder of the Australian Women Pilots'
Association, still lives in a house that overlooks the site of this
cache. In 1933, at the age of 17, she was the youngest Australian
woman to gain a pilot's licence, and one of the first pupils of the
Kingsford Smith Flying School at Mascot. She has described
Smithy’s flying technique as &quot;one of beauty and precision,
exactly timed, judged and balanced.&quot; In fact his exceptional flying
abilities made him a less than perfect instructor and one often
intolerant of a pupil’s lack of natural skill. He was also a
mediocre businessman, and in spite of all his success, was always
short of funds and getting entangled in dubious deals. But Smithy
was unstintingly generous with his own money and with his most
treasured possessions – his aircraft. The City of Melbourne
wanted to put itself on the world map for its centenary in 1934 and
devised a promotion: an Air Race from London to Melbourne, the
route stretching over 18,250 Km, through 19 countries and over
seven seas. They persuaded Sir Macpherson Robertson, a
multi-millionaire confectionary manufacturer, to sponsor the race.
Robertson wrote a cheque for A$1,500,000 (2006 values) and 63 of
the world’s top aviators entered the
“MacRobertson”, including Smithy, who accepted a
A$200,000 loan from Robertson to enable him to acquire a suitable
aircraft. Melbourne businessman Sidney Myer also underwrote
A$20,000 of Smithy’s costs if six others gave Smithy the same
amount. Take-off date was set at dawn (6:30 AM) on October 20,
1934, from RAF Mildenhall in England. Smithy chose the Lockheed
“Altair” - the creation of those cutting edge designers
from Burbank, California, John K. Northrop and Gerard Vultee. New,
the aircraft would have cost him A$800,000. This one was
“preowned” (actually “precrashed” and then
factory rebuilt) and was described by another famous aviator of the
period, P.G.Taylor, Smithy’s co-pilot for the Race and the
West–East Pacific crossing, as “A real thoroughbred.
Her tapered wings glistening below her blue streamlined fuselage:
no complex contraption of wires and struts and gadgets hanging
everywhere; just a wing, a body, and a tail of perfect form, like a
beautiful blue bird poised ready for flight” This state of
the art monocoque low wing monoplane had a tandem enclosed cockpit,
retractable undercarriage, flaps, variable pitch propeller, and a
performance far superior to any military aircraft of the time. The
14:1 supercharged engine was the 550 HP Pratt &amp; Whitney 9
cylinder radial which evolved into the famous Wasp R-1340, in
production until 1960, an engine that has powered a host of famous
aircraft, including the North American AT-6/SNJ/ Harvard advanced
trainer in which most Allied pilots in WW2 and afterwards learnt
their trade. You can find some newly discovered photos (2008) of
this beautiful 1930's aircraft at
http://www.adastron.com/lockheed/updates.htm and of the previous
owner, Captain George Hutchinson - who bought the Altair to emulate
Lindbergh's crossing of the Atlantic, but crashed on take-off
shortly after taking delivery! Note the shot showing the engine
without its cowling - then you understand how huge the fuel tanks
were, and why the pilot and navigator are located so far back. As
the actress said to the bishop - it's all to do with the C of G, my
dear :) Lockheed accepted Smithy’s order to modify the
“Altair” for long distance flying on the basis of his
fame (and their hope that a little would rub off on Lockheed if he
won the Race!) The mods resulted in an aircraft with a maximum take
off weight 34% higher than the design was certificated by the US
airworthiness authorities, so it could not obtain a US C of A. And
the rules of the MacRobertson Race said that all aircraft must
possess an airworthiness certificate from a country which was a
signatory to the International Air Convention. The USA was not a
signatory but Australia was. To add to Smithy’s woes, the
Australian government forbade the importation of aircraft from any
country that had not signed the ICAN. So Smithy did not have
– nor could he obtain – overt permission to import the
“Altair” or to fly it in the Race without first getting
an Australian airworthiness certificate. He had known this all
along, but gambled that if he could just get his
“Altair” onto Australia soil, he could use the press
and public opinion to bend the rules for him and have
“ANZAC” (as he now named the plane) certified here.
From Los Angeles, he shipped “ANZAC” to Sydney on the
sports deck of the SS ”Mariposa”, and directly she
docked at Woolloomooloo, Smithy paid the floating crane
“Titan” A$3,000 to swing her onto a barge. On 17 July,
1934, in Neutral Bay, “ANZAC” was manhandled off the
barge and pushed some 250 metres up to the northwest end of
Anderson Park. Fuelled with only 10 gallons (about 17 minutes
endurance), she was run up, turned into the wind and Smithy took
her off in 155 metres for the 12 Km flight to Mascot. When he
arrived there, Customs immediately impounded “ANZAC”,
disabled her engine by confiscating the plug leads and locked her
up in a sealed hangar! [To see good quality newsreel of the above
events, download the 5 Mb file from

1:24 mins of pure gold aviation history. I am indebted to that
website (and to many others including the State Library of NSW) for
the info and images in “Chilla’s Chance”]
Postscript: The “ANZAC” was renamed “Lady
Southern Cross” following a campaign by the Returned
Soldiers’ League to stop Smithy’s commercial use of the
name ANZAC. She eventually got her Australian airworthiness
certificate as VH-USB - Smithy was right about public opinion! But
she was scratched from the Race due to mechanical problems; time
ran out and she would have had to break the Australia to England
record just to reach the starting line. Subsequently, Smithy took
her to USA to sell so he could pay Robertson’s loan back.
Fitted with extra fuel tanks by the Australian designer Lawrence
Wackett, she now had a still air range of 4,090 miles (6,600 Km) at
a maximum take off weight nearly 40% above her certificated MTOW
and this provided Smithy some interesting challenges as it doubled
the take-off distance required. The flight was another record,
another triumph, the first trans Pacific flight from Australia to
USA. In Burbank, whilst Lockheed refurbished “Lady Southern
Cross”, Smithy made plans to take her to England. He became
embroiled in another bureaucratic nightmare: no US airworthiness
certificate meant no export permit from USA, which meant no import
licence into UK! In the end, common sense prevailed and she was
admitted to UK on a limited “racing only” C of A
registered as G-ADUS. However Smithy was running out of funds, and
was soon left with no options but to fly “Lady Southern
Cross” home to Australia. He and his copilot/mechanic Tommy
Pethybridge left on 6 November 1935 via Athens, Baghdad, Allahabad
(NW India), Singapore and Darwin in an attempt to break the England
to Australia speed record. Smithy was in poor health, burnt out
after living on adrenaline for 20 years, and deeply worried about
his financial situation. What should have been another glorious
adventure was now just a business enterprise to raise enough money
to survive. “Lady Southern Cross” was last seen at
around 2.16 AM on 8 November, 1935, south of Rangoon, Burma, when
the glow from her exhausts was visible as she overtook the only
other aircraft in the area, Jimmy Melrose in his Percival Gull,
also bound for Singapore. The weather was typhoonal and the
visibility bad. On 1 May, 1937, a section of her undercarriage
including a wheel and tyre (still inflated) washed ashore on Aye
Island in the Gulf of Martarban. Modern forensics have since shown
that it had been immersed for about 17 months in less than 15
fathoms (27 metres) of salt water. This relic is now in the
Powerhouse Museum, Sydney. The expedition that investigated this
find in 1937 also noted that the tallest tree on the very top of
jungle covered Aye Island (about 150 metres above sea level) had
had its top sliced off, and a dozen trees leading from there down
towards the sea were similarly damaged. They found some small
pieces of metal from the “Altair” on the beach, and
concluded that Smithy had crashed into the sea just off the Island.
It was a tragic ending to an amazing career, but not unexpected.
Amy Johnson, CBE, the great British long distance solo pilot and
contemporary of Smithy, always said “I know I shall end up in
the drink one day” and she did, and was never found. And
Amelia Earhart, DFC, another contemporary, an American and the
first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, said &quot;Flying may not
be all plain sailing, but the fun of it is worth the price.&quot; She
left Lae, New Guinea, for Howland Island 4,000 km away, on 2 July,
1937, on the penultimate leg of her attempt to be the first woman
to fly around the world – and was never seen again. Pioneer
fliers used up their luck pretty quickly. As the saying goes
“There are old pilots and bold pilots – but there are
no old, bold pilots…” In 1936, in Smithy’s
honour, Mascot Airport was renamed “Kingsford Smith
Airport” – international abbreviation KSA.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I (Akkatracker) Have now adopted this cache from Geomatica.&lt;/p&gt;
The sat coords were very consistent over 15 minutes although only 4 sats were acquired. Please report DNFs. The grounds were empty on a week day at lunchtime, although it is only 400 metres (as the crow flies) from North Sydney station. Starbrand muggle rating 2/5. I’ve lived around this area for over 30 years – and I never knew it existed. Safe place for geokiddies, but no swings. Sorry.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In 1872, the previous owner being in dire financial straits, a three story stone house known as “Euroka” on the heights of North Sydney, about two blocks from the Post Office, was sold to George Dibbs. He subsequently became State Treasurer and in this role he stopped the then practice of selling off Crown land to balance the State's books. He won public esteem when jailed for a year 1880 - 1881 for refusing on principle to pay £2000 damages for slander. Dibbs went on to serve several terms as Premier of New South Wales. George Dibbs set about turning the 7.5 acres (3 hectares) grounds near the house into a spacious parkland. Substantial plantings of figs, pines and other trees were undertaken. In 1882 he renamed the property “Graythwaite” after the ancestral home of his wife. Graythwaite's gardens have had 130 years to mature and it shows. In particular the estate features over forty mature Morton Bay, Port Jackson and Small Fruited Figs under whose canopy a rainforest has been gradually evolving from seed brought in by birds and bats. A significant number of young native rainforest trees are now on the rise. In 1915, Sir Thomas Dibbs (George Dibbs' brother) lost his only two grandsons at Gallipoli. In their ANZAC memory, he offered the property to the State of New South Wales as &quot;a Convalescent Home for our Sick and Wounded Soldiers and Sailors and when not required for that purpose as a Convalescent Home in perpetuity for distressed subjects of the British Empire regardless of Sect or Creed&quot;. The NSW Premier accepted the property as ”A gift for all time…” and in 1916, after significant building work, the convalescent home was opened under the control of the Red Cross. In 1978 “Graythwaite” was placed on the Register of the National Estate, the only comparable site in Sydney being Government House, with its setting on Sydney Harbour more or less opposite (from the South) and a garden area of comparable size - 5 hectares. However, in 1980 management responsibility for the property passed from the Red Cross to the NSW Department of Health. The property has steadily deteriorated since, and after two decades of almost total neglect by NSW Health, the State of NSW has twice tried to gain Supreme Court approval to &quot;separate the property from the trust&quot; and to sell it. No one would think of building medium density housing and allowing commercial development in the grounds of Government House, but that is precisely what the Health Department envisages for Graythwaite. North Sydney Council has made an offer to the NSW Government to buy “Graythwaite” to retain the land in public ownership, create a CBD park and ensure the restoration of the historic mansion to its former splendour. Currently the grounds are maintained by volunteers, and essential works are financed ex gratia by North Sydney Council, awaiting the State Government’s decision. A great garden does not happen overnight. It takes time, lots of it and one of the major features of Graythwaite is its gardens. You’ll find some postcards in the cache. If you think “Graythwaite” should not be sacrificed and turned into million dollar luxury apartments, please take one and post it to the current Premier. UPDATE May, 2008: The good news is that the 2008 Federal Budget allocates $20 million to “securing the future” of Graythwaite over the next 3 years. This is $5 million less than Kevin Rudd's election promise, but $20 million more than suggested after his Labor government’s review of the John Howard's Government's election spending promises. The less good news is that the Commonwealth has now effectively distanced itself from the issue, leaving it up to the RSL to battle the New South Wales State Government. (The Returned Services League is the Australian veterans' organization established in Australia in 1916 to provide help for former members of the armed forces and their families) The previous proposal had been for the Commonwealth to become the Trustee of the Graythwaite Trust, which would have given the Supreme Court confidence in the future of the Trust should it decide to remove the State Government as Trustee. The current proposal is for the RSL to become the Trustee, supported by the $20 million provided by the Commonwealth. This money both has to provide for the restoration of the property and provide an income for a range of RSL welfare services provided to veterans. This leaves the RSL with the obligation to finding a self funding use for the Graythwaite house itself. The gardens would be maintained by North Sydney Council. The RSL is actively looking for partners to assist it in finding a viable use for the house, most preferably a use related to health care. There is at least one good possibility and hopefully this can be developed prior to the next round of Supreme Court hearings in June, 2008. Update 10-07-08: The Mater Hospital has been actively looking at locating a convalescent facility at Graythwaite, and will join with the RSL in putting a proposal to the Supreme Court on July 14th. This will very substantially strengthen the RSL's case and make it much more difficult for the State to argue that their proposal is the best use of the Trust. Update 23-10-08: All the evidence has been heard. NSW Health proposed the sale of Graythwaite, the proceeds to be used for a rehabilitation facility at Ryde Hospital to replace an existing facility at Greenwich. This proposal would create not a single additional rehabilitation bed. It is simply a grab for cash. The other proposal, by the Australian Government and the RSL, proposed that the full purpose and spirit of the Graythwaite Trust be fulfilled by the grant by the Commonwealth of $15 million to the RSL for use for the provision of care services to veterans, that the grounds of Graythwaite be leased for a peppercorn rental to North Sydney Council for use as a regional park for the North Sydney CBD, that the Commonwealth provide $5 million for the restoration of the Graythwaite mansion and that St Vincents and the Mater Hospitals construct a new rehabilitation facility adjacent to the Graythwaite mansion and the adaptive reuse of the mansion as part of this facility. This proposal was supported by the RSL, the Commonwealth, North Sydney Council, St Vincents and the Mater Hospitals and the Friends of Graythwaite. All that has to happen now is for the Judge to choose the best case. However, the State Government/ NSW Health is going to court this Friday 24th October to try to defer the Graythwaite hearings set down for October 30 and 31. They suggest that the matter be stood over for a further directions hearing (not hearing of the evidence ) on December 5. Given that all of the evidence is now in and that the current Judge is retiring at the end of November, this suggests either that NSW Health realise that they have no chance of winning or that they want a new judge to hear the case some time in 2009. So, if you think the referee might rule against you - try and change the referee! Update 20 November 2008: The Court found in favour of the scheme proposed by NSW Health solely on the basis that it would help more 'distressed' citizens than the proposed Mater facility. This was despite the fact that the Mater's beds would be in addition to all existing beds, whereas the NSW Health scheme would merely replace existing beds without a single new bed being created to treat 'distressed' citizens! The Court's decision ignored the spirit and intent of Sir Thomas Dibbs's gift of Graythwaite and his obvious concern for the welfare of veterans, and focused solely on a narrow interpretation of just one sentence in his Deed of Gift. I understand the Court's decsion will be appealed. The cache is a 1 litre “sistema” box, with geokiddie goodies, the log and a 27 litre rubbish bag. Feel free to use the bag and take out any garbage you see around. If you do, record it when you log your find, and the next cacher will know to bring in a replacement. It is a pretty clean site - but we’d like to keep it that way! First To Find may get $50,000 - we’ve left a “scratchie” for you. Please replace the cache precisely as you found it - otherwise it will get muggled. Because of the water, ensure the log bag is put inside the zip slide bag. Oh and BTW If you spot a Garmin Oregon 300 laying around, its mine- I lost it here :(</groundspeak:long_description>

Bit concerned about this cache.. we had 2 hand held Garmin GPS units that we have used all over the world.. and they were both pointing 50M over a fence line into a farmers paddock.
We jumped the fence and had a stroll around looking through the rock piles and no cache was to be found.

The fact that the GPS places us on private property after jumping a fence.. and the walk thru also takes us through private property.. we are a bit dubious about the validity of this cache.

The cache owner needs to go and check the co-ords with a decent GPS (not a mobile phone) and let it sit for a few minutes to settle. 

At least it didn't rain.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">By boat only. Best is high tide, but probably you have to wade the
last meters.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Carters Island consists of two small areas of terrestrial
vegetation surrounded by mangroves which are the most highly
developed mangrove stands at Towra. The water is very shallow and
you may need to wade some hundreds meters if you are at low tide.
At high waters, you can come close with a small boat, but take care
if you have a motor, because there are plenty of submarine hazards
for your propeller.
&lt;p&gt;The shoreline at this part of Botany Bay is fractal exposing a
multitude of bays, sand bars, mangroves. In the water you may see
big fish as stingrays, at land and in the air birds. The adjacent
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkHome.aspx?id=N0551&quot;&gt;
Towra Point&lt;/a&gt; and Carters Island nature reserves are home to many
endangered, vulnerable, protected and exotic species of birds,
amphibians, mammals reptiles and plants. Land access into these
reserves is restricted and needs a permit, however, there are a few
beaches and landing stripes for boats which are open or closed, as
signposted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may need to work out your best boat access by yourself. It
depends on the size of the vessel, its propulsion method and where
you are coming from. Satellite maps may help to determine a deeper
water channel for approach. One way is to enter the bay close to
the Elephants Trunk. As you cross the bay towards GZ, steer
straight towards the mangroves and then follow them westwards, as
there the water is deeper than further out.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

preferably at lower tide. The descent, however, may be risky,
slippery and exposed. Take all of your care as an experienced
adventurer. Ask the locals for access.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Refreshed at the Beach Kiosk, it's only a short promenade to the
present location, where you can place the sunbeds. Enjoy the bathe
in the ocean or catch a wave, but be careful not to hit the
solids.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Access to here may be from the park opposite the School Of Arts in
Clifton. Surely, the kids have fun coming down in their lunch
break. Beware the path is steep, airy and slithery when wet. Bring
your bottle of water and slip-slop-slap.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You can go up and down. Definitely, you need rock climbing gear and
skills. This is a rock climbing wall for experienced
climbers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
DON'T attempt the cache without all the rock climbing gear. An
abseil from the top may do, but DON'T approach the drop if not
fully secured.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Best approach is by rock climbing on one of the regular routes from
the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stealth required, but once you're up, there is space to unpack the
cache and do your business out of the sights from the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rockclimbing at Nowra is one of the most famous sport climbing
spots along the south coast. Climbers gather here from both Sydney
and Canberra. The Descent Gully Wall you find here contains some of
the mostly climbed routes. Solid rock, caves, cracks - of any
difficulty and exposure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Back in 2003, the Arkaroo climbed here his first climb ever in
Australia, brought here and belayed by a new friend and colleague,
the legend Mike Law, who convinced me that it is a good place to
live here. That day, we also climbed the Turtle Wall roof, to the
right when you look up, with its exposure and abseil into empty
space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To place the cache, Suparki12 lead the climb - his first lead ever
- while The Arkaroo went up subsequently. That day, also Rocksandra
made it up as second for her very first time&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Bar Island is where History meets Nature and Adventure. This cache is by boat only and the ultimate approach is by the southern-most tip. Just a few meters up the shore line in magnificent rock. South shore is bare rock and free of environmentally fragile mangroves or salt marsh – no needs to enter those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be careful:&lt;/b&gt; Needs hands on the rocks to get up there.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After having found the cache, it's worth to drive to the jetty and visit Bar Island on a self-guided tour. There is a modern jetty superimposed to the historic one at the northern end, allowing landing even to one larger boat. The track leads up the hill, though the ruins of the church with a remaining chimney, the cemetery to the memorial at the summit.&lt;p&gt;Bar Island reveals both Aboriginal and modern history. The traditional lands of the Guringai and Darug groups meet at Bar Island. At its northern end, the island's foreshore has a midden which contains debris such as shells deposited by Aboriginals who ate shellfish and other foods on the site over many years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The island was occupied in the beginning of the 1870s by the new Australians. St. John's Anglican Church was built on Bar Island in 1876 to serve the spiritual needs of the local community on the Lower Hawkesbury River. A part time school was transferred to the premises in 1877, became full time in 1884, but closed in April 1892, reopening for a short period in January 1901 to July 1903. The first burial in the Cemetery took place on 23 August 1879, with the majority of burials taking place before 1906, by which time the church was a ruin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We made our way in a duck, such as the surf rescue inflatable boats and watered in Apple Tree Bay of the Kuringai National Park. That was a 72 km round trip with Bar Island being the furthest point. A gorgeous day out! Of course, there are closer boat ramps and access points all over the river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">1430 Luckily had a couple of weekdays off so decided to come on down to Sydney from Taree and get a couple of Arkaroo's caches that had been place in February, but were still waiting for someone to come and find them.
Wanting to increase my averages I decided to get a couple of Arkaroos other caches while I had chance to borrow a boat. Today was a trial run, making sure I knew where the shallows and channels are.
Not too difficult to land the dinghy on the southern end of Bar Island. And just a short climb up to the cache.
Found the GC/OC cache fairly easily. Wrote in the logbook that I was also logging this for Opencaching.
Left: Mini Karabiner, Mini Pencil, and a Correct Site Marker - surgical skin pen, that we get from work.
Thanks again for the cache Arkaroo.
PS A one litre sistema as a small, sweet! A bit more room for swaps.</groundspeak:text>

needed! If this is your first abseil, then don't do it! Just enjoy
the view! Don't approach GZ without a rope and approved climbing
gear. Stay in front of the guardrail if you are not in full abseil
condition. There is a risk of free fall of 20 m height! The cache
is for the experienced adventurer only and on his own, full risk!
You are warned; it is your responsibility!
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This place may be very busy, and in a normal
cache, you would be bothered by watching muggle, to whom you do not
want to disclose it. Here, let them watch: they won't reach it
anyway!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stanwell Park is a pretty touristic place, just south of the Royal
National Park, in a valley between Mount Mitchel in the south and
Bald Hill in the north. It offers high variety of sporting and
leisure activities, such as swimming, surfing, beach activities,
hang gliding, rock climbing bush walking, fishing, sightseeing. The
picnic area, the beach, the park. These activities attract heaps of
muggles on a nice day. No worries, there is space for
everybody!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ground Zero is located in that beautiful sandstone wall, where the
stone is intersected by the rusty iron precipitates giving to it
the different shades of ocher color. Probably, it's worth to
approach it first from the bottom and spot it! However, the stone
is too brittle to climb up, and it's a 15 m high overhanging. So
walk around and up the street and abseil.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The aim is the adventure; we want you to find it! From the bottom,
you see a deep black hole few meters under the top. It's not there
- although it's a perfect hole for a cache, however, you wouldn't
be able to recover it again! Abseil 1-2 m South of it. Fix the rope
at the obvious structure and go!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you drop it - go around and bring it up
again - it even happened to me when I placed it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We used a 11 mm rock climbing rope of 60 m
length (which is plenty), an abseil eight and an abseil shunt. Take
your helmet because pebbles fall, long pants and solid shoes to
protect from the thorns at the top! One person should secure the
place at the beach and keep muggles in a safe distance.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Easy to find cache, however along unsecured paths. You need to be
experienced in bush walking or hopping along rocks at the
shoreline. The steep slope may be slippery and exposed.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Some people drive their BMW here, but it is advised to leave the
car near the Clifton School of Arts and walk down the hill. There
is a sign telling about the unsecured path which you will take on
your own risk. Arriving at the bottom, enjoy the cliff galleries to
the north, before heading south to ground zero.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A modern car is made out of a multitude of materials produced after
state-of-the-art research. Here you can admire the corrosion and
wear resistance of different metals and polymers. Some of the high
strength steels, as found in the crank shaft and gear boxes, won't
withstand corrosion so well. The exhaust pipe, however, is usually
exposed to very high temperatures and also dry and wet
environmental conditions, withstanding very well the salty water of
a winter road in Germany. Other structural parts are made out of
light metal alloys, which just corrode away, while the wheels have
to be mechanically reliable, wear and corrosion resistant, probably
the best conserved metal on the car. Brake hoses need to be
flexible and resist fatigue and highest temperatures, why they
still look brand new as most of the other parts are gone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Amazing, me coming from Bavaria, finding such a device at the other
end of the world (20-30m north of GZ).&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;KD35HAY - Trailhead&lt;br /&gt;S 34° 15.585 E 150° 58.211</groundspeak:long_description>

down. It may be slippery and exposed - only for the experienced
mountaineer.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Best you start in Clifton near the School of Arts, make your way
down across the road. But probably you are already down here
because you sought a &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35HAY&quot;&gt;Sheer
Driving Pleasure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, it would be time for a coffee, ice cream or other
amenities, you enjoy with the breeze of the ocean, the views and
the sunshine. There is a little, blue rimmed kiosk, but make sure
you call for the opening hours or for the availabilities.
Otherwise, there are plenty of pubs and cafes only a few hundred
meters from here.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cache is a boring micro, placed at the published
coordinates. Terrain rating is higher than 1 because you have to
get off the track, bent down, and may get your Sunday suit dirty or
catch a spider web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;However:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The world is full of boring micros, so cache hunters are just going
for numbers, not for quality! Even logs at innovative and demanding
caches may read:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;TFTC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
No full stop '.', no exclamation mark '!', no 'M'. And even if so,
that's not enough! We cache hiders want to know your stories, the
weather conditions, the cache approach, your mood! Are the kids in
the car winching because dad's stopping all 161m for a boring
micro? How did you adjust your travel plans to get here and what
did it cost? What do you have in mind when caching under a narrow
foot bridge? Where are your caching limits, what defines them -
time, length, dirtiness, physical effort, intelligence (we'll find
out here!)? Have you experienced other adventures to get out here,
like hang gliding, abseiling, surfing, beach walking or seeking for
The Arkaroo's caches?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additional Logging Requirements&lt;/b&gt; (optional)&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When you log this cache, we desire you author an individual,
unpublished story of at least 250 words!&lt;br /&gt;
You can write any story, from your childhood, from your first
locomotive ride, philosophizing about Goethe's Faust, your secret
dreams, the precipitation of matter after the big bang, or what
most Aussie logs contain: the spider webs around the cache.
However, the log has to be genuine. If it is found anywhere else,
it will be deleted! So remember: No Plagiarism! This requirement
also excludes a copy of the contents of another story! I.e. if a
cacher logs the 250 random numbers he had in mind, a second cacher
must not do so any more. So hurry up to find and log it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Name of The Cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Read it: &lt;b&gt;! TFTC&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt;M!&lt;/b&gt;, where&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* '!' is the logical NOT operator,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* 'TFTC' is defined as usual in the community,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* 'M' stands for 'Mate' and should never be omitted in Oz,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* '!' is a mark to express exclamation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

is at the midpoint between Clifton descent and Wombarra beach, a
quick and easy find once you are out here. You need to hop along
the rocks of the shoreline. If coming from Clifton, be aware of the
risk the exposed and slippery path encounters.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Say in 2061, there is needs for the last coal to mine, imagine the
huge open pit excavators from Thyssen Krupp removing 300m of the
earth surface and digging into the Illawarra escarpment. Meanwhile,
enjoy the place, but don't try to climb the cliffs as the coal is
most brittle and will fall straight upon you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Access from either side, depending on your strength and fitness. At
Clifton, park near the School of Arts and start your way down
across the road to the left of the little park. A sign warns you of
the unsecured path.</groundspeak:long_description>

A gorgeous lookout along the Wodi Wodi track, towards the ocean and
Coalcliff. You are after a small tin can which can hold small
trackables. Bring an opener - such as your car key.  
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Wow, what a view again! Bring your picnic and have a rest. You are
standing at the NSW State Survey Mark &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/WMA3Q6&quot;&gt;24365&lt;/a&gt; at 250m height above the
ocean. In the south, Coalcliff and a glimpse to the Sea Cliff
Bridge.  &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Access is by walking only. The nearest car park is down at the
Lawrence Hargrave Drive between Stanwell Park and Coalcliff. Allow
two hours or so to walk up and down. The trail up leads through
different vegetation areas from the light coastal forests into tall
eucalypts, red gums, palm trees. As you cross the cliffs you'll
enter the plateau with gymea lilies, grass trees and a variety of
gum trees, bottle brush and other banksias. A jewel of natural
bush. I recommend to take the crest down, a little known path
leading down from near the ancient &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GCDFF&quot;&gt;Train Spotting (GCDFF)&lt;/a&gt; cache. This
way, you head down facing Stanwell Park beach with competitive
views.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Assuming that you have done the Quibray Bay Mangroves (&lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC2VPZ6&quot;&gt;GC2VPZ6&lt;/a&gt;) already, so you know all
about the area. Weeney Bay lies further down the channel between
oyster the farms. Have you seen the birds sitting on the poles and
fishing. Or just drying their feathers in the sunshine. The
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkHome.aspx?id=N0551&quot;&gt;
Towra Point Nature Reserve&lt;/a&gt; starts behind this sign, a few
meters further south of here, where even boats are prohibited. And
look to that idyllic hut just east of the sign with its little
jetty! It must be a nice place to relax.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Access:&lt;/b&gt; Here, larger vessels can come at high tide,
however, stay well in the channel, otherwise you may find yourself
in trouble. There is no need to enter the oyster fields at all. I
saw a jetski racing by with 20 or 30 knots, but many people
exercise here by paddling from the Kurnell area. A careful study of
a map or satellite image may be helpful for planning to come out
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rating is that high only because of the need of a boat.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Stanwell Park beach is in exceptional natural
shape, set back in a valley of the Illawarra Escarpment, just south
adjacent to the Royal National Park. It has a total length of 900 m
between the cliff shores, where Bald Hill and Mt Mitchell fall into
the ocean, north and south, respectively.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The sands of the beach may shift considerably from Far North To Far
South, depending on the currents in the ocean. At times, the beach
stretches or retreats by 100 m at one end and adding to the other,
demonstrating the forces and power of the waters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As you walk along the beach, you will see various landscapes,
biotopes, communities, sports, views and landscapes, which make up
the area such a jewel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Starting Far North, you could venture further north hopping from
rock to rock until The Pinnacles (GC2J7JJ), such as some fishermen
do. However, let's stay on the sands today for our walk to the Far
South.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The northern most part of the beach is embraced by a 20-30 m high
wall of colorful sandstone, which is worth to admire. There is
valuable bouldering at some spots, If you like an abseil adventure,
seek Muggle More Than Welcome To Watch (GC2J5TB).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Surfers and board riders enjoy the waters here as the break on the
sand bars is opposite to the rip created by the northern
lagoon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At this place, the sands retreat towards the park, along the
Lawrence Hargrave creek. This flat beach are is often used for
landing of the hanggliders coming down from Bald Hill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tourists and locals meet in the grassland of the park, where picnic
tables are located. Sometimes Indian communities gather here to
enjoy the day after celebrations at the Hindu temple in Helensburgh
nearby.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dunes surround the beach heading further south, at which the
Helensburgh Stanwell Park Surf Life Saving Club is located and,
together with the Wollongong life savers assure a safe swim. Say
hello to the patrol members; a few of them are involved in
geocaching and other outdoor activities!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another broad sand field separates the ocean from the southern
lagoon of Stanwell Creek - seek The Blue Hole (GC2HWNP) further
upstream.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At this place, Nippers meet for training and pointscore every
Sunday morning during the warm seasons. Kids compete in beach
events, such as sprint and flags, while they are approached to the
water by wading for the youngsters, swimming, board race for the
teens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the evening, fishermen occupy the shore line, while surfers are
in the water all day round.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The break is particularly powerful due to the steep slope of the
ground. A short swim out - or on a board or a boat opens splendid
views around the southern cliffs towards Coalcliff and the Seacliff
Bridge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The multi cache has two stations. Fist you
need to seek to the Far North end of the usual sand area, where you
find five dates at the Way Point. At times, they are easy to see,
but it may happen occasionally, that they are covered by
sands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ground Zero Far South is obtained by considering the
coordinates&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
S  34° 14' 19.65&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
E 150° 59' 33.59&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
and subtracting the youngest and the oldest year numbers from the
arc seconds of the latitude and longitude, respectively. Use the 4
digit numbers while disregarding the decimal dot (i.e. divide the
year numbers by 100 when accounting for the decimal dot).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a double check, Far South lies in a radius of approximately 900
m from Far North, with a bearing of roughly 225°.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

is your issue. Hop along the rocks from either Wombarra beach or
Clifton. The latter path may be of high risk, slippery when wet and
exposed, for the experienced mountaineer only.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The remnants of Clifton Pool prove of better times when swim
championships were held at this location. Come on a sunday and
support your champions in the disciplines. What's your time to swim
50m - give it a try! Not sure the location was closed because of
the vicinity of Wollongong's oldest pub!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Access from Clifton is parking near the School Of Arts, descend at
the other end of the park following a little fisherman's path. From
there, you may enjoy a series of other caches along the way.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Stanwell Park! Railway Crescent
is the first location you encounter when arriving by train of the
South Coast Line, from Sydney or Wollongong.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The railway is important part of history in Stanwell Park, as it
facilitates the transport of coal from the mines in the vicinity
and along the coast. There are many remnant buildings and street
names from the former train path, which are obsolete or otherwise
used today. Some of them host great geocaches, like Dark Side of
the Moon and (GCCA6) and The Blue Hole (GC2HWNP).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Railway Crescent and subsequent roads wriggle down the slopes to
the beach, like a serpent through the mountains (The Arkaroo),
ideal for group of youngsters arriving by train, skateboard under
their feet and surfboard under their arm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not just roads and streets, but also the railway line meanders
along the escarpment curling in a large crescent over the
impressive viaduct in its apex. A walk along the Wodi Wodi track
starting at Railway Crescent leads you into the bush of the
escarpment with great views over the area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last not least, this is the point, where The
Arkaroo arrived first in Little Bulli and fell in love with this
magic place.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; At this point, the plateau of Mount Mitchell in the Illawarra Escarpment drops abruptly vertical by ~ 30 m of height into the subtropical rainforest above Coalcliff. This basin carved into the sandstone and open to the ocean front is the second part of Little Bulli - the other is Stanwell Park. You want to sit down and rest to enjoy the views over the little ocean village with its beach front and headlands with the rock pool. In the foreground of the valley, the railway line serpents into the tunnel. More interestingly, you see the Illawarra Coke Company to your feet – from a bird's view – and study the coke ovens and the infrastructure in detail. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you dare to look down - I do it only lying on my belly – you will feel the air of the spot. Like from God's Window, you look on to of the forest in which some palm trees stitch out of the eucalyptus green. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACCESS: We followed the cliffs from the water tank. You either walk up Mt Mitchell and follow the coastal track from Stanwell Park or the other side, which leads to the tank. Alternatively an old service track gives access from the north west and you can venture from where the Princes Highway crosses the freeway, which, with permission, could be driven by an all-terrain vehicle og good clearence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXTRAS: Subsequently, pass the Bush Garden cache and venture to the point (34° 14.563'S; 150° 57.988'E), lie on the belly approaching the edge carefully and look down from the rock. You will be particularly impressed. Let me know, what you saw there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ATTENTION: Extreme Danger: There are high cliffs in the area and you have to be careful where you go. Think before! Probably you want to keep an eye on geokids – don't let them run around when they play. Ground zero is approximately 4 m away from the edge, so you would not need to balance on it. If you feel uncomfortable, just scramble on your knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;EX2KK71 - Car Drop&lt;br /&gt;S 34° 14.563 E 150° 57.987&lt;br /&gt;Very interesting point to look down the cliffs.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The pinnacles are frequently accessed by fishermen (muggle), who
know their path along the coast. Nevertheless, just before reaching
the spot, a bit of experienced climb with hands on the rock is
necessary.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; There is a few meters rock
climb with risk of fall. &lt;b&gt;It's YOUR responsibility
alone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The cache is located well above the highest water line, but may get
wet in heavy weather. Therefore make sure, it cannot be washed away
by placing a few rocks accordingly. Make sure, it's well hidden
from muggle.
&lt;p&gt;Located on the southern fringe of the Royal National Park, the
beach of Stanwell Park and surrounding area are set in an
amphitheatre-shaped valley, framed by 100 m high sandstone cliffs.
Views to the north drop steeply from Bald Hill into a headline made
up by two or three distinct pinnacles, resisting the harsh surf and
weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the interface between land and water coincides with the
interface of sandstone and the underlying Narrabean shale, a
sediment rich in fossils. Younger volcanism has broken through
these ancient layers and form different features along the
coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different hardness and resistance of the various rocks lead to
different erosion, forming the outstanding pinnacles, of which the
eastern most is basaltic while the western is remaining sandstone
on the shale floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Stanwell Park beach, the pinnacles are the most northern
point you can access by walking or jumping from rock to rock near
the shoreline. Access beyond, into Bulgo area of the Royal National
Park is given only by mounting into the escarpment or by the sea -
as a 30 m high, vertical rock wall plunges directly deep into the

&lt;p&gt;Once you reached Ground Zero, it's worth to climb the eastern
pinnacle and have the round view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please Note:&lt;/b&gt; The cache is located
in a so-called &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cache Catching Cage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; which prevents it
from being washed and blown away upon heavy weather. Once you
spotted it, please &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;open it from the uphill side&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; only
by removing that one rock and undoing that little mesh. Make sure
all is secure in place after your transactions. If you are
susceptible to scratches you may want to &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;use gloves&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
for this. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

area. The cache may hold small swaps such as geocoins and travel
bugs.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Towra Point, the northern tip of the of the land area stretching
into Botany Bay bears clear waters and a white beach. Beyond starts
the Towra Point Nature Reserve, which is often stated as the most
important wetland in the Sydney area. There are public moorings on
a day use basis, and on a hot summer day, this beach is one of the
regional secrets. You may also see marine wildlife, plenty of fish,
including stingrays.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Access:&lt;/b&gt; You must come by boat as land access through Towra
Point Nature Reserve is first by permit only, and secondly
impenetrable through the swamps. Landing of a larger vessel is at
the day use area, then walk the short distance along the beach
until you are closest to GZ. If you feel, please take some rubbish
off your way &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Be careful!&lt;/b&gt; Depending on how you approach GZ, there is risk
of fall from height or you may get wet feet. I suggest the latter
one. It may be extremely slippery after rain. Use your common sense
of mountaineering and do not hold on loose rocks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Approach:&lt;/b&gt; Haven't tried the direct way - and nobody
does!&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Stanwell Park is a village between Sydney and Wollongong, still
exposing much nature and history. Besides the beach, there is bush,
raising up the Illawarra escarpment. Two creeks come down the
slopes, Hargraves Creek and Stanwell Creek, feeding the Northern
and the Southern Lagoon, respectively. Lawrence Hargraves Drive is
the main road longing the coast, which follows here the ancient
rail path, therefore pretty even and on large foundation,
particularly, when crossing the Stanwell Creek. The waters of the
creek form a hole, called “The Blue Hole”, situated 90
m downstream Ground Zero, which is a pleasant venue for kids, off
the tourist way, jumping into the deep pool on hot days.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is my very first hide of a geocache,
which I dedicate to &lt;b&gt;Lady_YY&lt;/b&gt;. I invite

This epic, one of the oldest written stories, is the basis of many myths, legends and tales, including modern ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gilgamesh, Assyrian King of Uruk during the third millennium BC, is apart god and part man. He sets out on a quest to seek immortality. In the course of his quest, he finds compassion, friendship, courage, love and peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The statue was unveiled by the Chancellor of the University emeritus professor Dame Leonie Kramer, AC DBE on the 15 October 2000.</groundspeak:long_description>

is approximately 600m from Barraba Trig Rest Area.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's highly recommended that you purchase the topographic map
for the Quorrobolong area or the Great North Walk map set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To access the cache you'll need to hike approximately 4km along
the Great North Walk track starting at Congewai Ave, Congewai. The
Barraba Trig Rest Area, where you can camp at, is on the top of
Barraba which is 520m above mean sea level (amsl).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trig location is actually approximately 600m north of the
the Barraba Trig Rest Area. There is a gravel road that runs close
to the trig but you will need to do a small bit of bush bashing
along the ridge to Barraba Spur (450m amsl).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The views at the trig are obscured by trees but this is a nice
little detour for anyone staying at Barraba Trig Rest Area over
night.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Also Green Point Foreshore Reserve is just an amazing place in general and with the cycle ways and bush tracks is perfect for a family outing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the cache you find lots of little trinkets.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located at the Old Darlington School, a beautiful little building, which is surrounded by a moat on one side that separates it from from Cadigal Green park (also beautiful).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is is a log only cache so bring a pen. High muggle activity during the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old Darlington School was designed c1877, and was one of a number of single storey suburban schools designed by the architect to the Council of Education, George Allen Mansfield. At the end of 1975, the school, which was in a very poor state of repair was transferred to the University. Several buildings were demolished and the site cleared in 1976. It was originally intended that the area be used for construction of a new building for the School of Biological Sciences, to be relocated to Darlington from Science Road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This plan was cancelled with the ending of the Australian University’s Commission triennial funding in 1975, and in 1978 the building was renovated for the Department of Music to be used as a theatre workshop and performance space. The building is heritage listed under the City of Sydney Local Environment Plan and the University’s Section 170 Register.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old Darlington school is a single storey Gothic Revival style building constructed of polychromatic brickwork with sandstone sills, kneelers, broaches and string courses. The picturesque composition includes a spire at the south corner, a chimney almost in the centre of the verandah (to the west elevation) and gables to the south and west.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In September 2007, the University of Sydney began conservation work on the façade and roof of the old Darlington School in accordance with the 1999 Heritage Fabric Survey recommendations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work was completed in February 2008, allowing the Old Darlington School to continue as a venue for events, concerts and exhibitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old Darlington School is now conserved for future generations. The life expectancy of the features, such as the roofs is over 100 years. The savings to can be measured by the original investment in the embodied energy for the building has been saved for the 21st century. The project achieved its goal and was completed within the project budget of $1.4m, compared with the cost of an equivalent new building which would be in excess of $2m.</groundspeak:long_description>

While you can't really tell from the outside a huge portion of it is actually underground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache itself is a nano and is hidden in the forecourt of the Sydney Law School.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My GPS had a bit of difficulty with finding GZ because of the buildings surrounding the area. Please post the coords you get in the log if you think it’s wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sydney Law School building and associated components of the project occupy a significant site within the Camperdown Campus bounded by Fisher Library, Eastern Avenue, the Carslaw Building, and, Victoria Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four major components of the project are the Sydney Law School Building, including a Moot Court facility, Faculty of Law Library, Teaching Spaces, and Forecourt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Faculty of Law Building is the visually dominant element of the project occupying an elevated position on a linear north south orientation defining the campus perimeter with Victoria Park. Rather than forming a barrier the building is lifted above the groundplane with its northern section splayed providing an “open door” orientation towards the city, reinforcing the connection of law with the CBD’s legal precinct and wider society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This building, over four levels, accommodates the faculty academic and administrative staff, together with a range of research centres and institutes, and incorporates collaborative spaces, meeting and conference rooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A total of 23 teaching spaces are provided within the facility, ranging from 300 and 100 seat lecture theatres, through to 60, 56, and 24 seat seminar facilities to suit a wide range of teaching requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Law Library occupies approximately 3,650 sq mts on Level 1 including the associated mezzanine level to the western edge of the new facility and features views to Victoria Park from a range of contemporary resource and research spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone attempting this cache needs to be mindful that the forecourt is a very hight muggle activity area during the day. Evening/night time should be quieter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BYO pen. Also the log can be difficult to remove so bring a paper clip (or cache extraction tool).</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a Night Cache and can only be done at night. Bring your Torches and Hunt Bunyip at Kings Billabong.  Park at the Car Park, Follow the walking track to the start coordinates. GPS Required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The smooth-finned Bunyip in this area are most active at night, so a night trail has been set out that will take you to some of the best places for viewing them.  Be very aware that the trail takes you close to water at times – watch the young ones closely as Bunyips do eat small mammals. The trail is set out with stealth Firetacks, which reflect straight back at the light source – Hold your torch at eye level and they will show up best. When you reach a double tack you will need to look for a tag with Coordinates. The second tag will send you to the final. When you have seen enough Bunyips the road will take you back to the track and the track will take you back to the carpark. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning : Please be aware that a territorial female Bunyip is nesting in this area at present. Bunyips are very dangerous when expecting or raising young. They rarely travel far from the water however please be very careful to follow the trail and not stray into the nesting area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reeds provide good natural cover when hunting Bunyips but be aware that they both sleep and nest in flattened reed beds, usually on or near islands. Scan the water and you may be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of one of Australia’s rarest and most secretive animals.  Dr. B. Mitchell is an expert on this species, he suggests that you walk as quietly as possible. Bunyips can be alarmed by sudden sounds, so avoid breaking sticks or talking loudly. Silence will also allow you to listen out for bunyip calls. These calls vary from low rumbles that sound a little like distant trucks to high pitched skwarks.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;BC306D7 - Carpk&lt;br/&gt;S 34° 15.266 E 142° 13.821&lt;br/&gt;This is where the carpark is and the walking path starts.&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN306D7 - Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;The Location of the Final.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Toronto...
&lt;p&gt;Toronto is a town within the city of Lake Macquarie in New South
Wales, Australia, approximately 28 kilometres (17 mi) from
Newcastle's central business district and is a commercial hub for
the sprawling suburbs on the western shore of the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History:&lt;br /&gt;
Toronto was named after Toronto, Ontario, Canada in honour of
Edward Hanlan, a world-champion sculler who visited Australia in
1884. The area's subdividers, the Excelsior Company, named the land
in honour of Hanlan's visit, which coincided with the opening of
the subdivision. The name was not publicly used until 1887. The
Canadian city's name comes from the Mohawk language tkaronto,
meaning where there are trees standing in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toronto was originally the site of an Aboriginal mission called
Ebenezer, established in 1829 by Reverend Threlkeld. Threlkeld is
reported to have begun construction of his chimney with a local
black stone which he later realised was coal. Coal Point is named
after this discovery. The development of several coal mines in the
region, proximity to the nearby city of Newcastle, and its position
by the lake led to gradual development and population
increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the closure of the Ebenezer Aboriginal Mission in
1890, the population of the Toronto area remained mostly
Aboriginal. As the coal companies moved into the area, the
aboriginal population were helped financially and the community was
sustained mainly by the coal industry. However, it was not long
before a mixture of land disputes and poor treatment of the local
Aboriginals led to a major rally by the locals. This rally, which
began as vandalism of mining company property, soon escalated into
heavy violence and led to the Toronto massacre of 1896. Five
Aboriginals were killed and many people on both sides were brutally
beaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population:&lt;br /&gt;
Toronto and its surrounding suburbs had a total population of just
over 5,000 people at the turn of the century. Toronto's population
was 5161 in the 2006 census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transport:&lt;br /&gt;
Toronto is considered to be the hub for public transport on the
western side of Lake Macquarie. The area is served by a privately
operated bus service; 'Toronto Bus Service', which services the
areas to the west, south and north of the town.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Toronto was served by train services until March 1990, when the NSW
Government closed the line because of low passenger levels. The
train service was replaced by a bus service which connects Toronto
with Fassifern railway station.Train services operating from
Fassifern include services to Sydney and Newcastle as well as the
XPT service to Brisbane. Toronto is well served by road links to
Newcastle and Sydney and is approximately 8 minutes from the
Sydney-Newcastle Freeway (F3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toronto centre serves the local communities of Kilaben Bay,
Coal Point, Carey Bay, Rathmines and Wangi Wangi to the south and
Teralba, Booragul, Woodrising, Fennell Bay, Bolton Point, Fassifern
and Blackalls Park to the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sports:&lt;br /&gt;
Toronto is represented by three sports teams in Newcastle
competitions. The Toronto Awaba Stags FC in the Northern NSW
Football competition; the Macquarie Scorpions in the Newcastle
Rugby League and also the Toronto Workers Kookaburras in the
Newcastle cricket competition. Nathan Green, winner of the 2009 RBC
Canadian Open, was born in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;

Early spellings include 'Kuringbong'(1834),'Coorumbung'(1841), 'Corumbong' (1879). The name was officially adopted with the opening of' Cooranbong' post office in 1866. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Police Station and lock up was built by Henry Worley in 1835. Moses Carroll was the Superintendant. The township came into existence around the time of the 1861 land sales. It was announced in 1866 that a bridge was to be erected over Dora Creek. The first Catholic church was erected by November 1861. Thomas Russell opened the first hotel. By 1875 a racecourse was operating. The Seventh-day Adventists established a college at Cooranbong in 1896. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1865 it was estimated that the town had 150 residents, who were chiefly timber workers. In 1884 the population was about 700 but the census of 1891 showed only 206 people, possibly due to the depression of the 1890's affecting the timber trade. The population has grown to around 4500. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was previously published on www.geocaching.com on 2 Jul 2011, so has been found before under that listing.

Starting life as the Berowra-Calga Tollway, the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway has been gradually extended and improved until the Palmdale / Ourimbah gap and Lengahans Drive bypass were completed in the late 90's. The route replaced several sections of very windy road between Berowra and the southern reaches of Newcastle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The freeway starts with the junction of the Pacific Highway and Pennant Hills Road at Pearce's Corner, Wahroonga in Sydney's north. From here it goes north, skirting the western edge of the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park before meeting the Hawkesbury River at Brooklyn. After crossing the Hawkesbury the motorway passes through the Brisbane Water National Park, crossing Mooney Mooney Creek with an impressive 480m long and 75m high bridge before reaching the first main interchange on the Central Coast at Kariong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After reaching Kariong, the motorway continues through rural and semi-rural areas of the Central Coast with interchanges provided at Ourimbah, Tuggerah, Warnervale and also Kiar, near Doyalson. From the Doyalson interchange the freeway continues to the west of Lake Macquarie with interchanges near Morisset, Cessnock, Toronto and Cardiff. The Doyalson interchange is with what is known as &quot;Motorway Link&quot; a connection feeder to the Pacific Highway (now SR111), when the freeway ended at this interchange in the mid 1980s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the Cardiff interchange a link road takes  traffic into Newcastle via Wallsend while the motorway continues north to reach its finish with a roundabout at the junction of Weakleys Drive (Weakley's Drive photos can be seen here) and John Renshaw Drive, Beresfield. From here the National Highway route continues to Brisbane via the New England Highway (accessed via Weakleys Drive), with traffic on NH1/NH15 taking John Renshaw Drive and the New England Highway eastbound to meet the Pacific Highway at Hexham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sydney-Newcastle Freeway, is part of the Auslink National Network, and is the major road linking Sydney, the Central Coast and Newcastle. It also links with the New England and Pacific Highways, for travel to northern New South Wales and Queensland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sydney-Newcastle Freeway is a vital link for around 75 000 motorists that use the freeway daily, the majority of whom travel between the Central Coast and Hunter regions and Sydney. During weekends and school holidays, the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway is heavily used by motorists travelling to and returning from northern New South Wales and Queensland holiday destinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This section of the F3 was opened to traffic:&lt;br/&gt;Morisset to Freemans Drive - March 1988&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History:&lt;br/&gt;The Sydney-Newcastle Freeway replaced the old Pacific Highway which was built in the 1920s along a route that had existed since 1840s, when settler George Peat cut a track to his property on the banks of the Hawkesbury River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planning began for the freeway in the 1950s, with the aim of providing a high-speed replacement to a section of the Pacific Highway which was built in the 1920s and was struggling to cope with the increased traffic volume. Furthermore it was planned that the freeway would connect to freeway systems being proposed for both Sydney and Newcastle, providing a city-to-city freeway link.&lt;br/&gt;However, due to several reasons the goal and route of the freeway changed significantly so that today it serves to bypass Newcastle rather than go into it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freemans Drive:&lt;br/&gt;General information:&lt;br/&gt;Freemans Drive runs from the Morisset round-a-bout to the Freemans Waterhole round-a-bout. It is 19.1km's in length and takes approximately 17 minutes to drive it full length.&lt;br/&gt;Freemans Drive cross the path of the F3 Freeway three times - one under and twice over.&lt;br/&gt;Freemans Drive passes through the town of Cooranbong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freemans Drive is a sealed road in New South Wales. It goes from Morisset to near Ryhope.&lt;br/&gt;Freemans Drive's highest elevation along its length is 61.3m and the lowest point is at 4.85m.&lt;br/&gt;For cyclists and those towing caravans, boats or heavy loads Freemans Drive is undulating along its 15.6 km length, with about 510 m that is steeper in incline/grade than 5%. The total ascent / descent along the length of Freemans Drive is 117 m / 154 m. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was previously published on www.geocaching.com on 27 Jun 2011, so has been found before under that listing.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located near the Martinsville Cricket Oval, tennis courts and the Martinsville Rural/Bush Fire Brigade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Martinsville, NSW&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Name Origin:&lt;br/&gt;William and Sarah Martin were the earliest known settlers in the area and in the early 1890's a meeting of local citizens adopted the name in their honour. By the I January 1894 the local post office had also adopted the name. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early Land Grants:&lt;br/&gt;Portion 37, Parish of Coorumbung, Thomas Moore, granted 60 acres, on 8/4/1834. Moore's grant was near the junction of Dora and Deep Creeks. Portion 10, Owen Beardmore, granted 100 acres in May 1854. This portion adjoined that of Thomas Moore. The Martin family purchased a large tract of timbered country from the Crown between 1865 and 1875. In 1877 Sydney Dodds purchased the 60 acres that had originally been a grant to Thomas Moore. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early Settlers:&lt;br/&gt;William Martin a timber getter and his wife Sarah with their children were the first settlers. They originally came from Ireland, and settled in the area sometime between 1861 and 1866. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other settlers followed the Martins but no real community emerged until after 1875. About then Sydney Dodds settled and took up farming. Others to settle at the same time were George Hadlow, James Maher and John Edgtton, the latter two being sawyers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early Industries:&lt;br/&gt;Martinsville was founded on the timber industry. During the 1880's many men were employed in the industry with bullock teams carrying logs to the large saw mills at Cooranbong. Only small saw mills existed at Martinsville. Bamiers' Mill was at the top of Mount Falk, Mullards' at the foot of the Wattagan Road and Espleys' near the crossing of Blarney Grove Creek. Later fanning became predominant including dairying and citrus growing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First Post Office:&lt;br/&gt;Opened I November 1889, with the name of 'Dora Creek'. This office was renamed 'Brush' on 15 December 1892 and 'Martinsville' on I January 1894. It closed on 30 January 1965. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First School:&lt;br/&gt;Opened in December 1878 as Deep Creek Provisional School by Sydney Dodds on part of his land. His position as a teacher was confirmed in December 1878 by the Department of Public Instruction. In May 1881 Dodds transferred to a school in Newcastle and Miss Gleeson replaced him, remaining in the position for 8 years. It became a public school in October 1879. The school closed about 1974 due to insufficient numbers of pupils. The school was called 'Deep Creek' until 1883, and 'Dora Creek' until February 1894. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Town:&lt;br/&gt;First Church: The original &quot;Union Church&quot; was erected about the same time as the post office was established. It was a meeting place for many denominations until it was pulled down in 1924. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was previously published on www.geocaching.com on 22 Nov 2010, so has been found before under that listing.

Demolition was due to commence within days to make room for a new concrete structure. Guessing that these particular bats were large-footed bats (Myotis adversus), a threatened species, I quickly alerted environmental staff at the local city council in Lake Macquarie. &lt;br/&gt;Sure enough, an initial inspection revealed that this represented the first known roost of large-footed bats in the Lake Macquarie area. From my point of view, the discovery was very exciting, but for the city council and their bridge construction company, it presented unforeseen obstacles. I developed a plan allowing the bridge to be replaced with minimal disturbance to the bat colony, and it was approved by both the city council and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. My subsequent role was to ensure the bats were safely excluded from the bridge and to attempt to re-establish their roosts within the new structure. &lt;br/&gt;As demolition began, we progressively excluded the entire colony of bats from the cracks in the timbers where they roosted. Plastic flaps were placed over roost entrances so that the bats exiting at dusk were unable to re-enter after feeding. Using scaffolding beneath the bridge, I crawled around on the narrow timber planks, precariously suspended over a murky creek, placing traps at the roost entrances. The bats I caught were banded, and some individuals were fitted with radio transmitters. By tracking the transmitter signals, we discovered an alternative roosting site among the concrete beams of a canal supplying water to a power station about 2 1/2 miles (4 km) away. &lt;br/&gt;When the new bridge was partially completed, the construction crew moved roost timbers from the old wooden bridge into equivalent positions in the new concrete one. This method of incorporating pieces of the original roost into a new structure may actually be the first of its kind attempted. &lt;br/&gt;We had determined that, prior to the bridge replacement, a population of at least 170 large-footed bats had roosted there. Also, the presence of many juveniles and the discovery that females outnumbered males approximately four to one suggested the bridge had been a maternity roost. Following completion of the new bridge, the Lake Macquarie City Council funded a monitoring program, and we have verified that large-footed bats have re-established roosts within the old timbers and are breeding successfully. Apparently the bats recognized their home! &lt;br/&gt;Glenn and Margaret Hoye have researched bats throughout Australia for the past 20 years. They survey, research, and advise on bat-related issues through their company, Fly By Night Bat Surveys. &lt;br/&gt;The success of this project suggests that the strategy of fitting old roost elements into new structures could be applied in many similar situations. Anyone attempting this, however, should be aware of climatic differences and other changes that could make the habitat unacceptable to the bats. Prior to removal, one should note the position, aspect, height, temperature, and sun exposure of roost elements then take care to re-install them into equivalent positions and conditions in the replacement structure. &lt;br/&gt;________________________________________&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to bridges, the large-footed bat’s most common roosts include caves, mines, tunnels, tree hollows, buildings, and dense foliage in rain forest areas. This species is seldom found far from bodies of water, over which it hunts for insects and small fish. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Piers for the new bridge were installed while the original timber bridge was systematically removed. Scaffolding used to reach the bat roosts is visible under the bridge. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Timbers from the old bridge were carefully placed in equivalent positions in the new structure, and the city council marked the significance of the roost with a plaque. (“Fishing bat” is a common local name for the species.) </groundspeak:long_description>

Maybe best taken as a 'drive by' as it is just off the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The cache is a small metal tin, just big enough to fit a half a pencil, a logbook and one kid's toy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Make sure you take time to walk/bike around the many paths in this area, and visit the many parks. It seems Collingwood Park is a cache hiders and finders heaven.</groundspeak:long_description>

The traditional Girls Walk – So named because female and male students were directed to use separate walking tracks in earlier chapters of Avondale College’s history – formed the original entrance to Avondale from Avondale Rd.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very easy going walking track 2.2 km long. The cache is about at the half way mark near where Avondale Rd used to connect to the track and also near what used to be a BMX dirt track. (It has been dismantled with fallen trees covering parts of the track to it can no longer be used. Probably for OHS issues.)</groundspeak:long_description>

BYO writing device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‘Cooranbong’ is from an Aboriginal word meaning rocky bottom creek or water over rocks. The name was officially adopted with the opening of the Cooranbong Post&lt;br/&gt;office in 1866.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cooranbong was an important river port with up to ten ships trading here regularly for timber and agricultural produce. The town had a courthouse, shops, hotels and a ship yard. When the northern railway was coming, it was expected to pass through Cooranbong with a branch line to Newcastle and the main line to pass under the Gap as it went further north. The town’s people saw the town as the administration centre of the south. But the line was eventually built through Morisset and over Dora Creek. This prevented the sailing ships from coming up the river and Cooranbong rapidly went into decline dropping the population from 700 to less than 200 in five years. About that time the Adventists arrived and moved the town a mile to the east where the town center is today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

He was followed in 1889 by G.H. Manson. On 16 November 1898 its status was raised to that of an official Post office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Lieut-colonel James Thomas Morisset who was Commandant of Newcastle from 1818-1823. In April 1823 he made the first overland journey from Newcastle to Sydney and camped overnight under a tree on the western side of Lake Macquarie; the tree was situated just east of the present Morisset railway station, and is marked as a historic tree. However, there is also a possibility that it was named after his son E.N.V. Morisset who was superintendent of police at Bathurst, Maitland and Goulburn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first two industries established were sawmilling, and the building and functioning of the railway. The sawmills were situated near the railway to make transport easier. Logs were brought by bullock dray from a wide area, many from the Wattagan mountains. In 1909 the weekly output of one mill included:2000 tool handles, 8000 spokes, 100 pairs of rims, 200 pairs of shafts and 200 pairs of naves for wheels. Many of these were exported to New Zealand</groundspeak:long_description>

In 1791, Schaeffer was granted 140 acres of land in this area. Along with four convicts, he cleared the land of trees and rocks and planted grape vines, producing 'ninety gallons of wine in about two years'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today the creek is filled with weeds such as lantana and nasturtiums, but local groups and Parramatta council are slowly winning the war, replacing the area with native plants.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I saw this one here while I was working in the area. After about 30mins trying to find a place to walk in from in the side sts. I then found park and a path that looked like it would take me in from Crowgey St. This path was full of lizards and windy all the way in with a creek crossing as well. GZ came up at a brief 7 min. run /walk in. Found the likely spot and found that I was FTF. SL and took coins. Left TB. however my Munzee app was not working and would not let me sign in so I took a pic of it and will try later.Thanks for a great cache hide and walk. Never been here so I enjoyed the history.Rntd safe.

The surface area of the lake is 10km2 with a current storage of 450ML.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lake has been a relaxation area for many decades - being a popular swimming spot in the 1920s and 30s. Pollution from urban runoff meant the lake was no longer safe to swim in. However, recent tests have now cleared it for public use again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This geocache is located close to the shore of the lake, opposite another one of my geocaches - Lilypad lookout (GC2K2RM). You'll also be rewarded with a Munzee that is hidden in the container.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The park is only open from 6:30 am until 5:30 pm (7:30 pm during Daylight Saving). Please don't attempt the cache outside of these hours.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Trivial Trek&quot; series, is loosely based on a family board
game of a similar name.&lt;/p&gt;
The questions in this second series are from the &quot;Family Edition&quot;,
so are a little easier than those on the neighbouring &quot;Trivial
Trail&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To succeed with this game you will firstly have to seek and find
the following six caches.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Trivial Trek (Geography)&lt;br /&gt;
Trivial Trek (Entertainment).&lt;br /&gt;
Trivial Trek (History).&lt;br /&gt;
Trivial Trek (Art &amp;
Literature).&lt;br /&gt;
Trivial Trek (Science &amp;
Nature).&lt;br /&gt;
Trivial Trek (Sport &amp;
Leisure).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These initial six Caches are Eclipse tins containing a log and a
pencil but also a general knowledge question based on the category
in it's title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have the correct answers to all six of the questions,
you will be able to calculate the coordinates of the final and
winning Unknown Cache, &lt;strong&gt;Trivial Trophy II&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the physical Caches are colour coded to match the original
board game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Caches are all located on an easily accessible part of the
Yaberoo Budjarra trail, which will now form a circular walk linking
up with a &quot;Trivial Trail&quot; in the Nerrabup National Park and return
you to Burns Beach Road&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Cache is located within a few metres of the track, so very
little bush bashing is required, but again each hide will offer a
slightly different challenge to the seeker.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

similar name. It continues on from the &quot;Trivial Trail&quot; and forms a
circular Geocache walk, returning you to Burns Beach Road.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The Cache is not at the above coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; To succeed with this Cache you must have already have found all six
Caches that are associated with the series and correctly answered
all the questions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You must now use your the digits from your answers from each
question to find the correct coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&amp; B&lt;br /&gt;
GC2QMYT Trivial Trek (Entertainment) Answer = C
&amp; D&lt;br /&gt;
GC2QMZM Trivial Trek (History) Answer = E
&amp; F&lt;br /&gt;
GC2QMZW Trivial Trek (Art &amp; Literature)

The coordinates for this 'Winning Cache&quot; are.....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
S 31.43. NOP.&lt;br /&gt;
E 115.45 QRS.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
N= G - J&lt;br /&gt;
O= F - C&lt;br /&gt;
P= A - E&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Q= I + B&lt;br /&gt;
R= D - H&lt;br /&gt;
S= K - B&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The container is a Colour co-ordinated Medium Ammo Can which on its
launch contains, a small gift for the FTF, some trackables and of
course the mandatory log and pencils.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All questions &amp; answers are taken directly from the board game,
so any disputes please speak to Hasbro Games, not me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions are general knowledge, but it still may help some
to carry a web enabled smart phone, just to &quot;check&quot; your answers of
course!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check your final coords for this puzzle on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=9280cbd2b37c01babe50afaa2a86d9f1&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=47433254464450&amp;amp;name=5472697669616c2054726f706879204949&quot;&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Trivial Trek&quot; series, is based on a family board game of a
similar name.&lt;/p&gt;
The questions and the Cache hides in this second series are from
the &quot;Family Edition&quot;, so are a little easier than those on the
neighbouring &quot;Trivial Trail&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To succeed with this game you will have to seek and find the
following six caches.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Trivial Trek (Geography)&lt;br /&gt;
Trivial Trek (Entertainment).&lt;br /&gt;
Trivial Trek (History).&lt;br /&gt;
Trivial Trek (Art &amp;
Literature).&lt;br /&gt;
Trivial Trek (Science &amp;
Nature).&lt;br /&gt;
Trivial Trek (Sport &amp;
Leisure).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These initial six Caches are Eclipse tins containing a log and a
pencil but also a general knowledge question based on the category
in it's title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have the correct answers to all six of the questions,
you wil be able to calculate the coordinates of the final and
winning Unknown Cache, &lt;strong&gt;Trivial Trophy II&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the physical Caches are colour coded to match the original
board game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Caches are all located on an easily accessible part of the
Yaberoo Budjarra trail, which will now form a circular walk linking
up with a &quot;Trivial Trail&quot; in the Neerabup National Park and return
you to Burns beach Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Cache is located within a few metres of the track, so very
little bush bashing is required, but again each hide will offer a
slightly different challenge to the seeker.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The Cache is not at the above coordinates.
&lt;p&gt;To succeed with this Cache you must have already have found all
six Caches that are associated with the series and correctly
answered all the questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You must now use your two digit answers from each question to find
the correct coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
GC2QMV2 Trivial Trail (Geography) Answer = A
&amp; B&lt;br /&gt;
GC2QMYT Trivial Trail (Entertainment) Answer = C
&amp; D&lt;br /&gt;
GC2QMZM Trivial Trail (History) Answer = E
&amp; F&lt;br /&gt;
GC2QMZW Trivial Trail (Art &amp; Literature)
Answer = G &amp; H&lt;br /&gt;
GC2QN06 Trivial Trail (Science &amp; Nature)
Answer = I &amp; J&lt;br /&gt;
GCQN0D Trivial Trail (Sport &amp; Liesure)
Answer = K &amp; L&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The coordinates for this 'Winning Cache&quot; are.....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
S 31.42. NOP.&lt;br /&gt;
E 115.45 QRS.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
N= J - D&lt;br /&gt;
O= E - F&lt;br /&gt;
P= G + H&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Q= K + L&lt;br /&gt;
R= A + I + H&lt;br /&gt;
S= B - C - K&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The container is a Colour co-ordinated Medium Ammo Can, (see
images) and on its launch contains a few goodies and swaps, some
trackables, and of course the mandatory log and pencils.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All questions &amp; answers are taken directly from the board game,
so any disputes please speak to Hasbro Games, not me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 72 year old dad answered 5 out of 6 questions correctly just
by using his noodle....but it may help some to carry a smart phone
that uses Google !!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations, as ever, go to CHWILIWR for completing the trail
and then being the FTF for &quot;Trivial Trophy&quot;. Congrats also to
BLINGG for being FTF for the majority of the other Caches on the
&quot;Trivial Trail&quot;and 2TF the Trivial Trophy&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(NB. My thanks go to team PRIMREY, who kindly donated this Ammo Can
to me prior to their move overseas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: TT2QN0R - Trivial Trophy&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;These initial six Caches are Eclipse tins containing a log and a
pencil but also a general knowledge question based on the category
in it's title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have the correct answers to all six of the questions,
you will be able to calculate the coordinates of the final and
winning &quot;Mystery Cache&quot;, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Trivial Trophy II&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the physical Caches are colour coded to match the original
board game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Caches are all located on an easily accessible part of the
Yaberoo Budjarra trail, which will now form a circular walk linking
up with a &quot;Trivial Trail&quot; in the Neerabup National Parkand
returning you to Burns brach Road&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Cache is located within a few metres of the track, so very
little bush bashing is required, but again each hide will offer a
slightly different challenge to the seeker.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It's a micro and blends into its surroundings quite well, but even so  should be a quick grab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please replace Cache in the exact spot where you found it, I know all Cache listings say it, but its especially important with this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can walk and cycle to the Cache easily, however if you are driving there is free parking 150 meters north at the local shops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring a pen.

BBQ, play in the park, but remember to keep an eye out and listen
very carefully for the unique call of the &quot;Chirping Chicken&quot;.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This bird is so rare, we believe this location was the very first
recorded sighting in Western Australia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So to find this unusual species and more importantly to hear its
unique call, just ensure you are standing in the right spot, be
very still, quiet and patient.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you are lucky you will be rewarded with a friendly greeting from
the Chicken, which will include the location of its secret nest
where the Cache is hidden&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next, enjoy a light stroll or cycle along the dual purpose pathway,
its about 1.5 mi until you reach the sacred spot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On arrival, you will need to look for a cylindrical container,
about 10 inches in length, holding the log, pencil and a few small
items of Chicken treasure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's in plain view, but in a discreet position as the Chicken does
not welcome uninvited visitors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please take care to replace the item, in just the same place as you
found it, otherwise the Chicken may not share its secret with
anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;

All you have to do is simply count how many times each of the following letters appear on the sign post !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;J,M,S,V,W,X,Y's  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have an answer for each letter you will then need to complete the very simple sums below to&lt;br/&gt;seek the cache at the following coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S 31 48.

In the late 1990's it was remade into a traditional cartoon for new generations of kids.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captain Horatio Pugwash – sails the high seas in his ship called the Black Pig, ably assisted by cabin boy Tom, pirates Willy and Barnabas, and Master Mate. His mortal enemy is Cut-Throat Jake, captain of the Flying Dustman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captain Pugwash is renowned for his exclamations and often speaks in alliterations..... so to find the coords for this cache you are going to have to complete the following famous &quot;Pugwashisms&quot;....     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cache will be found at the following coords:&lt;br/&gt;S31 46.UVW   E 115 43 XYZ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U  = &quot; Dolloping   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _&quot; (1st missing letter) &lt;br/&gt;V  = &quot; Suffering   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ &quot; (2nd missing letter)   &lt;br/&gt;W = &quot; Staggering _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _&quot; (10th missing letter)  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X= Nautical _ _ _ _ _ _ _ &quot; (2nd missing letter)    &lt;br/&gt;Y= Lolloping _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ &quot; (4th missing letter)      &lt;br/&gt;Z= Scuttling _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _&quot; (8th missing letter)      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have found the missing letters simply convert the letters into numbers using A=1 B=2 etc.  You will then have the coords to start your seaward voyage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for the Cache you are looking for a small container, stored in a watertight pouch which has a log and a pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However you will not need to go excavating or climbing over the fence line.&lt;br/&gt;it is within arms reach at a sensible hieght.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extreme Stealth will be required here, as the area is very popular with runners/cyclists and dog walkers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avast, me harties !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: PP2AQ8G - Pugwash Paradox&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Cache Final Location.</groundspeak:long_description>

Walk to each marker and repeat the process and you will gradually make your way towards the Cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At your 17th marker, you will find a set of final coords.  You will need to enter these coords into your GPS to find the final Cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cache location is also marked with twin fire tacks, so you will be assured your GPS has brought you to the correct final location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've made the Cache a very generous size so&lt;br/&gt;it will be very easy to find in the dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will find the traditional &quot;log book and pencil&quot; (well not so traditional actually), a bag for trackables and a second bag for swappables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've noticed a common theme, in nearly all Caches I've found. They have all contained balls..so I thought I would put out a big cache where all the balls can get together, so please bring along any number of balls, whether they be golf, snooker, bouncy, marbles or whatever...and if you so wish, swap it for another to take home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All types of Travel Bugs and Coins are most welcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FT2C2XK - Coords for final cache&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;location of final coords.&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: SS2C2XK - Secluded Spheres V2&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Final Cache Location.</groundspeak:long_description>

You Have Been Warned !!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Cache, currently contains just a log  sheet, I still haven't got round to making mini pencils..but will do so in due course, so please bring your own until then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will only have to venture a little way off the path to find it, so please don't go rummaging to far into the undergrowth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is parking on the verge a few hundred yards North of the Cache, if required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;The Machman&quot;</groundspeak:long_description>

I would also suggest you have sensible sturdy footwear and BYOP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At GZ you are offered panoramic views over the Indian Ocean, so take a drink, sit on the rocks and watch the ocean go by.</groundspeak:long_description>

The walk is mostly easy terrain on a ready made path in the park. I think if you make the trip you'll think the views at GZ worth it. The container is large enough to take bigger swaps you might not get in some caches. Enjoy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an information board and tables if you wish to have a picnic and toilet facility (near parking area NOT near cache.) There's a number of different walks around the area plus another good cache GCMJ43 at a cool location. Please enjoy the hunt and don't forget to wave! Please post a photo if you wish.

We have done this walk twice and managed to see a kangaroo and joey, an echidna, a snake and plenty of water birds. The walk is relatively easy this a few minor up and downs. A parking area and toilet is available nearby. Please bring binoculars if available. Enjoy the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have the time to spare there are a few plaques near car park and an optional walk ( away from getting cache ) towards the beach that may be worth a look. There is sometimes an information sheet available with points of interest along the walk to GZ supplied by parks Victoria. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Container is small with log book, pen and small swaps.

I'm glad he didn't spook as Pam walked past him or he would have run straight into me.Then after seeing the birds we found the cache and did out business.On the way back I spotted a large echidna in the bush beside the track.Not a bad afternoons spotting.Thanks for enhancing our visit here.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Frank Forde was Prime Minister for only eight days, 6–13 July
1945, after the death of John Curtin. With unswerving loyalty to
his party and its leadership, Forde was a federal parliamentarian
for 24 years. For 14 years he was deputy leader of the federal
parliamentary Labor Party, and for nine of those years was deputy
Leader of the Opposition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Arthur Calwell on an inspection tour with senior Army officers in
1944.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: M4267, 10&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Forde was Minister for Trade and Customs in 1931, during the
government of James Scullin, and Minister for the Army from 1941 to
1946, during the governments of John Curtin and Ben Chifley. He
lost his seat in the 1946 election.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After leaving federal politics, Forde served as Australian High
Commissioner in Ottawa, Canada until 1954. He then returned to
Queensland State politics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Frank Forde died on 28 January 1983 at the age of 92, the
longest-lived of Australia’s Prime Ministers.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Australia’s eighth Prime Minister is also the second
youngest. He was a decorated war hero before he became Prime
Minister in 1923. Stanley Melbourne Bruce was perfectly suited to
the elegance and confidence of his period – the
‘Roaring Twenties’.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The Prime Minister (front centre) and Ethel Bruce (front right)
welcome the Duke and Duchess of York (front left and front centre),
arriving at Canberra’s tiny railway station for the
celebration of the opening of Parliament House Canberra in May
1927.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A6180, 20/5/74/41&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In office for six years, his government sought management of
imperial trade in Australia’s interests and a voice for
Australia in shaping British foreign policy. His uncompromising
stand on industrial relations brought down his government in
1929.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ethel Bruce was as stylish and dignified a figure as her husband.
She fulfilled her official tasks with aplomb, both at home and
abroad. As the first tenants of the official prime ministerial
residence in the new capital city, the Bruces left their mark on
the form and style of The Lodge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SM Bruce became Australia’s longest-serving High Commissioner
in London and his work at the League of Nations laid the
foundations of enduring international agencies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The highest of the many official honours he earned was his peerage
and from 1947 he was titled Lord Bruce of Melbourne. His chosen
coat of arms features two Australian lyrebirds and the motto
‘We have been faithful’.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Arthur Fadden was Prime Minister from 29 August to 7 October 1941.
As well as his ‘40 days and 40 nights’ in office, he
was acting Prime Minister for periods totalling nearly two years
during his coalition governments with Prime Minister Robert
Menzies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
A Cabinet vote made the new Country Party leader, Arthur Fadden,
the man sworn in as Prime Minister on 29 August 1941.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A6180, 4/2/77/30&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A Queenslander, Fadden was a member of the House of Representatives
for 22 years, from 1936 to 1958, and leader of the Country Party
for 17 years, from 1941 to 1958. As Treasurer in 1940–41 and
from 1949 to 1958, he presented a record 11 budgets, including a
‘horror budget’ in 1951.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Described as amiable and a great conversationalist and
story-teller, Fadden enjoyed good working relationships with his
colleagues and staff throughout his long parliamentary career. He
retired from parliament in 1958, and died on 21 April 1973.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On 10 January 1968, John Gorton became the 19th Prime Minister in
unusual circumstances. He was elected Liberal Party leader to
replace Harold Holt, who had disappeared the previous month while
swimming off the Victorian coast, and was presumed dead. Gorton
also left the job in unusual circumstances – he declared
himself out of office after a tied party vote of confidence in his
leadership on 10 March 1971.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
A determined non-conformist and a passionate Australian
nationalist, Gorton wanted to turn thinking in the party, and in
the nation, in a more independent direction.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Paul Keating was Australia’s 24th Prime Minister and held
office from 20 December 1991 to 11 March 1996.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Paul Keating at the APEC meeting in Bogor, Indonesia in November
1994 with heads of government Jim Bolger (New Zealand), Julius Chan
(Papua New Guinea), Mahathir Mohamad (Malaysia), Jiang Zemin
(People's Republic of China) and Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle (Chile).

&lt;br /&gt;
The Keating government pursued economic growth as a precondition
for improving the daily lives of all Australians. Keating’s
initiatives as Prime Minister included the passage of Indigenous
land rights legislation, encouraging the process of reconciliation
between Aboriginal and other Australians, and supporting the
writing of a ‘new national story’ that acknowledged the
conquest and capture of the continent from Indigenous peoples. The
government also established the Republican Advisory Committee to
facilitate debate on the possibility of an Australian republic,
supported reform of vocational education and training, and
introduced policies encouraging economic competitiveness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Treasurer and as Prime Minister, Paul Keating transformed
Australia’s financial system and economy. As Treasurer from
1983 to 1991 in the government of Bob Hawke, Paul Keating was the
architect of Australia’s economic deregulation. The
government floated the Australian dollar and allowed foreign banks
to operate in Australia from 1983.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Paul Keating first entered parliament when he won the House of
Representatives seat of Blaxland in 1969. He was only 25 years old,
making him one of the youngest federal parliamentarians.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Kevin Rudd is Australia’s 26th Prime Minister and the 19th
Leader of the Australian Labor Party. He came to office on 3
December 2007.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kevin Rudd departed from firm Labor Party practice when he selected
his own ministers – he was the first Labor Prime Minister to
break the traditional role of the Caucus. There are 42 members of
the Rudd government executive, 20 Cabinet members, 10 other
ministers and 12 parliamentary secretaries. Kevin Rudd is also the
first Australian Prime Minister to appoint a female deputy, Julia
Gillard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The historic highlight of his first months in office, however, was
his apology to Indigenous people in the opening week of
Australia’s 42nd parliament.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Kevin Rudd, 2007.&lt;br /&gt;
ALP National Secretariat&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Prime Minister followed the lead of all Australian post-war
prime ministers and visited countries considered significant in
Australia’s international and trade relations. With the issue
of climate change at the forefront, Kevin Rudd’s first visit
abroad was to Indonesia for a conference on climate change where,
on behalf of the Australian Government, he ratified the Kyoto
Protocol. In his first months in office Kevin Rudd also visited
China, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, East Timor,
Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At home, the new government gave immediate priority to its key
policy areas of education, employment and health, and introduced
legislation to reverse some of the major workplace reforms of the
Howard government.&lt;br /&gt;
But a series of political mistakes - including ditching the
emissions trading scheme and rolling out a new 40 per cent &quot;super&quot;
profits take on the mining sector - saw a collapse in Mr Rudd's and
Labor's vote.&lt;br /&gt;
On June 24, 2010, when a spil in the Leadership of the Labour Party
occured. Ms Gillard's victory was assured after most of the Rudd
Government ministers - including Treasurer Wayne Swan - decided to
oust Mr Rudd as the Labor leader. A confident Ms Gillard, flanked
by the Treasurer who will become her deputy, walked into the Caucus
meeting, confident they had the numbers to defeat Mr Rudd. At
9.36am, Caucus spokesman and NSW Senator Michael Forshaw emerged to
declare Ms Gillard would become Australia's next Prime Minister.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Robert Gordon Menzies was Australia’s longest serving Prime
Minister. He held the office twice, from 1939 to 1941 and from 1949
to 1966. Altogether he was Prime Minister for over 18 years –
still the record term for an Australian Prime Minister.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Prime Minister Robert Menzies escorts Queen Elizabeth II at the
State banquet at Parliament House, Canberra on 16 February 1954,
with Pattie Menzies and the Duke of Edinburgh following.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A1773, RV490&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Born into humble circumstances, Menzies obtained a first-class
secondary and university education by winning a series of
scholarships. He established himself as one of Australia’s
leading constitutional lawyers, then entered the Victorian
parliament in 1928. He won a seat in the federal parliament in 1934
and served as Attorney-General and Minister for Industry in the
United Australia Party government of Joseph Lyons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Menzies was Prime Minister when World War II began in 1939. In 1941
he lost the confidence of members of Cabinet and his party and was
forced to resign. As an Opposition backbencher during the war
years, he helped create the Liberal Party and became Leader of the
Opposition in 1946. At the 1949 federal election, he defeated Ben
Chifley’s Labor Party and once again became Australia’s
Prime Minister.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Menzies’ second period as Prime Minister laid the foundations
for 22 consecutive years in government for the
Liberal–Country Party Coalition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Menzies was often characterised as an extreme monarchist and
‘British to his bootstraps’, but as Prime Minister he
maintained Australia’s strong defence alliance with the
United States. During his second period in office the ANZUS and
SEATO treaties were signed, Australian troops were sent to support
US-led forces in Korea, and Australia made its first commitment of
combat forces to Vietnam.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Menzies retired as Prime Minister and from parliament in 1966.
Knighted in 1963, he was further honoured in 1965 by being
appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque
Ports.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Robert Gordon Menzies died on 15 May 1978.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Malcolm Fraser was Australia’s 22nd Prime Minister. He began
his term as caretaker Prime Minister on 11 November 1975, after
Governor-General Sir John Kerr dismissed Gough Whitlam’s
Labor government. The Fraser Coalition government was returned with
the largest landslide of any federal election a month later, and
remained in office until 1983. Nonetheless, the constitutional
crisis made its beginning controversial and marked Fraser’s
prime ministership.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Malcolm Fraser emerges from Parliament House on 11 November 1975,
after announcing that Governor-General Sir John Kerr had appointed
him caretaker Prime Minister.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A6180, 13/11/75/31&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Malcolm Fraser had an important influence on the changing relations
of countries within the British Commonwealth, and on shaping
Australia’s relations with the countries of East and
Southeast Asia. Though economic rationalism was introduced in
policy debate during his term of office, his government reflected
more traditional principles in financial management and fiscal
policy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before becoming Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser had spent ten years
as a backbencher in the government of Robert Menzies. He became
Minister for the Army in 1966, under Harold Holt, and was also a
minister in the governments of John Gorton and William
McMahon.</groundspeak:long_description>

Building on his success as trade union president, Hawke established

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Ben Chifley was Australia’s 16th Prime Minister. A railway
engine driver in his home town of Bathurst, New South Wales, Ben
Chifley became one of the most highly regarded of Australia’s
Prime Ministers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Ben Chifley, briefly in London for an Imperial Conference in April
1946, enjoys the spring sunshine in Kew Gardens with his head of
Postwar Reconstruction, HC Coombs.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: M2153, 6/1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First elected to a Labor seat in parliament in 1928, Chifley lost
his seat in 1931, but was re-elected in 1940. Chifley was Treasurer
in the Curtin Labor government in 1941 and was a prime mover of the
economic organisation for the war. Chifley was elected leader of
the Labor Party after John Curtin died in July 1945.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ben Chifley was a committed centralist. As Prime Minister he
introduced national projects such as the Snowy Mountains
hydro-electric scheme and the assisted immigration program. He also
pushed through legislation that enabled the Commonwealth to become
the collector of income tax and sought nationalisation of the
private banks so that the federal government could have more
control over the economy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chifley lost office at the 1949 federal election, after his attempt
to nationalise the banks. In Opposition, Chifley was against RG
Menzies’ proposal to ban the Communist Party – a major
issue at the federal election of April 1951. Two months after the
Labor Party was again defeated, Ben Chifley died on 13 June
1951.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">John McEwen was Prime Minister from 19 December 1967 to 10 January
1968 following the death of Harold Holt. His term as Prime Minister
came near the end of his 37 years in parliament.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The moment of office: John McEwen is sworn in by Governor-General
Lord Casey at Yarralumla on 19 December 1967.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A1200, L68079&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though only briefly Prime Minister, McEwen served as deputy Prime
Minister for twelve years, in the governments of Robert Menzies,
Harold Holt and John Gorton. He was acting Prime Minister many
times in the years from 1958 to 1971.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
McEwen held the key ministerial responsibilities of Commerce and
Trade for 20 years from 1949 to 1971. During this time the
portfolio emphasis moved away from agriculture and into the broader
industry area. Though a farmer and Country Party leader, McEwen
also moved the emphasis from low tariffs to protection of
manufacturing industries.</groundspeak:long_description>

January 1966 to 19 December 1967, when he was officially pronounced
dead after drowning at sea.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

visit Australia, and 'First Lady' Ladybird Johnson, in October
1966.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A1200, L59270&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Holt won his first seat in parliament in 1935. He became
Australia's youngest minister in 1939 when Prime Minister Robert
Menzies allocated him a junior role. For three-quarters of his 32
years in parliament, he was on the government benches. His only
period in Opposition was from 1941 to 1949. Holt held the senior
portfolios of Immigration and of Labour and National Service in the
1950s, and became Treasurer in 1958.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the most hard-working of Australia's Cabinet ministers,
after 32 years as a parliamentarian, Harold Holt reached the prime
ministerial office in 1966. The third Prime Minister to die in
office, Harold Holt is widely remembered for the unusual
circumstances of his death while swimming off the Victorian coast
in December 1967.</groundspeak:long_description>

PS - EDIT - The first attempt on this one took us 30 mins for a DNF, we Searched everywherew within 10m of the pole/GZ. NUFFIN!!!!!!! And we scratched around like chooks in the leaf litter too. Can see why the previous people had DNF's - cache creep ???????

Came back the next day, found in a few minutes - fortunately someone else had found it a few hours earlier, and it was now not covered (aka as ridiciously buried !!!!!) and/or cache creep had replaced it to where it belongs - NEAR THE POLE !!!!!!!!!.

Signed log then made it easier for others to find. All good now.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Australia’s 14th Prime Minister is widely regarded as one of
the greatest. John Curtin’s achievement rests on his
leadership of the nation during much of World War II.
Curtin’s rejection of the British strategy for Australian
troops enabled the successful defence of New Guinea. And, in a
remarkable move, he put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of
Australia’s defence forces. Although he had been a strong
opponent of conscription during World War I, as leader during the
1939–45 conflict, Curtin made the decision to send
conscripted troops to serve outside Australia.&lt;br /&gt;

House on 26 March 1942.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A1200, L36449&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Curtin was also intent on ensuring that Australia emerge from the
war free from the unemployment problems of the 1930s. He aimed for
a policy of work for all who wanted it, arguing this could be
achieved in peacetime as it had in war.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John Curtin died in office, on 5 July 1945, just six weeks before
the end of the war in the Pacific.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Australia’s 25th Prime Minister served from 11 March 1996
until 3 December 2007, the second-longest prime ministerial term
after Robert Menzies. When he lost the seat of Bennelong in 2007,
John Howard also became the second Australian prime minister to
lose his seat, the first being Stanley Melbourne Bruce in
1929.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Prime Minister John Howard with Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor
Castle, June 1997.&lt;br /&gt;
AUSPIC&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John Howard entered parliament as the Member for Bennelong in May
1974. After the controversial dismissal of the Whitlam government
in November 1975, he took his first portfolio as Minister for
Business and Consumer Affairs in the Coalition government of
Malcolm Fraser and Doug Anthony. John Howard was then Treasurer
from 1977 until the Fraser government lost office in 1983.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Leader of the Opposition from 1985 to 1989, and again from 1995,
John Howard became Prime Minister following the
Liberal–National Party Coalition’s victory in the 1996
federal election.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Prime Minister, John Howard led a government with a wide reform
agenda, initiated by the sale of Telstra, the nation’s chief
telecommunications carrier. His government achieved a restructuring
of industrial relations, including the introduction of direct
employer–employee enterprise agreements. A key economic
reform was the introduction of a goods and services tax.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In international relations, the government provided support
enabling East Timor to achieve independence and developed an
‘Asia-first, but not Asia only’ diplomacy. After the
terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, DC on 11 September
2001, Australia’s role in international responses to
terrorism was a major element in the foreign and defence policies
of the Howard government.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Gough Whitlam became Australia’s 21st Prime Minister on 5
December 1972. His Labor government, the first after more than two
decades, set out to change Australia through a wide-ranging reform
program. Whitlam’s term abruptly ended when his government
was dismissed by the Governor-General on 11 November 1975.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Whitlam’s lead, participation in international agreements
transformed Australian law and politics.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The public lives of Gough Whitlam and his wife Margaret extend over
half a century. After serving in the Royal Australian Air Force,
Whitlam joined the Australian Labor Party in 1945. He became the
Member for Werriwa in Sydney’s south in 1952, retaining the
seat in 11 more federal elections over the next 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whitlam led the reform of the Labor Party platform during the long
years in Opposition. As Prime Minister he immediately set about
implementing a reform program that included strengthening
Australia’s status by making Queen Elizabeth II Queen of
Australia. His government drew on international agreements to
develop programs on human rights, the environment and
conservation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Margaret Whitlam played an important role as a political and prime
ministerial wife. An outspoken public speaker, broadcaster and
columnist, she accompanied Gough Whitlam on his countless overseas
travels. As a qualified social worker, she was particularly
interested in social conditions. Their public lives have continued
since they left The Lodge in 1975.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
James and Sarah Scullin were given a triumphal welcome when they
arrived in Canberra on 21 October 1929 for the swearing in of the
new Labor government. But two years later, Scullin said his term as
Prime Minister was like a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Prime Minister James Scullin's red hair stood out in the crowd when
he and Sarah Scullin received a rousing welcome at Canberra's
railway station on 21 October 1929.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A3560, 6104&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Australia’s ninth Prime Minister was unlucky in his timing.
The New York Stock Exchange failure – the ‘Wall Street
crash’ – took place in the first week of his
government. He faced the crisis of economic depression by
attempting to manage a failing economy while implementing Labor
reforms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was probably the right moment for a Prime Minister remembered
as ‘a teetotal, non-smoking, budget pruner’ who was
also an honest and stoical man.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Joseph Lyons was Prime Minister for seven years – only a few
days short of matching the then record term of WM Hughes. He was
the first Australian Prime Minister to die in office.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Lyons was a very successful electoral campaigner, with Enid Lyons a
major factor in his winning popularity and appeal. His cautious and
orthodox financial management transformed him from a dissident
Labor minister to a conservative Prime Minister. His Cabinet also
needed careful management. He reshuffled ministries several times
and negotiated a coalition with the Country Party after the 1934
election.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Earle Christmas Grafton Page was Prime Minister for only 20 days,
from 7 April 1939 to 26 April 1939. Page was also deputy Prime
Minister to SM Bruce in 1923–29, and to Joseph Lyons in
1934–39. A founder of the Country Party, Page led the party
in parliament from 1921 to 1939. He is also remembered for his long
term as Minister for Health, from 1949–56, in the government
of Robert Menzies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Though Prime Minister for only three weeks in 1939, Dr Earle Page
was deputy Prime Minister for six years from 1923 to 1929.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A1200, L69705&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Described as ‘a man of boundless energy, fertile in
ideas’, Page spoke at a rapid rate, rarely pausing for
breath. His partnership with the deliberate and measured SM Bruce
was an ideal political combination – particularly for
political cartoonists. During the 1920s, cartoons depicted Bruce as
a dapper gentleman and Page as ‘a rather riotous-looking
lady’.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
William Morris Hughes was Australia’s longest serving Prime
Minister until 1957 when Robert Menzies overtook Hughes’
record term from 1915 to 1923. Hughes’ other record still
stands: no parliamentarian has surpassed his 51 years and 7 months
of continuous service as a member of Australia’s House of
Representatives – from the 1st parliament in 1901 to the 20th
in 1952.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Australian soldiers carry 'the little digger' along George Street,
Sydney in triumph after the Prime Minister returned from the Paris
Peace Conference in 1919.&lt;br /&gt;
MD3449&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before Federation, Hughes had been a Labor member of the New South
Wales parliament from 1894 to 1901. In March 1901 he won a seat in
the first House of Representatives. He served in the Labor Cabinets
of JC Watson and Andrew Fisher. He then replaced Andrew Fisher as
Prime Minister in 1915 and led Australia during World War I.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hughes’ campaign for conscription during the 1914–18
war split the Labor Party and affected political alignment in
Australia for the next half century. After the war, Hughes was
instrumental in the international recognition of Australia as an
independent nation through its membership of the League of
Nations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hughes lost office in February 1923, but served in parliament for
three decades more.</groundspeak:long_description>

Out on a short Caching run with FELIX II, when three new Caches were published, 
so we amended our route and headed straight for this one. 

Straight forward find at GZ..and a bonus to be greeted by an empty logbook.

Thanks also for the FTF prize Loubla , but i'm afraid we left it in the Cache.
Sorry I guess I thought it was for swaps!!!

I did pick up the trackable you left though, which I will move on very shortly.

Slightly confusing because geocaching.com doesn't show any caches at this location - that would because the logbook is supposed to be in a cache in Armadale. It seems a geocaching.com cache that hasn't yet been archived (but is listed as being unavailable) has been recycled to this new location logbook and all. All very confusing.

The logbook should be replaced to reflect this new location and cache and the geocaching.com cache should be archived (or replaced and the logbook from this cache put backk into it).

So I think I'm 2nd to find after Rogue's FTF at its new location.</groundspeak:text>

Coords were good and after a quick look around, I spotted it. Retrieval was a bit more complicated for poor Loki but I got there. The cache had been left open by previous finders (muggle kids by the looks of the log book) and the bag was open so there is a bit of condensation in the bag. I tried to dry it out as best I could and the log is ok. Hopefully that will be enough. A lovely area to visit anyway. Thanks shaddow_hound</groundspeak:text>

So we had to get to the general area then walk it in with a compass the old fashioned way. The relevant landmark seemed pretty clear though a little bit of scrambling was still required (not too sure this is really &quot;handicapped accessible&quot;).  Not exactly sure what 'awesomeness' means on this OC site, but yes, I guess it's kind of awesome. Very pretty area and had a chat with a nice Italian muggle lady about litter and the ducks etc. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

You've got to be quick to get on the first page of the log book in a Hills cache! I must have missed cruiz-n by a few minutes as I was there 1315h with only a dog walker having a quick lunch to be seen. I was sure there was a FTF for me... But 3rd is pretty good too, especially as I remember saying I wasn't interested in FTFs.
GPS fix was OK, had to look around as there are a few candidate hiding spots. In the end it was quite easy access.
I used to go here for scouts a few decades back, but the hall was demolished long ago. The park itself hasn't changed much though.

Thanks for the chupachup too! I probably shouldn't have had it, but it was a nice reward as I drove back to work.

The council have been pretty quick to fix things up though. While your in the area there are a few other caches nearby, take a walk and enjoy the parks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one should be pretty easy to find, although the area is exposed to houses on all sides and there are often kids enjoying the park.

A torch may be helpful at night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We wanted to place a cache in this area for people to come and look at the christmas lights. Paul Tully Ave is usually ablaze with lights on most houses come Christmas, and there is always a lovely festive atmosphere. Bring the kids and spend some time to soak in the atmosphere. If you are lucky you may come accross the Salvation Army band playing Carols, or you may see Santa in his specially decorated Truck, handing out lollies for the kids. If you have the time continue on to Collingwood Park lights up 2 which is in Brenda Ct.&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small round container, which is full of Christmas type swaps, there is a flashing badge for the first to find. &lt;br/&gt;Cache has now been moved to a less exposed spot, but you will still need to take care that you are not seen by the locals.Please cover it well when replacing so the local kids don't muggle it.

I often wonder as I ride my bike over his bridge and past his plaque. So I thought I may as well place a cache here and see if I can find out. a quick google search revealed that he was a Councillor of Ipswich City Council from 22 March 1995 to 4 May 1998. If you want, post any additional information you may have on him as part of your log. Other than that there is not much to do here, so I figured a micro was good enough. There is easy parking nearby, and a house pretty close so stealth may be required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***FTF Honours go to Gunnie69 well done***&lt;br/&gt;***This cache went under water in the flood of 12-1-11*** </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A small traditional cache near a new war memorial&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We decided to place a cache in this area to mark the opening of a war memorial for Redbank. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Memorial was formally opened on the 12th of October 2008. At this time there are no names on the monument but the local RSL will be completing its research and adding names in the coming months. The trees in the park were planted way back in 1995 by students from Redbank State School and are well established.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take care with the geokids as the roads all round can get pretty busy. Also be aware that the residents in the nearby houses seem to take a fair bit of interest in what people are doing in the park, particularly the bloke in the first house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;23rd December 2008. I have had to move the cache to a new spot, it is more exposed to muggles but hopefully harder for them to spot. Take care when searching to not be seen, and make sure you cover it well when you put it back. It seems that there are a few grubs around that leave their rubbish in the park, watch out for broken glass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You’re looking for a small plastic container, that holds a few swaps and a log book. </groundspeak:long_description>

At christmas the street is closed so if you come by car you will have to park down the street and walk the last few hundred metres. A torch may be helpful at night. You could also park at the end of Bailey St and take a short stroll through the bush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We wanted to place a cache in this area for people to come and look at the christmas lights. Brenda Ct is usually ablaze with lights on most houses come Christmas, and there is always a lovely festive atmosphere. Bring the kids and spend some time to soak it in. If you have the time continue on to Collingwood Park lights up 1 which is near Paul Tully Ave. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small round container, which is full of Christmas type swaps, there is a flashing badge for the first to find. Please cover it well when replacing so the local kids don't muggle it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have now moved this cache a bit further from the local muggle population, but you will still need to be careful and pick your time. </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Like Alfred Deakin, Andrew Fisher was Prime Minister three times,
in 1908–09, 1910–13 and 1914–15. Although very
different in background, these two men share the title of founder
of the new nation’s statutory structure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
A studio portrait of the prime ministerial family in 1910 shows
Andrew and Margaret Fisher with Robert (left), Andrew junior,
Henry, Margaret junior, and new baby John. The youngest child,
James, was born in 1912, during Fisher's second term in
office.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: M1406, 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Andrew Fisher’s politics were formed at the coalface. At the
age of ten, he became one of many boys working in Scottish mines.
He was still a coalminer when he migrated to Queensland thirteen
years later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fisher was a founding member of both the Labor Party in Queensland
and of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. He held the House of
Representatives seat of Wide Bay from 1901 until 1915.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Fisher was Prime Minister a number of important projects were
undertaken. The Royal Australian Navy was established, the
Commonwealth Bank was set up, the Northern Territory of South
Australia was transferred to the Commonwealth, the federal capital
of Canberra was founded, and the construction of the
trans-Australian railway line linking Perth to the other capitals
was begun. As well as introducing maternity allowances, Fisher
acknowledged the need for greater political equality for
women.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tall and handsome, Andrew Fisher always retained his distinctive
Scots accent. </groundspeak:long_description>

His contemporaries saw him as honest and trustworthy, but surpassed by Hughes in wit, oratory and brilliance. Fisher's record however reveals a legacy of reforms and national development which lasted beyond the divisions that Hughes left in the Labor Party and in Australia.

&lt;br /&gt;
Joseph Cook was 31 in 1891 when he became Labor member for Hartley
in the New South Wales parliament. Three years later, he was a
minister in George Reid’s Free Trade government. He joined
the first federal parliament in 1901 as a Free Trade member and,
despite being described as having ‘no glow’, held the
federal seat of Parramatta for 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Joseph Cook (second from left) and Mary Cook (right) meet the
people of Parramatta, New South Wales on 2 November 1913, the 125th
anniversary of its foundation.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: M3614, 8&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A man of great determination, he was quick to make the most of two
major re-alignments of political parties in the parliament’s
first two decades. In 1909 he became Defence Minister, after taking
a key role in the fusion of non-Labor parties that year. In 1917,
he led the Liberal Party in a merger to form the Nationalist Party
and served as Navy Minister and as Treasurer in WM Hughes’
government.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joseph Cook was Australia’s sixth Prime Minister, taking
office in 1913 with a Liberal Party majority of only one seat in
the House of Representatives. On leaving politics, Cook served as
Australia’s third High Commissioner in London from 1921 to
1927. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Alfred Deakin, Australia’s second Prime Minister, was also
the fifth and the seventh. He was in office three times in the
first ten years of Federation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Often referred to as ‘the constructor’, his work in
building soundly on the nation’s constitutional foundations
is evident a century later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps the finest speaker in the Australian parliament’s
first century, Deakin’s love of learning informed his
political life. Handsome and intelligent, his courteous manner
earned him the nickname ‘Affable Alfred’.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Prime Minister Alfred Deakin, a notable political orator, was also
a scholar and writer.&lt;br /&gt;

Opposition for six of the first seven years of the Australian
parliament.&lt;br /&gt;

George Reid at his desk, a copy of the progressive United States
journal The World’s Work ready at hand.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A1200, L11178B&lt;br /&gt;

Reid is remembered more for his quirks than his acquittal of the
roles of parliamentary representative, party leader, Prime
Minister, and Australia’s founding High Commissioner in
London.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though he held office for less than a year, Reid’s story
makes him one of the most interesting of Australia’s prime
ministers.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Federation was Edmund Barton’s ‘one great
thing’.One of the key architects of Australia’s
Constitution, Barton became the new nation’s first Prime
Minister at a grand ceremony in Centennial Park, Sydney, on 1
January 1901.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Crowds greet the new Prime Minister Edmund Barton (third from left)
and Governor-General Lord Hopetoun (third from right), as they
leave the rotunda in Sydney's Centennial Park, where the
Commonwealth of Australia was born on 1 January 1901.&lt;br /&gt;
Keenan, JJ, Inaugural Celebrations of the Commonwealth of
Australia, 1904.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Admired for his intellect and calm temper, Barton’s glowing
eyes revealed a keen sense of humour, while his ample girth was
evidence of a love of good food, fine wine and stimulating
conversation. With a rich and engrossing voice, he commanded
authority wherever he spoke.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1903 Barton resigned to become one of the three judges who
founded Australia’s High Court. </groundspeak:long_description>

I was travelling from Victor Harbor to stay with a friend nearby this series, so thought I'd grab a couple of them. I want to do the series in order so this was FIRST of course.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Australia’s first Labor Prime Minister held office for only
four months in 1904, but his imprint on legislation extended
through the first decade of the Australian parliament.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'His Vandyke beard was exquisitely groomed, his abundant brown hair
smoothly brushed. His morning coat and vest set off by dark striped
trousers, beautifully creased ... He was the perfect picture of the
statesman, the leader'. So the new Prime Minister was described (by
WM Hughes) at the first meeting of his Cabinet in 1904.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A1200, L11176A&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John Christian Watson was a founder and one of the principal
shapers of the Australian Labor Party.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The first sitting of the new parliament began on 2 March 1904. Six weeks later, Deakin was unable to gather the numbers for a government amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. He resigned as Prime Minister on 27 April. The same day, the Governor-General, Lord Northcote, summoned Watson to form a government. 

Despite the ability of the new Prime Minister for his role, the government hung on the fine thread because of the lack of a definite majority in the parliament after the second federal election. 

Although Watson sought a double dissolution of parliament so that an election could be held, Lord Northcote, who was the Governor-General, refused. Being unable to command a majority in the House of Representatives, he resigned, and his term in office ended on 18 August 1904 after spending only 4 months in office.

There is rarely water flowing at this waterfall but the view and the journey there is the best part and keep your eye out for the locals on the way.  This hike is not for the faint hearted but once you reach the top the cache is your reward. There is room for small trinkets only. happy hunting. Please cover carefully again. thank you.&lt;br/&gt;You can get to this point from closer locations but the hike from the bottom is well worth the effort.&lt;br/&gt;There is a fee to enter the park in a vehicle however there is a carpark outside for hikers and walkers to use and no fee to enter.&lt;br/&gt;This cache is not accessible by vehicle sorry. &lt;br/&gt;Please be wary of the cliff neaby the cache is not down there...&lt;br/&gt;Do not try this one at night either.</groundspeak:long_description>

I parked on Sheoak road and bushwhacked over, missing the path by a few metres!Don'y try it at night: the cliff is high and the blackberries are thorny!Coordinates have been updated with the owner, so hopefully it is a reasonable estimate of GZ now, I was 30 m off the mark at first.A nice spot to visit.

Looks like there has been some flooding, searched for about an hour but really long grass and fallen branches made it impossible to see some likely spots safely.

Then suddenly, I saw it sitting in the open. It must have become dislodged. It was then I noticed that it wasn't an OC cache, but a GC one. Dual listing! Cool, two for the price of one. I returned the cache to where I think it should be, although the owner may wish to confirm. Nice little location, but what are the pipes for? Water?</groundspeak:text>

Managed to reach from the first step, which was good as i was not so keen on going down too far, however i was determined to find and was considering extending my search under the bridge this time but luckily i didnt have to. lol. Good to see lots of new log sheets to chose from.
We stopped on our way down to Northcliffe for a few days of exploring. Ive even got a made up geocache, or three, to put out here somewhere. Keep a look out in the next week or so to see what pops up! Tftc. :)

previously logged find on GC website, should automatically log find!</groundspeak:text>

Because of the rabbit proof fence, one variety which is no longer in the area, the 'Kangaroo Grass' flourishes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It once covered a large are of the hlls, but the rabbits have completely eradicated it.

&lt;br /&gt;
The rippled structure of the Brachina Formation (or 'slippery dip'
as it is affectionately known) is evidence of formation in a
shallow marine environment which saw frequent wave action.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The asymmetry of the ripples suggests a single-direction 'stream
flow.' Further downstream, there is a parasitic fold (anticline)
which demonstrates compressional forces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Further downstream still, there is another major tectonic structure
- an unconformity. Essentially, the overlaying of the Ulupa
Siltstone on the Brachina Formation is a consequence of silt and
clay being deposited by a lake (which came into being when a river
was dammed by surrounding mountains some 100,000 years
later).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In itself, this means little but the endurance of the lake suggests
a cooler climate and/or higher rainfall rates than at
present.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the location in front of you, a couple of questions:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Question 1.&lt;br /&gt;
How long is the break in time between the two distinct rock
units?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Question 2:&lt;br /&gt;
Looking at the size of the ripples and the direction they are
moving. Was it really wave action or stream movement that caused
these ripples? Or is this caused by folding and uplifting? Let me
know your theory and the reasons for your theory.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And of course the obligatory photo of your GPSr in front of the
formation. Enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Access to the Flinders Ranges National Park is subject to entry
fees. The Geological Trail is accessible to all types of vehicles;
however, the roads can be very rough in spots and at times there
may be some flooding, so it's a good idea to use a vehicle with
good ground clearance.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This was hidden in an area which you can see them &quot;fly&quot; past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Land was first purchased for forestry at Mount Crawford in 1909. Plantings commenced in 1914; two species of eucalypts (Narrow-leaved Ironbark and South Australian Blue gum) and two species of pine (Radiata and Maritime pine).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plantings continued to expand until the 1960?s. Many of the original plantations have since been clear felled and replanted.&lt;br/&gt;Survival rate for the plantings range from 90-98% depending on the season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 70,000 tonnes of timber is harvested annually. Current reserve area is 12,367 hectares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many old gold diggings exist in the Mount Crawford district. John Watts made a rich strike in 1884 in the gully named after him. News of the discovery sparked a major rush in 1885.</groundspeak:long_description>

Today, this obelisk overlooks the Darwin Harbour Wharf area, from
where all men from the Territory left during the First World War.
The high cliffs would have been one of the last familiar sights
those men would have seen as they sailed off to war. It overlooks
the harbour where so many died in the Japanese air attack on 19
February 1942.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most significant of all, it is sited on the spot from which guns of
the 14th Anti-Aircraft Battery went into action, firing, arguably,
the first shots ever in defence of Australia on Australian
soil.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This memorial was the first official monument of any kind erected
in the Northern Territory and funds were subscribed by various
organisations and committees throughout the Territory during 1920.
The initial chosen site for the memorial was Liberty Square, the
area in front of the Administrator’s residence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located outside the War Memorial Fence and is best
accessed by the gate at the southern end of the plaques. Be mindful
that there are cliffs nearby so be careful with small children and
at night time. Stealth may be required as it is a busy spot. You
are looking for a small systema.&lt;br /&gt;

Darwin Fire Station is four kilometres from the Central Business
District in the suburb of Stuart Park and is the Headquarters of
the Northern Territory Fire and Rescue Service (NTFRS).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The three-storey building houses the Fire Service Administration,
Development and Strategy, Special and Technical Operations,
Procurement and Breathing Apparatus/HAZMAT sections and is equipped
with a hot fire training facility and a burn house, a gymnasium and
sauna.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Darwin Emergency Response Area (ERA) extends over 93 square
kilometres and takes in the wharf precinct and harbour, the fuel
depots, nursing homes and multi-level commercial and residential
buildings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fire crews respond mainly to structure and grass fires and
emergencies such as motor vehicle crashes, rescues and hazardous
materials incidents, such as chemical and fuel spills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A series of public awareness and fire education programs are
presented by Darwin Station personnel throughout the community and
the enforcement of fire safety requirements in buildings and a
hazard abatement program to identify areas of concern and potential
risks to public safety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The station is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week by a
minimum of 8 firefighters. There are four Watch Commanders who are
responsible for the manning of all three stations in the Darwin,
Casuarina and Palmerston Districts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The station provides a secure storage area for the fleet of five
operational vehicles which includes a command vehicle, a Tele Squrt
(a main turnout appliance), a skylift and observation platform for
high-rise fire fighting, a rescue tender for motor vehicle
accidents, fire structure salvage and hazardous material
incidents.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The four-wheel drive unit is equipped to fight grass and bush
fires. Darwin station also houses a flat bed truck with a hydraulic
tilt tray to transport equipment to and from the fire ground and
between the stations&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fire vessel ‘Mataranka’ is equipped with fire
fighting pumps, water canon and hoses and is berthed at Darwin Port
where it also doubles as a tug boat.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On May 2, 2000, at approximately midnight, US Eastern savings time, the great blue switch* controlling selective availability was pressed. Twenty-four satellites around the globe processed their new orders, and instantly the accuracy of GPS technology improved tenfold. Tens of thousands of GPS receivers around the world had an instant upgrade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The announcement a day before came as a welcome surprise to everyone who worked with GPS technology. The government had planned to remove selective availability - but had until 2006 to do so. Now, said the White House, anyone could &quot;precisely pinpoint their location or the location of items (such as game) left behind for later recovery.&quot; How right they were.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For GPS enthusiasts, this was definitely a cause for celebration. Internet newsgroups suddenly teemed with ideas about how the technology could be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On May 3, one such enthusiast, Dave Ulmer, a computer consultant, wanted to test the accuracy by hiding a navigational target in the woods. He called the idea the &quot;Great American GPS Stash Hunt&quot; and posted it in an internet GPS users' group. The idea was simple: Hide a container out in the woods and note the coordinates with a GPS unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The finder would then have to locate the container with only the use of his or her GPS receiver. The rules for the finder were simple: &quot;Take some stuff, leave some stuff.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On May 3rd he placed his own container, a black bucket, in the woods near Beaver Creek, Oregon, near Portland. Along with a logbook and pencil, he left various prize items including videos, books, software, and a slingshot. He shared the waypoint of his &quot;stash&quot; with the online community on sci.geo.satellite-nav:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 45° 17.460 W 122° 24.800&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within three days, two different readers read about his stash on the Internet, used their own GPS receivers to find the container, and shared their experiences online. Throughout the next week, others excited by the prospect of hiding and finding stashes began hiding their own containers and posting coordinates. Like many new and innovative ideas on the Internet, the concept spread quickly - but this one required leaving your computer to participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the first month, Mike Teague, the first person to find Ulmer's stash, began gathering the online posts of coordinates around the world and documenting them on his personal home page. The &quot;GPS Stash Hunt&quot; mailing list was created to discuss the emerging activity. Names were even tossed about to replace the name &quot;stash&quot; due to the negative connotations of that name. One such name was &quot;geocaching.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In celebration of the first 10 years of Geocaching, I placed this cache out in the middle of nowhere - but near a lot of other caches.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Lane Cove was hidden on 18-May-2000, so 18-May-2010 will see the
10th anniversary of geocaching in Australia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To celebrate this milestone, this cache has been hidden as one of
many placed to commemorate the occasion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is located in the Frank Smith Park Wetland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Located in Coromandel Valley, Frank Smith Park is a reserve
approximately 12 hectares in size.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The need for a wetland on the site was identified in the initial
management plan for the Patawalonga Catchment Water Management
Board. Community support for the project saw the development of the
Frank Smith Park Wetland Working Group, which included
representatives from:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cities of Onkaparinga and Mitcham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patawalonga Catchment Water Management Board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greening Australia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coromandel Valley Community Association&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coromandel Primary School&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1998, a concept plan for the wetland was developed. Construction
began in December 2000 and was completed in 2001.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose of the wetland is to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improve water quality downstream of the Sturt River&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enhance the existing corridor linking native vegetation along
the river&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;form part of the Sturt River Linear Park, catering for passive
recreation activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide environmental education opportunities by promoting
issues such as water quality, catchment care and biodiversity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The wetland area is made up of three ponds, which sit at different
levels. Each pond was designed to perform a separate function. The
upstream pond forms an inlet zone, the central pond provides rock
islands for bird loafing and the downstream pond forms a mudflat.
Additional features include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boardwalks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a jetty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a lookout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;walking and riding trails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;informal meeting areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
As part of the response to extinguish the fires, the Sturt CFS
Group sent a strike team from Coromandel Valley, Blackwood, Eden
Hills and Belair.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the fire appliances that responded in the strike team were a
couple of geocachers, firesafe and EmZee Wild'rs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And what do cachers do while waiting to get down to firefighting -
they look for a spot to hide a cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finding this cache will allow you to see the scrub that burnt
regenerate over time. Post some photos so that we can see the
transformation.</groundspeak:long_description>

 Historically Sedan was a place to pass through. With no surface
water it was only visited seasonally by Aborigines who lived along
the River Murray or those who lived in the hills. White settlers
lived seasonally in little huts that dotted the countryside. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 They visited in the spring and winter, fed their stock and
returned to the hills when the feed ran out. The Overlanders, using
the ‘Old Sydney Track’, which was the stock route between the
Eastern States and Adelaide, passed through Sedan. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The Hundred of Bagot was proclaimed on the 19th of April 1860. It
was one of the many land releases of the time, relieving pressure
on the Adelaide Plains and Hills for the developing Colony. People
were then able to cultivate the land and settle permanently. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Early settlers were the Germans, seeking religious freedom, from
Silesia and the British who sought better living conditions. The
town is surrounded by dry-stone wall structures built by these
early settlers. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The nearby structure is one of the many structures that still stand
as a testament to the conditions of the early settlers.</groundspeak:long_description>

event and to assimilate into the local environment we all dressed
as Mexicans (if in Mexico do what the Mexicans do). A great time

 On coming home and doing the last of Jardry's Old Mail Road caches
then heading up to Wacky's Jeepers Creepers and then onto the Old
Escort House, it seemed just like doing a Border Run - so just what
was needed for a new cache adjoining the Border Fence and Track -

&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Paringa Bridge was built in 1927 for the railway extension over
the River Murray to Renmark. It is one of South Australia's
significant engineering monuments.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Paringa Bridge was designed so that one of the six steel spans
could be raised to allow the river boats to pass through. It
carried a single-track railway and also catered for road traffic
with cantilevered roadways on both sides of the central
spans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Paringa Bridge is a State Heritage Place protected by the
Heritage Places Act 1993.</groundspeak:long_description>

You can catch Koi, Carp, Redfin and occasionally native fish from this area. You can even take in a wedding party, jogger, barbecue or cyclist or two. I recommend the use of corn or bread for Carp or Koi. The water rats, possums, and swans are friendly.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My first cache ever so it was pretty cool. It was an easy 29km bike ride from Belconnen to get here although bitterly cold at 8am on a Canberra winter's morning. There was plenty of varied bird life including a large Black Comorant standing nearby with wings spread wide to absob the sun's warm rays. This scene made for a great photo that I happily snapped up. Despite the number of joggers around it was a relatively peaceful place and a great spot for fishing, and very easily accessible by all. Thanks ArcherACT - you have inspired me to set up cryptic caches around the lake - hope you get to enjoy them - see ya. PS. I left behind a small butterfly clip for the next person - there was nothing to take but the thrill of find was enough for me.</groundspeak:text>

Some still have building remains, whereas others are long gone with only a fading memory of what once remained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hilgay State School 4281&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Established as full time school due to an increase in population from a sub-division of Hilgay Estate for Soldier Settlement. Hilgay opened on 22nd of November 1925 and closed on 30th of July 1951. The building was removed in 1955 to be used at Chetwynd as a replacement for that school's building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, it proved unsatisfactory, and in 1957 the building was sold for demolition. Nothing remains of Hilgay now other than memories and the tree lined fringe of the school grounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no need to enter the property and you're looking for an Eclipse Mint Tin</groundspeak:long_description>

Out with local cacher today (Honeysucker) to clear up some of these country caches.
A quick search in the most likely spot turned up the cache.

We were actually meant to start the walk here [:I] but short-circuited it a bit and started in the camping area instead.  What a beautiful spot for a cache and it was great to see some water in the river [:D].

As Alsume pulled the cache from its hidey-hole, that gave LinearZZ and us a high DRC rating for this one [8)] [B)].  Oh well, tough [;)].

It is as far as possible away from our sterile world with their safety belts, guardrails, seat cushions and &quot;please wash your hands now&quot; signs. This is how it should be and this is why we love it. Geocaching was in the truest sense of the word inspired by the unforeseen and inhospitable. If the enemy is the unknown, a perfect performance is not a luxury but a necessity. With geocaching, mountaineering and other outdoor activities, you have to face real dangers. Just because your equipment can cope with everything, that does not mean you can too. Have great respect for the environment in which you find yourself. Be prepared for everything!  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;I hope you enjoyed the reading but seriously:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This cache is dangerous and can cause severe injuries or death! Thunderstorms, tidal changes and lack of skills are the greatest threats to your health and safety! DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Facility&lt;br/&gt;The Black Mesa Research Facility is a private research and defence contractor comprised of a massive complex built within Phillip Bay just off the coast of Melbourne. Built deep into the bottom of the ocean, Black Mesa is the site of broad scientific research relating to theoretical, quantum, and particle physics, applied mathematics, robotics, genetics, biotechnology, trans-dimensional travel, teleporting, and other classified subjects.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The submerged character of Black Mesa is due to the shielding nature of vast amount of water on top of it. Although it being close to a major metropolitan area, it is considered to be one of the safest facilities on this planet ... until three hours ago.&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Incident&lt;br/&gt;Three hours ago the Black Mesa relay station in Point Cook lost all communication with the research facility. Only a small data burst was received prior to a massive electromagnetic surge. The data indicates that lambda-experiment resulted in a catastrophic failure of the containment field and therefore opened an uncontrolled trans-dimensional portal. Fortunately the fail-safe system did work and closed the portal after 350 ms with a 32.5 t RDX charge. Most of the blast energy was absorbed by the portal however a small portion did render the research facility inert.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We believe that this is the reason why the second fail-safe system didn't engage and secondary rift opened close to the Black Mesa facility. As of now we have no information where that rift is located. Our lambda satellite shows a reading but the glare from the first portal is still visible. The rift has to be within the purple zone. Our best guess at the moment is that the second fail-safe sensors did record the rift jump and launched a buoy with the exact coordinates.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Since this is a class three incident the SASR has been notified to take care of the situation. Although they have to fly in from Swanbourne, WA your window of opportunity is limited. You have to retrieve the coordinates, get to ground zero and close it with a hollow charge. Make absolutely sure the charge is pointing to the centre of the rift. Any misaiming would have catastrophic consequences since it would expand the rift instead of closing it. Previous similar incidents and the following involvement of military personnel suggest that this vital information is not know to every operator.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We recommend that you get the job done before the SASR arrives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(The Hunt)&lt;br/&gt;Three easy steps and you are at the portal / cache. You'll only need this paragraph to find the cache.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    * Stage 1 - S37 53.783 E144 58.412&lt;br/&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;      At the given coordinates you'll find a buoy with a number at the top = A. Attached to one of the handles are two plaques with the coords for stage 2 and the final. (In case you can't find them / you don't want to get close to that buoy, write down the eight numbers at the bottom and calculate the coords: BCDEFGHI)&lt;br/&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;    * Stage 2 - S37 53.(C-1)(H)(E) E144 59.(G)(D-I)(B)&lt;br/&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;      If the number A is even enter portside (left) - if A is uneven enter starboard (right). If there are more than 2 doors / gates / hatches / ... use the very left or very right.&lt;br/&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;    * Stage 3 - Final - S37 53.(E+I)(G)(F-E) E144 59.(C)(D-I)(E)&lt;br/&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;      The cache-box is about 2m above your feet.

The small plastic container was very damp inside. The last vistor was on the 11 June 2011 but it was evident that they had trouble writing on the wet paper. We were not able to log our find as the paper was much too damp but we did return the cache to the same location.  Unfortunately a beautifully white cockatoo had met it's fate in the park and lay beside the cache. A sad ending to such a beautiful day.</groundspeak:text>

So he made one for a one off event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That first event was so successful that it is used by the Gawler Road Knights Road Club for regular events as well as the Rover Scouts for their Sand Blast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you keep an eye on the CAMS calendar you may be able to spot an event in action.

The District comprises an area of the southern&lt;br /&gt;foothills south east of Adelaide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blackwood Scout Group had humble beginnings in the then rural&lt;br /&gt;hamlet of Blackwood in 1909 with the formation of the &quot;Hound&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Patrol. State Council registered the patrol on 16th November of&lt;br /&gt;that year (Published in &quot;The Advertiser&quot; on 20th November) and&lt;br /&gt;listed as No. 31 on the first official day of registration on 11th&lt;br /&gt;December 1909.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woolshed was brought from Port Adelaide in 1928 and transported&lt;br /&gt;to land at 288 Main Road, Blackwood donated by the Davey-Thomas&lt;br /&gt;family. The hall was opened with much ceremony in 1929.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Group is now coming up to 100 years old. The Group currently&lt;br /&gt;provides a Joey Scout Mob (Tuesday), two Cub Scout Packs (Tuesday&lt;br /&gt;and Thursday) and a Scout Troop (Wednesday). The Group services a&lt;br /&gt;catchment area for boys and girls that includes the suburbs of&lt;br /&gt;Blackwood, Glenalta, Hawthorndene, Coromandel Valley and&lt;br /&gt;beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache name &quot;Drop off a Dead Marine&quot; comes from the bottle&lt;br /&gt;recycling activities nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the younger cachers, what a dead marine is about can be found&lt;br /&gt;at Dead&lt;br /&gt;Marine

From 1838 the area formed part of an extensive grazing grant that was developed further by a succession of owners up until the 1920s. The original sub-division of Chirnside Park was, at that time, known as Mooroolbark Park. Around 1000 acres (4 km²) of mainly rich black basaltic soil was grazed and cultivated, watered from two perpetual springs&lt;br/&gt;In 1921 George Chirnside sold Werribee Park, moving the family's stud herds and the contents of Werribee Mansion to Mooroolbark Park. After George Chirnside's death in 1941, permission to sell the estate was given in 1950 and finalised some years later. Subdivision was approved by the then Shire of Lillydale in 1956 with the residential area, centred on the two storey stone homestead, country club and golf course, named Chirnside Park in 1962 in honour of Thomas Chirnside, who founded the Chirnside empire in 1839.Amadeo DeVincentiis, an Italian from Abruzzo, also owned great swathes of what is now known as Chirnside Park. However, he sold it for a paltry amount in the 1960s, and within years the fortunate purchasers stood to make thousands. Amadeo attempted to rescind the sale, spending thousands, but failed.Formally West Lilydale, the surrounding region became known as Chirnside Park in the 1970s, the Post Office opening on 25 September 1979.  Nominally a suburb, Chirnside Park is a satellite community of Lilydale. Thus the services that cannot be met in the nearby shopping complex are found elsewhere. The residential area is set around the large 18-hole golf course, though its future is in doubt. Further residential development exists to the west and north. In area, however, most of the 'suburb' still retains a rural flavour, extending well into the Yarra Valley to the north, with commercial wineries, orchards and livestock farming, as well as large area residential estates. The Heritage Golf and Country Club, designed by Jack Nicklaus, also nestles in the northwest corner of the suburb directly on the Yarra River.&lt;br/&gt;Geocaching is about sharing the little gems you find packaged as an adventure for the next person. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I was reading about OpenCaching and thought I would come out to this one. My youngest geoprince also wanted to be in &quot;Daddies Carrrrrrr&quot;.

On route I discovered this was a dual listing with GC.com which is always a problem for me as while I want to record the find on both sites I dont really .want to distort my count - I seem to treat each time I come across this in a different way... Today I will do both...

The cache itself was an easy drive by find, no sooner than I was out of the car, I had the cache in hand - I was also helped by the fact that the external cammo gave it away.

Our thanks for the cache and an opportunity to log our first OX cache - as for the first to fiind - nope many have logged the GC before us.</groundspeak:text>

Storage capacity is 11,000 megalitres with a catchment area of 9,800 hectares. Maximum water depth in the dam is 34 metres. The wall is 44 metres high and at the crest it is 229 metres in length.&lt;br/&gt;The road from Kyogle is tar until the turnoff, approx 7km from the dam. &lt;br/&gt;The dam has a reputation as one of the best Australian Bass fishing areas in the state however a fishing license is required.&lt;br/&gt;Near the dam wall there is a public access area with picnic tables, toilets and barbecues. A small well maintained Golf Course is located at the Dam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Accommodation is available at Toonumbar Waters Retreat. Camping is permitted at Bells Bay with a small fee required to assist with maintaining the facilities here. Bells Bay &lt;br/&gt;Camping Ground is secluded in magnificent forest.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located at the Bells Bay camping ground. A nice spot for a weekend of fishing, walking or just relaxing. Facilities at Bells Bay campground include, shelter sheds, toilets, rainwater tanks, barbecues, jetty and boat ramp. Speed limit on the dam for boats is 8km/h.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The road into the campground is about 2km long and can be in poor condition after rain, 2wd vehicles not advised. During dry weather however any vehicle should not have any problems negotiating the road..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a regular sistema type and contains a Geocoin, CD game and a few other trinkets. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Once at the top, there are picnic tables, toilets and a gas barbeque.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a camo eclipse container and shouldn't be very difficult to find. There is no need to leave the viewing platform.&lt;br/&gt;Be aware that snow does fall at this location, and while the road to the top is in good condition, care and warm clothing would be advisable in the winter months. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Sonneys Waterfall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We placed this cache while on a recent 4wd trip into the hinterland West of Wauchope. Sonneys Waterfall is one of a series of small falls on Sonneys creek. Access to this area is via Knodingbul road approx 45km North West of Wingham. If heading North on Knodingbul road take a left turn at Blue Mountain Creek road S31 32.757 E 152 10.274.&lt;br/&gt;The area is accessible by 2wd vehicles but caution should be exercised especially in the wet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 6.7km along Blue Mountain Creek road you will arrive at the picnic area. S31 31.703 E 152.08.402. It looks like it has been seldom used as the only table is getting difficult to see. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From here follow the sign that points to the waterfall. The walk takes approximately 20 minutes each way and please make sure you check for leeches and ticks when you return. When you arrive at the GZ co-ordinates take a bearing of 140 degrees. This will point to a high bank to the right of the falls. The cache has been placed fairly high up the bank to avoid possible flooding in times of wet weather. A degree of clambering up the steep slope is required to access the cache. It looks as though there are several tracks on this slope that have been used in the past by people endeavouring to go further upstream to the other falls. Also beware of stinging nettles at the base of the falls. The cache is located in a small cleft of rock. The cache is a regular sized Sistema container&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;CP17CXW - Sonney's Waterfall Picnic Area&lt;br/&gt;S 31° 31.703 E 152° 08.402&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KR17CXW - Knodingbul Rd and Blue Mtn Creek Rd Junction&lt;br/&gt;S 31° 32.757 E 152° 10.274 &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Nice and dry.
If anyone else is coming along: At the road, there is a &quot;To Waterfall&quot; sign above a huge log, 10m downhill you may find the 'track' that is overgrown to the waterfall.
At the site, look for a drum (~100 litre - endless), and cache is ~8m NE.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We discovered this lookout on a recent 4wd trip through several national parks. Rowleys Lookout is located in Tapin Tops National Park. Access is via Knodingbul Road approximately 400kms north of Sydney and 30kms north-west of Wingham. As you make the steady climb from the pastoral land near Wingham, warm temperate sub-tropical rainforests meld with scarpland eucalypt forests, providing a lush mountain environment. Lookouts like Rowley's Rock provide panoramic views to Taree and the ocean beyond. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The park is accessible by two wheel drive vehicles year round and has good picnic and camping facilities. Some real &quot;gems&quot; of nature await the enthusiast.&lt;br/&gt;This area has local Aboriginal significance with the name &quot;tapin&quot; meaning dingo in the local language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This stunning rock outcrop has 360 degree/views, 1018m above sea level. To the south east you look down Caparra Creek and to the west, into the extensive forested hinterland, including Bulgan Nature Reserve. If you're intending to use the viewing platform, park your vehicle in the car park off Rowley's Road and take the 45 minute strenuous walk to the top. It's worth it&lt;br/&gt;If you have a 4WD it is a 400m walk to the summit which is 1018 metres above sea-level &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Kyogle is a small town in rural Northeast NSW. Primarily a beef, timber and dairy area and until a year or so ago had a large plywood factory. Unfortunately a tragic fire destroyed the plant and forced many locals out of work. The town is a gateway to many National Parks and State Forests that lead to a few great caches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache situated in town at the local lookout will hopefully attract a few travellers to experience the inland road while travelling. Follow the lookout signs opposite the hospital and wind your way to a view over the whole town and outlying countryside. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once at the lookout you have two choices,&lt;br/&gt;1.	Walk the remaining 300 metres up a steep track&lt;br/&gt;2.	If you have a 4wd, drive to within 20 metres of the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The track is well defined and has been used recently, however, be warned it is steep and fairly well rutted. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Many years ago, the North Coast of NSW was once covered in a magnificent rainforest called the Big Scrub. These days unfortunately, due to widespread land clearing there are but a few pockets remaining. As a result much of our native flora and fauna have disappeared. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area where we have placed this cache is currently under re-vegetation. Located on the Eastern outskirts of Lismore but still in the middle of Suburbia, this great park is ideal for a lazy afternoon stroll. The park consists of 4 areas. &lt;br/&gt;1.	The bird Sanctuary&lt;br/&gt;2.	Platypus park&lt;br/&gt;3.	Richmond Birdwing butterfly gully&lt;br/&gt;4.	Children playground&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The walkway winds its way beside the creek and over several causeways and bridges. There are quite a few entrances to the park so we will leave that up to you to find the best way in to enjoy all the sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep an eye out for the magnificent Birdwing butterfly. One of the largest butterflys in Australia with a wingspan of up to 15cm. Unfortunately it is also one of the rarest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small to medium sized container in an area that may be a bit tricky due to the tree cover. It is also recommended to bring insect repellent as the mosquitos can be rather thick. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Who said 13 is an unlucky number. Being born on a Black Friday I can not afford to be superstitious. Been there before so knew where I needed to be. Without the difficulty of rain it was an easy cache to find. A muggle family on bikes and scooters and with a pram chose the time I arrived to use the slope on either side of the causeway as a skate board style play area. Mum and dad caught up soon and all left the site.

This is another one of those little parks that the locals go to but
no one else knows about.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a small container painted black that is placed
in an area where the locals like to walk their dogs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is placed here as a place to swap and see coins from
other countries. When the cache was activated it contained coins
from Fiji, Ireland, Hong Kong and other places.&lt;br /&gt;
All these coins were collected from other caches that we have
visited.

With the wife and MissBB out at the Bead and Gem show.
I took the 2 boys out caching to see if I could get my 500th find.

Quite muggle free here today which made for a quick find.

Took TB, GC and Bus.

No matter which direction you come please be aware parts of this area of the Molonglo River does have some steep sides and drops with loose ground. If you choose to do this cache at night be very careful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get to this cache please do not not cross Private Property without permission. In the A.C.T. all major rivers have a corridor on either side that allows for public access (apart from a few exceptions) and general protection of the natural environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also be careful when it has rained or is raining as the river levels may rise suddenly. Expect a few blackberry bushes along the way but in most circumstances they can be avoided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is an ammo box and on the inside of the box are 2 numbers that will be used to obtain the final locations for All the Rivers Run Puzzle No. 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consider these numbers as B and C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALL THE RIVERS RUN CHALLENGE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an added incentive I will give the first person a geocoin who completes this multi in 1 day (ie by foot/push bike between 12.01.01am to 11.59.59pm of the same day) and has signed (dated with the individual's personal signature - no stickers) all the cache log books (All the Rivers Run Numbers 1-5 and Puzzle No. 1). I will check the logs to ensure claim is legitimate and of course I will have to rely upon your honesty in this matter also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am also seriously considering making a limited edition &quot;All the Rivers Run Challenge&quot; pathtag to give to those cachers who meet the above requirements and there will be a Honor Roll listing with the All the Rivers Run Puzzle No. 1 webpage naming those successful people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can attempt this challenge more than once but you will still need to sign the log books on the day of your attempt.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Logs pretty much the same for all as I DID THEM ALL IN THE ONE DAY, Coooeee, a *FTF*. Saw 3 MTN goats too  Pics taken for all too.

Parked car at Coppins crossing in the dark at 6am, then proceeded to walk to #1. Arrived there at 6:15am by torchlight, light drizzle. My eyes coped with the pre-dawn overcast sky very well and I could see Black Mountain tower glowing over in the distance and dawn just arising. Nice little views of the Molonglo too. Nice spot #1.
Walked back to car, got out the Mountain bike, crossed the Molonglo, and then proceeded to ride and slosh down the track on the Nth side for some considerable distance until I was nearly directly above #2. Dumped bike, then I zig-zagged down the very steep embankment following well defined GOAT tracks. Arrived at #2 well hidden a la natural. Relieved the cache of its TB and Geocoin. Nice spot #2. Arrived there 7:50am.
Consulted GPS, Hmmmm, I need to cross the river for nos 3&amp;4. So, I crossed there and then – LOTS of water flowing, but OK. Then it was a pretty severe bush bash, steep gullies, deep side creeks (all flowing vigoursly), having enough of this I made for MUCH higher ground and followed the fence line till I was on the spur leading to No. 3. Down the spur I went, found no. 3 – WOW – TOP SPOT! Seeing the water flow through here is quite something – it must be speccie when in flood.  Arrived there 8:55am. Admired the geology and scenery for a while, then back up the hill a bit and headed off to #4.
Down again to the rivers edge for #4, another nice location. Arrived there 9:30am. Then I crossed the river there and went straight up and up and up till I had clear grass and an easy stroll back to the bike, admiring the gorge scenery from the heights as I went.
A drizzly ride back to car, hopped in car and drove to near #5. Met the local farmer and had a good chat as I wandered down the road.  Onwards to #5 – approached from the high ground, got to GZ coords, but no cache – looked vertically down, hmmmm, it must be down there. So backtrack a bit, round I go, and there I find it – another nice little hide with trickiness. (easily retrieved in the wet as there were good footholds). #5 – another great spot. Arrived there at 12:10pm.

GZ calculated, off I go, some tracks, some bushbashing, some rocks, arrived at GZ – Hmmmmm, this is NOTHING like rBirtles would do, and nothing like the other wonderful locations. Blackberries and more blackberries in the middle of more blackberries. Hmmmm, consulted my numbers, yep, all OK.  Arrived there 1pm. 
(*^&amp;^%^%^()*&amp;(*^%(*&amp;&amp;* - There was clearly something wrong with the formula, and I had no idea what as the numbers and formula were quite specific. OK, whip out phone and call rBirtles – DAMN – no signal down here. UP I go and UP I go, ah, at last, a signal, nobody home. Double Damn. Wrung out all my clothes as by now there was a fair bit of rain, and I was literally STEAMING. Waited a while, tried again, nothing. Dejected, I then wandered off back to the car, found a much easier way back. Took off gaiters, boots etc etc, and was about to drive off, ring ring…..hello – Yay, mr. Birtles with the correct coords. A bit of chat, and OMG – That’s further than I went before, and the rain is still falling. Oh well, I’m wet, WARM &amp; steamy, still OK after some lunch, so off I went. Some considerable time later (hey, after 15km walking and 16km riding one is allowed to slow down a bit), I found the elusive cache. Arrived there 3:30pm.
ANOTHER nice location. Then returned back to car, completing 16km bike riding and 21km walking for the day with considerable rock climbing.

In summary, 2 FTF’s (#2 and final Puzzle), [red][b], one top series of spectacular caches with simply excellent locations[/b][/red], [blue][b] Easily #3 was the top spot, such a wonderful geological and scenic spot.[/b][/blue]

Thanks rBirtles for the wonderful series, the sustenance and the geocoin too, well done.</groundspeak:text>

Its source is on the other side of the mountain range from where the Shoalhaven River rises, in Tallaganda state forest at ~1200 metres altitude. The Molonglo River flows from south to north before turning northwest, through the outskirts of the New South Wales town of Queanbeyan, where it picks up its major tributary the Queanbeyan River, and then continues through the nation's federal capital city of Canberra, where it has been dammed to form Lake Burley Griffin. It then flows on to empty into the Murrumbidgee River to the northwest of Canberra. Over its course the Molonglo River alternates between long broad floodplains and narrow rocky gorges several times. One of these floodplains is called the Molonglo Plain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The river's name was recorded as the &quot;Yeal-am-bid-gie&quot; in 1820 by the explorer Charles Throsby. This was probably the collective local Ngunnawal language name for the river. (The suffix &quot;bidgee&quot; was common in Aboriginal names for rivers in the Canberra area and presumably means &quot;water&quot; or &quot;river&quot;.) The Moolinggolah people of the district around Captains Flat probably gave the Molonglo its name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major tributary of the Murray River, the Murrumbidgee travels 900 kilometres (559 mi) from the foot of Peppercorn Hill in the Fiery Range of the Snowy Mountains, through the ACT, and to a confluence with the Murray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reaches of the Murrumbidgee in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) are now affected by the complete elimination of large spring snow melt flows and a reduction of average annual flows of almost 50%, due to Tantangara Dam. Tantangara Dam was completed in 1960 on the headwaters of Murrumbidgee River and diverts approximately 99% of the river's flow at that point into Lake Eucumbene. This had extremely serious effects on native fish populations and other native aquatic life and has led to serious habitat loss. It is said that the Murrumbidgee River through the ACT is only half the river it used to be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Murrumbidgee River was known to Europeans before it was actually discovered by them. In 1820 the explorer Charles Throsby informed the Governor of New South Wales that he anticipated finding &quot;a considerable river of salt water (except at very wet seasons), called by the natives Mur-rum-big-gee&quot;. In the expedition journal, Throsby wrote as a marginal note: &quot;This river or stream is called by the natives Yeal-am-bid-gie ...&quot;. The river he had stumbled upon was in fact the Molonglo River, Throsby reached the actual river in April 1821.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1823, Brigade-Major John Ovens and Captain Mark Currie reached the upper Murrumbidgee when exploring south of Lake George.  In 1829, Charles Sturt and his party rowed and sailed down the length of the river from Narrandera to the Murray, and then down the Murray to the sea. They also rowed, sailing when possible, back up against the current.  The Murrumbidgee basin was opened to settlement in the 1830s and soon became an important farming area.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Text taken from Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This puzzle requires you to visit caches All the Rivers Run Numbers 1-5. Within these traditional caches (all ammo boxes) you will find numbers that are needed to find this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have listed this cache as a Level 4 terrain based mainly on the cumulative terrain rating of the 5 necessary caches required to complete this multi. I am happy to adjust this based on cacher's opinion once they have completed this series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The All the Rivers Run caches are located along the Molonglo River (starting from Coppins Crossing) and finishes along the Murrumbidgee River downstream where the 2 rivers join.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get to this cache please do not not cross Private Property without permission. In the A.C.T. all major rivers have a corridor on either side that allows for public access (apart from a few exceptions) and for general protection of the surrounding natural environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many thanks to Newberys who helped place this cache. He will log a find after someone has claimed the FTF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find this cache use the following formula using the numbers gathered from caches All the Rivers Run Numbers 1-5.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;South 35 13.DBA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;East 148 57.EFC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALL THE RIVERS RUN CHALLENGE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an added incentive I will give the first person a geocoin who completes this multi in 1 day (ie by foot/push bike between 12.01.01am to 11.59.59pm of the same day) and has signed (dated with the individual's personal signature - no stickers) all the cache log books (All the Rivers Run Numbers 1-5 plus this cache). I will check the logs to ensure claim is legitimate and of course I will have to rely upon your honesty in this matter also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am also designing a limited edition &quot;All the Rivers Run Challenge&quot; Pathtag to give to those cachers who meet the above requirements and there will be a Honor Roll listing with this page naming those successful people.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Logs pretty much the same for all as I DID THEM ALL IN THE ONE DAY. Pics taken for all too.

Parked car at Coppins crossing in the dark at 6am, then proceeded to walk to #1. Arrived there at 6:15am by torchlight, light drizzle. My eyes coped with the pre-dawn overcast sky very well and I could see Black Mountain tower glowing over in the distance and dawn just arising. Nice little views of the Molonglo too. Nice spot #1.
Walked back to car, got out the Mountain bike, crossed the Molonglo, and then proceeded to ride and slosh down the track on the Nth side for some considerable distance until I was nearly directly above #2. Dumped bike, then I zig-zagged down the very steep embankment following well defined GOAT tracks. Arrived at #2 well hidden a la natural. Relieved the cache of its TB and Geocoin. Nice spot #2. Arrived there 7:50am.
Consulted GPS, Hmmmm, I need to cross the river for nos 3&amp;4. So, I crossed there and then – LOTS of water flowing, but OK. Then it was a pretty severe bush bash, steep gullies, deep side creeks (all flowing vigoursly), having enough of this I made for MUCH higher ground and followed the fence line till I was on the spur leading to No. 3. Down the spur I went, found no. 3 – WOW – TOP SPOT! Seeing the water flow through here is quite something – it must be speccie when in flood.  Arrived there 8:55am. Admired the geology and scenery for a while, then back up the hill a bit and headed off to #4.
Down again to the rivers edge for #4, another nice location. Arrived there 9:30am. Then I crossed the river there and went straight up and up and up till I had clear grass and an easy stroll back to the bike, admiring the gorge scenery from the heights as I went.
A drizzly ride back to car, hopped in car and drove to near #5. Met the local farmer and had a good chat as I wandered down the road.  Onwards to #5 – approached from the high ground, got to GZ coords, but no cache – looked vertically down, hmmmm, it must be down there. So backtrack a bit, round I go, and there I find it – another nice little hide with trickiness. (easily retrieved in the wet as there were good footholds). #5 – another great spot. Arrived there at 12:10pm.

GZ calculated, off I go, some tracks, some bushbashing, some rocks, arrived at GZ – Hmmmmm, this is NOTHING like rBirtles would do, and nothing like the other wonderful locations. Blackberries and more blackberries in the middle of more blackberries. Hmmmm, consulted my numbers, yep, all OK.  Arrived there 1pm. 
(*^&amp;^%^%^()*&amp;(*^%(*&amp;&amp;* - There was clearly something wrong with the formula, and I had no idea what as the numbers and formula were quite specific. OK, whip out phone and call rBirtles – DAMN – no signal down here. UP I go and UP I go, ah, at last, a signal, nobody home. Double Damn. Wrung out all my clothes as by now there was a fair bit of rain, and I was literally STEAMING. Waited a while, tried again, nothing. Dejected, I then wandered off back to the car, found a much easier way back. Took off gaiters, boots etc etc, and was about to drive off, ring ring…..hello – Yay, mr. Birtles with the correct coords. A bit of chat, and OMG – That’s further than I went before, and the rain is still falling. Oh well, I’m wet, WARM &amp; steamy, still OK after some lunch, so off I went. Some considerable time later (hey, after 15km walking and 16km riding one is allowed to slow down a bit), I found the elusive cache. Arrived there 3:30pm.
ANOTHER nice location. Then returned back to car, completing 16km bike riding and 21km walking for the day with considerable rock climbings.

In summary, 2 FTF’s (#2 and final Puzzle), [red][b], one top series of spectacular caches with simply excellent locations[/b][/red], [blue][b] Easily #3 was the top spot, such a wonderful geological and scenic spot.[/b][/blue]

Thanks rBirtles for the wonderful series, the sustenance and the geocoin too, well done.</groundspeak:text>

Will get a better one once I get back out there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache site is bigger, better and harder than Corpora Cavernosa I.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located near the Cotter Dam this site may go underwater in about 2 years time once the dam wall has been built and the waters rise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackberries are everywhere in this area so long pants and gaiters would be recommended. Although getting to the cache may be a bit difficult some planning will make the task a bit easier. The cache is an ammo box and I have left a big box of bandaids and antiseptic cream as part of the contents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many thanks goes to TankEngine who informed me of this rock formation while seeking out a cache hide for his multicache Cotter Catchment II. I stronglly suggest that you do the first part of his cache first in order to avoid unnecessary backtracking.</groundspeak:long_description>

Was hoping to locate the last three caches of this puzzle today but it was all too difficult. The water is flowing right up to the steep rock faces making it too dangerous to climb the slippery rocks.  Will try again in the summer time when the river should be flowing far less.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Logs pretty much the same for all as I DID THEM ALL IN THE ONE DAY. Pics taken for all too.

Parked car at Coppins crossing in the dark at 6am, then proceeded to walk to #1. Arrived there at 6:15am by torchlight, light drizzle. My eyes coped with the pre-dawn overcast sky very well and I could see Black Mountain tower glowing over in the distance and dawn just arising. Nice little views of the Molonglo too. Nice spot #1.
Walked back to car, got out the Mountain bike, crossed the Molonglo, and then proceeded to ride and slosh down the track on the Nth side for some considerable distance until I was nearly directly above #2. Dumped bike, then I zig-zagged down the very steep embankment following well defined GOAT tracks. Arrived at #2 well hidden a la natural. Relieved the cache of its TB and Geocoin. Nice spot #2. Arrived there 7:50am.
Consulted GPS, Hmmmm, I need to cross the river for nos 3&amp;4. So, I crossed there and then – LOTS of water flowing, but OK. Then it was a pretty severe bush bash, steep gullies, deep side creeks (all flowing vigoursly), having enough of this I made for MUCH higher ground and followed the fence line till I was on the spur leading to No. 3. Down the spur I went, found no. 3 – WOW – TOP SPOT! Seeing the water flow through here is quite something – it must be speccie when in flood.  Arrived there 8:55am. Admired the geology and scenery for a while, then back up the hill a bit and headed off to #4.
Down again to the rivers edge for #4, another nice location. Arrived there 9:30am. Then I crossed the river there and went straight up and up and up till I had clear grass and an easy stroll back to the bike, admiring the gorge scenery from the heights as I went.
A drizzly ride back to car, hopped in car and drove to near #5. Met the local farmer and had a good chat as I wandered down the road.  Onwards to #5 – approached from the high ground, got to GZ coords, but no cache – looked vertically down, hmmmm, it must be down there. So backtrack a bit, round I go, and there I find it – another nice little hide with trickiness. (easily retrieved in the wet as there were good footholds). #5 – another great spot. Arrived there at 12:10pm.

GZ calculated, off I go, some tracks, some bushbashing, some rocks, arrived at GZ – Hmmmmm, this is NOTHING like rBirtles would do, and nothing like the other wonderful locations. Blackberries and more blackberries in the middle of more blackberries. Hmmmm, consulted my numbers, yep, all OK.  Arrived there 1pm. 
(*^&amp;^%^%^()*&amp;(*^%(*&amp;&amp;* - There was clearly something wrong with the formula, and I had no idea what as the numbers and formula were quite specific. OK, whip out phone and call rBirtles – DAMN – no signal down here. UP I go and UP I go, ah, at last, a signal, nobody home. Double Damn. Wrung out all my clothes as by now there was a fair bit of rain, and I was literally STEAMING. Waited a while, tried again, nothing. Dejected, I then wandered off back to the car, found a much easier way back. Took off gaiters, boots etc etc, and was about to drive off, ring ring…..hello – Yay, mr. Birtles with the correct coords. A bit of chat, and OMG – That’s further than I went before, and the rain is still falling. Oh well, I’m wet, WARM &amp; steamy, still OK after some lunch, so off I went. Some considerable time later (hey, after 15km walking and 16km riding one is allowed to slow down a bit), I found the elusive cache. Arrived there 3:30pm.
ANOTHER nice location. Then returned back to car, completing 16km bike riding and 21km walking for the day with considerable rock climbing.

In summary, 2 FTF’s (#2 and final Puzzle), [red][b], one top series of spectacular caches with simply excellent locations[/b][/red], [blue][b] Easily #3 was the top spot, such a wonderful geological and scenic spot.[/b][/blue]

Thanks rBirtles for the wonderful series, the sustenance and the geocoin too, well done.</groundspeak:text>

No matter which direction you come please be aware parts of this area of the Molonglo River does have some steep sides and drops with loose ground. If you choose to do this cache at night be very careful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get to this cache please do not not cross Private Property without permission. In the A.C.T. all major rivers have a corridor on either side that allows for public access (apart from a few exceptions) and general protection of the natural environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also be careful when it has rained or is raining as the river levels may rise suddenly. Expect a few blackberry bushes along the way but in most circumstances they can be avoided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is an ammo box and on the inside of the box is 1 number that will be used to obtain the final locations for All the Rivers Run Puzzle No. 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consider this number as A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALL THE RIVERS RUN CHALLENGE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an added incentive I will give the first person a geocoin who completes this multi in 1 day (ie by foot/push bike between 12.01.01am to 11.59.59pm of the same day) and has signed (dated with the individual's personal signature - no stickers) all the cache log books (All the Rivers Run Numbers 1-5 and Puzzle No. 1). I will check the logs to ensure claim is legitimate and of course I will have to rely upon your honesty in this matter also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am also seriously considering making a limited edition &quot;All the Rivers Run Challenge&quot; pathtag to give to those cachers who meet the above requirements and there will be a Honor Roll listing with the All the Rivers Run Puzzle No. 1 webpage naming those successful people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can attempt this challenge more than once but you will still need to sign the log books on the day of your attempt.</groundspeak:long_description>

Depending on how you approach this cache it will require climbing amongst the blackberries - so come with a decent pair of shoes so that you don't slip and long pants/gaiters. Good view to a fast flowing Molonglo River - interesting to see the impact of the last heavy rains ie: much erosion. We left a small skateboard replica in the container to join many other trinkets. We did not take anything. Look forward to finding the other caches in the group to work out the puzzle. Many people have visited this cache but not reported on this site.

(*^&amp;^%^%^()*&amp;(*^%(*&amp;&amp;* - There was clearly something wrong with the formula, and I had no idea what as the numbers and formula were quite specific.

A bit of chat, and OMG – That’s further than I went before, and the rain is still falling. Oh well, I’m wet, WARM &amp; steamy, still OK after some lunch, so off I went. Some considerable time later (hey, after 15km walking and 16km riding one is allowed to slow down a bit), I found the elusive cache. Arrived there 3:30pm.
ANOTHER nice location. Then returned back to car, completing 16km bike riding and 21km walking for the day with considerable rock climbing.

In summary, 2 FTF’s (#2 and final Puzzle), [red][b], one top series of spectacular caches with simply excellent locations[/b][/red], [blue][b] Easily #3 was the top spot, such a wonderful geological and scenic spot.[/b][/blue]

Thanks rBirtles for the wonderful series, the sustenance and the geocoin too, well done.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The top of Pig Hill is quite obvious and can be seen from a long distance due to a clearing on top. This is a well known site for hang glider and para glider pilots when the wind from the east is blowing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back in the 90s I was a hang glider and knew this spot well. This was the site I got over 9000 feet above sea level and couldn't go any higher due to I was touching the bottom of the clouds. As a pilot this is one place you do not want to go behind the hill as the is nowhere you can crash land except in the trees - and with limited road access for the rescuers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At about 970m Pig Hill offers some beautiful views over Canberra and the surrounding farm lands. You may even be lucky getting to watch the hang gliders at work but then again on such days it may be difficult to grab the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access to Pig Hill can be made in two ways. The easiest is by accessing the Hill directly by car (4WD recommended although a 2WD could make it with care) via Doctors Flat Road and the turn off to the Hill at S35 13.537 E148 53.134. Or, if you want a nice hike you can walk up from the bottom of Mountain Creek Road which is at 620m elevation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a trig station on this hill so don't forget the camera and log it via Geocaching Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is also a nice spot to bring a picnic lunch and blanket and don't forget to follow Doctors Flat Road along a little to visit Capital Glimpses cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is an ammo box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please do not interfere with the ribbons on the posts and on the trig itself. They are used for pilots to ensure that the wind coming up the hill and over it is in the right direction before they take off.</groundspeak:long_description>
