            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Marrakech - Djamaa El Fna
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The famous town square of Marrakech, Jamaa El Fna, owes little of its fame to its own beauty, but to the continuous day and night life. During most of the days, perfomers of every kind put up their shows, continuing until the food stalls start to move in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Jamaa there are several entries to the fantastic suuqs, and for anyone who needs to relax for a while, there are plenty of cafés around the Jamaa, where the main attraction is looking at the ongoing activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaa El Fna owes most of its fame to the large number of spectacles going on all around all the time. Snake charmers, singers, story tellers, healers and fakirs attract a dominantly Moroccan audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The food stalls take over the Jamaa as soon as the orange juice sellers have packed up and gone home. The food is prepares from fresh on the spot, and you can choose between fish, meat or vegetable dishes. The concept is easy, you point at everything you desire, indicate the quantity and within few minutes it is there in
front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The food is exquisite, tasteful and much appreciated by Moroccans and brave tourists. Never forget the good rule of eating in Morocco: eat where the Moroccans eat — they know where to get good food!&lt;/p&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Koutoubia Mosque is the largest mosque in Marrakech, Morocco. The minaret was completed under the reign of the Almohad Caliph Yaqub al-Mansur (1184-1199) and was used as the model for the Giralda of Seville and for the Hassan Tower of
Rabat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name is derived from the Arabic al-Koutoubiyyin for librarian, since it used to be surrounded by sellers of manuscripts. It is considered the ultimate structure of its kind. The tower is 69 m (221 ft) in height and has a lateral length of 12.8 m (41 ft). Six rooms (one above the other) constitute the interior; leading around them is a ramp by way of which the muezzin could ride up to the balcony. It is built in a traditional Almohad
style and the tower is adorned with four copper globes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to legend, the globes were originally made of pure gold, and there were once supposed to have been only three globes. The fourth globe was donated by the wife of Yaqub el-Mansur as compensation for her failure to keep the fast for one day during the month of Ramadan. She had her golden jewelry melted down to flab the fourth globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minaret of the Koutoubia was the model for the minaret of the Giralda mosque in Seville which in its turn has influenced thousands of church towers in Spain and Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

Tizi n'Tichka - MG10
&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The route of Tizi-N-Tichka length is 200 km,
      crossed the High Atlas and is considered one of the most
      beautiful in Morocco. It is a must win for Marrakech to
      Ouarzazate. The route of Tizi-N-Tichka is a series of small
      turns that culminated, the Tizi-N-Tichka is at 2300 meters:
      be careful. It is possible that the pass is closed in
      December and January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Roughly hallway along the main highway between
      Marrakech and Ouarzazate, this pass &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a spectacular
      piece of French engineering built to replace the main caravan route
      connecting south and north. Along is route is a fascinating
      contrast of environments ranging from the rich, red-soil
      farming plains and fertile valleys above Marrakech to barren
      peaks and oases like palmeraies facing the
      pre-Sahara.
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Scattered along the route are small villages and welcome roadside
cafes. A 2260m, the pass is higher than the Tizi n’Test to its west
and affords a similarly exhilarating if somewhat bleaker, vista
from its peak.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 There are souvenir stalls precariously precariously all along the
higher reaches of the pass, and look out for salesmen waving
brightly colored—sometimes by artificial means—fossils and minerals
at your vehicle as you round the hairpin bends. 
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you have time, I recommend a side visit to
      Telouer and the Dar Glaoui kasbah that dominates the village.
      This former “castle of the sand,” fast rejoining the very
      earth from which it was built, was the base for the el-Glaoui
      clan, who controlled much of southern Morocco from the late 1
      800s until Moroccan independence in 1956, as well as the
      caravan route of which the main highway has now replaced. The
      kasbah is an absurdly huge. dramatic building. .and although
      the maze of locked rooms and connecting passageways are
      mostly off limits—for safety reasons—it’s still worth a visit
      if only to marvel at the extravagance of this modern-day
      dynasty. The turnoff to Telouet is about 6km south of the
      pass arid 21 km along a narrow, scenic, pot-holed
      road. &lt;br /&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
From parking to the cache are 570m, with an area
      of difficult progression at the end, it requires some
      physical effort. In winter, with snow, the cache may provide
      some difficulties to be found, because the cache is at 2300
      m.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marrakech-Menara Airport is an airport serving Marrakech, the capital city of the Marrakech-Tensift-El Haouz region in Morocco. It is an international facility that receives some European flights as well as flights from Casablanca and some of the Arab world nations. The airport served over 3.1 million passengers in the year 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During World War II, the airport was used by the United States Army Air Force Air Transport Command as a hub for cargo, transiting aircraft and personnel. It functioned as a stopover en-route to Casablanca Airfield or to Agadir Airport on the North African Cairo-Dakar transport route for cargo, transiting aircraft and personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
