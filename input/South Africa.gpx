The hollows, dents and stems are living shelters for bushbabies, squirrels, rodents, lizards, snakes and even tree frogs. Various insects, spiders and scorpions may find solace for their entire lives within the one tree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The baobab tree flowers at the ripe age of about 20 years. Large white blooms, about the size of a Frisbee, open at the first sign of sunset. The musk-scented odor it exudes attracts fruit bats and various insects. Many are attracted to the nectar, including bats and mouse lemurs as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The foot long flowers can open up fully within one minute, creating an awakening in the forested areas of South Africa. Mouse lemurs hibernate during the dry season, but awaken upon the blooming of the first baobab blooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baobab nectar drips down the bloom, sending the aroma of the sugary liquid out to all. Giant hawk moths are tempted by the tasty treat and will fertilize the blooms by spreading the pollen around. The mouse lemur finds not only the blooms of the baobab tree tasty, but the hawk moth is also a special treat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trunk holes are home to birds such as hornbills, parrots, spinetails, kestrels and rollers. Bigger cavities are filled with ground hornbills or barn owls. Huge stick nests can be found in the baobab tree, as nesting sites of the larger birds such as vultures and eagles, and the occasional stork. Buffalo weavers are found in the branches too, more than other trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The baobab trees are commonly owned privately, as they have an important role in the culture and economy of Africa. Wood from this tree is too fibrous for building use, but bark is shredded for use in rope, nets, cloth, snares and basket weaving. Cosmetics and tonics are created from roots of the valuable tree. Spinach and soup can be made from the large leaves. Seeds are ground for coffee substitutes or can be eaten fresh. White pulp taken from the tree is used for a ‘cream of tartar’ powder for baking goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The baobab survives in semi-arid temperatures. African elephants are their biggest enemy, as they strip the resources by removing bark and leaves in their attempt to survive.</groundspeak:long_description>

Went to check on the cache today after seening that it was not found by the Woodies.
Sadly it seems that it has been Muggled! Looked all around but found no trace of it anywhere!
Seems the spot is a popular eating &amp; chilling spot during the week as it provides good shade.
Replaced the cache with a new one today and moved it to a less frequented spot in the same park.
Have updated/listed the new coordinates as follows: S 26'02.657, E 028'05.076
New tradables are: Plastic Giraffe, Glow-in-the-dark star &amp; a Wire Star.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;h2&gt;Cape Town's 1st Scuba Cache&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affectionately known to the Cape Town diving community as The Boss, this wreck, The BOS 400, is without a doubt one of the most dived wrecks on the Atlantic Peninsula. This cache will require you to dive the wreck and collect some information whilst you are down there. The information gathered will lead you to the final which is located safely on land a short drive/walk away close to a good point to view all the action.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The Wreck&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, the Bos 400 was the largest crane barge in Africa at approximately 100m long. She was under tow by the Russian tug Tigr having almost completed a journey from Pointe-Noire in the Republic of Congo to Cape Town, South Africa. On the 26th June 1994 during a north westerly gale, the tow parted causing the vessel to run aground off Duiker Point in Maori Bay (so called because of the wreck of the SS Maori nearby). Despite several towage attempts, the shipwreck was considered a total loss as salvors were able to recover little from the wreck. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artificialowl.net/2008/05/shipwreck-of-bos-400-maori-bay-south.html&quot;&gt;following article&lt;/a&gt; gives a little more detail and also has some photos of the wreck soon after it was sunk (compare them to those below to see how the wreck has changed over the years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting There&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you are superman or fancy a long hike with all your gear followed by a tricky entrance/exit over some steeps rocks, you will definitely want to get to this one by boat. The wreck is only really dived during the summer season when the wind is predominantly a south-easter which results in an upwelling of clean water along this side of the peninsula. In addition, the south-easter can be particularly vicious at times and Maori Bay is relatively sheltered from this wind. During this season (October - February) however, most of the local charter operators will dive this site fairly often so finding someone who's launching there shouldn't be too much of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Dive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BOS 400 is one of the most dived wrecks on the Atlantic seaboard. As already mentioned, it is located just off Duiker Point in Maori Bay, which is also affectionately known as &quot;The Fridge&quot; amongst the local diving community. You can expect temperatures of around 8°C-10°C but it does get as low as 4°C so be warned. The plus side of the cold water is that, as a rule of thumb, the colder the water the better the visibility and the visibility can be as good as 30m if you're lucky. The wreck is easily visible as it some of it sits out of the water and as such the depth of your dive will range from shallow (5m) to about 20m at the deeper sections. This also means there's something for everyone and it's accessible to divers of all qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life on the wreck is fairly indicative of what one sees on the Antlantic peninsula - lots of colourful sponges, soft corals, anemones, kelp and, my personal favourite, nudibranchs like this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrews_underwater_images/3441571272/in/set-72157594415649369&quot;&gt;gas flame nudi&lt;/a&gt;. However, the marine life is generally better on other sites so your main interest here is the wreck itself. Initially, most of the wreck sat out of the water and there were limited penetration possiblities that were particularly difficult because of the shallow nature of the dive and the surge generated being so shallow and close to the rocks. However, the wreck has detoriated significantly in the last couple of years. The helipad which forms part of the challenge in this cache only collapsed in Sept 2010. And in September 2011 a large part of the mid section of the barge collapsed as well. Generators, hydraulics, cabling and other structural components that were either above water or only accessible by penetration are now lying exposed on the seafloor and as such it is now a far more interesting dive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't dived the wreck before, the best source of information on what to expect is of course the operator taking you out to the dive site. If you want to read up beforehand, the following &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikitravel.org/en/Diving_the_Cape_Peninsula_and_False_Bay/SS_Oakburn_and_MV_Boss400&quot;&gt;wikitravel article&lt;/a&gt; provides a great overview on the site and also of the SS Oakburn (which extends out from the stern of the Boss).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Cache&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most operators will probably drop you very close to, if not on, the helipad. If they do not, then ask them to do so and they will most likely happily oblige (or at least drop you close by and tell you where to go). Either way, make your way to the WNW side (the deeper side) of the helipad. You will notice that the helipad is not perfectly round and is more like a giant polygon. If you look at the edge you will see some round port-hole like holes through the metal (see photo). I was initially going to make you count all of them around the entire helipad but this became quite a mission and gets quite hard because of the amount of kelp that is already growing on the higher (shallower) section of the helipad. So, you need to find out how many of these are there per side of the polygon that forms the helipad (i.e. between any 2 &quot;corners&quot;...). I checked 4-5 sides and they all had the same number of holes - although the placement of the holes differs on each side and could be potentially confusing as the hole gets closer to the &quot;corner&quot;. If in doubt, check more than 1 side just to be sure. Let this number be A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each of the corners on the helipad you will see what I call a corner post (or at least see evidence of one). This is essentially just a piece of metal extending from the corner. On either side of the post are 2 shorter extending pieces of metal with a small piece of vertical, round pipe attached to the end of them (see attached photo). How many of these shorter extensions are there along one side of the helipad (i.e. between 2 corner posts). Let this number be B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there leave the helipad and swim along the length of the wreck following the coastline essentially. Initially you will come to section where (at the time of placing the cache) there is a large piece of metal plating supported by rocks. You can easily swim underneath and along for quite a distance. But for now I wouldn 't recommend you do as you'll need to be looking out on you right for a large compartment (looks kind of like a container) that broke free of the rest of the wreckage. It has some large pipes coming out of the back and some fencing/railings running around the top. There are 2 main entrances - one along the length (facing the shore) and one along the width at the western side (the far side from where you will approach). The deepest part of the &quot;container&quot; was at 20m on the day we dived at which point it was also quite close to high tide. So, the first thing you need to do is count the number of &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;vertical&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; fence posts (&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;excluding&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the corner posts) along the &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;length&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of the compartment above the entrance. Let this be C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, go into the entrance below the fence you just counted (i.e. along on the length). You will see the other entrance diagonally opposite and left of you as well as another entrance/exit/hole in the ceiling across and slghtly left of you (i.e. almost the exact view from which the photo below was taken). As you go through the entrance immediately look up. You will notice that ceiling of the compartment has been broken into a number of sections by support beams that run along the length and width of the compartment. D = the number of sections into which the &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;width&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of the compartment is broken by these support structs. The arrows in the picture below give you an indication of what I'm referring to (except the example is on the side and you need to be looking at the roof). Just to be sure, there are the same number of support structs as the no. of fence posts so D = C + 1. Then, proceed to the other entrance as shown in the picture below. E = the no of vertical sections (as shown by the arrows in the picture below) to the &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;left&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of the entrance (when looking form the inside out).
Inside wreckage: D &amp; E = no. of sections separated by supporting bars (see image from &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikitravel.org/en/Diving_the_Cape_Peninsula_and_False_Bay/SS_Oakburn_and_MV_Boss400&quot;&gt;wikitravel article&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Final&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great stuff you've now collected all the info required to find the final... Enjoy the rest of your dive. The final is located at S34 B*A/E+B.(E+B)*(E-B) E018 E+D+A*B.D*E*(A*C-1). Contents of the cache are SCUBA/ocean themed - I've tried to make the cache large enough to handle a SCUBA related item or 2 (your BC won't fit though). &lt;b&gt;NB: Please be sure to stow and cover cache properly when you are done!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    </groundspeak:long_description>

She woke up every morning, full of excitement to go to work and later retreated to her home to relax. Many evenings she spent playing with the doggies in the pretty garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But she was alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every night she dreamt of her prince, fighting traffic and deadlines to come to her rescue in his sleek company car. He would bring her a bunch of intersection-bought flowers and pizza from the nearest Debonairs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One morning she had had enough. She stopped looking after the property and refused to do anything until her prince arrived. The property became dilapidated and the garden is a retreat no more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where is the prince who will rescue her from her misery?&lt;br/&gt;Find her house and find the cache.

The dam is fed by a small river on the other side of Nelmapius street, and regularly overflows the street after heavy rain. The dam also quadruples its size after rain, so beware – you might be wading in the rainy season. I’m pretty sure the cache will stay dry though - if you put it back exactly as you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF swag included.</groundspeak:long_description>

Sections of this hedge, named Van Riebeek's Hedge, still exist in Kirstenbosch. The area of the botanical garden was used for the harvesting of timber during this period. The Kirsten part of the name is believed to be the surname of the manager of the land, J.F. Kirsten, in the 18th century. The bosch part of the name is a Dutch word for 'forest' or 'bush'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The handover of owenship of the colony to Britain in 1811 wrought changes in the use of the Kirstenbosch area. Two large land grants were made, with a Colonel Bird building a house, planting chestnut trees, and probably establishing a bath (still extant) fed by a natural spring. The Ecksteen family acquired the land in 1823, and it later came into the possession of the Cloete family (a well-known Cape lineage). It was under their stewardship that the area was farmed more formally, being planted with oaks, fruit trees and vineyards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The land was thereafter purchased by Cecil John Rhodes in 1895. After this point, the area became run-down, with large groups of pigs feeding on the acorns and wallowing in the pools. The famous Camphor Avenue was planted in 1898. The land now occupied by the Kirstenbosch Gardens was bequeathed to the Nation by Cecil Rhodes, who died in 1902.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;--Cape Town Conferences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no need to cross fences if you follow the directions</groundspeak:long_description>

The shore is exposed to the south and the pool is swamped when the heavy swells come in.Whale pods frequent the bay in season, and the road above is known as a good vantage point for whale-watching. This stretch has been known for good angling, such that the nearby Clovelly Station is reputed to be the only station to feature the sign 'no fishing from the platform'. The Station has been closed for years and is derelict, and now the area does see various unsavory characters, so be prepared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further info on whale-sighting &amp; fishing conditions at this location may be found online.</groundspeak:long_description>

the scenic Bo-Swaarmoed pass east of Matroosberg and
Klondyke.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located at a built structure
housing what is purported to be an old slave bell, although to date
we have not managed to find any information on it's origins and
history. Certainly the bell station is close to an old farm
settlement, and several good examples of &quot;langhuis&quot; structures are
immediately across the road, unfortunately at present in a state of
rotting decline.  The bell may therefore well have been used
to summon slaves a few centuries ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the uncertainty of the bell's
historical value, the location definitely possesses the necessary
&quot;&lt;em&gt;genus loci&lt;/em&gt;&quot; to pique interest and warrant a
stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sneaky when
retrieving the cache - you can be seen from miles
away!  The cache is easily retrievable, and
&lt;em&gt;it is not necessary to dig&lt;/em&gt; to
obtain the nano container. Please replace taking care to conceal
the container well.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This quick roadside cache is
situated at a scenic low level causeway over the Breede (or
Bree) River on the Slanghoek Road. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This location has &quot;&lt;em&gt;genus
loci&quot; &lt;/em&gt; (derived from the Latin for &quot;the spirit of the
place&quot;) and is a good place to stop on one's journey to collect
thoughts, have a stretch, and linger to absorb the views. The
Slanghoek Valley road is the shortest route (time-wise) between
Cape Town and Ceres, according to our GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;337km long, the Breede River begins its
seaward journey high in the mountains north of Ceres and flows into
the Indian Ocean at Witsand.  The Breede and its tributaries
flow through no fewer than eleven dams, and well known attractions
in the Western Cape such as the Bontebok Park and Malgas Pont
owe their existence to the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;
The causeway may be underwater after heavy rain, and be subject to
flash flooding after rain falls remotely in the catchment area
further inland, so please exercise caution. 
&lt;strong&gt;Do not attempt a crossing by vehicle
or on foot if the river is in
flood.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache site overlooks the Heiveld Dams catchment area, and provides scenic 360 degree views of the Koue Bokkeveld Valley and Skurweberg Mountains, including some amazing rock formations.  This is slave rebellion country, documented in Andre Brink's &quot;Chain of Voices&quot; story of the 19th century events at Houdenbek Farm, just over the ridge from your destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approaching the cache off the Kagga Kamma / Katbakkies Pass tar road is recommended.  The actual access road to the dam is rough dirt, and although reasonably well maintained on an irregular basis, should be attempted by a vehicle with adequate clearance.   The road may present difficulties in the wet season after heavy or prolonged rains.  If in doubt exercise discretion - you may wait a while to be rescued if you get stuck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should you wish to hike to the cache, park off the road near S32 58.260 E19 24.021, or continue with your vehicle on dirt to the cache, some 4km north. The south dam turnoff is en-route at S32 57.224 E19 23.396, well worth the visit in the interests of expanding your trip.  The cache lies above the north dam at the given co-ordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 4-wheel drive or 4x2 at least is recommended should you desire to continue further along the dirt road in a northerly direction, once you have found the cache.  This section of road is public, but as you will drive through farm land please exercise speed restraint and courtesy.  Your route will rejoin the R303 at S32 53.518 E19 17.652&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are driving south from Citrusdal, take the turn east (left) off tar at the last mentioned waypoint , and continue until the road forks at S32 54.654 E19 21.685  Here you should head EAST (left turn again, towards &quot;Wonings&quot;), and although this looks like a private road it is not; the sign merely indicates the way to the farmer's residences, situated further along and off this road.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The road is well documented both on the Tracks4Africa GPS mapset of the Western Cape, and on Slingsby's &quot;Cederberg- the Map&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A picnic at either dam is recommended.  Also refer Slingsby's &quot;Walks with a fat dog...  and more walks without&quot; for his description of the hike to the Heiveld Arch.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">An easy roadside cache at a convenient stopping point on the R303 Ceres - Citrusdal road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have driven this road many times, and often pause at this point and absorb the views of the surrounding mountains and the rugged rock structures.  It is a quiet spot with little traffic, a lazy river and a strong sense of place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While standing at the bridge, Geelberg Mountain is to the southeast, and the rugged Bokkeveld range to your west.  The main Cederberg road is some 18km east, and you are roughly west of Mount Ceder.  A cup of coffee and a rusk may be appropriate.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h4&gt;This cache provides an opportunity to
visit the first township-based museum in the Western Cape and gain
some insight into the heritage of migrant workers under the
apartheid system in South Africa.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the onset of democracy in South Africa,
the new ANC led government turned the hostels of Lwandle into
family type accommodation. Residents of the area felt that at least
one hostel should be preserved to sustain a memory of how the
system of apartheid had operated, and decided to establish a
museum.  Opened on the 1st May, 2000 (Worker's Day) by poet
and ex-Lwandle resident Sandile Dikeni, the museum is housed in the
old community hall, and features a permanent display depicting the
life, hardships and triumphs of the migrant workers and hostel
life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unusual museum in itself is certainly
worth a visit. I would strongly suggest that, in addition, you
ask one of the guides to take you on a visit to &lt;strong&gt;Hostel
33&lt;/strong&gt;.  To round off your visit, there is a
&lt;strong&gt;township tour&lt;/strong&gt; available, and the &lt;strong&gt;Hector
Peterson Library&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Arts and Crafts
Centre&lt;/strong&gt; (both within spitting distance) will provide
interest for all visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an entrance fee payable for entry
to the museum itself (at time of publishing R20/adult, R10 per
student or pensioner), and the museum is open M-F 09:00-16:00, Sa
09:00-12:00  Tel 021 845-6119 Curator Mr Lundi Mama&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is advised to look for the cache
during the museum's open times, and make use of the secure parking
area on the museum property.&lt;/strong&gt;  The usual precautions
should be taken - lock your vehicle when unattended, and do not
leave anything of value visible in the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further information on the museum is
available at:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lwandle.com&quot;&gt;http://www.lwandle.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please use stealth
tactics at all times - you WILL be watched!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

At the same time he was also engaged in the construction of Michell's Pass. Its name is derived from a Khoikhoi term, meaning a steep pass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Named after the Roman Goddess of Fruitfulness, Ceres village was founded in 1849 when, after the completion of Michell's Pass, the first plots of land were sold. The village lies 150 km to the North-East of Cape Town and after the discovery of diamonds in the interior in 1869, the road through Ceres became the main route to the North. Prince Alfred's Hamlet is a small town outside Ceres. Founded in 1865, it established a municipality during 1876. It is situated 9 km north of Ceres and 160 km from Cape Town. The town has shown rapid growth in industry and business development in the past years. Ceres and the Prince Alfred's Hamlet area of the Koue Bokkeveld offer many pleasant places to walk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The valley produces the finest deciduous fruit in South Africa, and is also well-known for its fresh and dried fruit, fruit juices and natural spring water.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gydo Pass offers spectacular views of the Ceres Valley, especially during the snowfalls of winter, when it becomes the hub of the Western Cape's &quot;Winter Games&quot;.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This easily found cache
is located along an interesting and little known route of some 50
km, as a deviation from the R303 national route between Ceres and
Citrusdal.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cache location was
chosen to encourage geocaching travellers to depart from the
&quot;beaten track&quot; and get some dust on their vehicles and feet.&lt;br /&gt;
The cache title was chosen because we knew we would easily find a
&quot;special site&quot; to place the cache, but later realised that there
are so many places of the same &quot;genus&quot; along the road, that we
simply placed the cache at a convenient spot more or less halfway
along the road (at a good &quot;Pee and T&quot; stop with a view)&lt;br /&gt;
Gen(i)us Loci thus seemed a fitting description, as this one is all
about the journey and not the destination...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Genius Loci&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; n.&lt;br /&gt;
The distinctive atmosphere or pervading spirit of a
place. &lt;br /&gt;
(Latin genius loci : genius, spirit + loci, genitive sing. of
locus, place.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Genus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; n., pl.,
gen·er·a&lt;br /&gt;
A class, group, or kind with common attributes.&lt;br /&gt;
(Latin,
kind.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will travel
through farmers land, so please act responsibly and travel the
(slow) speed limit required.&lt;br /&gt;
Do not enter roads demarcated as &quot;No Entry&quot;, and leave all gates in
the condition you find them, either open or closed.&lt;br /&gt;
Stay on the road or verge, as geocachers do not trespass!&lt;br /&gt;
Above all, do not purloin crops along the route to supplement your
next meal, or kill small animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the appearance
in places, &lt;i&gt;the road is open to public traffic&lt;/i&gt;, and
confirmation as such is published in various sources (amongst
others a current off-road Western Cape GPS map set, and a road
atlas issued by a popular publishing house)&lt;br /&gt;
There is thus no need to feel furtive &lt;i&gt;en-route&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
The farm Morestêr has a controlled gate at the northern end of the
dirt road, which is secured from sun-down through sun-up.&lt;br /&gt;
Generally there is a guard present, who will open for you &quot;after
hours&quot; should the absolute need arise...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our recommendation is
to travel the road in daylight hours with time to spare, or you
will miss out on the scenery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The road is only
surfaced in part, and you will encounter loose gravel, sand or
thickish mud dependant on season and specific location.&lt;br /&gt;
If possible use should be made of a vehicle with above average
clearance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the rain
season there is a low level causeway that floods, and caution needs
to be exercised in crossing this feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep an eye out for
picturesque farm house ruins, incredible rock formations and an
abundance of water that will astonish you as you pass through the
arid landscape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Google Earth format are provided as navigational aids, each within

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Refer to the spoiler photo in the listing. The cache is stuffed into a horizontal cleft in a large rock some 30 odd paces off the cleared area near the farm gate, and hidden by smaller rocks. Walk up the &quot;ramp&quot; on the rock - cache at about knee height. Please replace the covering rocks carefully.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Mozzie Central. So named after its most prolific muggles, set in a beautifull reserve. Enjoy getting lost before finding it, its worth not knowing where you are in this small reserve. Access is from 07:00 to 19:00 only. Wheelchair access to some paths from Main road entrance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This little reserve was once upon a time a brickfield where bricks were baked and later left to become an informal dump. Many moons later this reserve was cleared up and today its an amazing tranquil place in the heart of Knysna. (Tired of the mall? Cross the road and have your mall-bought lunch here.)There is excellent pamphlets at the entrance that gives a better overview of the reserve, its paths and fauna an flora. Please leave a donation and if you find rubbish, remove it.&lt;br/&gt;You can link to the the nature reserve here: http://www.pledgenaturereserve.org/&lt;br/&gt;Take insect repellent because the mosquitoes will suck you dry if you stop.&lt;br/&gt;The original cache contain:&lt;br/&gt;Logbook and pencil&lt;br/&gt;Metal puzzle (try and seperate the pieces without force) Drop it in the next cache with the pieces joined again.&lt;br/&gt;Crazy bean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A big thank you to the management team that is so positive about caching and especially to Mervin for helping me. If you feel like it, there is often full moon walks offered for a small fee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK3CFVC - Parking&lt;br/&gt;S 34° 02.050 E 023° 02.632&lt;br/&gt;Park anywhere you like.

Few people can reach even the lower branches, but maybe you may find a funfair up there or perhaps a goose that lay golden eggs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for the Lost Falls, here was once a rest area. (If you would like to see this place restored as a picnic site, please make suggestion to MTO Forrestry.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remnants of the old stairs may still be seen.The trees here is Karri Gums, planted in 1926. The tree at the cache is the third tallest tree in South Africa at 71.5m. The &quot;Big Tree&quot; next to the N2, a few kilometers away, is in comparison a paltry 36m. Of the Karri Gum species, this is the tallest in Africa. The tree is on the list of Champion Trees of South Africa. Its listed as number 128. The mounds next to the trees is just the normal process of gum trees shedding bark. Enjoy the crunchy spongy walk! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yip, I use &quot;local camo&quot; please renew the camo when you replace the box, there is no shortage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Driving into the forestry is not permitted.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is my first hide, done on my son's 1st birthday. This cache is an easy walk, but don't attempt it barefoot or in high heels. The tracks are abandoned and often used by fishermen. Beware of mugglers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This find is easier than you may think, but not easily visible. The stones mark its old resting place, but it was too hard to get out with muggles around in that spot. Best is to sit down on the track and rest for a while, poke around a bit, but don't be too obvious in case a muggle is watching. If the muggles is close by, don't look for it. A big magnet holds it all together and its within arms reach.&lt;br/&gt;The bungy cord around the box just slips of the tabs, don't loose it and please put it back over tabs before placement. Look carefully where the box was, putting it as far back into the corner as possible, else the muggles may see it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initial contents: Metal puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;Travel bug.&lt;br/&gt;Baby gloves (used by my son in winter).&lt;br/&gt;Crazy bean.&lt;br/&gt;Scripture verse.&lt;br/&gt;Smelly foot.&lt;br/&gt;Pencil and log book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tip: If at the parking and you see a muggle on the second bridge, third pillar from the far bank busy fishing, come back later. Binoculars may help spying the spot and of course recommended for bird lovers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This walk is always fun. Since the Outeniqua Choo Choo does not run the route anymore, this is perhaps the closest you will ever get to the days of steam trains. If the muggles spoil your retrieval, the scenery will make up for it.  You can cross the bridge all the way to the other side of the lagoon and enjoy a view of the heads. At the level crossing turn right to Lake Brenton and discover the area bit. There is often kite surfers at Lake Brenton and plenty of bird life. Terns often use the bridge for a perch, and you can get so close to them you can almost touch them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;A13CAVZ - Parking for a bridge too far&lt;br/&gt;S 34° 02.302 E 023° 02.396&lt;br/&gt;Park here or further east at the waterfront.&lt;br/&gt;S13CAVZ - GC3CAVZ Stage 1&lt;br/&gt;S 34° 02.548 E 023° 01.972&lt;br/&gt;On 2012/02/09 in the middle of the tracks was a nest with two eggs.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As the name implies, this beautifull setting has been all but forgotten. This is Brackenhill Falls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was once a great picnic spot. How it came to be so neglected must be a story all by itself. You will find the original walking trail skirting the cliffs an easy safe walk, although a bit overgrown. The trail goes to the old picnic site just above the pools. You will see smashed picnic tables in the vicinity. Amazing views is now obscured by trees, but the viewpoint still have a clear but narrow view of the falls. Old Google earth archives show the lawns of the past. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I remember picnics and lots of shade where there is today only a heap of fallen trees and stumps. Given it was part of a plantation so I don't mind the removal of the alien trees. Maybe one day this place will be resurrected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow the waypoints to drive here or use a mountain bike or simply walk. The dirt road is fair and a car can be used, but drive carefully. There is one ditch that need carefull negotiation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can cool off in the pool below the first cascade. You can climb down the rocks just on the other side of the stream. Or right above the main fall, there is a steep path you can follow down if you want a quick swim.&lt;br/&gt;(Only jump from the rocks when you know its clear below you. The water is deep.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow the waypoints to the cache, there is no GPS route available for this one.&lt;br/&gt;Stay on the road, don't drive around the plantations. You are allowed to hike and cycle in the plantation.&lt;br/&gt;Only enter during daylight hours. If you find a chain across the road you will have to walk. Its only 1.5km and an easy hike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please cover the cache well with the stones and wedge the stump in as you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original box contain:&lt;br/&gt;Pad Lock&lt;br/&gt;Metal puzzle (try seperate the pieces without force)&lt;br/&gt;Qatar Coin&lt;br/&gt;Light&lt;br/&gt;Baby sandels&lt;br/&gt;Scripture verse&lt;br/&gt;Logbook and pencil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like to see this spot restored please contact MTO Forestry and suggest restoring it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK3CN3D - GC3CN3D Parking&lt;br/&gt;S 34° 02.921 E 023° 09.782&lt;br/&gt;Park here, its as close to the cache as you can drive.

Found with HovelJ.

Was relaxing on a rainy Sunday afternoon watching documentaries and updating the Oracle. On viewing the eventual updates, noticed that there was a new Opencaching listing close to home. Although not a popular caching platform in this area, I decided to claim the FTF before the cache hounds sniffed this one out.

So off in the rain I dashed and met up with HovelJ who had just done the Sundial cache. So I let him know that there was a new 'different' cache up for grabs and we quickly headed down the trail to claim this one.

Did this have anything to do with Time and Relative Dimension In Space? Unless you crack the Chameleon Circuit, you'll never know.

These and other interesting facts can be found by taking the tour through the unusual large structure nearby, for which there is a small charge (R10 per adult, and R5 per child at the time of planting the cache).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, you don't need to take the tour or pay anything to locate the cache.  Please take care and watch small children near the cache location as there may be some vehicle traffic around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a convenient spot to park a few metres from the cache location, in the shade of a coral tree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you are in the vicinity, you can also start your hunt for the multi-stage cache &quot;The Bathurst Roundabout Renewed&quot; (GC18MZW), the first stage of which is hidden nearby. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This virtual site takes you back 253 million years - 50 million years before the first dinosaurs...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this time - called the Permian Period, Africa formed part of a supercontinent called 'Pangea' and this Karoo area, as we know it today, painted a very different picture from what does today. At the time the area around the present day Nieu-Bethesda was covered by huge meandering rivers which flowed in a northerly direction. In the floodplains, many pre-historic animals roamed freely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, the existence of these animals are proved by fossils found in this area.&lt;br/&gt;Take the time to visit the Exploration Center at the listed coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;It has a wealth of information about the pre-historic animal- and plant life of the Permian Period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to log a find on this virtual cache, you have to find the pass phrase which is the name of the father of the famous paleantologist after whom this centre is named.  Only his first name is the pass phrase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also take a half-hour stroll with a guide to the nearby Gats River bed to find real fossils. The guided tour starts at the Fossil Exploration Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fossils are protected by law and may not be collected or traded!!  Only take photos!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can, please send us a photo of your fossil discoveries for our album! Send them to 'teamginger@gmail.com' . (Note that this is totally optional and not a requirement for logging a find on this geocaching site).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope you have fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;This cache is listed with variation as an Earthcache on Groundspeak's geocaching.com site and called &quot;Uncle Jimmy's Bones&quot;. </groundspeak:long_description>

This RDP House's quality has already been rejected by 'council' once and then re-established by the Ginger-municipality, here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANT:  The house itself is fixed and cannot be removed from its 'foundation'.  Please be gentle when retrieving the container with logsheet from the house.

From the guard house they cannot see the ossewa, but ensure that you are always out of sight of the guards by keeping to the “back” side of the wagon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photography could work well here as a front to finding the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main road going past the cache is quite busy, so please be careful who may be watching. Suggest you park your car to hide you from the traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a magnetic nano, but not the usual kind.  Please replace it exactly where you found it.  Please wipe it dry if you can if it is wet.   &lt;br/&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;Note 30 June 2012: The wagon was temporarily moved from it's spot for restoration and to revamp the garden.&lt;br/&gt;The wagon is now in plain sight and not at the listed coordinates, but the cache can still be found. Cachers will need to use more stealth, as it is in the open with lots of traffic and muggles passing by.&lt;br/&gt;I'm not changing the cache coordinates for now - as the wagon should move back there sometime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;This cache is also available on Groundspeak's geocaching.com site. </groundspeak:long_description>

Here you will visit the bust monument of a well known Afrikaner man in South African history.&lt;br/&gt;Born on 14 July 1893, this man served as Prime Minister of South Africa from 1954 to 1958.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Write down this man's initials to use for calculating the coordinates of waypoint B.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint B: S26 05.zyw E027 46.xyz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If one counts letters in the alphabet (A=1 and B=2 etc.), determine which two numbers each of the letters in the initials recorded at waypoint A, represents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;x = the number representing the second initial.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiply the two initials' numeric values. The second digit = y.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;z = the number representing the first initial divided by 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;w = z - 1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At waypoint B you will find the statue of another famous man in South African history.&lt;br/&gt;This man was born in Cradock, South Africa on 10 October 1825. He was ten years old with the commencement of the Great Trek. He became a leader and negotiator in the struggle to regain independence of the Transvaal Republic. He is recognized as one of the builders of the Afrikaner nation in South Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note the following to calculate waypoint C:&lt;br/&gt;(1) What is this man holding in his left hand?&lt;br/&gt;(2) What is the word that is written above the person's name on the plaque?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint C: S26 05.abc E027 46.cde where&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a = e = the number of letters in the word written above his name on the plaque minus 3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b = c - a&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;c = number of letters in the name of the item in his left hand (use the English name for it) plus the number of B's in this word&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;d = 2 * b&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On April 12 1877, the South African Republic was annexed to the British Crown. Repeated protests were made by the burghers against this action. Then came a great gathering of burghers at Paardekraal (8-14 December 1880), where it was decided to set up a Triumvirate, with full power to act, consisting of Paul Kruger, Piet Joubert and MW Pretorius.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between five and six thousand armed men attended that gathering and&lt;br/&gt;swore to stand together, to the death if necessary, until their independence had been restored. As proof of this adherence to this national movement, each burgher placed a stone on a cairn, which was to be a lasting monument to their national pledge. Following on this, the War Of Independence broke out and freedom was regained within a few months.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1890 the Government erected a monument over the sacred pile of stones which had been set up at Paardekraal. The Paardekraal Monument has since played an important role in the cultural activities of the Afrikaans speaking community and the development of Afrikaner Nationalism in South Africa. The stones which had composed the original cairn were removed by British soldiers in 1900 and deposited in the Vaal River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint C is the final coordinates where the cache can be found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLEASE NOTE: The area where this treasure can be found, is surrounded by an electric fence to keep vagrants and vandals out. The committee in charge, as well as the caretaker who stays on the premises, is aware of the cache (but not its exact location).&lt;br/&gt;To gain access to the area, contact 'Sid Mann' at 083 227 3260 and tell him you are a geocacher coming to find the cache at the monument. He&lt;br/&gt;will arrange with the caretaker, Hugo, to open the gate at S26 05.479 E027 46.851.&lt;br/&gt;I recommend that you arrange getting access in advance, if possible, to avoid disappointment.&lt;br/&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;This cache is also listed on Groundspeak's Geocaching.com site and is called &quot;Tonteldoos XII - Transvaal se Onafhanklikheid&quot;  </groundspeak:long_description>

We took everything out of the old container and moved it into the new holder, except for a large metal washer (too big), the washer is on the pole just behind the cache.

The container has been placed back in position with a lot of rocks covering it.

PLEASE DO NOT drop the rocks on the container - that is why the previous container cracked!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a virtual cache in the Kruger Park. No traditional caches are allowed in the Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;James Stevenson-Hamilton was born in Dublin, Ireland, of Scottish parents, in 1867. He later joined the British army and served in the Anglo Boer War (1899-1902).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the war he was offered the warden ship of the Sabie Game Reserve by the Milner Government of the Transvaal. He became involved in the welfare of the Park and the continued existence &amp; development of it is largely due to his dedication and sound administration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He married Hilda Cholmondeley in 1930 and they had 3 children. &lt;br/&gt;He retired in 1946 (the same year as his friend and colleague Harry Wolhuter) and settled with his wife on his farm Gibraltar, 10 km north east of White River. He died on 10 December 1957 at the age of 90 and his wife died on 10 January 1979. Although a grave was prepared for him on top of the Stevenson-Hamilton Rocks, it was his and his wife’s wishes to be cremated. Their ashes were left to the wind on 10 April 1979 near Shirimantanga (Stevenson-Hamilton Rocks), 12 km south of Skukuza, in the place he served and loved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The co-ords will take you to the parking area. You are allowed to get out of your vehicle at this place. Take a walk around the rock and get some nice views over the Bushveld. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember that as in any other place in the park, you get out of the vehicle on your own risk. Watch out for sharp teeth and claws that might be lurking in the bush, or in the trees, or behind some rocks, or on top of the rocks, or . . . . I think you get the picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this lookout point you will also find a plaque against the rock. To log your find you have to find the date in the right bottom corner of the plaque and supply it via the code phrase function as it appears.</groundspeak:long_description>

is dedicated to my daughter Zoé (one of the two most beautiful
girls in the world) to celebrate her 8th birthday: May the sun
always shine upon you, and may the angels always guide you... We
travelled 750km to celebrate her birthday at her favourite place on
earth! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



 
&lt;br /&gt;





&lt;p&gt; In 1822 the Royal Navy sent the ships Leven, Barracouta,
and Cockburn to survey the coastline. The captain of the Barracouta
was Lieutenant A.Vidal, after whom Cape Vidal was named, and Leven
Point was named after the sloop HMS Leven. The various points along
the coast: Jesser, Liefeldts, Gobey &amp; amp, and Hully were named
after officers on the ships who died of Malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cape Vidal is a beautiful stretch of beach, where one can swim,
fish, sail or snorkel. It is part of the Eastern Shores Nature
Reserve of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. In the year 1999 the
coastal area between Maphelana in the south and Kosi Bay near the
border to Mozambique in the north, including the wetlands around
Lake St. Lucia, were declared a World Cultural Heritage Site by the
UNESCO. Since then the reserve is called the iSimangaliso Wetland
Park (previously St. Lucia Wetland Park) and comprises 328000
hectares. It protects a stunning variety of unique habitats:
lagoons, reet and papyrus swampland, mangroves and swamp forests,
different types of thornveld and savannah, subtropical coastal
forest, dunes and sandy beaches as well as coral reefs off the
shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park’s centrepiece is Lake St Lucia. Although several rivers
feed into the lake, it is not a freshwater lake, but a 60 kilometre
long, shallow lagoon with varying degrees of salinity. It runs
parallel to the coast and has its mouth south of St. Lucia, which
might close up in times of drought. Because of the vast and
permanent supply of water, a large number of game animals,
especially antelope, hippopotami, crocodile and elephant are
attracted to the area. The Eastern Shores Nature Reserve features
the highest dunes in the world (150m high). The St Lucia Lake is
home of over 2000 crocodiles and 700 hippos, many antelope and a
very rich bird life. More than 350 species of birds, including
pelicans, flamingos, fisheagles and herons have been recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

 2 Billion years ago, a meteorite of about 10 kilometers in diameter

&lt;p&gt;'n Gedenktuin is ter ere van die 1441&lt;br /&gt;
gestorwenes vanuit die twee Potchefstroomse&lt;br /&gt;
konsentrasiekampe, op 'n terrein langs die NG Kerk&lt;br /&gt;
Potchefstroom-Oos, aangelê.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 


  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next to the
Potchefstroom East Dutch Reformed Curch a memorial garden was
erected to honour the 1441 deceased from the Potchefstroom
Concentration camps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volgens gegewens&lt;br /&gt;
is bykans 300 vrouens en kinders uit die eerste&lt;br /&gt;
kamp begrawe. Laasgenoemde was tussen die&lt;br /&gt;
Wasgoedspruit en die Spoorwegstasie geleë. Uit&lt;br /&gt;
die tweede kamp, waar die Vyfhoekgedenktuin&lt;br /&gt;
tans is, aan die bopunt van Burgerstraat, het 1141&lt;br /&gt;
sterfgevalle voorgekom. Hier was vroeër 'n groot&lt;br /&gt;
begraafplaas langs die kamp, maar nou vertel die&lt;br /&gt;
twee monumente, 'n gedenknaald en 'n senotaaf,&lt;br /&gt;
die aangrypende verhaal. Aan die gedenknaald is&lt;br /&gt;
twee graniettablette as gedenkstene aangebring,&lt;br /&gt;
een op 16 Desember 1918. Dit is onthul deur die&lt;br /&gt;
weduwee van generaal J.H. de la Rey en lui so: &lt;/p&gt;



  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;According to history, approximately 300
women and children from the first camp (situated between
Wasgoedspruit and Spoorweg station), were
buried.   Previously there was
a larger memorial next to the camp, but now the two monuments, a
memorial needle and cenotaph tell the whole compelling
story.  Two granite tablets are attached to the
memorial needle as memorialstones – one on 16 December
1918.  It was inaugurated by te widow of Genl.
J.H. de la Rey:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;From the second camp, where the Vyfhoek
memorial garden is situated at present (at the top of Burger
street) 1141 people died.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GEDENKSTEEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
Ter Eere van de&lt;br /&gt;
967 kinderen, 117 vrouwen en 57 mannen&lt;br /&gt;
Die omgekomen zijn in de kamp alhier&lt;br /&gt;
Gedurende den oorlog van 1899-1902&lt;br /&gt;
“Hun nagedachtenis zal voortleven”
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GEDENKSTEEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;onthul deur die&lt;br /&gt;
Staatspresident mnr. C.R. Swart&lt;br /&gt;
By die geleentheid van die oorhandiging van die&lt;br /&gt;
Kampkerkhof Vyfhoek&lt;br /&gt;
Aan die&lt;br /&gt;
Afrikaanse Kultuurraad&lt;br /&gt;
Op 9 Nov. 1963&lt;br /&gt;
“Ek dank die moedertrane&lt;br /&gt;
sade van nuutopgestanenasie.”&lt;br /&gt;
Totius&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was revealed by the State President Mr
C.R. Swart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;during the handover of
the  Camp Ceremony Vyfhoek to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the Afrikaans Culture Council on 09 Nov
1963.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; SENOTAAF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die ander monument, 'n senotaaf, is ongeveer&lt;br /&gt;
100 m van die gedenknaald opgerig. Dit&lt;br /&gt;
verteenwoordig die honderde stukkende grafstene&lt;br /&gt;
wat daar vroeër was, as 'n simboliese graf. Dit is 'n&lt;br /&gt;
agtkantige struktuur uit graniet waarop die name&lt;br /&gt;
van die kamp se oorledenes verskyn. Die name is&lt;br /&gt;
as volg in twee verdeel en volg alfabeties: dié van&lt;br /&gt;
kinders tot en met die ouderdom van 15 jaar –  en&lt;br /&gt;
op die ander gedeelte dié van persone ouer as&lt;br /&gt;
15 jaar. Uit gegewens op hierdie senotaaf blyk dit&lt;br /&gt;
dat 967 kinders, 117 vroue en 57 mans in hierdie&lt;br /&gt;
tweede Potchefstroomse kamp omgekom het.&lt;br /&gt;
Aanvanklik is die terrein op ongereelde basis&lt;br /&gt;
deur studente skoongehou, maar toe dit later&lt;br /&gt;
baie verwaarloos geraak het, het die Afrikaanse&lt;br /&gt;
Kultuurraad ingegryp en is die terrein amptelik&lt;br /&gt;
in 1963 aan hulle oorgedra deur die Vyfhoek-&lt;br /&gt;
Noord-Bestuurraad. Fondse het egter steeds&lt;br /&gt;
ontbreek om iets monumentaal daar uit te rig.&lt;br /&gt;
Met die daaropvolgende bemoeienis van die&lt;br /&gt;
Sentrale Burgergrafkomitee, is 'n groot verbetering&lt;br /&gt;
bewerkstellig deur netjiese mure, 'n tuin en die&lt;br /&gt;
oprigting van die senotaaf. Sedert 1963 sorg die&lt;br /&gt;
Potchefstroomse Stadsraad vir die instandhouding&lt;br /&gt;
van die gronde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;em&gt;The
other monument, a cenotaph, is erected approximately 100m from the
memorial needle. It represents the hundreds of vandalised
gravestones that were previously there, as a simbolic grave.It is
an eightsided structure made out of granite that displays the names
of those deceased in the camp.  The names are
split in two parts and are listed alphabetically: those of the
children aged 15 years and younger, and those of the people older
than 15 years.  From details on the cenotaph it
seems that 967 children, 117 women and 57 men died in this second
Potchefstroom camp.  At first the terrain was
randomly cleaned by students, but after it was neglected it was
officially handed over to the Afrikaans Culture Council in 1963 by
the Vyfhoek North Management Council.  However
they still lacked the funds to erect a monument. 
With the help of the Central Burger Burial Committee improvements
were done in the form of walls, a garden and the erection of the
cenotaph.  Since 1963 thePotchefstroom
Municipality
is
responsible for the maintenance of the grounds. &lt;/em&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The longest oak lane in the Southern
hemisphere:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potchefstroom boasts its own living national
monument: the longest oak avenue in the Southern hemisphere, which
was declared a national monument in 1975. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 700 oak trees were planted in 1910 from
the Agricultural Centre to the Lakeside Resort: An oak avenue of
6.48km long comprising of Botha, Retief, van Riebeeck, Kock, Kruger
and Tom streets as well as Calderbank Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To commemorate this living national monument a
bronze plaque was erected in 1977 on the corners of Lombard and
Kruger streets, on stones from the old North Bridge. The oak avenue
was planted in terms of a resolution passed by the Town Council of
Potchefstroom and the Parks and Recreation Committee chaired by BR
Gericke on 12 September 1910.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The avenue of 6.48km has since become an
important feature of Potchefstroom.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is the line taken from a Wilfred Owen poem, that he penned shortly before his death in active service during World War I in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 28-line poem, which is written in loose iambic pentameter, is narrated by Owen himself. It tells of a group of soldiers in World War I, forced to trudge &quot;through sludge,&quot; though &quot;drunk with fatigue,&quot; marching slowly away from the falling explosive shells behind them, towards a place of rest. As gas shells begin to fall upon them, the soldiers scramble to put on their gas masks to protect themselves. In the rush, one man clumsily drops his mask, and the narrator sees the man &quot;yelling out and stumbling / and flound'ring like a man in fire or lime.&quot; The image of the man, &quot;guttering, choking, drowning&quot; permeates Owen's thoughts and dreams, forcing him to relive the nightmare again and again. Owen then talks about how he has to throw the man into the back of a wagon and the man's &quot;hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Owen, in the final stanza, asserts that, should readers see what he has seen, they would no longer see fit to instill visions of glorious warfare in young men's heads. No longer would they tell their children the &quot;Old Lie,&quot; so long ago told by the Roman poet Horace: &quot;Dulce et decorum est / Pro patria mori&quot; (&quot;It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country&quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The title and the Latin exhortation of the final two lines are drawn from a poem of Horace (Odes iii 2.13):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori: &lt;br/&gt;mors et fugacem persequitur virum &lt;br/&gt;nec parcit inbellis iuventae &lt;br/&gt;poplitibus timidove tergo.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&quot;How sweet and fitting it is to die for one's country: &lt;br/&gt;Death pursues the man who flees, &lt;br/&gt;spares not the hamstrings or cowardly backs &lt;br/&gt;Of battle-shy youths.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These words were well known and often quoted by supporters of the war near its inception and, as such, were of particular importance to soldiers of the era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE MONUMENT&lt;br/&gt;A newly built memorial at Linden SAPS was officially opened on 19 November 2004. The memorial was erected in honour of all policemen and -women who have sacrificed their lives to protect and serve the community. It consists of a wall of remembrance in honour of 86 police officers who have died in the line of duty since 1994. &lt;br/&gt;During the ceremony white doves were released as a symbol of peace. This symbolism is also reflected in the sculpture comprising of assault rifles and a dove. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Management of Johannesburg SAPS came up with the initiative to pay tribute to all our fallen heroes and their families annually and a fixed memorial venue had to be erected for this purpose. The memorial cost an estimated R200 000 to erect and was made possible through extensive contributions by business partners from the local community of Johannesburg. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deputy Area Commissioner of Operations, Director Jenny Naidoo, who coordinated the project and managed the event, said: “The newly built memorial will be utilized to host future annual services. At the same time, this memorial site provides family and friends access to a specific venue to remember late members or friends.”&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Information supplied by Insp Amanda Roestoff, Johannesburg Area Communication Services &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is humbling to walk in this garden and see over 100 names of SAPS officers that have died in service in the Joburg area since 1994.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A really poignant monument with 3 R3 rifles in a tripod with a dove rising from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please ask an officer in the Charge Office for permission to go to the monument. They are generally more than willing to let you look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a camoflagued nano bison tube - too small for trade items - please bring a pen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep an eye out for rabbits, guinea fowl and even a guinea pig! They roam wild here.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Linden has often being called the &quot;Boere Ghetto&quot; of Johannesburg. Home pf many famous Afrikaans citizens, from Louw Geldenhuys, NP van Wyk Louw, Karen Zoid, Gerard Viviers, DJ Swanepoel (Swanepoel escorted Winston Churchill to jail in Pretoria during the Anglo Boer War) and scores of other artists, academics, politicans and musicians.&lt;br/&gt;The suburb was named after Johannes Jacobus Rabie van der Linde, a farmer from Philippolis in the Free State. He co-owned the south western corner of the farm Klipfontein with Louw Geldenhuys, who farmed fruit and vegetables on the neighbouring farm of Braamfontein. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They both bought their portions of the farm in 1896 but in 1898, on the death of Van der Linde's second wife, he had to find £2 195 for inheritance dues, and so, together with Geldenhuys, they divided up the farm with a view to selling off the portions as lots, a procedure that had already made Geldenhuys a wealthy man with the sale of sections of Braamfontein. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lots did not sell as quickly as Van der Linde had hoped, being so far out of town - some 8km - with access limited to three dirt tracks from town. Then the Anglo Boer War broke out, and everything was put on hold. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the war the effort was revived and an auction was held, but not much was sold, and Van der Linde had to take out a mortgage on his portion of Klipfontein to cover the inheritance costs, and put 84 more stands up for sale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After several setbacks - land was rented to tenants who then couldn't pay and the British government declared Van der Linde's portion outside Johannesburg's boundaries - by the 1920s the land had finally been sold and consolidated into small holdings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The soil turned out to be very fertile - the acidic clay was perfect for growing peaches - and soon flourished with orchards. Once farmhouses were built, roads to Linden were laid out, and in 1932, £3 600 was put aside to tar Rustenburg Road, the thoroughfare on the eastern border to the &quot;fruit producing area in the vicinity of Linden&quot;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By 1934 between 300 and 400 families were living in Linden, and &quot;most appear to be engaged in fruit farming&quot;. Water was not a problem - private wells or boreholes supplied good quality, plentiful water. One large dairy, Gieskins, believed to have been &quot;the biggest private retail dairy in South Africa&quot; at the time, supplied residents with fresh milk twice a day from its milking, cooling and bottling operation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An early corner of Linden &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Truluck describes how the farms gradually disappeared and how in the 1950s the Afrikaner elite moved in, resulting in the suburb being referred to as the &quot;Boere Houghton&quot;, and by the late 1950s Linden was a &quot;fully developed urban suburb&quot;. Nowadays there's a mix of English and Afrikaans speakers in the suburb, with Albertina Sisulu listed as the suburb's most famous resident. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the remaining fruit trees can be seen in the garden of the Paputzi's restaurant in 4th Avenue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A charming guide through early suburban Johannesburg, the brochure sells for R15, and is available at various shops in Linden, at Exclusive Books in Hyde Park and Estoril Books in Cresta.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is large traditional LnL cache in Marievale nature reserve. This one is to say thanks for visiting our caches. There are not many large caches&lt;br/&gt;for geocachers in RSA so this is for you. You should find it easy -&lt;br/&gt;follow the hint exactly. You are probably in a hurry at this point&lt;br/&gt;and we will make it an easy one. Please cover the cache&lt;br/&gt;well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope you enjoyed the walk and/or drive and I hope you learnt something new. In this birding reserve there is in each and every area that was shown to you something unique. You probably noticed how certain birds stayed&lt;br/&gt;together in one area. On your way to this one I hope you noticed the wild flowers. I also hope you noticed the mine dumps and the efforts that were made to protect the reserve. I hope you noticed the rocks around the base of the mine dumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this final location you will find a man made rock barrier. Was this a railway line or was this another attempt to protect the reserve - you comment will be appreciated. Please stay clear of the mine dumps and do not visit them. You do not want to be exposed to cyanide. I included&lt;br/&gt;a parking way point; please do not proceed any further - there are hidden barbed wire in this area. I tried to clean up as much as possible but please park at this point and walk to the cache. Thanks and well done.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Not much is known about the Old Powder House. It lies alongside a track which is the last remains of the first road in the valley. The road came up from the beach at Clovelly, roughly along the same route the existing tar road follows,  across what is now the golf course and on up the valley. Much of this road has now been lost due to development or become completely overgrown. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 1830's the area was granted to the Smit family who built their home next to the Old Powder House, but the buildings where abandoned around 1950 and timber was removed from the roof and doors, leaving only the remains of the stone walls we see today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There seems to be some disagreement over the actual age of the building. Some say it dates back to the 1680's and was used by the miners while others say it was used by the Dutch defences in 1805.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park at the Sunbird Environmental Recreation Centre, S34° 06.675 E018° 24.495. Follow the track from the trail head, up the slop and around to the left at the top. Continue along this track until your reach the ruins.</groundspeak:long_description>

Silvermine East parking area, Sunbird Environmental Centre and
Boyes Drive (Kalk Bay).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the well marked paths to S34° 06.712
E018° 25.650. At this point, marked by a cluster of large
boulders, head off the path in a South Westerly direction towards
S34° 06.724 E018° 25.603. There's no need for &quot;bundu
bashing&quot; as the terrain is mostly short grasses and rocks, with
patches of open ground and rudimentary paths. Continue on to
S34° 06.733 E018° 25.529, passing a small &quot;cave&quot; as you
reach the top of the rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, head in a Southerly direction to
S34° 06.799 E018° 25.534, then in a South Easterly
direction up the rise to S34° 06.830 E018° 25.557, marked
by a large boulder. Now head South Westerly across the rocks to the
cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternate Route&lt;/strong&gt;


Follow the well marked paths to the TMNP cairn at S34° 06.919
E018° 26.059. Head off along the Cave Peak path for a short
distance to reach S34° 06.933 E018° 26.050. Take the path
heading South West. The path is a little overgrown in parts but is
easy to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At S34° 06.976 E018° 26.020 take the
path heading West. As it winds its way along the ridge it can
become indistinct in places but easy to follow, marked by small
cairns. At S34° 06.830 E018° 25.557, marked by a large

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Prior to 1801 the government held the monopoly
on milling. But with the removal of government control, many small
mills began to spring up. In 1820 Johannes Brand saw the economic
potential of having a mill here for himself and local farmers, as
the nearest mill at the time was over the mountain towards Cape
Town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mill is situated on what was Welcome Cottage
Farm and is thought to have operated from 1820 to sometime in the
1850s. It was a popular gathering place for farmers in the area and
this may be how the farms name originated, but by the 1860's the
mill had fallen into disrepair because farmers had switched to
growing vegetable and raising cattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an overshot mill with a 4m diameter
water wheel. From the middle of the 18th century the overshot mill
was acknowledged as the most efficient source of power. Water was
collected in a small mill pond upstream and channeled down the
millrace to the wooden launder over the centre of the wheel. The
launder probably had some sort of hatch to regulate the water flow.
All that remains of the mill pond are a few dressed stones,
boulders and a short dam wall, but it is all silted up. The course
of the millrace is still visible in parts but much of it has
collapsed and it is not known if this was lined with wood or just
plastered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walls of the mill were constructed from
boulders, dresses stone and clay &amp; cobble filling. It was
finished with a fine lime/shell plaster inside and out. The floors
where clinker, a hand-fired brick used in flooring tiles and ovens
of the time. The wheel was almost certainly constructed from wood
as cast and wrought iron wheels did not come into general use until
the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the height of the remaining walls, the mill
appears to have been a two-story building consisting of the main
room, which housed the milling machinery with an upper level, and
an annex which is thought to have been added later. The purpose of
the annex is unsure, but it may have been used as the millers
quarters. There is also mention, in historical records, of a bakery
near the mill, but all physical evidence of that building has
disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach the cache, you can park at S34° 09.140
E018° 24.430 and from here it is a short walk to the ruins. You can
also walk down from the start/end point of the

Glen View cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note, the gates to the parking area are
only open between 07h00 and 16h00 daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternate Route:&lt;/strong&gt;


On those occasions when the gatekeeper has not done his job or you
arrive a bit late and don't want to take the chance of getting
locked in, you can do the following:- Park at S34° 09.183 E018°
24.730 and head down the trail at S34° 09.178 E018° 24.721, marked
by a large wooden frame. Follow this path along the fence line for
about 150m at which point the fence comes to an end. From here you
can head straight across the fields to the cache site.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A few meters South you will need to climb up a large rock, with a small cactus near it's base. Once on top of this rock, head South a few more meters, up a convenient sloping rock to the top.

His wife then reported him missing to the police. The police was searching for 3 days but no sign of him was found. The police divers found the body on 17 March 2010 near the dam wall. An investigation into his death came to the conclusion that no foul play is involved.

This cache is since archived and it was replaced with a micro on the Vaal Japie close by - this one did not lasted long before it also went to cache heaven. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This location is in the Industrial Park and quite a couple of industries are presented here.

There is no need to cross the river with your vehicle. Trust me - you will not like it to get stuck here. Rather do the bunny move - hop onto rocks and soon you will be on the other side. I hope the key word is &quot;dry&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scan the area for any nastiest that want to get to you; then close your eyes and listen to the wind and/or the silence. This is a different world and you will hear some weird bird sounds in this area. From here the going will get tougher but the little valley is getting deeper and more isolated. But I prefer not to take cachers down into the valley as it is not safe from this point onward. Please check for any slithering animals before removing rocks. If this river is in flood please leave the cache alone - it will be unsafe to attempt it. Take care and enjoy it.</groundspeak:long_description>

Mike built the pass to access a part of the little 'berg to conduct research on the effect tree plantations would have on water sources. A weather station is build in this area equipped with all sorts of equipment that records all there is to know about water in this catchment’s area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No ordinary sedan vehicles are allowed to drive this road and access will be denied for sure; 4x2 is the minimum requirement for this pass. During snow and rainy conditions a 4x4 could be needed. In dry seasons you do not need any specialized skills. You can also walk the pass; it is only 6.5 km long. You can also use your mountain bike. This pass is perfect for the person that hates walking but still would like to enjoy the Drankensberg and the scenery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entrance fee is R25 per person and access is to the left of the gate. You have to report to the hotel reception and here you have to pay for the use of the pass at R50 per vehicle. From here you have to go back to the main gate and the security will allow you access onto Mike’s Pass. To make it worth the while we decided to add some caches to the one existing cache in this area. At present only one cache exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: We believe that not many visits will be done so it will be unfair to the owner to drop his TB or coin inside a cache on this road. If you have an urge to drop a TB or coin please communicate your intention with the owner of the trackable before you drop it in a MP cache. If he agrees so be it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy it.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The following series of caches is in the Drakensberg on a panoramic pass called Mike’s Pass. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mike's Pass has been named after Mike De Viliers who built the pass by hand along with Italian Prisoners of war in the 1940's. Mike built the pass to access a part of the little 'berg to conduct research on the effect tree plantations would have on water sources. A weather station is build in this area equipped with all sorts of equipment that records all there is to know about water in this catchment’s area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No ordinary sedan vehicles are allowed to drive this road and access will be denied for sure; 4x2 is the minimum requirement for this pass. During snow and rainy conditions a 4x4 could be needed. In dry seasons you do not need any specialized skills. You can also walk the pass; it is only 6.5 km long. You can also use your mountain bike. This pass is perfect for the person that hates walking but still would like to enjoy the Drankensberg and the scenery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entrance fee is R25 per person and access is to the left of the gate. You have to report to the hotel reception and here you have to pay for the use of the pass at R50 per vehicle. From here you have to go back to the main gate and the security will allow you access onto Mike’s Pass. To make it worth the while we decided to add some caches to the one existing cache in this area. At present only one cache exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: We believe that not many visits will be done so it will be unfair to the owner to drop his TB or coin inside a cache on this road. If you have an urge to drop a TB or coin please communicate your intention with the owner of the trackable before you drop it in a MP cache. If he agrees so be it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy it.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Should be an easy find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While driving around in this area I came across some strange and sometimes good locations in Volksrust. At one stage we found a German restaurant with the best German food available in Mpumalanga. We had lunch and we enjoyed their company. For obvious reasons we did not plant any caches at this restaurant. We then decided to visit the oldest part in Volksrust. We have seen good examples of houses build for an era that passed long time ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this location you will find various locations which were unknown to us until today. First you will drive pass the golf course with a par of 73. Then you will find the small airport on your right. Today was a busy day and we noted two aeroplanes touching down. Then you will find the off road club entrance. Then you will find the raceway. Yes, they have a raceway. Maybe not of international status but it is there. Ok, sort of being a raceway. :) If you carry on you will find the cemetery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I drove pass this town so many times but never bothered to stop and to have a closer look at the town. There is a lot to offer and we even discovered that there is a waterfall close by. I hope you enjoyed Volksrust.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In a time of war there are always two sides. But bravery and courage do not take sides and we should recognize a brave attempt even if it is not in our favour. At this location you will find the grave of a man that received the Victorian Cross for action against the Burghers. This is the grave of Sergeant John James Clements. He was born in Middelburg in the Old Cape Colony on 19 June 1872. He died on 18 June 1937 only one day before his 65th birthday and was buried in Newcastle. On 24 February 1901 Clements who was a corporal at that stage received a serious shot trough the lungs at Strijdenburg. This is his story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On this specific day a scouting part which consisted of Lieutenant Harvey, Corporal Clements, a intelligence officer and four men were busy with a scouting party near a farm about 5 miles south of Strijdenburg when they heard a party of Boers were near. They managed to capture one of the Burghers which informed them that there is another 5 burghers close by on the hill. They left one man with the captured Burgher and they stormed the hill. During this attempt Clements were wounded when he received a bullet through the lungs. The Burghers then called for their surrender. Instead the 28 year old Clements threw himself between the Burghers and with his revolver managed to shot three of the Burgers. Two Burghers died at the spot and the other 3 then surrendered. With other words a total of 4 Burghers were captured. For his action he received the Victorian Cross.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sergeants Clements went to King Edward’s Coronation in the Diamond’s Horse contingent and when they returned on 15 February 1902 he came back to South Africa and started farming again. However Clements who was also a boxer was always ready for another “scrap”. He enlisted in Botha’s scouts for the German South West Campaign in the Great War and he served his time until the autumn of 1915. He then returned and carried on with his farming activity until his death. A total of 8 children were born out of this marriage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The VC (Victorian Cross) was introduced by Queen Victoria on 29 January 1856 to reward acts of bravery. This medal is awarded at the time of writing only 1356 times. It is been told that the metal used is from the Russian cannons captured at the Siege of Sevastopol. But this is questionable. Only 13 medals were awarded since World War two. A medal like this can reach over 400 000 pounds on an auction today and is considered very rare. The most medals ever issued for one single event was at the Battle of Rockies drift. It is also very important to note that this medal takes preference to all other medals and are always worn on the left side of all the other medals when you view the person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*** Please note that the cache is not in the cemetry due to respect. His grave number is M79 and for fun you can search it. ***</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a traditional cache. You will search for a small little LnL container under the wall on the outside of the wall. Every time I pass Volksrust it is hard to believe that there are no caches in this town. So today we paid a quick visit to see if we can get Volksrust on the geocaching map. We were amazed to find Anglo Boer War graves near the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Battle of Laingsnek (28 January 1881) fourteen men of the Boer forces died. One of them was the 25-year old son of D.C. (&quot;Swart Dirk&quot;) Uys, the famous Voortrekker leader who, after the battle of Amajuba, took part in the peace negotiations at O'Neil's Cottage. The family, grief-stricken at their loss, felt that the younger D.C. Uys, as well as his comrades, should be commemorated and so erected the tombstone in their house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Swart Dirk Uys died in 1910. In the years to follow, the original Uys house fell into disrepair and the municipality of Volksrust has therefore erected a stone wall in close proximity to the original foundation around the grave. The original tombstone is a small round little monument and it is further on near the dam wall. This round monument was built to enclose the tomb of young Dirk Uys, killed at the Battle of Laing's Neck. His grief-stricken parents brought the body back and buried it in the lounge of their farmhouse so that he would always be with the family! The house has long since disappeared but the grave remains. To visit the original monument you will have to enter and pay the entrance fee as day visitor. We will plant a cache at this location at a later stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will enter the Mahawane Resort road from the N11. The resort is further down this road. There is no entrance fee and the graves of this listing are considered public domain. As soon as you enter this road from the N11 you will have to keep your eyes open for a small dirt track on your right which will end at the graves. A long time ago there was a sign pointing to this grave yard but this no longer exists but you will find the original pole on your left hand side. If you end at the access gate of the resort then you have to make a U turn and search for the access road to the graves again.</groundspeak:long_description>

This particular blockhouse was part of a group of blockhouses that stretched from Colesberg and Bethulie to Aliwal North as this was the border of the then Cape Colony. I believe that they were connected with barbed wire with tin cans to warn of any crossings. Next to the N1 you will find another blockhouse at cache GC250E. Here the blockhouse was protecting the railway line. At this particular spot the railway line was cut through a hill and it was easy for the Burghers to attack it from above. After several attacks the blockhouse was build.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But forts were built even before this war. You can also view Fort Merensky (cache GCR5QF). Here the German missionaries build a fort to protect themselves against attacks which were frequent.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is no pen/pencil please take a pen with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is always difficult for me to visit the graves of innocent children that passed away in the concentration camps. These camps were erected by the British during the Anglo Boer wars. I always experience a feeling of sadness and a feeling of shock rather than a feeling of hate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The British was not equipped to deal with the concentration camp situation. Tents and food were scares and the war took longer than anticipated. The British started previously with a scorched earth policy and they destroyed many cattle and very little food production was seen. Language and culture was a massive barrier between the two nations. The Burghers stayed on farms before this war and any sicknesses was in many cases isolated and contained on the farm and it could not spread easily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At Standerton one of the worst winters was experienced. Many sicknesses was aggravated due to overcrowding and sleeping on the cold earth. The burghers were now concentrated in one area and with a weaken immune system these sicknesses spread quickly through the camps. This had a huge negative impact and deaths occurred quickly. Every morning an ox wagon would do his rounds through the camp – picking up the corpses of the ones that passed during the night. They were then transported to this location to their final resting place. We can only imagine the hardships that were experienced. Black people and children were laid to rest at another location. But the suffering was sometimes even harder for them. They received less food rations and less medical attention and the Burghers shared their food with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this location you will also see a little building near the graves of the children. Inside you will find a lantern which is no longer burning. To me it is a symbol of a little light that never had the chance to shine.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache consists of the normal goodies in a small LnL container. It is close to the road and it should be easy to find. There is no plastic bag. I forgot to include a pencil so please make sure you have one with you. There is an easy way and a hard way. Hard way is to budu bash through the tall grass and blackjacks. The easy way is to find the walking trial crossing the road. Try to find the yellow marker on your right hand side and it will guide you to the cache. While you are at the cache sit down and listen and you will understand the cache name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is close to my “home” and it is placed to remind me in future of a different time in my life. This is my story. You can also skip my story and enjoy the reserve, the animals and the trip around the reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My story:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I accepted a job offer in Alberton as a Service Manager in charged of a production department and engineering and to make it a little bit more interesting I am directly responsible for all projects. It also expected from me to give support to a factory in Botswana. Soon I will be logging caches that side. I decided to stay in this reserve at the camping site for security reasons. On 12 May 2009 I parked my caravan and I pitched my tent with one hell of a struggle. Damn they do not design this as a one man operation. I was the only one at the camp site at that time. My daughter is now in grade 7 and we can not move her to another school. If I can sell the house in Ermelo then we could be together again but until such time this is my “home”. Sometimes we do a lot for our children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I got used to the routine, the cold and the people that come and go on a weekend. During the week it does get lonely when there is no one camping. I use this time to study. Every second weekend I do go home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One night at about 02h30 walking in the dark I spotted a movement about 10 meters away from me. The eyes were that of a jackal. I switch on the torch and I noticed that he is not moving away. I then checked the area if there are more as a pack is extremely dangerous. You can tame this animal but there will always be a dark streak in them. Many of these tamed ones turned on their owners. They are dangerous when they are hungry and they will attack. I stood my ground and he stood his ground but my training told me to stay put and to watch for an attack. He then sneaked behind a tree and started to move out of the area but he kept on turning back. He then left to my relief. On Monday 15 June 2009 at 00h23 my mother passed away while psalm 23 was read to her while I was here.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Today everyone is equal and this area is available to everybody and you can visit this location. Maybe Pachaltsdorp will surprise you. The gravel road to the cache is good and should not be a problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a long time I wanted to see where it ends.

You have to cross a very narrow vehicle bridge to get to the island if you follow auto routing. Place take it slow across this narrow bridge and keep your eyes open. If you are afraid of the bridge or your vehicle is too wide then you have to take the alternative road at S34 03.204 min E22 13.677 and park your vehicle at the designated parking area. Furthermore to find the cache you will have to wade or swim across a river depending on circumstances. There is a foot path near the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The additional waypoint will take you a plaque (now missing) that was erected on rocks for a person that made the ultimate sacrifice. For nearly 30 years I visited this location to pay my respect and to remember his brave action and for many heroic incidents in my army days. This year (2009) the plaque is gone due to some idiot that stole and sold the copper plate for a couple of cents. I can’t remember the details on the plaque. If I remember correctly then this person saved 6 people from drowning that was caught in a strong current. Six times he went into the sea and six times he got one person back on land. On his seventh attempt and totally exhausted he disappeared under the waves and he drowned at this location. The plaque is gone but this deed should be remembered. If you were a witness to a heroic deed or heard about such a deed please feel free to publish it, if it is sensitive please change the names of the persons involved. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;This is a traditional cache with the normal goodies placed on a hill with a view over the dam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Right now you are on your way to the Brummer Dam. Very few people actually realize that there are two dams in this area. There is no entrance fees to this dam. A gravel road will guide you but there is various off-road tracks that will take you directly to the cache if you are brave enough. In this area several quad bike competitions are held quite regularly. Try to follow the sequence of the series and all will be fine. The terrain can be rough and I made the cache finds relatively easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From this point you will have a clear view on the Willem Brummer Dam. Please enjoy it and keep your eyes open for any muggles and other strange elements and nastiest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town Ermelo is supplied with raw water from the Douglas dam and the Willem Brummer dam. These dams are approximately 8 km to the north west of the town. Other water resources is the Usutu-vaal system which is in turn fed by the Jerico, Morgenzon and Heyshope dams. The raw water is purified at the northern water purification works, which has a purification capacity of about 13.2 Ml/day. The southern purification works has a capacity of about 5 Ml/day and it is used as a standby during emergency situations such as draught periods. Enjoy it.</groundspeak:long_description>

If it really starts to pour then you will probably need a 4x4. In extreme weather you could consider a boat.

Use the house number to calculate the final waypoint. It could be tricky to find the correct route; please does not drive on any routes with a no entrance or private property sign. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This house in de Jagerstreet has many legends attached to it. One of the legends are saying that the females “entertained” the British forces which was a long way from home. However, I will use the more acceptable and romantic version in this listing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the scorched earth policy of the British this particular house was left alone and no harm were done to the house or its occupants. It is alleged that one of the daughters of the family that stayed in this house during that period had some sort of relationship with a captain of the British forces. The family was instructed as per legend to raise the British flag on the day Ermelo was torched and attacked. The captain issued an instruction to his men concerning this house. Anyone harming the inhabitants or their property will be shot. The British experienced no resistance and Ermelo was torched except this house and a church. A few days later the British was attacked at Chrissiesmeer by the Burghers and many British soldiers perished. Maybe this was the end of the relationship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today this house is the oldest house in town and is declared a national monument. Please do not disturb the owners of this house as they were not informed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find the cache do the following.&lt;br/&gt;1. Confirm that the red bicycle is in front the house to ensure you have the correct one. The cache is not at or near the house. &lt;br/&gt;2. You need to determine the number of the house.

Colley suffered a defeat at each of these battles and he paid the highest price at Amajuba where he was killed. We will describe the battle of Schuinshoogte – also called the Battle of Ingogo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colley’s motive was to march to Pretoria. His plans received a major blow at Laingsnek where he suffered a huge loss and defeat. Colley had no choice – he had to withdraw to Mount Prospect and he had to wait for reinforcements. Communication with Newcastle, supplies and the transport of the sick and wounded was a critical task. The Burghers was an enemy who was on the move all the times and who did not fight or act in the established conventional warfare at that time. The slow moving transport from and to Newcastle quickly became a target for the Burghers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commandant-General PJ Joubert was in charge of the Burghers and he was supported by Commandants Nicholas Smit, J.D. Weilbach, A. Pretorius, Stephanus Roos, D.J. Malan, Joachim Ferreira and Gideon Erasmus. Most of these men took part in the Battle of Laingsnek and their spirit and morale was good. They done many raids and reconnaissance trips – even past Newcastle and the movements of Colley was well known to Commandant-General PJ Joubert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biggest disadvantage of the British was that they believed in conventional warfare which is more or less static. Parties will dig in, both will open fire and when the one party weakens the winning party will do a charge with bayonets. The Burghers on the other hand was mobile and they believed in a strategy of hit and run. The Burghers was famous for their accurate fire even on horse back with a gallop. The khaki clothes the Burghers worn at that time more or less blended in with the environment. They became an invisible enemy. In contrast the British 60th Rifles wore dark green uniforms with light helmets and both did not blend well with the South African veldt. The gunners and the mounted brigades were also equipped with dark uniforms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colley decided to teach the Burghers a lesson and he decided to use a show of force to stop the raids on the logistics. As the British commanding officer he had to gain some face after the defeat he suffered at the Battle of Laingsnek. This show of force took place on 8 February 1881. Transport was scheduled to leave for Newcastle. He allowed them time to move along and he then followed with a strong contingent. His motive was to ensure that they get pass the Ingogo river and the long gently sloping hill known as Schuinshoogte. The idea was to meet up with the transport from Newcastle and to escort them back to camp while the wagons destined for Newcastle then just carries on. At least he would be able to defend them in the Ingogo area against the irritating raids of the Burghers. Colley himself took charge of two 9 pounder guns, two 7 pounder guns and men totalling about 273. They reached the present Valley Inn on the banks of the Ingogo River and it appeared as if his master plan is working. No contact with any Burghers was made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colley had to make sure that there is a safe return route for him and he left the two 7 pounder guns and one Rifle Company just before crossing the river. They started the long climb and as they reached the plateau (Schuinshoogte) fire was drawn from about 200 Burghers. The Burghers did not plan this attack - this was a spur of the moment attack. Colley reacted and he deployed his men in a semi circle guarding both sides of the road. The battle started with full force. The Burghers were relieved as they ran out of ammunition. The rapid and sustained fire power confused the British and they felt overpowered. At this stage the gunners had a very difficult task as the target was moving all the time as the Burghers went from cover to cover. The impact of the guns was insignificant. The moment the gunners started to reload accurate and consist fire from the Burghers caused heavy casualties among the British. The mounted troops attempted a charge but accurate fire from the Burghers killed most of their horses and they had to return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colley ordered Macgregor to move a company from the right flank across the road to stabilize the left flank. Macgregor was killed and the company received a severe blow and most of them were killed in the following hours that followed. One can only admire the courage of the British not to raise the white flag under this severe fire but they stood their ground for hours in the killing field. At one stage the Burghers and the British was only 40 meter apart but no attempt was made to do a bayonet charge. The British was famous for this charge but this time for some unknown reason no attempt was made. A heavy downpour was experienced at about 17h00. This was a relief for those that were exposed to the blistering sun and suffering from thirst. But this quickly turned into a very chilly night and with nightfall both parties withdrawn. Some of the wounded probably died because of this added factor. At about 21h30 the British moved away and they left their dying and wounded on the battlefield. They destroyed their ammunition as there were just enough horses left to move the guns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But their misery had no end. The Ingogo was now in flood and Colley with very little ammunition left decided not to cross at the established drift in fear of an ambush. Another 8 men were washed away and they drowned. The next morning a British party returned and they attended to the wounded. On 9 February Lieutenant Wilkinson was also washed away while attending to the wounded. This occurred on his 4th crossing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end the British lost 4 officers and 62 men. About 4 officers and 63 men were also wounded. The total loss calculates to 142 including the soldiers that have drowned. The Burghers had 8 men killed and 6 that were wounded of whom 2 died at a later stage. This was the beginning of the end and the Battle of Amajuba still had to come. Colley received another serious blow and he should have known that the Burghers are outclassing him with their tactics and their superior shooting skills under command of Commandant-General PJ Joubert. His final lesson and his final sacrifice were now due in 19 days at Amajuba – the place of the doves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also another interesting site at this location. As you walk down to the grave site you will notice a pile of rocks on your right hand side. This pile of rocks is the ruins of a fort that was build during the Second Anglo Boer. Have a good look at the rocks and you will notice the outlay of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reference Material and recognition:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;South African Military History Society - Journal</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is a regular and is situated in a garden. It is road side cache and is dedicated to the cachers in Piet Retief. Muggles could be a problem but that is part of the challenge. A camera and a relaxed attitude will help you to find it. Weekends will not be good - too many muggles. Late afternoon or early morning is maybe the best time. Use your vehicle as a shield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Piet Retief is a very interesting town and the following is worth noticing. If you pass the town on your way down to the coast you have the impression that this is a layback town where nothing of interest is occurring which is not true. My intention is not to create a commercial cache but to highlight some of the features of this town without focusing on specifics or on entities. If you need detail and exact locations you can contact the Info Centre at Piet Retief on 017 826 5477.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geography:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This town is situated in the Assegai Valley. Nearest border post for entry to Swaziland is Bothashoop at a distance of less than 20 km from Piet Retief. Mahamba border post is open until 22h00 and is approximately 30 km from Piet Retief. Rainfall is about 1000 mm per year and frost is not a problem. Between the years 1900 and 1911 large scale of wattle was planted in the surrounding areas. Piet Retief is surrounded with about 150 000 hectares of plantations and today pine, gum and some wattle can be found. The estimated number of residents in this region is about 147 000 people. The municipality area covers roughly 4 868 square kilometer. The town Piet Retief have about 53 919 inhabitants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Piet Retief is named after the Voortekker Piet Retief who was killed by Dingaan, the Zulu King, in 1838. The town was established by his descendants in 1883 on the farms called Osloop and Geluk. This town was nearly completely destroyed during the Anglo Boer wars. During 1886 an independent state was formed nearby and was called the Republic of Little Free State. It even had his own president and this lasted for more than 5 years until 1891. Today this area forms part of the Mkhondo Municipality which was established in 2000. Mkhondo means “animal or foot trail on natural terrain”. Mkhondo municipality forms part of the Gert Sibande district - one of the three district municipalities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arts, culture and monuments:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are eight indigenous and numerous other cultures presented in this town. The Germans forms the main core of the other cultures and it is still spoken as a first language. Several small villages and farms still bear German names. There is even a German school and church nearby. There are several monuments in this area. There is a war memorial and a gravesite of the British soldiers that died during the Intombe Wars. You will also find the Heinrich Filter monument – he was killed by Swazi fighters with spears after his son shot and killed a Swazi which was related to the Royal family. The Dutch reformed church is declared as a national monument and is the work of Gerhard Moerdijk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science and nature:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several game farms in this area. Various 4x4 tracks and an active 4x4 community and club can be found in this area. Forestry forms a main part of the activities in this area. Close by you will also find the Oribi conservatory – the only sanctuary in South Africa for this antelope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sport &amp; Entertainment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cycling is a favorite sport and several routes exist. Bird watching is also high on this list. A nice golf course is available and fishing is available in well stock dams and rivers. Geocaching is also an active sport in this area and a number of cachers can be found in this area. The cache concentration is acceptable with new ones added at regular intervals. Several hiking trails are available in this area in some of the most beautiful locations and endemic aloe specicies can be found in this area. There are several farms that offer horse riding to the wetlands and to the surrounding mountains.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a traditional small cache and it should be an easy find. It is an 750 ml LnL plastic container. It is a view on Heroldsbay. This place holds many memories from my late father. This was one of his favourite fishing areas when he was still with us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My brother dives at regular intervals at this location. He collects the sinkers that are lost by fishermen. In this area there are huge holes where the sinkers collect with time due to the wave action and it is easy to remove. The sinkers are then melted down as bars. The bars are then stocked and sold in bulk to recover some of his diving cost. It is sometimes quite funny to see what people use as sinkers. During one of these dives one of the fishermen recognized one of his sinkers with his initials on it and wanted it back. My brother told him the “The sea has taken it and he gave it to me, you want it then you pay for it, this is the rule of the sea”. To cut the long story short he was not a very happy person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this area we spotted a massive great white shark when I was about 10 years old. My brother was busy with a dive when this monster moved in and started to circle where he went down. This one was by far the biggest one ever seen by my family. Not even in the open seas. My father got worried when dive time elapsed with no sign of my brother. Twenty minutes after final dive my brother came crawling up the hill from our behind. He swam down to the bottom and was swimming around the rocks at Rooikransies to get away from this shark. He was a little bit shaken and 30 years later he never met a similar one.</groundspeak:long_description>

No need to climb through the fence - just walk pass the entrance and around. If you follow this road you will end at the Mahawane Holiday Resort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volksrust is a town in the Mpumalanga Province. The main industries are beef, diary, maize, wool, and sunflower seed industries. One Escom Power Station operates close to this town. This town was established near the site of The Battle of Amajuba. Dorothea de Jager, daughter of Dirk Uys, named the town Volksrust (People's Rest). Literally the people were resting again after the British were defeated at Amajuba.Volksrust is situated some 1 675 m above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and hills that witnessed many historical happenings. The town was established in 1885 on a farm that was used by the Boers to recuperate after the battle of Amajuba (1881), during the Anglo-Transvaal War of Independence The Amajuba battle site features a memorial to British casualties on the spot where Gen Colley fell. The British suffered catastrophic losses at Amajuba.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the second Boer War a concentration camp was built in Volksrust where many Boer children and women died. You will find a monument in town with regards to this. About 772 people died at that camp, mainly children. A bit further on with this road you will find the monument erected for those that fell during the Battle of Laingsnek which includes Dirk Uys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have time you can also visit the Convention Bridge on Grensspruit which have been proclaimed a national monument. In 1894 Britain and the Transvaal Republic decided to strike a new agreement that put Swaziland under Transvaal control. A railway carriage was hauled to the middle of the bridge so that the conference table could stand astride the borders. President Kruger sat on Transvaal ground and Sir Henry on British ground.</groundspeak:long_description>

Unfortunately time ran out and we had to go back home. Luckily the eastern bunny bought a new cache for KZN cachers this time around and I hope you enjoy it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a traditional cache in a LnL container with the normal goodies. The actual size is between a small and a regular. No plastic bag is fitted around the cache and it is covered with rocks, branches and leaves. Cache is between the path and the river and you should find it easy. Please enjoy the walk and the little Gorge on your way. Take time to look at how some of those trees are hanging on right above the cliff edge. While you walk down to this cache listen to the sound of the water and smell the freshness of the air. The area should be safe but as always do not go alone and keep your eyes open. There is no need to do any bundu bashing; the pathway is need and tidy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need a high clearance vehicle to get to the way point given below. If you have a BMW then you are in for quite a stroll. A second way point is given for cachers that do want to risks their vehicles. Ok, the above do not apply to Wazat.

Arose in the wee dark hours of a cool African Autumn Morning to hunt an FTF. Opted for a 50/50 Parking spot between the LC and HC point... amazingly almost any vehicle that has Toyota in it's name is a 4x4....

Took a very nice stroll along the babbling brook enjoying the awakening of the forest in the half light of the rising sun, and heard the last call of an African Wood Owl before it settled in for its roost and then was treated to a most amazing song of an early morning rise for all the other feathered inhabitants. This is one of my most favourite green areas to visit as it is still so untouched by outside influences. At GZ played along with the GPSr compass and went bushwacking... not bad at this time of day, but soon resorted to reading the topo map more carefully and then went looking without technical assistance. Shortly thereafter the cache was located. FTF log signed... this one did not get away from me.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a small cache stashed inside the public area near the river. There is no pen/pencil please take a pen with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today this area is a recreational area where people come to enjoy themselves. Little bit of fishing, braaing and quad biking can be seen. A nice area where one can relax next to the Vaal River. However, more than 100 years ago this was a place of suffering too great for words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The location is part of the Anglo Boer Wars which took place during 1899 and 1902. The cache is at the original Standerton concentration camp; which were situated next to the Vaal River. This was one of the camps with the highest death toll and mostly children have perished during this period. During this period abnormal cold conditions were experienced; it even snowed during 1901.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The children that passed away were not laid to rest at the cache area but was transported via ox wagon to another location and were laid to rest at that area. There is a cache called &quot;It ended here&quot; if you need to visit this location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Close to the cache location you will notice a small monument which serves two purposes. The one side is to remember that 22 074 children has perished in these camps in less than 3 years. That is about 7358 children in a year. On average about 20 children died each day for 3 years. It is hard to understand the fears, the pain and suffering these innocent children had to endure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other side of the monument you will see the names of the children of Magrietha Swart van Roodekrans who all died at this location. It is worth noting the details and the dates.</groundspeak:long_description>

Mike built the pass to access a part of the little 'berg to conduct research on the effect tree plantations would have on water sources. A weather station is build in this area equipped with all sorts of equipment that records all there is to know about water in this catchment’s area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No ordinary sedan vehicles are allowed to drive this road and access will be denied for sure; 4x2 is the minimum requirement for this pass. During snow and rainy conditions a 4x4 could be needed. In dry seasons you do not need any specialized skills. You can also walk the pass; it is only 6.5 km long. You can also use your mountain bike. This pass is perfect for the person that hates walking but still would like to enjoy the Drankensberg and the scenery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entrance fee is R25 per person and access is to the left of the gate. You have to report to the hotel reception and here you have to pay for the use of the pass at R50 per vehicle. From here you have to go back to the main gate and the security will allow you access onto Mike’s Pass. To make it worth the while we decided to add some caches to the one existing cache in this area. At present only one cache exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: We believe that not many visits will be done so it will be unfair to the owner to drop his TB or coin inside a cache on this road. If you have an urge to drop a TB or coin please communicate your intention with the owner of the trackable before you drop it in a MP cache. If he agrees so be it.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is micro inside a tree. It should not be difficult to find but it could prove to be a real test of stealth against many muggles. Just settle down and enjoy the area and the muggles will relax. Please do not drop any TB's or coins due to muggles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This location will not have any meaning to many cachers visiting the cache. But this is a very important location for Ermelo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On 29 August 2008 a very special event took place at this location. A human chain was formed with children and teddy bears to attempt a world record. The facts of this historical event were as follows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chain was formed with 2581 children each with the same number of teddy bears. (Never knew that they could get that many children together in this small town) &lt;br/&gt;The children were mainly from the primary schools in Ermelo but some of the scholars of the senior schools also joined. &lt;br/&gt;The chain was more than 2.6 km long and was a close loop all around the street block where this cache is hidden. &lt;br/&gt;The previous record was done with 1714 children. &lt;br/&gt;The teddies were donated afterwards to the Greater Rape Intervention project. (GRIP) &lt;br/&gt;The Misty Knights Mpumalanga motor bike riders also helped with the event and the organization. &lt;br/&gt;To be recognized as a world record the chain had to form a close loop and must be held close for a time period of 10 minutes. &lt;br/&gt;The main brain behind the event was Jaco Breyl and his wife Corlani organized it.&lt;br/&gt;For primary children to hold on to the teddies to their left and right for a 10 minute period is a lot to ask. The news reporters were present as well as people from the Guinness book of records. My biggest fear was that my daughter will drop her teddy in front of the whole world. At one stage it was a near reality, a chopper with the observers came down in the middle to watch the chain. A lot of dust was blowing around in the area but the children hold on to their teddies with their eyes closed. After 10 minutes the alarm was sound and all the children thrown the teddies in the air. It was quite funny to see more than 2500 teddies getting airborne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The record was set. Everybody was happy and everybody in town was watching the news that evening. To their dismay only 5 seconds was shown on television with no reference to the record or of Ermelo itself. But the event was mentioned in the Beeld and the local newspapers and that was fine. We planted the cache so that everybody can remember this event in years to come and to say thanks to the children. While you attend to the cache follow the street with your eyes and try to imagine the circle of children holding more than 2500 teddies.</groundspeak:long_description>

Also please note that this cache is only available from 08h30 to 16h30 as requested by owner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We normally get onto the N1 as fast as possible and then we “fly” down to the Western province as fast as possible. Yesterday we made a decision to take the back roads and roads less travelled. This time we used the Maloti road back to Ermelo. It is shorter than the N1 route we normally use. The scenery is fantastic along this road. Most people are adhering to the 100 km/hr speed limit and the road is not that bad. While the sun was setting the mountains created a different atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We then notice this little rest area – the only one worth stopping for on this road. What impressed me about this location is the artistic feeling that I experienced. The person running this establishment is using ordinary items to create something different from them. Even the benches are not made of plastic and steel but from something natural. The food we received was great and the atmosphere was farmyard style. I do not want to say too much but this is worth visiting. The reason for this is for you to discover.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a traditional cache which contains only stuff for the girls. I have seen a lot of females, even an 11 year old, climbing this peak. I wanted to do something special for the female cacher that is doing this hike. However, the males could also find it and log it. The cache itself is a regular container hidden underneath a rock and covered with rocks. The location is to the right when you face George on top of the peak. It is the nearly on the edge. I placed two branches at the location for an easy to find. If you remove the cache please use a stick. Make sure the cache is well hidden. The cache container is a Tupperware container which locks on all four sides and is marked as a geocache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache will lead you away from the ordinary and up the mountains above George. On a clear day you can even see Mosselbay. The views are fantastic and it is breath taking. But you need to work hard to see it. You do not need to make use of any climbing equipment. The cache is placed for the nature lovers that do love hikes and beautiful views in a relative safe location but which are still close to a town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is cell phone reception on the mountain and it is possible to contact your backup team as needed. I included some additional waypoints. There is a clear cut path going up the mountain. Do not litter and please no open fires. No need for sleeping bags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache location is one of my favourite places and it holds very dear memories of my younger days. I was about 11 years old when I climbed this mountain for the first time. Back in those days we took about 2.5 hours to get to the top and the quickest time down was done in 40 minutes but this was at running speed. Today 20 years later it is a different story. Danie Brown and I ran around these mountains during our PW Botha technical high school days. Even during my “Voortrekker” days we climbed this mountain as a team. This mountain will always be special to me. This is the place where I feel the closest to my God than any other place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenery from the peaks is some of the best you will experience. We placed the cache in such a way that it is easy to find. You done a lot of work up to this point and you should be tired. Sit down and relax for a while and admire the view. Do not sit down too long or else you will get stiff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will be difficult to do the George and Cradock peak on the same day unless you start early and you are fit. If you are in a group you will have to split in two groups to get to both of them.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Outeniqua Hike - Cradock Peak (1582 meters ASL)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a traditional cache which contains stuff for boys. The cache itself is a small container hidden underneath a building at the corner. The cache is to the right when you face the Karoo on top of the peak. It is also the furthest building. Make sure the cache is well hidden. Please trade only small items. The cache container is a Tupperware container which locks on all four sides. The forestry department is describing this hike as a hike of “very high exertion” with a distance of 19 km and as an 8 hrs hike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The views are fantastic and it is breath taking. You do not need to make use of any climbing equipment. Some easy rock climbing is needed at one specific area close to the top. Please be careful at this point. Make sure that you are stable before moving to the next rock. Leave you backpack at the bottom if you are too tired. The cache is placed for the nature lovers that do love hikes and views in a safe location which is near the concrete jungle named George. Please use these caches and additional waypoints as beacons to determine your travelling time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We placed the cache in such a way that it is easy to find. Sit down and relax for a while and admire the view. From here you have a clear and unobstructed view of the Outeniqua mountain range. You also have a view of the Karoo. Please use your binoculars – you will be amazed what you can see from this point. If you are standing in town you will hardly recognize this peak – most people do not even take notice of this peak. But Cradock is higher than the George Peak. Please stay clear of the ledge on the left hand side. You do not need to go there – you have to go across the rocks on the right hand side. There is a yellow marker marking the point where you have to go up. The ledge on the left has a sheer drop – not good if you are tired. Take it slow, use one hand or foot at a time. Test the hold before moving the other hand or foot. The normal cacher should be able do this without any problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will be extremely difficult to do the George and Cradock peak on the same day. If you are in a group you will have to split in two groups to get to both of them. Please enjoy this hike – it will stay with you for the rest of your life. The beauty is too difficult to forget.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Outeniqua Mountain Cross (602 meters ASL)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a traditional cache which contains the normal goodies. The cache itself is a small container hidden inside a crevice covered with a large rock. The cache is to the right when you face George from this location. Make sure the cache is well hidden. Please trade only small items. The cache container is a Tupperware container which locks on all four sides. You will encounter one railway tunnel on route. The railway line is not in daily use and Forestry approved this walk. The tunnel is situated where the railway line is forming a 90 degree bend and you must make sure that this line is clear. There is a walking trail that you could use to bypass the tunnel if needed. There are many paths to this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache will introduce a different world to you - from the ordinary to a location high above George. The motive for this cache is to show you some beautiful scenery along a relative safe route without any special climbing equipment. This cache is for the ones that are not interested in going up the mountain or as a test trial before doing the Cradock and/or George peak caches. There is a path leading directly to Power Station which bypasses the tunnel but thus was not tested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To attempt this cache please park at waypoint as given below. The Forestry Offices have a register that you need to complete before the hike. This is the safest way. There is no monies payable. This cache will bring you to a location where a cross is erected which can be seen from George. During the night this cross is illuminated. This cross is also the symbol of your trip up to George and Cradock peak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a footpath leading from this cache up to George peak but the path is overgrown and very wet with some nasty inclines in certain places and should not be attempted. I used this foot path to plant the three caches. The reason I used this footpath is that you can go directly and quickly to George peak and then to Cradock, with other words all three caches are in line. This path was the cause that I only arrive back at the forestry office at 21h15 with hyperthermia. All plants in this area are pointing downward and you have to move up the incline with bushes dragging you down. The worst is that they are wet and you will stay wet up to waist height for more than 8 hours. The official route is much easier although a little bit longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your way you have to pass the FM transmitters on your way to the cache. You are not allowed to enter this area and you have to walk around the fence and transmitter. Under no circumstances are you allowed to cross directly.</groundspeak:long_description>

The wife and I had spent a long weekend at our time-share at Pine Lake Inn.
Decided to try and break our 'most caches found in 1 day' record as we traveled back home to JHB.
Interesting location!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">By now – only I – Sir Owain Chandler – remained. In my stupor and fever induced incoherence, the mighty ebony warrior would not stop – but continued to his city – an imposing stone edifice that reminded me so much of a rough hewn Camelot. By now I had recovered from the fevers and was strengthened by the small black victuals provided by my companion. My countenance too had decayed in the journey. Apart from becoming lean and firm like the trees along the journey, I had discoloured and was a darkish shade and appeared in many ways like a number of the paler savages that we passed. In the city, the Great Zeembabwi, I was surprised to see that the clerics and controllers were not the large warrior class of my companion and dare I say friend. But there were of paler countenance and had straighter pitchblende hair. They were a peaceful, quiet nation who asked me about gold. This seemed to be their primary aim – and they showed me magnificent golden artefacts from oliphants, camelpards, leopards, leos and sea cows. Also an array of masks used for their pagan ceremonial observances. I quested regarding the ark or a chalice – but to no avail. One of the Dravidian monks seemed to understand more than the others. He and I built a rapport and after many months, he sensed my agitation and frustration. We had formed a common language along with my ebony friend which we called Guni. They struggled with the pronunciation of my name and reffed to me a Chaka. The monk, sWazi, my warrior brother, Zuloo and I discussed many topics and sWazi mentioned the observatories in the south, and the land where the gold (komati) was found. He spoke of a treasure hidden – more valuable and more powerful than any other and of a spot where God left his toeprint after walking on the earth. This was the final part of Issa’s prophecy. So many years had passed, so many friends had passed, so many memories and feeling of inadequacy had passed in my head. Now it was close. I knew it.

We left at the end of the rains – when the food and water was plentiful and the plains were peaceful. Upon reaching a low laying land we set up towards the astronomical observatories. There were a myriad of these structures in every valley and mountain top. Sage observers manned their posts and could report on movement of bodies unknown to me or any from my land. They foretold droughts, rains, the changing of the seasons and could divine prophecies from the stellar bodies. Using the information I provided on the Grail and Ark, we were guided to a grass covered hilltop to wait. We were instructed to build a house like my own and wait for the battle. Then we were to wait more than 100 passings of the solstice and we would find what we sought under a tree that grows nearby. 



Here where you now stand – we have decided to build Camelot – but Zuloo insists we include it to be like Zeembabwi. We will construct our bastion and await the sign of a nearby tree that the treasure will lie beneath .

Another of those caches that has been on my To do list since the day it was published. So glad to get here today. Thought that I may have to give it a skip as they were burning firebreaks and the entire place looked a little apocolyptic with smoke billowing over the entire scene. Reminded me a bit of a battle field aftermath.

Anyone interested in these ruins should look up Dr Cyrl Hromnik - a cape Town based academic who has done a lot of research on this. There is a site in waterval Boven that is a little more documented.

This find is also dedicated to the late Stewart Meikle who did so  much to preserve these sites on Sappi land during the 1980's and 1990's.</groundspeak:text>

Please do not disturb or remove anything at this site. No open flames and no garbage at site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What, may you ask, do the creator of Sherlock Holmes; Mahatma Ghandi and Lord Kitchener have in common with Sappi’s plantations? Unlike the great sleuth, the answer is not quite so “elementary” as one may think. It involves a number aristocratic hedonists, a cover up of national proportions that would have even the most reluctant conspiracy theorists contemplating a Masonic linkage and a hero of seemingly Herculean proportions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Helvetia is one of Sappi’s tree farms just outside Machadodorp in Mpumalanaga and forms part of the Camelot estate. It was also the site of one of the last set piece battles of the second Anglo-Boer war. The battle took place on 29 December 1900, just as the war entered its scorched earth phase with the deplorable concentration camps and mobile guerrilla tactics of the Boers. A cemetery with the remains of a number of fallen British soldiers is still maintained on the plantation and many tourists pay the site a visit each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The brief overview of the battle plan was that the Boers under General Ben Viljoen, launched an early morning sortie against a British garrison on the strategic cross roads at Helvetia. The British were complacent in their defences having all but assumed that the war was over and that they would soon be redeployed to India after some much needed leave. Most officers on site were so nonchalant about their task that they blatantly ignored dispatches from their Head Quarters and did not prepared adequate defence structures or instil any level of discipline amongst their troops. Manning any static position is a rather boring task for the majority of the time. The officer’s felt this boredom and attempted to spice their life up by entertaining each other with evening dinner parties using the garrison’s ample liquor ration and food for the Christmas and New Year celebrations. The officer’s had served together for a reasonable spell and were known to enjoy the good life from documented accounts of their conduct while stationed in Pretoria in the preceding months, which included tennis parties, dancing and socialising with the colonial gentry of the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The consequence of all of this is that the British positions (including the artillery piece – the Lady Roberts named after Lord Robert’s wife) were easily overcome and surrendered with very little fight at all. Of the various emplacements, it was only the King’s Koppie where a Colour Sergeant Johnson took charge of his position in the “absence” of his officer in command. He and his men staged a valiant defence with prevented a total rout of the British position. Johnson won the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) for leading this brave stand. Johnson opted to keep silent about the ineptness of his officer’s according to the unwritten warrior code. He was not even called as a witness to the resultant court martial in case his evidence was contrary to what Kitchener required. After the war, the Regiment sent a simple telegram with the words, “We are mighty proud of you!” to Johnson. All in all this was certainly not the mighty King’s Liverpool Regiment’s finest hour. By first light the Boers had retreated with almost the entire battalion in tow as prisoners of war. Once again the festive rations were imbibed and Gen Viljoen wrote later in his memoirs that about 30 members of the garrison had to be left behind near Dullstroom as they were too drunk to walk. He also recounted how three of the officers had to be woken from their beds to be taken captive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So now that the actual battle had finished, the political intrigue and cover up began. This is the part that had remained “under the carpet” for so many years and Peter Goodship’s research has recently brought to light. Kitchener was devastated at a third consecutive loss a demanded that a plausible explanation was established. The British government were furious as they had been assured that the war was all but over, “Home by Christmas” was the saying of the day, and these defeats were a major embarrassment (especially in the light of a looming election).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The garrison’s commander, Major Cotton, was summonsed before a court martial for surrendering to the Boers. Evidence in his defence regarding the fact that he was recovering from a serious bout of malaria that saw him carried to Machadodorp on a doolie by Indian bearers. This is the Ghandi connection as Mahatma Ghandi organised the bearers for the Regiment. He was also shot in the head by a glancing bullet early in the fracas and spent most of the battle wandering around in a serious state of concussion. The court ignored this crucial evidence and Cotton found himself the sacrificial lamb that shouldered the full blame for the incident.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Cotton bore the full brunt of the political hostilities, Kitchener revoked his court martial a few months later with little fanfare or restitution (he remained a civilian for the rest of his days). His name was also removed from all official War Office records of hostilities and to this day does not appear in any official government records of the Boer War. It is here that Goodship surmises that the Arthur Conan Doyle link fits in. Conan Doyle was vociferous in his comment on the war in South Africa. He publicly questioned the verdict of the court martial, but to no public acknowledgement. Conan Doyle and Kitchener no doubt continued their communication off the record. Both were members of the Masonic lodge and were known to frequent similar social gatherings. It appears that some form of amicable agreement was reached between them that lead to Cotton’s pardon. Conan Doyle received a knighthood soon afterwards and Kitchener was given his promotion to commander in Chief of the Indian Army. And so ends an intriguing part of history that appears to have been brushed aside to further the bigger picture.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">1.0 Machadodorp – Gold, battles, Paul Kruger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the story of Machadodorp during the Anglo Boer War (1899 – 1902). In chronological sequence the following events were important in the history of Machadodorp and the events that took place near Machadodorp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paul Kruger and his men took a decision on 7 May 1900 that Pretoria will not be defended. This was the last meeting of the Volksraad in Pretoria. &lt;br/&gt;The battle of Bergendal that took place close to Machadodorp was probably the most severe of all the battles and it was also the last conventional battle. &lt;br/&gt;Paul Kruger and his entourage left for Machadodorp on 29 May 1900 from Pretoria. &lt;br/&gt;On 30 May 1900 the British forces encircled Johannesburg. &lt;br/&gt;Pretoria was captured on 5 June 1900. The British expected the surrender of Paul Kruger and his Boers with the fall of Pretoria being the capital. This was the “honorable” thing to do – if your capital was seized then it is the end of the war and you surrender. They were not prepared for the toughness and the determination of the Boers. The dream of capturing Paul Kruger and his men with all of the Kruger millions never materialized. Lord Roberts never experienced this honor. &lt;br/&gt;Paul Kruger moved to Machadodorp and announced this village as the capital of Transvaal. This happened on 5 June. He and his men operated from the rail coaches and even some minting was done. Today the coins minted in this town are called the “Machado coins” and it is quite distinct. &lt;br/&gt;It is also worth noting that the area called Machadodorp was surveyed in 1862 and was registered as the farm Geluk 29. A small railway station was established and the station was called Geluk. In 1890 the name of the station were changed to Machadodorp in recognition of JJ Machado who surveyed the railway line. Only during September 1904 was Machadodorp declared a municipality and furthermore declared a town the same year. In other words the village became a capital, then a municipality and then a town. &lt;br/&gt;Buller was appointed in control of all British forces in Natal. Under Buller the divisional troops, cavalry, naval and infantry brigades were combined in a group named Buller’s Natal Field army. &lt;br/&gt;Buller started his advance from Natal and on 2 June he occupied Volksrust. &lt;br/&gt;Buller marched to Standerton and with not much resistance the town was seized. The 1 st brigade King’s Royal Rifle Corps occupied Amersfoort with very little resistance on 7 August. &lt;br/&gt;Ermelo was occupied on 11 August. &lt;br/&gt;On 14 August a squadron of Strathcona’s Horse entered Carolina. Buller was now on his way to Machadodorp. &lt;br/&gt;On 15 August Buller was told to halt his advance and to wait for Lord Roberts to reach Belfast. At this stage the Natal forces were about 11000 men strong. &lt;br/&gt;As the British forces under control of Lord Roberts and Buller advanced the Boers retreated along the Delogoa bay railway line toward Machadodorp. &lt;br/&gt;On 26 July Middelburg was occupied by the British advancing from Pretoria. &lt;br/&gt;The Boers were gathering to the west of Machadodorp at this stage. &lt;br/&gt;By 26 July the 11 th division (British) was spread out all along the line from Middelburg to Balmoral. (British) &lt;br/&gt;Buller ordered his troops forward on 21 August to a location south east of Belfast. &lt;br/&gt;On 24 August the British forces moved into Belfast. On 25th August Lord Roberts arrived in Belfast from Pretoria to take overall command of the British forces. &lt;br/&gt;At this stage Lord Roberts was satisfied that more than enough British soldiers were available for a standoff with the Boers. The British count as a combined force was now totaling about 20000 soldiers. &lt;br/&gt;During the restart of the Buller’s advance on 21 August 1900 the mounted troops secured the hilly terrain to ensure that the Natal Field army could move through these areas as fast as possible. &lt;br/&gt;Early morning on 26 August General French’s cavalry received the instruction to occupy the mountainous terrain north of Belfast and Machadodorp. They were halted due to heavy shelling and accurate firing from the Boers while moving forward on the Lydenburg road. &lt;br/&gt;General Botha established a defence line stretching from Bothasberg (North West of Belfast) to the Komati poort area. This was done during the beginning of August 1900. Their objective was to protect the railway line. Strategically this was their communication line to the world. This protection line was more than 80 km long and about 5000 burgers were used to form this line. &lt;br/&gt;At Bothasberg commandant Dereksen and his Boksburg commando took up position to protect the road from Middelburg to Lydenburg. Lydenburg was the escape route for the Boers and it was needed to secure this area. The Lydenburg commando took position at Steenkampsberg protecting the road from Belfast to Dullstroom. The Middelburg and Johannesburg commando were positioned to the north east of Belfast and they were protecting the Belfast Lydenburg road. The ZARP contingent which consisted of about 70 men took position on the farm Bergendal in some hills. The ZARP were supported by about 1000 burghers on either side but were not directly connected to them. This was a problem and it placed the ZARP in isolation. &lt;br/&gt;For the first time during this war the four state artillery Creusot guns were under the command of General Botha. The problem was that Botha had limited experience in conventional warfare deplouying soldiers and artillery with reference to the British. The other problem they faced was a shortage of ammunition. &lt;br/&gt;The four long toms were place initially to protect the retreat roads and for any advance of the British towards Belfast. &lt;br/&gt;During 26 August the guns were placed on Elandskop, Driekop, Suikerboschkop and near Elandsfontein. &lt;br/&gt;On 26 August Buller received information that the extreme left flank of General Botha was positioned on Bergendal. Buller changed direction and advanced directly north across Bergendal. &lt;br/&gt;To ensure advancement of the Natal Field regiment the 2nd brigade, “A” battery and the 4th division mountain infantry were sent forward to clear a path. &lt;br/&gt;Commandant Oosthuizen, the commander of the ZARP’s received ammunition just in time. He was told to stay put at all cost and to defend and to keep control of this kopje. &lt;br/&gt;At 11h00 a three hour bombardment started on the kopje where Oosthuizen was located. The bombardment was a combined effort from the howitzers, a field battery and a 4.7 inch naval gun. The burghers received the full force of the British artillery. &lt;br/&gt;This was a serious problem for General Botha – his guns were too far back to have any effect. The four long toms were now not a factor. &lt;br/&gt;After 3 hours of British bombardment the Boers were still occupying the kopje. &lt;br/&gt;Buller then ordered the infantry to move closer under artillery fire. The attacks came from the west, south and east side of the kopje. &lt;br/&gt;At the foot of the kopje the British fixed bayonets and began their charge. &lt;br/&gt;Eventually the surviving ZARP’s had to withdraw but accurate firing from the Boers hampered the British progress. They only left the kopje when the British soldiers were among them. Some left on horse back and others on foot. This is an example of the toughness and determination of the burghers. Less than 70 burghers against well trained soldiers totaling more than 1500. This is a ratio of more than 21 British soldiers to 1 Burgher. &lt;br/&gt;After the 3 hour bombardment with all artillery pieces and an advance of more than 1500 British soldiers Lieutenant Pohlman and nineteen other burghers were killed. Commandant Oosthuizen as well as 18 others were taken as prisoners. &lt;br/&gt;The line of defence of the burghers was breached. The rest of the men escaped and rejoined other commandos. &lt;br/&gt;The commandos then separated and they went to Lydenburg and Barberton and this was the start of the guerrilla warfare. This phase of warfare lasted longer than the first phase. It was only ended at the end of May 1902. &lt;br/&gt;Paul Kruger was at Waterval Onder on 27 August, which was the first railway station in the lowveld. Paul Kruger left for Nelspruit on 28 August. &lt;br/&gt;On 28 August Buller's troops marched into Machadodorp. On 1 September Lord Roberts issued the proclamation declaring the entire Transvaal British territory. &lt;br/&gt;The Kruger millions were lost between Machadodorp and Waterfall Onder. There are many rumors – some said it went to Europe. Some said it was hidden somewhere close to Machadodorp. There are also rumors that 3 ox wagons were sent from Machadodorp in three directions. One of these wagons was captured near Ermelo. They say this wagon was a decoy and other say that they already buried the treasure and that this is why the wagons were empty. &lt;br/&gt;While looking for this cache keep your eye open for any Kruger pounds, if found please inform me – I will gladly share the loot. &lt;br/&gt;There were no winners in this war. General Buller returns to the United Kingdom and he retired during October 1901. He died on 2 June 1908 of cancer. He was blamed for the death of 22000 British soldiers that was killed in action by farmers armed with German Mausers and a piece of biltong in their pockets. Paul Kruger died on 14 July 1904 in Switzerland. More than 22074 children lost their lives in South Africa. Many woman and old folks died a horrible death in the camps. During this period an unknown number of black children also paid the highest price as well as other black adults. They were buried in unmarked mass graves. The total death toll will never be known. Towns and farms were burnt to ashes as well as live stock. &lt;br/&gt;On one of the documentary videos about this period they described how one specific woman returned from one of the concentration camps, her husband was killed in action and she lost her children in the concentration camp. She arrived on her farm which was burnt to the ground and when she stopped crying she walked to the nearest building and with her finger she started to scratch around in the dust and she found a couple of seeds. With the seeds in the one hand she walked to the field and she planted them. This woman is showing character and is a symbol of the Boer nation and the guts they can show. It is not what happens to you, what counts is how you deal with it, which make us human.&lt;br/&gt;2.0 Cache Description:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is an easy mystery puzzle and you need to read the above history to answer the questions.

I must say that the final clue made this one easier to find.

I have driven past this cemetary so many times - and not even given it a second thought - thanks for the cache - and the TD series - bringing a great part of SA history alive to us.

BTW: the cache prevented a nice speeding ticket for me too - by slowing down for the turn off from the highway - I avoided speeding by the cops in attendance at the turn off and joining the long line of &quot;oortreders&quot;.

Ek glo daar het baie naslaan en ondersoek in hierdie geskiedenis gegaan en ek kan nie anders as om vir Gerhard geluk te wens met hierdie Tondteldoos nie. In hierdie geval was die beskrywing meer die skat as die Tupperware.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a small traditional roadside cache planted inside the public area. The monument is a little bit further on and is available to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old folks are telling a lot of stories about this location. People is small towns are normally very superstitious and are quick to explain any unnatural incident and to add their understanding. This is the story which was told to me and which some people still believe is the truth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is how it happened according to the legend. Somewhere in the past a violent thunder and hail storm erupted on one of the farms near Standerton. The farmer was furious when he saw his crops ready for harvesting destroyed. Out of frustration and desperation he grabbed his rifle and stormed to the outside. He allegedly cursed the Creator and he started to discharge his rifle wildly, aiming at the thunderclouds above him. The rifle was in his one hand and with the other hand clenched in a fist raised high above his head he stood there in the howling wind and hail. His wife and kids stood in the doorway of their home; shouting at him to return. The kids were frightened and were holding onto their mother screaming and crying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then it happened, a massive single bolt of lighting struck the farmer. His wife stated afterwards he stood there in the middle of the field glowing inside a white light. The wife and kids ran into the home and stayed there until the storm has passed. This is the legend as told for more than 100 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this location you will find a monument which explains the truth. The farmer named Daniel Poklenberg Erasmus was a Christian which happened to be at the wrong place. He was struck on 25 January 1884 and the monument marks the exact spot. Farmer Erasmus was 44 years 6 months and 22 days old when he was struck. His family erected this monument during 1981 in an attempt to explain the truth and to stop the legends and rumours that dishonoured him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The legend however has a strange twist in the tale. If you look very carefully you will notice that there are two indents directly in front of the monument. The legend is saying that this is where farmer Erasmus was standing when he was struck. The legend is saying that these marks will reappear if you rake the area. The legend is also saying that no grass will ever grow in this area. His family do not believe in this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During my visit I drove around in this area for some clues. I found a dwelling about 1.8 kilometres away from the place where the farmer was struck. I do not believe that the farmer stormed out of his house and he ran into the fields for nearly 2 kilometres before he was struck. At a distance of 2 kilometres it will not be possible for his wife to see the incident. We will probably never know the truth; it is possible that the legend will carry on. But to me this was a very sad incident that took the life of farmer Erasmus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand the grass is not growing at the indent …&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please replace the cache as found and make sure that it is not visible. Not many cachers will visit the cache and a very long time could pass before the next visit.</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache itself is in a public area and no fences need to be climbed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area between Luneburg and Piet Retief is one of our favourite places. When we reallocated to Ermelo this was one of the first areas we visited. The area reminded my wife of Germany and the place she was born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today while driving the back roads my wife said “Let us hide a cache, we found a nice one from Geo_J, let us return the favour”. I wanted to hide the cache higher up but there is not enough safe parking available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I love the area. We planted the cache at sunset and it was nice to sit down and to hear absolute nothing</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache itself is small with not a lot to trade; it is in the Groenkloof nature reserve on the 4x4 trial. This cache is called “Low range in”. Cache is hidden under some rocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I enjoyed the Groenkloof Nature reserve so much that I planted two caches on the 4x4 trail at probably the worst section. These two caches are for those that love off-road driving. You can also walk to these caches or you can cycle to them. We spend a lot of time doing the caches in the reserve and we enjoyed the animals. It is good to see so many people cycling, walking and driving around so early in the morning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trial itself is nothing in comparison with some of the trials we have done such as Berakha and Three provinces but the stretch between these two caches is probably the best test for low range driving in this reserve. During rainy seasons this road should be difficult as water should be running down this hill. There are also some clay areas so it should be fun in the rain. Differential locks should then be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special note:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a nature reserve and before the cache is removed you need to verify that there are no snakes present. &lt;br/&gt;You are allowed to exit from your vehicle. &lt;br/&gt;Please park in such a way that you do not annoy other road users. &lt;br/&gt;Please cover the cache well.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Caching is not about adding numbers but to bring people to interesting sites and locations. The focus of this cache is to bring cachers to a location not widely known. This listing forms part of a group of 4 unique and protected locations that was made available to cachers with the kindness and permission of the Ermelo Tourism Agency. Visitors do not have open and free access to this location. It is a sensitive heritage site and situated on private property. Private rights weigh more than your right to visit a heritage site. The owners of this private location, Sagrys and Anlie van der Merwe, will only allow visits to the site via a tour guide or historical specialist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have to arrange for a visit to Bonnefoi via Info Junction at Ermelo. This is needed to protect the historical site and to protect the cacher and his family. If you are accompanied by the tour guide you can not be held responsible for damages that someone has caused to the site prior to your visit. The tour guide will escort you and will inform you about the history, importance and the role Bonnefoi played about 150 years ago. Without the tour guide the site will have no importance to you and will only resemble old buildings with no significance whatsoever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, you can access the site via a gravel road, if you do please park in the public road and you can view Bonnefoi from a distance but you are not allowed to enter the property unless escorted as stated above. We live in a society where idiots get a high and kicks when he causes destruction to historical sites. Many of these sites are now isolated from the public and are behind fences, chains, locks and are now controlled and managed - which we pay for. The owners are about 10 minutes away from the site and they do have black guards at the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache details:&lt;br/&gt;The waypoint given in this listing is pointing to the cache. The cache is a regular Tupperware container and well sealed. It is hidden between rocks and covered by rocks and leaves. It is situated about 1 km away from Bonnefoi and it is a road side cache inside a public area. It will give you a view of where Bonnefoi is situated and it will provide a view over the valley. The cacher does have the option to visit Bonnefoi or he has the choice to drive pass the site and to have a glimpse of Bonnefoi. There is thus no obligation to make use of the tourism agency in order to find the cache. If you find the site interesting please use the contact telephone numbers and e-mail to arrange for a visit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonnefoi, the location itself:&lt;br/&gt;This is a place where you could even meet fairies if you wait long enough. This is a magic place; it also contains an element of sadness. This little trading village existed before the town of Carolina was established. Bonnefoi was established during 1872. During these years Chrissiesmeer consisted of two houses and a trading post. This is not an ordinary cache/site but a unique site that will give you great joy and pleasure. This is stepping back into time to a place different from today. This was the time when post was still conveyed via the ZAR post riders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But you need to discover the answers to the questions behind it, such as why was it lost, what happened to the people, what role it fulfilled in the Anglo Boer Wars, etc. Who were the Everard painters and their relationship with this lost village? However, this little village was caught in the ever cycle of change. This village was lost and forgotten for a long time. It is rare but it is true. Today it is situated in the middle of a dense forest and forgotten. Many years ago it was rediscovered by accident with all the furniture still inside the buildings. The furniture is now stored at a safe location. Luckily for us, the buildings are available for viewing and you can share in this interesting historical site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This village also played a role in the ANC when Joe Slovo and Braam Fischer was hiding close to this place waiting for the right time to enter Swaziland. This little hamlet played a vital role in the history of this country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don’t want to spoil your fun. This is your journey and challenge for learning something new so I will only guide you to do the research and for you to discover. Please feel free to share your experience with me via e-mail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are various options available to visit Bonnefoi all depending on your circumstances.&lt;br/&gt;1. You can hire a tourism representative which will be able to inform you about the history of this place. This must be arranged by you personally. The cost of such at the time of publishing this listing was R250 for 2.5 hours. This does add a lot of value and this is highly recommended. This is personal and the most enjoyable and adds the most value. This option is the most suitable and comes highly recommended. It is worth the money and effort. Arrange with other cachers to form a team to visit the site, which will reduce the cost. The cache owner did use this option and it was worth every cent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. You can also join in for free on certain Sunday afternoons, please contact the Tourism Bureau at the contact telephone numbers published below. This is also very informative and is also recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access to Bonnefoi is subjected and approved on the following conditions via the owners and the tourism agents.&lt;br/&gt;You may only visit the historical site between the hours 08h00 and 16h00 with an escort present. &lt;br/&gt;Armed guards do occasionally patrol the area. You are responsible for your own actions. They can confiscate your vehicle, laptop, and gps in extreme cases where you are caught in the act of causing permanent damages to the site without an escort. &lt;br/&gt;If you enter the premises without authorization you will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Please take it seriously. The word is will and not can. There are various countermeasures in place to protect the place and they will catch you. &lt;br/&gt;Nothing must be removed from the site. The only exception is the removal of litter and garbage, please act responsible and show our commitment as cachers to the CITO (cache in trash out) principles. Let us be pro-active and let us keep the site clean. &lt;br/&gt;No fires are allowed at the historical site. &lt;br/&gt;No camping is allowed at the site. &lt;br/&gt;If the GPS is pointing to a waypoint inside the historical site then you are hopelessly lost. Please abandon the cache, you will never find it. &lt;br/&gt;No caches are allowed to be placed at or on the historical site. &lt;br/&gt;Please do not disturb anything on or at the site. &lt;br/&gt;No quad bikes are allowed at the historical site, please park in the gravel road next to the site. &lt;br/&gt;You are not allowed to enter any buildings or vehicles on or at the site. Please do not climb into trees or on top of buildings or any other monkey business. &lt;br/&gt;Before you visit the site please make use of the e-mail address provided to inform the Tourism agents that you are a cacher and arrange for a visit. &lt;br/&gt;Please respect all signage and warning notices at the site. &lt;br/&gt;The adult will be held responsible for the actions of his children, please supervise them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Contact telephone numbers, e-mail correspondence and physical address:&lt;br/&gt;082 786 7959 (Athol Stark) &lt;br/&gt;082 445 9994 (Dirk Snyman) &lt;br/&gt;e-mail address tourism@webafrica.org.za &lt;br/&gt;Further research on the historical site is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;Refer to book called “Woman of Bonnefoi” written by Frieda Harmsen, published by JL van Schaik; please try your local library. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a road side cache. The cache is a large one liter plastic container. Cache contains a stash note, pen, logbook and the normal goodies. There are 232 mountain passes in South Africa and Skurweberg pass is number 20 on the list from the northern side of South Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is situated near the top of a hill. Do not cross the barbed wire fence, the cache is on public grounds. If you approach the pass from Badplaas you will notice a rock painted with the words “Old Mac” and a rock painting that resembles a face. The rock is situated above the road on the left hand side against the hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is painted in the same style as “Old Joe” [S25¿ 25.201 E30¿ 29.320 (WGS84).] We are busy hunting for more history on “Old Mac”, is there anyone that knows more about this person? We believe that Old Mac is the engineer that has constructed the pass and road; but this must be confirmed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do not make me cry by falling down from this hill. Please look at the included photo to determine the gradient. It is difficult terrain; rocks are at an angle facing downward, sliding and skidding is possible especially during rainy seasons. Grass is high and it does hide some holes. However, it is a beautiful view from the top and is one of our favorite areas. There are established footpaths in this area, probably from people visiting “Old Mac”, please make use of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is between two rocks inside a crack. An aloe is watching from directly above the cache. Yes we know many aloes and many rocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, please give me feedback on the rating. Is the rating too hard or too soft? For me it was an easy climb. For others it could be scary.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is a sand stone bridge dating back to 1897 that crosses the Komati River and it is a national monument but access is a huge problem. It is now situated on private property. You can truly call this bridge a bridge to nowhere. This bridge shares the history with the cache called “Hamlet of Bonnefoi”. Many moons ago this was the access road to Nelspruit and Mozambique. This road also passes Bonnefoi. Both the bridge and Bonnefoi was lost in time when new towns were built with new access roads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also be aware of the fence next to the cache. This fence was electrified at a stage but it is non functional at present, however treat it as if it is alive. Do not touch the fence. The cache is on public grounds.

Please do not place anything else in this micro; this is a high risk muggle area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another train and another micro. We never visited Breyten until this afternoon. I was not even aware that it had a train station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today we were searching for the exact starting location or the eye of the Vaal River. The exact location has a bridge and a dam and the Vaal River actually starts as a spring. Somehow I think somebody pulled wool over my eyes. After having a lot of trouble with dust roads, drivers from hell, a lot of dead ends and no friendly farmers we decided to call it a day. For the first time we visited this one horse town. To be frank, I think the horse died a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This afternoon I suddenly remembered the days when my parents and I travelled from George to Durban with the train. This trip was done every year and it was a highlight for me. The stations were cleaned and no rubbish was present. I remember the polished floors of the train stations. In the morning on the train you could hear them shouting “coffee, coffee”. Later the conductor came around shouting “tickets tickets” and they always rattled the door with their key. Then I remember the thick blue blankets and the white linen, they always smelled good and clean. Always present was the clack clack of the wheels. I remember my old mother with her picnic baskets with a lot of goodies to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt sad while driving through the town and after visiting the old station. The old railway houses are run down and are falling to pieces. Even the train is the symbol of decay and soon he will not be there. This place was probably throbbing when the trains were still active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not park in the main road but use the street about 10 meters from the train that turns off the main road. Be aware of anyone approaching when you do this cache. If you feel unsafe abandon the cache. Please feel free to move the micro to another location if you believe you found a better place.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The listing is an easy gravel road side cache for a quick grab. Container is a smallish Tupperware with a white lid. The original content is a smallish compass which has the habit of pointing everywhere, nice angel key ring from Cape Town, a homemade shell ornament from George, logbook and stash note.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a nice peaceful view over a valley with very little muggle interference. It is a road side cache that can be attempted during normal conditions; please take it slow if you are driving in a normal sedan. If the road is wet it is better to approach and to return via Sheepmore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is also the crash site of one of my colleagues. Specific details are withheld to protect him from any embarrassment. Excessive speed on gravel roads was the root cause.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pre-cautions&lt;br/&gt;1. Do not attempt to visit the cache during lighting storms. This area has one of the highest lighting strikes per square kilometer in the world.&lt;br/&gt;2. Muggle interference is low but be cautious all the time.&lt;br/&gt;3. You can literally drive right up to the cache. Your vehicle is with you all the time.&lt;br/&gt;4. It is not recommended to do visit the cache site during the night.&lt;br/&gt;5. Please replace the cache as found.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache container is a large white tablet canister. The cache is situated near Ermelo coal train depot; here you can see 4 to 6 diesel locomotives pulling more than 200 coal wagons, sometimes up to 2.5 kilometer long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is my daughter's first cache hide. Do not make use of any roads with a restricted no entry sign. Cache is not close to any railway line or any serious muggle risks. Original cache content were small cocktail umbrella, yellow ball, whistle, South African (new) cocktail flag, game boy, log book, pencil, sharpener, stash note.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each haul from places like Grootegeluk, Thabazimbi, Eikeboom, Delmas and Broodesnyersplaas consist of about 100 wagons. From places like Machadorp only 50 wagons at a time are dispatch. At Ermelo they are combined in one huge haul and their destination is Richard Bay - a distance of 580 km. It does cross the N2 highway via a train tunnel of more than 4 km long. If you travel to Piet Retief you will notice the metal exhaust ducts for the tunnel next to the road near a communication tower pass Camden power station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please use waypoint S26 33.421 E29 59.505 to find the correct entry route to the cache. There are many roads to the cache, but only one is correct. GPS auto routing could send you in circles. Best approach is from N11 then to cache location via the given access road waypoint. Please use the Google Map link on this listing for more detail. You could also visit Google Earth to see the Arial photo for this depot. It is quite huge. You can enter the depot but it is not recommended because of the many road trucks going in and out. The road to the cache is not in use by these trucks. The only time you will cross the railway line is via a bridge that goes underneath the railway line.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is a easy to find but at a interesting site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first cache planted by my wife. This is a neglected cemetery but it is part of the Anglo Boer wars that took place at Chrissiesmeer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both Boer, British and joiners (hensoppers) lay side by side. The only difference is that the Boers are facing the correct direction while the Englishman and joiners/traitors are facing the opposite direction. You will also find a grave marked as “Unknown British soldier”. There is also a monument for the Boers at this site; some of them were originally from Ermelo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here you will also see the grave of a British Hero, Lieutenant Arthur William Swanson, who saved a fellow wounded man paying the highest price in the process. His fiancée send flowers to his grave every year via the post office mistress until 1961. This lady then stated that she is too frail and this was possible the last box of flowers. She never married and stayed true to her beloved without having the chance to visit her beloved’s grave. The people at this town is now carrying on with this tradition by placing flowers every year on his grave site while singing “My bonny lays over the ocean, my bonny lays over the sea….”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First to find honors goes to CrystalFairy – Happy caching!!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

From here turn NW and follow the sandy/gravel path to S34° 08.981 E018° 24.461. You will have a paddock in front of you and the start of the trail to your left, marked with a large rock atop two other rocks. Follow the winding trail to an open area between some pine trees where the path turns NW towards the peak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continue along this path until you reach the tight bend at S34° 08.930 E018° 24.120. At this point head off the path in a NNE direction for a few meters to reach the rocks. From here it is a fairly easy rock traversal to the top, and the beacon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is hidden a few meters East of the beacon, on the lower level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please return along the same route as the path continuing down the NW side has been closed for rehabilitation by TMNP.

At this location you should see a small stone step with a rock leaning into the path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From this point, head in a North Easterly direction up a rough path, over some rocks, under an overhang and over the top until you reach the beginning of a ledge at S34° 08.850 E018° 25.721. Walking along this ledge will bring you out onto the NE end of the ridge, within a few meters of the cache.

Most have been on top near the edge but lo and behold this one involved some mountaineering, although reasonably safe, whilst dry and keeping my wits about me. Soon had the container in hand, whilst my darling wife called over the edge occasionally to see if I was ok (she does not like cliffs). Grew up in this area and know this place well.

Fountain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rondebosch Fountain forms the centre of this suburb, find it
where Belmont &amp; Main Road meets. Buy your fresh cut flowers
from the Flower sellers near the Fountain.The Fountain is
considered the &quot;centre&quot; of Rondebosch and can be visited in its
original place, now the busy traffic intersection where Belmont
Road meets Main Road. On or near this spot, stood a clump of thorn
trees named by Jan van Riebeeck, &quot;'T Ronde Doornbosjen&quot; from
which Rondebosch took its name. In this vicinity, on March 1, 1657,
nine free &quot;burghers&quot; took permanent title to land and became the
first European &quot;citizens&quot; of South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fountain was donated to the Municipality of
Rondebosch by George Pigot Moodie on 26 Sept 1891. He
died five weeks later at Westbrooke where he lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was proclaimed a national monument on 10 April 1964.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to its name, the Fountain is actually an ornamental
trough for watering horses. This cast-iron structure was put
together from a catalogue issued by Walter Macfarlane &amp; Co,
Saracen Foundry, Glasgow. The lamp above the fountain apparently
contained the first electric street light installed in Cape
Town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years fresh flowers have been sold from the side-walk
across the road from the Fountain and has become a landmark to the
people of Rondebosch and neighbouring suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of fresh flowers are available all year long, from the
indigenous giant proteas and &quot;Snow on the Mountain&quot; in season to
the more known Gladiolus hybrids, roses and Dutch Iris. This is
well worth a visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area of the Two Rivers Urban
Park&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area defined as the Two Rivers Urban Park, located at the
confluence of the Black and Liesbeek Rivers, is a special and
unique place in Cape Town. The area comprising of sensitive
ecological systems and habitats, extensive open space areas,
significant institutions, historical buildings and cultural
landscapes, provides an ideal space for the creation of a park that
fulfils a variety of human and ecological needs and responds
creatively to this quality environment. Within our city there is an
urgent need to protect and rehabilitate ecological systems and to
encourage mutually beneficial relationships between people and the
natural environment. This is recognised as critical to the
sustainable development of the city, and hence is a central concern
of local government. The area identified as the proposed Two Rivers
Urban Park offers an exciting opportunity to address these needs.
However, current institutional limitations and budgetary
constraints mean that investing considerable financial and human
resources in the development and maintenance of parks in the order
of Kirstenbosch or the Company Gardens, is unsustainable. Within
such limitations and inspired by the idea of the Urban Park, there
are considerable opportunities for a proactive and creative
approach towards honoring this responsibility&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Situated on the old Valkenberg Farmstead which lies within the Two Rivers Urban Park, this is the resting place of members of the Mostert Family. The Mostert Family, who owned a number of farms in the area, acquired this land in the early 19th century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sybrand Jacobus Mostert, is one of the occupants of the mausoleum. The Mosterts Mill nearby is named for him,but was constructed in 1795 by his father-in-law Gysbert van Reenen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nearby Valkenberg Manor house is said to date from about 1830 although it probably incorporates fabric dating from the 18c. The various other elements were modified and extended by the Mostert family and then by later users, a reformatory and hospital authorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Valkenberg manor house and outbuildings have been renovated and are utilised by The Courtyard Hotel and The Wild Fig Restaurant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The farmstead is the only remaining one on the Liesbeek River still retaining a sense of its agricultural past. All the others are now demolished or consumed by the Urban environment but include Coornhoop and Westoe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After finding the cache take your time and enjoy the relative tranquility of this little patch of greenery in the City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your way to see the Manor House, admire the large Moretonbay Fig Tree (ficus macrophylla) from where the restaurant takes its name. The attached bar, Annie's Arms is a singe malt lovers paradise and you can wet your whistle with a well deserved drink as reward for finding the cache. The owners are keen cachers so pop in and say Hi. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have placed this cache here to bring some attention to the little known Two Rivers Urban Park - did you notice the big gabion berm at the lights on your way in? This is under construction and will be the gateway to the Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also have passed The Royal Astronomical Observatory who have open nights once a month. This happens on the second Saturday see http://www.saao.ac.za/ for more details.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache also highlights the plight of our heritage and that is where the name comes from - Of Grave Concern - The site is not being maintained as it should. The site is owned by the National Monuments Council and lease to UCT on a 99 year lease. UCT are responsible for the maintenance but it is sorely lacking. Unfortunately quite a bit of money will now have to be spent to conserve this monument. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking available at  33°56'34.44&quot;S  18°28'46.02&quot;E opposite open field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is small, but can take small trade items. Please replace cache carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On hiding the cache contained :-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 x log book and pencil and caching note&lt;br/&gt;1 x  Meal Voucher for The Wild Fig as a FTF Prize!&lt;br/&gt;2 x coloured dice&lt;br/&gt;2 x plastic spiders&lt;br/&gt;2 x rubber snappy jumpy things&lt;br/&gt;2 x wooden piggy faces&lt;br/&gt;2 x tiny peg with ladybird&lt;br/&gt;2 x old 20c piece - not legal tender but still great for quarters!&lt;br/&gt;1 x glitter&lt;br/&gt;1 x 10 Ringgit note&lt;br/&gt;1 x 50 sen&lt;br/&gt;1 x wooden heart on string&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy! &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a traditional cache which contains the normal goodies. The cache itself is a small container hidden inside a crevice covered with a large rock. The cache is to the right when you face George from this location. Make sure the cache is well hidden. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please trade only small items. The cache container is a Tupperware container which locks on all four sides. You will encounter one railway tunnel on route. The railway line is not in daily use and Forestry approved this walk. The tunnel is situated where the railway line is forming a 90 degree bend and you must make sure that this line is clear. There is a walking trail that you could use to bypass the tunnel if needed. There are many paths to this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache will introduce a different world to you - from the ordinary to a location high above George. The motive for this cache is to show you some beautiful scenery along a relative safe route without any special climbing equipment. This cache is for the ones that are not interested in going up the mountain or as a test trial before doing the Cradock and/or George peak caches. There is a path leading directly to Power Station which bypasses the tunnel but thus was not tested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To attempt this cache please park at waypoint as given below. The Forestry Offices have a register that you need to complete before the hike. This is the safest way. There is no monies payable. This cache will bring you to a location where a cross is erected which can be seen from George. During the night this cross is illuminated. This cross is also the symbol of your trip up to George and Cradock peak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a footpath leading from this cache up to George peak but the path is overgrown and very wet with some nasty inclines in certain places and should not be attempted. I used this foot path to plant the three caches. The reason I used this footpath is that you can go directly and quickly to George peak and then to Cradock, with other words all three caches are in line. This path was the cause that I only arrive back at the forestry office at 21h15 with hyperthermia. All plants in this area are pointing downward and you have to move up the incline with bushes dragging you down. The worst is that they are wet and you will stay wet up to waist height for more than 8 hours. The official route is much easier although a little bit longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your way you have to pass the FM transmitters on your way to the cache. You are not allowed to enter this area and you have to walk around the fence and transmitter. Under no circumstances are you allowed to cross directly.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a nano cache. There is no pencil or pen. My daughter will attend this school from next year and she will keep an eye on this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The school was founded on 10 May 1963. The forerunner of this school was the Klip Skool, so named because it was built of stone, which started round about 1894 when Nigel was a Mining Camp. When Nigel became a Village Council, the first Principal, Mr Diamone, was appointed. The Klip School eventually became a Junior High School - Gr 1 to Standard 8. In 1948 the Principal was Mr Kloppers and the Vice-Principal was Mr Malherbe. The Head Prefects were Poppie Pretorius and Peter Raccine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The School moved to the new buildings, where H/S John Vorster is today, in 1949. The Senior class was Standard 9 and the Principal was Mr Kloppers and the Vice-Principal was Mr Malherbe. The Head Prefects were, once again, Poppie Pretorius and Peter Raccine. In 1950 Nigel High had its first Matric Class and, you guessed it, Poppie and Peter were, yet again, Head Prefects. The School was dual medium - English and Afrikaans. At that time the school never had a hall. Every morning started with assembly in the Quad and the teachers stood on the balcony, which was between the Principal's Office and the Staff Room. Assemblies alternated between English and Afrikaans and every Wednesday a Minister from one of the local churches would take a service - again, alternating one week English and one week Afrikaans. The school uniform was bottle green, as is H/S John Vorster today. In the summer, the girls wore green tunics, with white short sleeve blouses. In the winter they wore the same tunics with whilte shirts and the green school tie. They wore grey long socks with the green, orange, black and white stripes. The boys wore grey trousers and white shirts. The blasers were plain bottle green with the school badge on the pocket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1951 Mr Kloppers retired and Mr L. Spruyt became the Principal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1952 a competition was held to design a blazer with colours. Mr Rossouw, an Afrikaans teacher, won the competition. The blazer had a bottle green background with a broadish orange stripe and a narow black and white stripe on either side. It was very striking. The badge on the H/S John Vorster blazer is still the same as the one on the 1952 blazer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1963 the English and Afrikaans speaking pupils parted company. The English High School moved to the present premises of Nigel High School and H/S John Vorster remained as the Afrikaans H/S.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is micro cache at the entrance to Nigel, my home town. This is a history lesson and Oom Lang Piet started it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A long time ago during 1882 a farmer Petrus Johannes Marais (nicknamed Oom Lang Piet) who owned the farm Varkensfontein in the Heidelberg district made an agreement with a prospector named Johnstone allowing him to prospect for gold on the farm Varkensfontein. Mr. Johnstone' s prospecting operations continued for a considerable time shrouded in secrecy. Then one day a stranger turned up at Oom Lang Piet's home and made an offer to buy the farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the time of the offer Oom Lang Piet was by chance busy reading &quot;The Fortunes of Nigel&quot; by Sir Walter Scott, a story about a young man who was the victim of a dishonest intrigue but eventually achieved his goal in life. The stranger's visit immediately aroused Mr. Marais's suspicions to the extent that he decided to visit his farm himself. Once at the farm he found that his suspicions were well founded. With the experiences of Nigel, the character in the novel in mind, he determined not to allow himself to be cheated by cunning fortune seekers and at once set about to establish his own company. In July 1888, two years after the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand, he achieved his goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marais attributed his luck to the novel he had been reading and, therefore, called his company Nigel. In this way, the town of Nigel came into being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1888 the State President Paul Kruger declared Nigel as a public digging under notice no. 331 and since then the history and development of Nigel are inseparable from those of the gold mines. The town was little more than a mining camp until 1923, when the control of the town was passed into the hands of a Dorpvillage. The first meeting of this council was held on 2 January 1923. As you drive around in this area you will notice the old mining houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sub Nigel mine had, in the meanwhile, come into existence and proved to be the riches gold mine in the world. As a result of this fact a great influx of people to the town occurred. Within a space of 7 years the local authority was given increased status and in 1930 was elevated to a Town Council. On 24 November 1930 the first meeting of the Town Council was held and Mr. C.L. Mackle was elected the first Mayor. This event also marked the starting point of fast growth of Nigel. Today many people stay here but work elsewhere. The town today have a out of town feeling to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The years 1934 - 1939 saw the most noteworthy development of the town. This was only slowed down by the outbreak of World War II. During those five years, no less than 5 suburbs were proclaimed and speculation in fixed property soared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The railway line between Springs, Nigel and Heidelberg was opened on 18 October 1935. Until then, the nearest railway station had been Kaydale; situated five miles from Nigel on the main line between Johannesburg and Durban, and all transport had been conducted by ox wagon, horses or car. Sadly the train station is no longer in use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to my world and I hope you like the caches. As you drive around in Nigel you will notice several houses and structures that relates to mining. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Many people believe that J.R.R.Tolkien renowned author of “Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit” visited Hogsback and inspired by its forests and mountains, reflected them in his stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The beauty of the area seems infused with the other-worldy aura of Tolkien’s “Middle Earth” and the forests envelop you in a world of fantasy.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Old, gnarled trees seem to whisper their wisdom on the breeze and the undergrowth of ferns conceals an imaginary world of “little folk” – goblins, elves, gnomes, dwarves, fairies, and of course hobbits.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The area abounds with Tolkienesque names. One finds properties and farms named Arminel, Wilderland, Tanglewood and River Running.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Instruction:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
!!!The GPS coordinates are not the concrete point of the cache. It's only a starting point!!!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hogsback is famous for it’s hiking trails. There are many paths to find the cache. It doesn’t matter which trail you choose, you have to follow the RED PIG with a WHITE CROSS on it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Overview - Map: 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; http://bit.ly/urst100 &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can start your walk at the parking area opposite the Police Station (3-4 hours) or at the parking area near the “Tyume Indigenous Forest Trails” (40-50 min) at the Wolfridge Road.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will find the Geocache at the “Madonna &amp; Child Falls”, on a slope to the right-hand side.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;When you have found the Geocache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- pay attention to the muggels, because sometimes there are lots of them
&lt;br /&gt;- make sure that you hide the cache very well, because there are many Baboons in the forest, they have a good nose
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notice:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;- because of the dense forest, it’s possible that your GPS device doesn’t work at all the time&lt;br /&gt;
- a few paths can be very slippery an dangerous&lt;br /&gt;
- please take an pen with you, it’s possible that my old one doesn’t work</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>When you’re in front of the Madonna &amp; Child Falls, you have to climb a slope on the right-hand side (approximate 10 m), there is a crack in the rock. There you will find the Geocache. </groundspeak:encoded_hints>
