&lt;br /&gt;
Time to get back to the basics of Geocaching.... Getting out with a GPS, family / friends and visit historical or interesting places.

Richard Pearse, inventor and possibly the first man to make a powered flight.
 
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So... was he the first powered flyer in the world???. Visit the site of his Otago home.Sorry only from a distance!!! Now in private hands. The old house is now been used as a store room.
In 1911 he moved to Milton ( to this house ) and a very secluded area. No houses overlooked his property and the only reported incidents were that of a local farmer who, upon hearing a strange noise, went to look and saw Pearse testing an unusual machine; he didn't stay around to watch. Three people also claim to have seen his aeroplane hanging over yet another gorse hedge. While living here Pearse built a number of farm implements including a topdresser, a potato planter and a plough. Some were successful, others failed very quickly and were abandoned. As with his previous acreage, Pearse was meant to be farming for a living, however what crops there were his neighbours tended and the 300 sheep he owned all but starved to death through lack of food

Clear 200ml container. BYOP. 
Watch out for cars.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Dunedin International Airport is an international airport in the Otago region of the South Island of New Zealand, serving Dunedin city and the Otago and Southland regions. Dunedin International Airport is one of two international airports in Otago, the other being Queenstown International Airport. It is located adjacent to the village of Momona on the Taieri Plains approximately 22 kilometres south west of Dunedin CBD. It has a single paved runway rated for aircraft up to the Boeing 767.It has one terminal building with two airbridges and five gates, and also customs facilities and other amenities. The Dunedin City Council and the Crown each own 50 percent of Dunedin International Airport Limited,a publicly unlisted company which operates the utility. Construction of the airport was completed in 1962, and its primary use was to cater for passengers of short haul aircraft. In about 2005, the check-in space was enlarged and a new international arrival area was added. This airport is the third busiest and largest on the South Island of New Zealand, after Queenstown Airport and Christchurch International Airport.

&lt;p&gt;So....travelling somewhere? Feel free to pick up or drop off some trackables on your way past - they like to keep moving from cache to cache!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It lies close to the southeast shore of the shallow tidal lake which shares its name. The name Waihola is the southern Maori form of the word wai-hora, meaning &quot;spreading waters&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lake Waihola was used in the Central Otago goldrush. Ships used to travel up the Taieri River and across to the southern side of the lake where prospectors would traverse the hills and on to Gabriel's Gully. In the early days of settlement a paddle-steamer, the Betsy Douglas, plied the lake's waters from Owhiro, near Henley in the north to Clarendon at the lake's southern end. Lake Waihola is located at the southern end of the lower Taieri Plains and is the largest of a group of historical lakes that were once distributed between Lake Waihola and Mosgiel. Other neighbouring historical lakes include Lake Tatawai, Loch Ascog, Loch Katrine, Lake Potaka and Silverstream Lagoon...

International Airport.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Allanton Cemetery was formerly known as Greytown Cemetery, and
before that, Grey Cemetery. Allanton Cemetery is one of the closest
cemeteries to Mosgiel and had a large available area and
improvements had been made to parking and access since East Taieri
Cemetery closed. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allanton,_New_Zealand.html&quot;&gt;More info
from Wikipedia about Allanton&lt;/a&gt;. The cache is a small round black
container.
&lt;p&gt;BYO Writing Instrument!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
No room for travel bugs/coins, so if you're on your way to the
airport I recommend also stopping at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/en/#!geocache/OX37MA7&quot;&gt;
The Trackables Inn&lt;/a&gt;.

No need to cross fence into private land!! The home owners around the Booth knows about the cache.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Tollhouse appears to have been originally located at 'Waihola Gorge' where it stood for around ten years housing the toll keeper who collected the tolls from the passing traffic on this main route between Dunedin and Central Otago.

The charges were complex and depended on factors such as the kind of wheeled vehicle, the number of harnessed animals, the number of stock and the job of the individual traveller. In 1876, the Bruce County Council (which took over the administration of roading following the abolition of the Provincial Government) shifted the building to nearby Clarendon where it performed additional services as a Post Office. In Bruce County the toll system was abolished in the 1880s and the Tollhouse was bought by local farmer and Otago businessman Henry Driver and shifted to Helensbrook, where it remains today. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/RegisterSearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=3212&quot;&gt;Some info on the booth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a&gt;Some info on the booth in the paper&lt;/a&gt;. Looking for a silver round tube... Please NOTE that you must sign the log book for each individual cacher, Finds logged not corresponding with the logbook wil be deleted. Please take some time before leaving to ensure that the cache is re-hidden exactly as you found it.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Clutha River can be
dangerous, those who fall in seldom fall out
again.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Having said that it is no more hazardous than being
near water with children, anywhere. As the cache is hidden close to
the road and also close to the picnic area you will need to watch
out for &quot;Muggles&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to move a largish rock to get at the
container. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please replace the rock so that it remains
well hidden.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good spot to stop for a picnic either
&quot;going to...&quot; or &quot;coming from.....&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
 or, in season, try your luck at some salmon or brown trout
fishing. I am trying to find out who or what &lt;b&gt;Black Jack&lt;/b&gt; was.
When, or if, I do I will post a note with the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a 880ml, clear, &quot;Klipit&quot; type
(replaced 11/08/2005 also books taken out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When hidden it contained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Log book, pencil and pencil
sharpener&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some Paperback Books for book
swapping&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Roxburgh badge (could be used
as an earring.?)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Roxburgh
Postcard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some brochures describing local
walkways and attractions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

This cache is at ground level right beside a track. Don't loose sight of the track and become lost in your search!

From there you can descend into Johnsonville, Khandallah or Ngaio if desired.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The trade items listed on the cache page are gone and have been replaced with some cash and a pair of sunnies. The logbook had been filled in November but not logged here — muggles?

I found the cache easily enough because the park is virtually on my back door and I had a pretty good idea where to look which is just as well as with the GPS bouncing all over the place due to the poor signal under the canopy.  It might pay to expand on the clue and describe the area where the hint is located because there is heaps of hints to look in with the dodgy signal found in the bush.</groundspeak:text>

The cache is a camo-painted 1L sistema plastic container. Please make sure you hide it super well to keep it a little challenging. Initial contents are:&lt;br/&gt;- Logbook&lt;br/&gt;- Pencils&lt;br/&gt;- Pencil sharpner&lt;br/&gt;- Super expanding insect&lt;br/&gt;- Mini hand clapper&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placed partially because there was no cache at VUW and partially to make people aware of the importance (and I think coolness) of science degrees. If you visit this GC during the working day and VUW is open, have a wonder through the corridors and look at some of the research that is going on there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF goes to agcnz.

Usual issues with GPS reception here, so gave up on my GPS and found the cache almost immediately by cacher's instinct- however once I was at GZ I did an averaged reading which said the coordinates were only .2 out on latitude and OK on longitude with an accuracy of 5 metres. Watch out if approaching from above by the fence, there is a big hole which I didn't see as I was watching the GPS at that stage, could have damaged my ankle but fortunately no harm done.
TFTC.
I am a VUW graduate though from way back and not in science disciplines. As I am rather a fossil, at the time I was there the place was totally different and none of the buildings close to the GZ were even thought of!
Log was damp, did manage to sign though with difficulty, owner has since attended to that (thanks.)   I note the reference to the FTF, a bit of a tricky situation when a cache  is cross-listed as the FTF doesn't even show as a found log on this site! (I suggest that the FTF should only be listed in the cache description on the site where it is logged, though if a cache description is cross- posted that doesn't work!)</groundspeak:text>

Once you find the plaque you have a 50/50 choice on which direction to take to find the medium size cache.  Take a coin you may need to flip a 50/50 to make your choice in which direction to travel.

You can park at WP1 and work out the co-ordinates for the final, which will take you about 5mins to walk to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At WP1 there is a big wooden sign.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a simple cache in a lovely park south of Nelson. Nearby is a picnic table and seats which would make a great spot for a caching lunch stop. The cache is a 2Lt camo painted sistema container with the usual log, pencil and swaps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is just off the track, and one step away. Please do not trample any plants as there is no need to search far and wide. This should be an very easy find as the GPS coverage is good if you approach from open ground. Please recover the cache so that it is not visible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Update: 11/11/09 cache missing and replaced, no trackables in this one please just in case the hiding spot has been compromised. You may need to take two steps off the track to reach the cache now.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">To celebrate our 1st year anniversary of being part of the geo-caching family we are placing three caches as a thank you and tribute to Nelson/Marlborough's three biggest cache placers. These cache placers (and many others) have brought us lots of fun over the last year and it seemed fitting to honour them. We will not name them specifically but I'm sure you will guess by the cache description who they are dedicated to.&lt;br/&gt;This 2nd cache in the series is dedicated to a caching team who has been very busy, in fact they have been busy little bees, their caches are spread far and wide throughout the region. There are still a couple we are yet to track down but what we have found so far is that they are all of high quality, are placed in interesting spots, have accurate co-ordinates and are of varying camo designs – a real credit to the caching community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These cachers have also been very busy in the finding department with a good tally to their name. Thanks very much for your caches, they are an inspiration to us all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this cache you will enjoy a short 5 minute walk along a developing walkway system and hopefully it should be an easy find. There are some bees near gz so be careful not to disturb them, we would hate for anyone to get stung. You cannot see the cache from any distance but you will know where to look for it when you find the GC1HNZD label. As always please put everything back how you found it so that the next cacher has the same experience you had.</groundspeak:long_description>

It caused many spectacular slips, cut roads and dammed rivers. The quake, of magnitude 7.8, was centred under the White Creek Fault.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please respect the site, there is no need to step onto the garden to retrieve the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very historical street with some great “Olde World” buildings that are worth having a wander past or a look inside if they are open. Our favourite is Hodgson’s Store, which was severely damaged in the quake as you can see below but is still standing today.</groundspeak:long_description>

Decided to do it without a clue but after 10 minutes I had to give up on that plan.  Who would have guessed it was there?  Didn't think it would safely hide a cache, but whaddayaknow?  Drove to Six Mile to start the day with Now that's Weird and move on to Maruia Saddler.  Those two would be top caches.  If you are looking at this cache, consider the trip through a path less travelled - it's worth it.  Thanks for the cache Aaron.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A small micro cache located between Renwick and Blenheim in the province of Marlborough. You are looking for a black eclipse mint tin held in place by an invisible force. The co-ordinates should be quite accurate except for the influence of the overhead obstruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache name will become more obvious once at GZ. There you will find an item of historical significance to the New Zealand aviation industry. It is the last of it's kind in the world. There are information signs at GZ where you can find out more about the history. The cache has been placed with permission but as always be discrete with your search and retrieval. No night time visits please.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a small donation required if you would like to go inside. The funds go to a trust and are used for maintenance and restoration. You do not need to go inside to find the cache so entry is purely optional. The feature is open weekends only and the nearby cafe is now closed but may open again in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you cache with children ask them if they can find the resident owl.</groundspeak:long_description>

Park at the co-ordinates given below and enjoy a wander through some interesting natural rock formations. You could probably get to the cache and back inside 10 minutes but allow at least an hour to enjoy a leisurely wander around the park. If you have young children with you there are plenty of things to see along the track to keep them entertained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The popular Labyrinth Rocks Park created by the late Dave Whittaker was reopened on the 23rd December 2009 as a council reserve. So what was once private land and subject to an entry fee is now completely free for everyone to enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache has been placed with the knowledge of one of the local volunteer caretakers who we met while visiting the rocks. He told us further restoration work was being done so expect the area to improve even more over time. Please keep to the tracks at all times, there is no need to leave them to find the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: If you want to learn more about the geology of the area visit the nearby Earth Cache GC22YF4.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Time for a bit of technology in Huntly The listed co-ords 
will make you wet, so 
don't go there, but you are in the right area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the first waypoint you will need to solve the 
puzzle. At the waypoint there will be 2 ways to get the location for the final, you can 
either use your high technology or actually find the waypoint cache which 
contain the co-ords for the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the puzzle, All the questions are based on this high technology,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WWW&lt;/strong&gt;=  The first 3 digits of the battery type used?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XX&lt;/strong&gt; = 
Remembering that A=1 and Z= 26, what is the type of wireless protocol does this hardware use? Adding up the number of each letter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YY&lt;/strong&gt;=  This technology sends out a message, how long can the message be 
????? characters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZZ&lt;/strong&gt; = What is 
the reliable transmitting range in meters of this technology?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  
Now do the sums&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S37 33.&lt;strong&gt;XX&lt;/strong&gt; 
times &lt;strong&gt;YY&lt;/strong&gt; minus 
&lt;strong&gt;907&lt;/strong&gt;  
   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;     

E175 08.&lt;strong&gt;WWW&lt;/strong&gt; minus &lt;strong&gt;ZZ&lt;/strong&gt; plus &lt;strong&gt;187&lt;/strong&gt;  
   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 30 - 45 minute walk, 150 m up and just under 1 km from Red
Hills hut there is an amazing rocky outcrop. As soon as you see it

&lt;p&gt;This cache is more about getting there than being there, because
there is no such thing as a bad day on the tops (in good weather
;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just be grateful my legs said &quot;No&quot; to the original plan for this
cache: Slaty Peak. No doubt the usual suspects will rectify that
during their next visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take the precise hint, as we don't want you to frown all
the way back down. Note that the cache is wedged in with a stone,
and it is appreciated if you could do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part of the Richmond Alpine and Te Araroa Trails. You
shouldn't be here unless you have the right gear and at least some
experience. Only the Über-Fit would be able to do this in a single
day, so most would need to spend at least one night up here,
somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Take some time out to admire the view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When hidden it contained:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log book with pencil and sharpener.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fishing float key ring.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The township had its genesis in the discovery of gold. The early miners used water from the surrounding catchments to sluice the gold from the old creek and river beds. Many of the old water races can still be seen on the surrounding hillsides.  In time these water races came to be used to deliver irrigation water to the stone fruit orchards that succeeded gold mining as the principal source of income in this valley. The development of hydro electrical generation started with the damming of Lake Onslow. Today there are a number of small storage lakes, canals and generation plants on the Teviot River from its source at Lake Onslow to its confluence with the Clutha River on the east bank at Roxburgh. It was at this confluence that alluvial gold was discovered by Young and Woodhouse in 1862. The water use is truly multi use as a considerable volume of water is still taken by means of the old water races to fill irrigation dams on the eastern terraces of the Clutha River. Two of the generation stations are within a short distance of the Geocache Site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the gold is to be found in the brilliant autumn colours that adorn the trees in this valley, and in the export value of the Cherries and Apricots grown here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross over the river and turn north, then turn right after 0.15 km.&lt;/p&gt;

Deer Flat is a favourite picnic spot with it's crystal clear river, tree swing rope and ancient forest nestled in the mountains. Take your time driving the Milford Road - the journey is always better than the destination. Even in the rain the trip is wonderful as the mountains come alive with waterfalls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a 1 litre camo painted snap lock container. Tree cover is moderate, allowing 3 to 4 satellites at half strength on the GPS12. Tall but not dense beech forest, no undergrowth, no prickles, just centuries of beach leaves &amp; moss making a cushioned, short (2 minute) climb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sandflies can be a pest between early January and late December so pack your repellent &amp; wear clothing that covers exposed skin. The area is popular in summer for good reason so watch for others camping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also try the very nearby cache at the confluence of 45S / 168E by Donovan, (GC7E7) – it involves a river crossing and is in dense forest and good fun – in the summer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope you enjoy this area and the cache hunt as much as we've enjoyed placing it.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Lake Gunn Nature Walk, on the road to Milford Sound&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nature walk is a very attractive short walk to the outlet of Lake Gunn. The ancient beech forest drips with moss and age - it's an easy walk for all ages being a flat, wide path. OK for baby strollers until entering the small path (50-60m long) that runs downstream beside the lake outlet. Mind small children near the water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our cache is a couple of minutes downstream of the lake outlet on a narrower but very well defined path. Path is generally straight, beside the river. If you get to a sudden left then right turn in the path you've gone about 5-10 steps to far. Satellite reception is not that flash. Coordinates are on the log hanging out horizontally over the river. In fact you will have walked VERY close or over the cache on the way to the coordinates. Cache is out of sight but can be easily reached below ground level under tree base.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Under base of large tree that hangs way out horizontally over river. Easiest to reach from upstream side.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A short way (10 minutes) up the track to Lake Marian, off the Hollyford Valley Road. The track is wide and very easily strolled by young &amp; elderly. Keep an eye on children if they want to run ahead - the boardwalk at the cache site runs above the river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Head down the Hollyford Valley road about 1.4km to the Lake Marian track car park. Take the (very good - it can take 10 people at a time) swing bridge and follow the track for about 10 minutes through ancient beech forest – it’s all rather lovely and very refreshing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reception at the cache site is limited so leave your GPS on from the carpark. The cache is not under the board walk nor will you have to move off the board-walk to find it, thus zero environmental impact. The clues are in order of help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Container is a 2.2 litre Loc &amp; Loc type so is a decent size for your goodies. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Anzac Park is also known as Pork Chop Hill.  There is a carpark at the top of the hill.  The road up to the carpark has a gate at the bottom.  According to the sign, the gate is open between 10am and 6pm during daylight saving hours and between 10am and 4pm the rest of the year.&lt;br/&gt;If the gate is shut, it is only a short walk up the hill either via the road or a nice bush track that goes up the side of the hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a nice view of Palmerston North city from the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a 1 litre snaplock container and contained the following items:&lt;br/&gt;log book&lt;br/&gt;pen&lt;br/&gt;pencil&lt;br/&gt;small torch&lt;br/&gt;squirrel toy&lt;br/&gt;padlock&lt;br/&gt;toy skateboard &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
