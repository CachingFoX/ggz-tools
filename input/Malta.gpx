            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;A HOUSE IN RUINS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Out in the Birzebbuga countryside, in the area known as “Ta’ Kaċċatura”, lies Casa Ippolito. The house, a limestone structure in the middle of fields and shrubbery, is unihabited and has been so for the past 100 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, walkers and explorers of the area will observe that this monument of a bygone era is in a derelict state: parts of the original structure have caved in, and it bears little resemblence to the countryside home it once was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Known locally as “Id-Dar ta’ Pultu”, the house dates back to 1664, according to an inscription carved above the main door, that reads:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questa e la casa &lt;br/&gt;Di Ippolito Novantieri&lt;br/&gt;Che Fece Oggi Quel&lt;br/&gt;Che Dovea Far Ieri&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was built by the Baron Ippolito Novantieri, who lived there with his wife, Casandra Navantieri, and his five children, Rosa, Paola, Giovanni Battista, Innocenzo u Vincenza Veronica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Popular history, however, suggests that the house has more intriguing origins. Legend has it that, in the times of the Knights, a young, Sicilian knight by the name of Ippolito lived at Casa Ippolito. He fell head over heels in love with a local girl, who was young and beautiful, from a place known as Ta’ Ġellieda, limits of Ħal Kirkop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ippolito’s plans for marriage, however, were dashed when her father learnt of the affair. The story goes that, to safeguard his family’s honour, he sought out Ippolito and shot him. He then carried the knight’s dead body to the nearby valley of Wied Saptan and buried him in a hole covered with a rock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Baron Novantieri died in 1727, followed by his wife in 1739, following which the house fell into the hands of several different owners. After the death of his mother, Casandra, the house became the property of Giovanni Battista. Although married, he died childless, and thus, the house became the property of his nephew, Antonio Le Fevre.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A court order following the death of Antonio divided the property and its surroundings between all the inheritors, the house itself falling into the care of Annetta Giappone. Records show that in 1893, the entire property was worth £570. It was bought by a certai Luigi Mifsud in 1899 and remained under his ownership until his death. The last person to own the house was Emanuel Mifsud, who passed away in 1919.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Casa Ippolito is quite a unique example of 17th century architecture from the days of the Knights. The house is split into two floors, built entirely of Maltese limestone and spread over 36 acres of land. A yard, leading onto the road, leads up to the house. Inside are two stairways, each leading to different areas of the house. The first storey looks onto the yard, and culminates in a large hall, and two other rooms (one which was formely the kitchen).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ceilings are particularly striking, with grand arches set with heavy beams running across. Another interesting feature is the fact that the house appears to have been fortified for extra protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1998 MEPA classified the property at Grade 1, placing it under the highest level of protection. Despite this encouraging decision, Casa Ippolito is today almost entirely derelict. Parts of the original structure have collapsed, and the house is in dire need of restoration. It remains to be seen what will become of “Id-Dar ta’Pultu”, yet another of Malta’s historical gems left to the mercy of the elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Source: A House In Ruins, Noel Pace, http://www.sundaycircle.com/2012/06/a-house-in-ruins/]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*******************************************************************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leave your car somewhere close to the Parking Waypoint and make your way to the trail head.  Just follow the trail up the old house.&lt;br/&gt;GPS reception isn't very good in and around the house. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find the cache go inside the house and look around in the second room on the left.  The cache is very easy to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;** WARNING: **  &lt;br/&gt;In order to get to the cache, some light climbing is required and you will need to walk over some unsteady terrain.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">*THE OLDEST ACTIVE CACHE ON THE MALTESE ISLANDS*&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is placed within the area of the world famous cart ruts in Malta, called Clapham Junction.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The cache consits of one small plastic box containing only the travel bug &quot;The Master Ring&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
You can reach the location very easy by car - there is a car park nearby - or by bus 81 from Valetta via Rabat to Dingli. Leave the bus at Buskett Gardens. From there on it is a nice walk. Just follow the signs &quot;Clapham Junction&quot; or &quot;Cart Ruts&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
It is better to wear good hiking boots!&lt;br /&gt;
Look out for a small cavern with a large bush. The cache is not in the cavern ...
&lt;p&gt;All the rocks and stones you seen in this area are of significant ecological value and shelter entire eco-systems beneath them.&lt;br /&gt;
PLEASE MAKE SURE TO REPLACE ALL ROCKS/STONES (GENTLY) EXACTLY AS YOU FOUND THEM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Facing the cavern, the cache is to your left, near the mouth of the cavern. Hmm...what's that small pile of stones hiding??</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Edmond Dantès is on the run. He was being held captive in St. Mary's Tower in Comino, and now needs to find the treasure to become known as the Count of Monte Cristo.  In order to find it, Dantes needs to visit some landmarks on the small island to collect enough information to discover the final co-ordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Dantès has no time to spare, but hopefully you do, as the idea behind this cache is to take you to some of the landmarks on this small island.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Keep in mind that there aren’t a lot of trees to offer shade in Comino, and the ground is quite white, so it is strongly recommended that you wear a wide-brimmed hat and sun glasses, and if possible slap on some sun protection.  In most cases you can follow the paths, but there are a couple of times where you would need to get off the beaten track.  For this reason, it would be best if good walking shoes are worn (or at least shoes that offer some support, and protection from the rocks).  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, do take a camera with you or otherwise you will kick yourself for not being able to take photos of some of the picturesque scenes Comino has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is a small, black, lock-and-lock type container.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To help you confirm the final coordinates: A+B+C+D+E+F should give you a two-digit prime number.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;Q13M1JX - Waypoint A&lt;br /&gt;N 36° 00.411 E 014° 19.780&lt;br /&gt;Edmond Dantès is on the run. He was being held captive in the tower of Chateau d'If, (a.k.a. St. Mary's Tower). Before he leaves, he takes one last glance at the coat of arms on the facade of the tower (waypoint A). 

Subtract the number of fleur-de-lys in the top right quadrant from the number of fleur-de-lys in the bottom left quadrant of the coat of arms. The result is A.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Q23M1JX - Waypoint B&lt;br /&gt;N 36° 00.472 E 014° 19.851&lt;br /&gt;During the escape, Dantès has hurt himself and decides to steal some medical supplies from the hospital nearby (waypoint B). Once inside the central courtyard of the hospital, he spots a canon pointing towards a number of doors on the [b]top[/b] floor. 

The number of doors on the top floor that this canon is pointing to is B.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Q33M1JX - Waypoint C&lt;br /&gt;N 36° 00.726 E 014° 19.846&lt;br /&gt;Before he continues his journey to retrieve his hidden treasure, Dantès decides to pay his respects to a late friend of his; John Gaul, who was buried next to Comino's cemetery (waypoint C).  [While in prison, Dantès used to hear the guards speak about a cache in the cemetery’s vicinity, – you can check to see if the cache GCKDCQ is still there.]

Find John's tombstone. The digit that appears 4 times on his headstone is C.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Q43M1JX - Waypoint D&lt;br /&gt;N 36° 00.770 E 014° 19.955&lt;br /&gt;While paying his respects, the wonderful aroma of bread wafts his way, making him wonder where this delightful smell might be coming from. Dantès looks around him, and Bingo!  He spots the chimney of a bakery (waypoint D) just a few metres away to the North East. He decides to head down there and steal a loaf of bread for his journey. Upon entering the gate, on his immediate left he spots a writing on the wall: A_.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The number next to letter ‘A’ is D.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Q53M1JX - Waypoint E&lt;br /&gt;N 36° 00.913 E 014° 20.147&lt;br /&gt;With his belly full of bread, and another loaf tucked under his arm, Dantès continues his journey towards the sea, where he passes by a little chapel (waypoint E). He stops underneath the trees for a little shade (and because he remembered the guards mentioning another cache hidden here – GC2CVKG).  Before moving on, he stops to take in the view of the facade, and he notices that there are a number of water spouts. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The number of water spouts on the chapel's facade is E.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Q63M1JX - Waypoint F&lt;br /&gt;N 36° 00.976 E 014° 20.268&lt;br /&gt;Dantès heads down to the sea to meet his old friend Jacopo who had agreed to meet him by the slip way, as he was coming to the island by boat. While waiting for his friend by the room which has a sign reading &quot;Caves&quot; on its side (waypoint F), he notices that the room has a wooden door that when opened, will fold itself into a number of segments. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The number of segments making up this door is F.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
FN3M1JX - GC3M1JX Final&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Dantès looks at the map that the old priest had given him at Chateau d'If and notices a small inscription on the corner of the page which reads:
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
N36 AC.CCF
&lt;br /&gt;

Follow in Dantès’ footsteps as he now heads to the final location to retrieve the treasure and become known as the Count of Monte Cristo. When you’re at GZ,  go inside and have a look. If you're not afraid of heights, go through the passage on the other side to see from where the Count made his getaway by boat.

&lt;br /&gt;R13M1JX - Viewpoint&lt;br /&gt;N 36° 00.411 E 014° 19.780&lt;br /&gt;If the tower is open (it usually is on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from April to end of October between 10.30am and 3.00pm if the flag is flying) do go ahead and visit it.   It is a very interesting building, and from its roof you can take in incredibly spectacular views of Comino, especially of the Blue Lagoon.  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Malta's very first Nightcache!!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-- THIS CACHE SHOULD ONLY BE ATTEMPTED AT NIGHT --&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;
This is a nightcache so you will (obviously) need to take a flashlight with you. The path to the cache is marked using reflective markers (approx 1cm diameter) placed at around 2m above the ground.  It is VERY IMPORTANT that you hold the flashlight beside your head when looking for the markers, so that the light can reflect back directly to your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since you will be walking around in pitch darkness, remember to keep your eyes on the ground and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH WHERE YOU ARE GOING!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; There is a ditch close to the nightcache trail - so do be careful. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also remember to take a note of your car's coordinates if you do not park at the suggested parking waypoint.  They might come in handy to find your way back after completing the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Head over to the cache coordinates and park your car at the recommended parking spot (the road can be a little bit bumpy).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Make your way over to the listed coordinates, and look for the reflective markers on the trees (remember to hold the flashlight at eye level).  Make your way from one marker to the next.  The final cache hiding place is within one meter of the point marked by three reflective strips (you'll know what we mean when you see them).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Be extra careful to hide the cache properly after you find it.  You might think it's invisible in the dark, but during the day there can be loads of muggles in this area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
bring a pen with you to log the cache.&lt;br /&gt;

We were REALLY close to giving up on this one...it really is a sneaky hiding spot and the GPS signal did bounce around quite a bit!

Luckily i managed to spot the hiding place just before we gave up. 

Just a few hints for fellow cachers:
1. Absolutely no climbing is required (don't look up)
2. There's no need to go any distance down the path. 
3. When you think you've checked all the holes....look again ;)</groundspeak:text>

Very quick find even though the cache is pretty well hidden :)

There were a couple of muggles in the area and one kid was even walking around with a small rifle (I'm hoping it was just an air-gun)!

The cache is quite close to a shooting range, so don't be startled by the loud bangs ;)

Great views of St. Paul's Bay and Mistra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fort is in ruins and the path is a bit rocky. You can park close to the location but it's recommended that you park by Selmun Palace and enjoy the stroll.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get to the location, you need to go by the entrance of Selmun Palace and take the path to the right of the palace (whilst looking at the palace).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the small plastic box you will find:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- log book&lt;br/&gt;- pencil&lt;br/&gt;- hair comb&lt;br/&gt;- hair clip&lt;br/&gt;- teddy bear head&lt;br/&gt;- Tunisian coin&lt;br/&gt;- paperclip&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information about Fort Campbell can be found at: http://www.mellieha.com/places_interest/fortifications/fortcampbell.htm</groundspeak:long_description>
