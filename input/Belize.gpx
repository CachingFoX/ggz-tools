                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My first International cache! Whoohoo! It was way awesome to actually get to do some geocaching while on my first Carnival Western Caribbean cruise. Although I really don't recommend this part of Belize, the cache was a great one to make my first international.  Cache was in good shape, and concealed it as I found it. Lots of muggles around, but that's to be expected in this area. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found it! Then, security came and asked: did you find it? Haha, they are standing and watching the tourists erring and seeking for a cache. What a good chat this started! He told me everything about Belizian history, that it was a british colony; that it's commonwealth, that we have the same queen! I did not know, and it was totally unexpected to have an english speaking country in the middle of latin america! What a clash! But that's it! The rest of Belize is looking moreover like expected - an adventurous place, where you can buy cheap fruits. Hmmm, had good papayas and bananas! That alone is worth coming here! The officer also told me about his family. He grew up further inside the country, in the mountains. His father had a farm, producing everything you need for living. But the farm is not enough for all the growing family, that's why he has to work here...

Good, let's check Belize City! Still a potential cache container in the pocket - prepared with everything - laminated cache note, log sheets etc. Walked through the streets, but did not yet find a good place ... keep trying - as some of the cachers note, would be good to have some outside the convict area...

Probably going on a reef snorkeling tour later on, before boarding the  Liberty of the Seas again, and resuming hard work convening at the SMEC 2011 meeting.
