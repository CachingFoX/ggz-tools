            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Situated in the coast of Southern China, Hong Kong is covered with beautiful green mountains overlooking to the South China Sea. Wind coming un-obstructively from the sea can generate strong slope lift when it hits the mountain. There are many fantastic slope soaring sites scattered around the territory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GZ is by far the most popular flying site in the territory, partly because it is accessible by public transport. It is situated in eastern part of Sai Kung peninsula. The flying site is just at the road side. The surrounding scenery is one of the most attractive in Hong Kong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best flying seasons here are autumn and winter when northeast monsoon prevails. Come here in holiday during these seasons you may able to see many radio-controlled gliders soaring in the sky. Some gliders with wheels even make use of the road as a runway for landing. All passer please follow the instruction of airfield operation commander.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">High Junk Peak - one of the four treacherous peaks in Hong Kong - is primary attraction of Clearwater Bay Country Park. Steep and menacing, the spur offers surprisingly peaceful vistas. This juxtaposition of wild ruggedness and bucolic charm have lured many visitors in times old and new. One poet in the Qing Dynasty wrote the Bamboo Verse to mark his journey to High Junk Peak, &quot;Hiking across Sheung Yeung Shan and Ha Yeung Shan, the encounter with High Junk made my day&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towering 344 meters above the sea, it tests hikers with a tough final ascent. On the east face of its abrupt summit, precipices plunge down to densely wooded foothills, where buttress slopes stretch all the way to Clearwater Bay and the typhoon shelter beyond. The High Junk Peak Country Trail, a hillside green walk, takes you to a lookout atop Sheung Yeung Shan. This sinuous route offers breathtaking views on both sides. The eastern view, revealing jagged cliffs of High Junk Peak, is particularly arresting. Common Melastoma (Melastoma candidum) is widely distributed in these hills. In early spring, when a burst of pink dresses nearby slopes, the formidable High Junk Peak seems almost tame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please beware of the cliff and steep slope when searching the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Sai Kung Hoi was a fishing harbour that fishermen still gather here today. The harbour is now a typhoon shelter, where motorized junks used in the local tourist trade now are moored. They are boats that now can be hired for fishing and swimming trips.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having evolved from a fishing village, it is a paradise for seafood lovers, locals and foreign tourists alike. Visitors can stroll along the waterfront of Sai Kung Town or explore the lanes of the old town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is well hidden in a group of submerged rocks that is 60 meters away from the waterfront promenade. During high tide, the rocks are surrounded by sea water and it would be adviseable to go at low tide when the tide is lower than 1.0M only. Please aware of the rising tide when searching the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tidal informatin can be found at following link:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.weather.gov.hk/tide/etide_main.htm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a small cove between the GZ and the promenade. You may able to see some dragon boats anchoring in this shelter before &quot;Dragon Boat Festival&quot; in 5th month of Chinese lunar calendar. If you are lucky to visit the cache site during the days of &quot;Dragon Boat Festival&quot;, please take more pictures to this derby and share with us.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">My first National Day Cache. The cache is only enough space for a logbook. Please bring your own writing tools and return the cache to original position after retrieving. A small cache here is all because of the historical issue of another cache nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tai Tung Shan (Sunset Peak) is one of my favorite mountains on Lantau Island in Hong Kong. I love to climb up from Wong Lung Hang Country Trail, all the way up to 770m to Lautau Mountain Camp (Nan Tau Ying, Ying in Chinese means camp site) and have a coffee break there. You will surely love the scene there.&lt;br/&gt;If you find climbing up to 770m is too tough to you. You may consider to take New Lantau Bus #3 or #23 and get off at Pak Kung Au. You will save 490m.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last alternative is to go up from Nam Shan and start from Mui Wo. You can take New Lautau Bus #3 from Tung Chung or ferry from Central Pier to Mui Wo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, there still have many other routes that can lead you to GZ, but not recommended here. If you want to know or even try, you may contact me. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remark *** Anyone who enjoys a peaceful and quiet retreat will definitely like the Lantau Mountain Camp, at about 770 meter elevation of Sunset Peak (869 meter). The camp provides 20 small stone houses, which were built before World War II as a rest haven for the British colony's Christian missionaries taking time off from their work in China. The houses are available for rent by civilians who book in advance.&lt;br/&gt;(some information copy from hongkongdotcom)</groundspeak:long_description>

Because the cache is hidden between: &lt;br/&gt;- The Hong Kong Museum of Art, founded in 1962, was formerly known as the City Museum and Art Gallery. It aims to preserve the cultural heritage of China and promote art with a local focus. In 1991, it opened its doors at the current Tsim Sha Tsui Premises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The Hong Kong Cultural Centre marked a new era in the development of the performing arts of all variety in Hong Kong. The foundation stone was laid in 1979, construction works started in 1984 and the building completed in 1989. Since its grand opening on 8 November 1989, the Cultural Centre has remained the premier cultural venue offering stimulating environment for arts talents and quality programmes to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The Hong Kong Space Museum , the main local institution aimed at popularising astronomy and space science, was officially opened in October 1980. Its unique egg-shaped dome has become a striking landmark of the City.</groundspeak:long_description>
