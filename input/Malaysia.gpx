            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache by BernGPS consisting of a pink food container in red plastic bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kuching Reservoir Park is right in the city centre, within walking distance from the Kuching Waterfront. It is very popular with joggers and strollers in the evenings - there are usually quite a number of people there when the weather is good. It used to be the fresh water reservoir for Kuching town and the park was developed around it. The Japanese Bridge crossing the main lake is one of the truly iconic structures in Kuching. This park definitely holds a sentimental value for many people as it used to be the main dating ground in Kuching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being right in the city centre, it is quite surprising to find a place with so many tall and mature trees. The trees here could be some of the oldest in Kuching, as they seem to have been there forever. The are some 2nd World War Bomb Shelter at a corner of the park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a great place for exercise as the trees provide plenty of shade and the tracks give you a choice of either an easy run around the lakes, or a more strenously trek on the hilly slopes . There is also a nice playground for the kids.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Atkinson Clock Tower is one of the oldest building in Kota Kinabalu, previously known as Jesselton. The building of the Clock Tower was initiated in 1902 through public donation and was completed in 1905. It was originally built as a memorial to the first District Officer. Mr Francis George Atkinson who had died in 1902 of “Borneo fever” (malaria) at the age of 28. The clock was started on April 19, 1905 while still under construction. Originally built of Merbau wood, the Clock Tower stands at 157 metres (48 feet) high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the years, through repairs and extensive renovations, the original façade has altered significantly. It was refurbished in 1959 to celebrate the city’s diamond jubilee. It is said that the original clock, a double faced clock that was a gift from Atkinson’s mother to him, was replaced in 1964. The tower once served as a lighthouse to guide sailors, when it wa nearer to the shore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sabah Museum took over the care and maintenance of the Clock Tower in 1979 and the site was gazetted as a Government Reserve in August 1983. It was designated a heritage site in 1998.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located in a clump of Oil Palm trees about 70 metres to the south of Atkinson Clock Tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you are done with this cache, dont forget to go to [url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=6519a6a2-747a-442c-a733-fb6d62946399]Signal Hill[/url] located about 600m away.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Double Six Monument is located in Sembulan, marking a significant tragedy in the history of Sabah. On June 6th, 1976, an airplane carrying Sabah’s fifth Chief Minister, Tun Mohd. Fuad Stephens and six other State ministers crashed, killing all on board. The Double Six monument was erected on the exact spot of the fatal crash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a magnetic nano that can take some small coins. It is located in the so called Grace Point : Secret Garden of Kota Kinabalu. Its best not to go there in the evening to avoid lots of little muggle. Once you are at GZ, take a seat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting There&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monument is a 10-minute drive from Kota Kinabalu city. A taxi ride from the city centre will cost approximately RM15.00 (one way). Take Bus no. 17B (marked ‘Putatan’) from the bus station in front of Wawasan Plaza for RM1.50 per person (one way). Buses run from 6:30am to 8:00pm. You probably need to get off at the Sutera harbour traffic lights. Not sure if the Bus goes to the Grace Point Food Court.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Admission is free</groundspeak:long_description>

It is the first public park in Kota Kinabalu and was built to commemorate the Royal Visit to Sabah by the British Royal Family. The park was named after Prince Philip, the consort of Queen Elizabeth II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This park offer a spectacular tropical sea view with a dazzling romantic sunset ambience along superb beach. There are numerous mature casurina trees. Unfortunately, the park facilities are a bit run down as the City Hall hasnt been active in repairing the old corroded facilities. But, there are 2 first class public toilets located in the Park, one built by the Kota Kinabalu City Hall while the other is built by the Malaysia Ministry of Tourism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located about 80m from a house of the city hall worker. You will be searching for a 1 litre icecream container with a logbook inside a a few FTF goodies for you to keep. When you are at the GZ, take a seat.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The 0 Km milestone of Sabah was launched on March 16 2011. It is located in front of the old Post Office from where distances were measured as postmen walked or cycled to deliver mail. Now all roads will lead to this point on the floor adjacent to the entrance of the Sabah Tourism Board which is housed in the old Post Office since 1987. Their distances will be measured from the compass points of the 0 Km marker embedded on the outer floor of the building. This is one of three remaining colonial ones that survived the second world war from 1939 to 1945. The others are the Atkinson clock tower, and a building built of wood and concrete next to the Standard Chartered Bank that once housed the Sabah welfare department. Only pillars of it remain after a mysterious fire razed it on December 31 in 1992.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first official use of the old post office as a road distance marker in post colonial Sabah was announced in the government gazette of 1996.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Royal Institution of Surveyors Malaysia (Sabah Branch) decided to re-establish the 0 Km marker to mark its 50th anniversary. The project is carried out together with the Kota Kinabalu City Hall and the Sabah Tourism Board. The board will maintain the monument as it expects it to draw tourists to visit the spot. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">During my stay in Pulau Tioman I have visited a small village called Genting. It was an amazing place with friendly staff that agreed to take care of the cache I placed. Nearby you have a snorkeling/diving club where you can get a PADI. You can also jungle track and see a nice waterfall and talking birds. Tioman island lies about 56km off the coast of Pahang, according to legend, this island is the final resting place of a mythical dragon princess. The warm waters and good visibility make Tioman a paradise for diving &amp; snorkeling. It is an idyllic sport for leisurely days under the sun. Swim in its emerald waters, enjoy a stroll by the beach or go jungle trekking around the island. A quick advice is to visit it during off peak season. For example October. You will get lots of attention and better prices.</groundspeak:long_description>

Nice walk will take you through the house with talking birds and you can stay and talk to them for a while. Then follow the road up the hill , cross the bridge and there you are. A nice fresh water waterfall. Water comes from the top of the hill and is filtered by layers of rocks and soil. Perfectly good to drink.

To give all cachers a possibility for a short rest while driving up and down Malaysian highways ;-) (southbound)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Update December 2009:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am told that since Malaysia is introducing a limit for 20 l. petrol sales to foreign (eg. Singapore) cars within 50km from the borders, the filling station at Machap is getting very popular (being the last one on the highway outside the 50k limit) and thus lengthy queues can develop that may also affect users of the restpoint itself. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I suggest that when stopping here to first get into the queue for the filling station, while other passengers go eat/cache. Note that there is no way to drive back to the restpoint from the filling station though :-(</groundspeak:long_description>
