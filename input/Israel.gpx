            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is an easy cache located in Hagosrim hotel area. The cache is near a small scenic waterfall and near the beginning of an short beautiful hike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kibbutz HaGoshrim was founded in 1948 mostly by Jewish immigrants from Turkey. It is under the jurisdiction of Upper Galilee Regional Council. The kibbutz is adjacent to the Hurshat Tal National Parkand bisected by tributaries of the Jordan River, the Hatsbani, Dan and Banias Here is a short Vedio about Hagosrim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About the Cahce:&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a silver bison tube that contains only a log. It is located near a beautiful fountain(see photo) inside the kibbutz hotel area (on the way to the swimming pool). On your way to the cache you will see a lot of unique stone statues scatter around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Near the cache:&lt;br/&gt;About 10-15m south of the cache is the beginning of a short (about 2Km) hike called the &quot;Hidden river valley&quot; (עמק הנהר הנעלם). It is a hike that will take you to the ruins of a windmill and an aqueduct. And then from the open outdoors you will find yourself walking in a wall reserved path inside the vegetation, in the cool shade along a nice water stream which you can dip your feet in its cold refreshing water. Part of the hike is on small wooden bridges.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is a small 100mL box filled with nice surprises. It is located on a top of a green hill with a lovely panorama of all the area and a unique monument. The climb is not hard but may take some time. The views (and the cache) are worth the effort. There is no pen so bring your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hod Hasharon is a nice and peaceful city. It is full of small agricultural fields and in general it is a city that gives you the feeling you are in a village. In the NE part of Hod Hasharon, almost on the border of Petach Tikva there is a small hill that used to be a burial site but it is closed for many years and now it serves as picnic area. During the winter and spring the hill is covered by many flowers and painted in vivid green. When you climb to the top of the hill you can see all the way to the Mediterranean Sea on the west and the Samaria mountains on the east. On the top of the hill you will also see a unique monument of a bicycle on a pole. This is in memory of a rider named Avner who died on 19 Oct. 2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How to start:&lt;br/&gt;You can get very close to the hill from two different routes&lt;br/&gt;1.You can drive to the Hadasim st. (הדסים)-Tel Dan st. (תל דן) junction, park your car and start walking on the dirt path in the direction of the hill (you will see in front of you).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.You can turn from derekh Ramatayim (דרך רמתיים) to derekh Ha-Yam (דרך הים) and drive all the way to the foot of the hill. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Climbing the Hill:&lt;br/&gt;There are a few trails going up the hill. Some are blocked in the middle, some are a little doggy, and the best trail is the one on the SW corner of the hill . If you are coming from Tel Dan st. it will be in front of you, when you reach the hill. If you are coming from Derekh Ha-Yam it will be the road after the building near the junction. The road itself is a wide dirt road (on some parts it is paved) and it is a circular road that climb all the way to the top. The road is blocked so cars will not pass, but I have seen many 4X4 and bikes climb this trail all the way to the top. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache and all its nice content is waiting under the palm trees. Since many muggles visit this site, please try to hide it well.  </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finger of Og&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A colossal monolithic column (12m long) was discovered here in
1871. This place was a quarry in ancient times. The column broke
while it was being quarried and was left in site, still embedded in
the natural rock. Based on its size it is supposed that the column
was destined for the colonnades of the 2nd Temple. Similar columns
have been discovered in Mahne Yehuda neighborhood, but those are
hidden by the urban buildings. A Jerusalem legend tells this is a
finger bone of the biblical giant Og. This legend is the base for
the popular column name &quot;Finger of Og&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Russian Compound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The area is one of the oldest districts in central Jerusalem. It
was built by family of the Russian Tsar in 1860. It is including a
large Russian Orthodox church and several former pilgrim hostels
which are used today as government buildings and for the Museum of
Underground Prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the cache&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
At time of hiding, it was the smallest cache in Israel (please
correct me if I wrong), only 2cc. The cache location is marked by
the GX
logo, about 1cm size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don't need to go down into the column location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The column is in front of a police station. The cache place is
not seen from the police station. Don't try to search in front of
the police station.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cache location is marked by the GX logo. You can see easily
this mark while walking in regular public path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The area is regularly visited by tourists, so the police
station is not a problem, as long as you behave like a normal
tourists and not like a crazy geocacher. You can see the GX logo
while walking normally, in a place hidden from the entrance to the
police station.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The sculpture commands a spectacular view of its surroundings&lt;br/&gt;(very recommended reading: gemsinisrael.com)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Martyrs forest&lt;br/&gt;The Martyrs Forest is comprised of six million trees – truly, a living memorial. Four and half million pine trees represent the adults who perished in the Holocaust while a million and (one) half cypress trees account for the children who perished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Directions&lt;br/&gt;The Martyrs Forest is located on Route 395. From Beit Jamal take Route 38 north, toward Beit Shemesh. At Shimshon Junction take Route 395 east. Be on the lookout for a sign leading to the Martyrs Forest and the Scroll of Fire monument (not far from Moshav Kissalon Ramat Raziel).</groundspeak:long_description>
