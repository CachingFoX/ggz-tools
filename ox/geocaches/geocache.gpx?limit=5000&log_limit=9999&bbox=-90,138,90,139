&lt;br/&gt;
The rippled structure of the Brachina Formation (or 'slippery dip'
as it is affectionately known) is evidence of formation in a
shallow marine environment which saw frequent wave action.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The asymmetry of the ripples suggests a single-direction 'stream
flow.' Further downstream, there is a parasitic fold (anticline)
which demonstrates compressional forces.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Further downstream still, there is another major tectonic structure
- an unconformity. Essentially, the overlaying of the Ulupa
Siltstone on the Brachina Formation is a consequence of silt and
clay being deposited by a lake (which came into being when a river
was dammed by surrounding mountains some 100,000 years
later).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In itself, this means little but the endurance of the lake suggests
a cooler climate and/or higher rainfall rates than at
present.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
At the location in front of you, a couple of questions:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Question 1.&lt;br/&gt;
How long is the break in time between the two distinct rock
units?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Question 2:&lt;br/&gt;
Looking at the size of the ripples and the direction they are
moving. Was it really wave action or stream movement that caused
these ripples? Or is this caused by folding and uplifting? Let me
know your theory and the reasons for your theory.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
And of course the obligatory photo of your GPSr in front of the
formation. Enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Access to the Flinders Ranges National Park is subject to entry
fees. The Geological Trail is accessible to all types of vehicles;
however, the roads can be very rough in spots and at times there
may be some flooding, so it's a good idea to use a vehicle with
good ground clearance.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It was not as challenging as last year on Yorke Peninsula (GC1T8TC) - http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=079632d0-3c0b-46ab-a7d9-b3cea8498e47 24 teams logged a find which is 9 more.

This year we have chosen a bullet proof, all weather road to access this one but should you come in from the wrong direction in wet weather then the terrain may increase substantially.

If you look to the east at this location you will be take in the vista of the Hallett wind farm.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On May 2, 2000, at approximately midnight, US Eastern savings time, the great blue switch* controlling selective availability was pressed. Twenty-four satellites around the globe processed their new orders, and instantly the accuracy of GPS technology improved tenfold. Tens of thousands of GPS receivers around the world had an instant upgrade.

The announcement a day before came as a welcome surprise to everyone who worked with GPS technology. The government had planned to remove selective availability - but had until 2006 to do so. Now, said the White House, anyone could &quot;precisely pinpoint their location or the location of items (such as game) left behind for later recovery.&quot; How right they were.

For GPS enthusiasts, this was definitely a cause for celebration. Internet newsgroups suddenly teemed with ideas about how the technology could be used.

On May 3, one such enthusiast, Dave Ulmer, a computer consultant, wanted to test the accuracy by hiding a navigational target in the woods. He called the idea the &quot;Great American GPS Stash Hunt&quot; and posted it in an internet GPS users' group. The idea was simple: Hide a container out in the woods and note the coordinates with a GPS unit.

The finder would then have to locate the container with only the use of his or her GPS receiver. The rules for the finder were simple: &quot;Take some stuff, leave some stuff.&quot;

On May 3rd he placed his own container, a black bucket, in the woods near Beaver Creek, Oregon, near Portland. Along with a logbook and pencil, he left various prize items including videos, books, software, and a slingshot. He shared the waypoint of his &quot;stash&quot; with the online community on sci.geo.satellite-nav:

N 45° 17.460 W 122° 24.800

Within three days, two different readers read about his stash on the Internet, used their own GPS receivers to find the container, and shared their experiences online. Throughout the next week, others excited by the prospect of hiding and finding stashes began hiding their own containers and posting coordinates. Like many new and innovative ideas on the Internet, the concept spread quickly - but this one required leaving your computer to participate.

Within the first month, Mike Teague, the first person to find Ulmer's stash, began gathering the online posts of coordinates around the world and documenting them on his personal home page. The &quot;GPS Stash Hunt&quot; mailing list was created to discuss the emerging activity. Names were even tossed about to replace the name &quot;stash&quot; due to the negative connotations of that name. One such name was &quot;geocaching.&quot;

In celebration of the first 10 years of Geocaching, I placed this cache out in the middle of nowhere - but near a lot of other caches. [:D]</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Kevin Rudd is Australia’s 26th Prime Minister and the 19th
Leader of the Australian Labor Party. He came to office on 3
December 2007.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Kevin Rudd departed from firm Labor Party practice when he selected
his own ministers – he was the first Labor Prime Minister to
break the traditional role of the Caucus. There are 42 members of
the Rudd government executive, 20 Cabinet members, 10 other
ministers and 12 parliamentary secretaries. Kevin Rudd is also the
first Australian Prime Minister to appoint a female deputy, Julia
Gillard.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The historic highlight of his first months in office, however, was
his apology to Indigenous people in the opening week of
Australia’s 42nd parliament.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Kevin Rudd, 2007.&lt;br/&gt;
ALP National Secretariat&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Prime Minister followed the lead of all Australian post-war
prime ministers and visited countries considered significant in
Australia’s international and trade relations. With the issue
of climate change at the forefront, Kevin Rudd’s first visit
abroad was to Indonesia for a conference on climate change where,
on behalf of the Australian Government, he ratified the Kyoto
Protocol. In his first months in office Kevin Rudd also visited
China, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, East Timor,
Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
At home, the new government gave immediate priority to its key
policy areas of education, employment and health, and introduced
legislation to reverse some of the major workplace reforms of the
Howard government.&lt;br/&gt;
But a series of political mistakes - including ditching the
emissions trading scheme and rolling out a new 40 per cent &quot;super&quot;
profits take on the mining sector - saw a collapse in Mr Rudd's and
Labor's vote.&lt;br/&gt;
On June 24, 2010, when a spil in the Leadership of the Labour Party
occured. Ms Gillard's victory was assured after most of the Rudd
Government ministers - including Treasurer Wayne Swan - decided to
oust Mr Rudd as the Labor leader. A confident Ms Gillard, flanked
by the Treasurer who will become her deputy, walked into the Caucus
meeting, confident they had the numbers to defeat Mr Rudd. At
9.36am, Caucus spokesman and NSW Senator Michael Forshaw emerged to
declare Ms Gillard would become Australia's next Prime Minister.</groundspeak:long_description>

until 3 December 2007, the second-longest prime ministerial term
after Robert Menzies. When he lost the seat of Bennelong in 2007,
John Howard also became the second Australian prime minister to
lose his seat, the first being Stanley Melbourne Bruce in
1929.&lt;br/&gt;

Castle, June 1997.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
John Howard entered parliament as the Member for Bennelong in May
1974. After the controversial dismissal of the Whitlam government
in November 1975, he took his first portfolio as Minister for
Business and Consumer Affairs in the Coalition government of
Malcolm Fraser and Doug Anthony. John Howard was then Treasurer
from 1977 until the Fraser government lost office in 1983.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Leader of the Opposition from 1985 to 1989, and again from 1995,
John Howard became Prime Minister following the
Liberal–National Party Coalition’s victory in the 1996
federal election.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As Prime Minister, John Howard led a government with a wide reform
agenda, initiated by the sale of Telstra, the nation’s chief
telecommunications carrier. His government achieved a restructuring
of industrial relations, including the introduction of direct
employer–employee enterprise agreements. A key economic
reform was the introduction of a goods and services tax.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In international relations, the government provided support
enabling East Timor to achieve independence and developed an
‘Asia-first, but not Asia only’ diplomacy. After the
terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, DC on 11 September
2001, Australia’s role in international responses to
terrorism was a major element in the foreign and defence policies
of the Howard government.</groundspeak:long_description>

Paul Keating was Australia’s 24th Prime Minister and held
office from 20 December 1991 to 11 March 1996.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

1994 with heads of government Jim Bolger (New Zealand), Julius Chan
(Papua New Guinea), Mahathir Mohamad (Malaysia), Jiang Zemin
(People's Republic of China) and Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle (Chile).

&lt;br/&gt;
The Keating government pursued economic growth as a precondition
for improving the daily lives of all Australians. Keating’s
initiatives as Prime Minister included the passage of Indigenous
land rights legislation, encouraging the process of reconciliation
between Aboriginal and other Australians, and supporting the
writing of a ‘new national story’ that acknowledged the
conquest and capture of the continent from Indigenous peoples. The
government also established the Republican Advisory Committee to
facilitate debate on the possibility of an Australian republic,
supported reform of vocational education and training, and
introduced policies encouraging economic competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As Treasurer and as Prime Minister, Paul Keating transformed
Australia’s financial system and economy. As Treasurer from
1983 to 1991 in the government of Bob Hawke, Paul Keating was the
architect of Australia’s economic deregulation. The
government floated the Australian dollar and allowed foreign banks
to operate in Australia from 1983.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Paul Keating first entered parliament when he won the House of
Representatives seat of Blaxland in 1969. He was only 25 years old,
making him one of the youngest federal parliamentarians.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Malcolm Fraser was Australia’s 22nd Prime Minister. He began
his term as caretaker Prime Minister on 11 November 1975, after
Governor-General Sir John Kerr dismissed Gough Whitlam’s
Labor government. The Fraser Coalition government was returned with
the largest landslide of any federal election a month later, and
remained in office until 1983. Nonetheless, the constitutional
crisis made its beginning controversial and marked Fraser’s
prime ministership.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Malcolm Fraser emerges from Parliament House on 11 November 1975,
after announcing that Governor-General Sir John Kerr had appointed
him caretaker Prime Minister.&lt;br/&gt;
NAA: A6180, 13/11/75/31&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Malcolm Fraser had an important influence on the changing relations
of countries within the British Commonwealth, and on shaping
Australia’s relations with the countries of East and
Southeast Asia. Though economic rationalism was introduced in
policy debate during his term of office, his government reflected
more traditional principles in financial management and fiscal
policy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Before becoming Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser had spent ten years
as a backbencher in the government of Robert Menzies. He became
Minister for the Army in 1966, under Harold Holt, and was also a
minister in the governments of John Gorton and William
McMahon.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Gough Whitlam became Australia’s 21st Prime Minister on 5
December 1972. His Labor government, the first after more than two
decades, set out to change Australia through a wide-ranging reform
program. Whitlam’s term abruptly ended when his government
was dismissed by the Governor-General on 11 November 1975.&lt;br/&gt;

Whitlam’s lead, participation in international agreements
transformed Australian law and politics.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The public lives of Gough Whitlam and his wife Margaret extend over
half a century. After serving in the Royal Australian Air Force,
Whitlam joined the Australian Labor Party in 1945. He became the
Member for Werriwa in Sydney’s south in 1952, retaining the
seat in 11 more federal elections over the next 25 years.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Whitlam led the reform of the Labor Party platform during the long
years in Opposition. As Prime Minister he immediately set about
implementing a reform program that included strengthening
Australia’s status by making Queen Elizabeth II Queen of
Australia. His government drew on international agreements to
develop programs on human rights, the environment and
conservation.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Margaret Whitlam played an important role as a political and prime
ministerial wife. An outspoken public speaker, broadcaster and
columnist, she accompanied Gough Whitlam on his countless overseas
travels. As a qualified social worker, she was particularly
interested in social conditions. Their public lives have continued
since they left The Lodge in 1975.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On 10 January 1968, John Gorton became the 19th Prime Minister in
unusual circumstances. He was elected Liberal Party leader to
replace Harold Holt, who had disappeared the previous month while
swimming off the Victorian coast, and was presumed dead. Gorton
also left the job in unusual circumstances – he declared
himself out of office after a tied party vote of confidence in his
leadership on 10 March 1971.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
A determined non-conformist and a passionate Australian
nationalist, Gorton wanted to turn thinking in the party, and in
the nation, in a more independent direction.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">John McEwen was Prime Minister from 19 December 1967 to 10 January
1968 following the death of Harold Holt. His term as Prime Minister
came near the end of his 37 years in parliament.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The moment of office: John McEwen is sworn in by Governor-General
Lord Casey at Yarralumla on 19 December 1967.&lt;br/&gt;
NAA: A1200, L68079&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Though only briefly Prime Minister, McEwen served as deputy Prime
Minister for twelve years, in the governments of Robert Menzies,
Harold Holt and John Gorton. He was acting Prime Minister many
times in the years from 1958 to 1971.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
McEwen held the key ministerial responsibilities of Commerce and
Trade for 20 years from 1949 to 1971. During this time the
portfolio emphasis moved away from agriculture and into the broader
industry area. Though a farmer and Country Party leader, McEwen
also moved the emphasis from low tariffs to protection of
manufacturing industries.</groundspeak:long_description>

October 2010 update - After the final location was flooded last month, the cache location is now covered by debris (see the gallery), and I was unable to locate the container. I have placed a new container nearby, on the near bank and a little higher up! - the puzzle has been updated.

If you have the old coordinates, or you would like to see where the old one was :), the cache was re-located S -0.008, E -0.006.

January 1966 to 19 December 1967, when he was officially pronounced
dead after drowning at sea.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

visit Australia, and 'First Lady' Ladybird Johnson, in October
1966.&lt;br/&gt;
NAA: A1200, L59270&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Holt won his first seat in parliament in 1935. He became
Australia's youngest minister in 1939 when Prime Minister Robert
Menzies allocated him a junior role. For three-quarters of his 32
years in parliament, he was on the government benches. His only
period in Opposition was from 1941 to 1949. Holt held the senior
portfolios of Immigration and of Labour and National Service in the
1950s, and became Treasurer in 1958.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
One of the most hard-working of Australia's Cabinet ministers,
after 32 years as a parliamentarian, Harold Holt reached the prime
ministerial office in 1966. The third Prime Minister to die in
office, Harold Holt is widely remembered for the unusual
circumstances of his death while swimming off the Victorian coast
in December 1967.</groundspeak:long_description>

PS - EDIT - The first attempt on this one took us 30 mins for a DNF, we Searched everywherew within 10m of the pole/GZ. NUFFIN!!!!!!! And we scratched around like chooks in the leaf litter too. Can see why the previous people had DNF's - cache creep ???????

Came back the next day, found in a few minutes - fortunately someone else had found it a few hours earlier, and it was now not covered (aka as ridiciously buried !!!!!) and/or cache creep had replaced it to where it belongs - NEAR THE POLE !!!!!!!!!.

Signed log then made it easier for others to find. All good now.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Ben Chifley was Australia’s 16th Prime Minister. A railway
engine driver in his home town of Bathurst, New South Wales, Ben
Chifley became one of the most highly regarded of Australia’s
Prime Ministers.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Ben Chifley, briefly in London for an Imperial Conference in April
1946, enjoys the spring sunshine in Kew Gardens with his head of
Postwar Reconstruction, HC Coombs.&lt;br/&gt;
NAA: M2153, 6/1&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
First elected to a Labor seat in parliament in 1928, Chifley lost
his seat in 1931, but was re-elected in 1940. Chifley was Treasurer
in the Curtin Labor government in 1941 and was a prime mover of the
economic organisation for the war. Chifley was elected leader of
the Labor Party after John Curtin died in July 1945.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Ben Chifley was a committed centralist. As Prime Minister he
introduced national projects such as the Snowy Mountains
hydro-electric scheme and the assisted immigration program. He also
pushed through legislation that enabled the Commonwealth to become
the collector of income tax and sought nationalisation of the
private banks so that the federal government could have more
control over the economy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chifley lost office at the 1949 federal election, after his attempt
to nationalise the banks. In Opposition, Chifley was against RG
Menzies’ proposal to ban the Communist Party – a major
issue at the federal election of April 1951. Two months after the
Labor Party was again defeated, Ben Chifley died on 13 June
1951.</groundspeak:long_description>

the greatest. John Curtin’s achievement rests on his
leadership of the nation during much of World War II.
Curtin’s rejection of the British strategy for Australian
troops enabled the successful defence of New Guinea. And, in a
remarkable move, he put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of
Australia’s defence forces. Although he had been a strong
opponent of conscription during World War I, as leader during the
1939–45 conflict, Curtin made the decision to send
conscripted troops to serve outside Australia.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Curtin was also intent on ensuring that Australia emerge from the
war free from the unemployment problems of the 1930s. He aimed for
a policy of work for all who wanted it, arguing this could be
achieved in peacetime as it had in war.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
John Curtin died in office, on 5 July 1945, just six weeks before
the end of the war in the Pacific.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Arthur Fadden was Prime Minister from 29 August to 7 October 1941.
As well as his ‘40 days and 40 nights’ in office, he
was acting Prime Minister for periods totalling nearly two years
during his coalition governments with Prime Minister Robert
Menzies.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
A Cabinet vote made the new Country Party leader, Arthur Fadden,
the man sworn in as Prime Minister on 29 August 1941.&lt;br/&gt;
NAA: A6180, 4/2/77/30&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A Queenslander, Fadden was a member of the House of Representatives
for 22 years, from 1936 to 1958, and leader of the Country Party
for 17 years, from 1941 to 1958. As Treasurer in 1940–41 and
from 1949 to 1958, he presented a record 11 budgets, including a
‘horror budget’ in 1951.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Described as amiable and a great conversationalist and
story-teller, Fadden enjoyed good working relationships with his
colleagues and staff throughout his long parliamentary career. He
retired from parliament in 1958, and died on 21 April 1973.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
Robert Gordon Menzies was Australia’s longest serving Prime
Minister. He held the office twice, from 1939 to 1941 and from 1949
to 1966. Altogether he was Prime Minister for over 18 years –
still the record term for an Australian Prime Minister.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Prime Minister Robert Menzies escorts Queen Elizabeth II at the
State banquet at Parliament House, Canberra on 16 February 1954,
with Pattie Menzies and the Duke of Edinburgh following.&lt;br/&gt;
NAA: A1773, RV490&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Born into humble circumstances, Menzies obtained a first-class
secondary and university education by winning a series of
scholarships. He established himself as one of Australia’s
leading constitutional lawyers, then entered the Victorian
parliament in 1928. He won a seat in the federal parliament in 1934
and served as Attorney-General and Minister for Industry in the
United Australia Party government of Joseph Lyons.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Menzies was Prime Minister when World War II began in 1939. In 1941
he lost the confidence of members of Cabinet and his party and was
forced to resign. As an Opposition backbencher during the war
years, he helped create the Liberal Party and became Leader of the
Opposition in 1946. At the 1949 federal election, he defeated Ben
Chifley’s Labor Party and once again became Australia’s
Prime Minister.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Menzies’ second period as Prime Minister laid the foundations
for 22 consecutive years in government for the
Liberal–Country Party Coalition.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Menzies was often characterised as an extreme monarchist and
‘British to his bootstraps’, but as Prime Minister he
maintained Australia’s strong defence alliance with the
United States. During his second period in office the ANZUS and
SEATO treaties were signed, Australian troops were sent to support
US-led forces in Korea, and Australia made its first commitment of
combat forces to Vietnam.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Menzies retired as Prime Minister and from parliament in 1966.
Knighted in 1963, he was further honoured in 1965 by being
appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque
Ports.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Robert Gordon Menzies died on 15 May 1978.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Earle Christmas Grafton Page was Prime Minister for only 20 days,
from 7 April 1939 to 26 April 1939. Page was also deputy Prime
Minister to SM Bruce in 1923–29, and to Joseph Lyons in
1934–39. A founder of the Country Party, Page led the party
in parliament from 1921 to 1939. He is also remembered for his long
term as Minister for Health, from 1949–56, in the government
of Robert Menzies.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Though Prime Minister for only three weeks in 1939, Dr Earle Page
was deputy Prime Minister for six years from 1923 to 1929.&lt;br/&gt;
NAA: A1200, L69705&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Described as ‘a man of boundless energy, fertile in
ideas’, Page spoke at a rapid rate, rarely pausing for
breath. His partnership with the deliberate and measured SM Bruce
was an ideal political combination – particularly for
political cartoonists. During the 1920s, cartoons depicted Bruce as
a dapper gentleman and Page as ‘a rather riotous-looking
lady’.</groundspeak:long_description>

Joseph Lyons was Prime Minister for seven years – only a few
days short of matching the then record term of WM Hughes. He was
the first Australian Prime Minister to die in office.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Lyons was a very successful electoral campaigner, with Enid Lyons a
major factor in his winning popularity and appeal. His cautious and
orthodox financial management transformed him from a dissident
Labor minister to a conservative Prime Minister. His Cabinet also
needed careful management. He reshuffled ministries several times
and negotiated a coalition with the Country Party after the 1934
election.</groundspeak:long_description>

James and Sarah Scullin were given a triumphal welcome when they
arrived in Canberra on 21 October 1929 for the swearing in of the
new Labor government. But two years later, Scullin said his term as
Prime Minister was like a nightmare.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Prime Minister James Scullin's red hair stood out in the crowd when
he and Sarah Scullin received a rousing welcome at Canberra's
railway station on 21 October 1929.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Australia’s ninth Prime Minister was unlucky in his timing.
The New York Stock Exchange failure – the ‘Wall Street
crash’ – took place in the first week of his
government. He faced the crisis of economic depression by
attempting to manage a failing economy while implementing Labor
reforms.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This was probably the right moment for a Prime Minister remembered
as ‘a teetotal, non-smoking, budget pruner’ who was
also an honest and stoical man.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
William Morris Hughes was Australia’s longest serving Prime
Minister until 1957 when Robert Menzies overtook Hughes’
record term from 1915 to 1923. Hughes’ other record still
stands: no parliamentarian has surpassed his 51 years and 7 months
of continuous service as a member of Australia’s House of
Representatives – from the 1st parliament in 1901 to the 20th
in 1952.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Peace Conference in 1919.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Before Federation, Hughes had been a Labor member of the New South
Wales parliament from 1894 to 1901. In March 1901 he won a seat in
the first House of Representatives. He served in the Labor Cabinets
of JC Watson and Andrew Fisher. He then replaced Andrew Fisher as
Prime Minister in 1915 and led Australia during World War I.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Hughes’ campaign for conscription during the 1914–18
war split the Labor Party and affected political alignment in
Australia for the next half century. After the war, Hughes was
instrumental in the international recognition of Australia as an
independent nation through its membership of the League of
Nations.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Hughes lost office in February 1923, but served in parliament for
three decades more.</groundspeak:long_description>

Australia’s eighth Prime Minister is also the second
youngest. He was a decorated war hero before he became Prime
Minister in 1923. Stanley Melbourne Bruce was perfectly suited to
the elegance and confidence of his period – the
‘Roaring Twenties’.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
In office for six years, his government sought management of
imperial trade in Australia’s interests and a voice for
Australia in shaping British foreign policy. His uncompromising
stand on industrial relations brought down his government in
1929.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Ethel Bruce was as stylish and dignified a figure as her husband.
She fulfilled her official tasks with aplomb, both at home and
abroad. As the first tenants of the official prime ministerial
residence in the new capital city, the Bruces left their mark on
the form and style of The Lodge.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
SM Bruce became Australia’s longest-serving High Commissioner
in London and his work at the League of Nations laid the
foundations of enduring international agencies.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The highest of the many official honours he earned was his peerage
and from 1947 he was titled Lord Bruce of Melbourne. His chosen
coat of arms features two Australian lyrebirds and the motto
‘We have been faithful’.</groundspeak:long_description>

Joseph Cook was 31 in 1891 when he became Labor member for Hartley
in the New South Wales parliament. Three years later, he was a
minister in George Reid’s Free Trade government. He joined
the first federal parliament in 1901 as a Free Trade member and,
despite being described as having ‘no glow’, held the
federal seat of Parramatta for 20 years.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

anniversary of its foundation.&lt;br/&gt;
NAA: M3614, 8&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A man of great determination, he was quick to make the most of two
major re-alignments of political parties in the parliament’s
first two decades. In 1909 he became Defence Minister, after taking
a key role in the fusion of non-Labor parties that year. In 1917,
he led the Liberal Party in a merger to form the Nationalist Party
and served as Navy Minister and as Treasurer in WM Hughes’
government.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Joseph Cook was Australia’s sixth Prime Minister, taking
office in 1913 with a Liberal Party majority of only one seat in
the House of Representatives. On leaving politics, Cook served as
Australia’s third High Commissioner in London from 1921 to
1927. </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
Like Alfred Deakin, Andrew Fisher was Prime Minister three times,
in 1908–09, 1910–13 and 1914–15. Although very
different in background, these two men share the title of founder
of the new nation’s statutory structure.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
A studio portrait of the prime ministerial family in 1910 shows
Andrew and Margaret Fisher with Robert (left), Andrew junior,
Henry, Margaret junior, and new baby John. The youngest child,
James, was born in 1912, during Fisher's second term in
office.&lt;br/&gt;
NAA: M1406, 2&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Andrew Fisher’s politics were formed at the coalface. At the
age of ten, he became one of many boys working in Scottish mines.
He was still a coalminer when he migrated to Queensland thirteen
years later.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Fisher was a founding member of both the Labor Party in Queensland
and of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. He held the House of
Representatives seat of Wide Bay from 1901 until 1915.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When Fisher was Prime Minister a number of important projects were
undertaken. The Royal Australian Navy was established, the
Commonwealth Bank was set up, the Northern Territory of South
Australia was transferred to the Commonwealth, the federal capital
of Canberra was founded, and the construction of the
trans-Australian railway line linking Perth to the other capitals
was begun. As well as introducing maternity allowances, Fisher
acknowledged the need for greater political equality for
women.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Tall and handsome, Andrew Fisher always retained his distinctive
Scots accent. </groundspeak:long_description>

His contemporaries saw him as honest and trustworthy, but surpassed by Hughes in wit, oratory and brilliance. Fisher's record however reveals a legacy of reforms and national development which lasted beyond the divisions that Hughes left in the Labor Party and in Australia.

Opposition for six of the first seven years of the Australian
parliament.&lt;br/&gt;

George Reid at his desk, a copy of the progressive United States
journal The World’s Work ready at hand.&lt;br/&gt;
NAA: A1200, L11178B&lt;br/&gt;

Reid is remembered more for his quirks than his acquittal of the
roles of parliamentary representative, party leader, Prime
Minister, and Australia’s founding High Commissioner in
London.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Though he held office for less than a year, Reid’s story
makes him one of the most interesting of Australia’s prime

Six weeks later, Deakin was unable to gather the numbers for a government amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. He resigned as Prime Minister on 27 April. The same day, the Governor-General, Lord Northcote, summoned Watson to form a government. 

Despite the ability of the new Prime Minister for his role, the government hung on the fine thread because of the lack of a definite majority in the parliament after the second federal election. 

Although Watson sought a double dissolution of parliament so that an election could be held, Lord Northcote, who was the Governor-General, refused. Being unable to command a majority in the House of Representatives, he resigned, and his term in office ended on 18 August 1904 after spending only 4 months in office.

the fifth and the seventh. He was in office three times in the

Often referred to as ‘the constructor’, his work in
building soundly on the nation’s constitutional foundations
is evident a century later.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Perhaps the finest speaker in the Australian parliament’s
first century, Deakin’s love of learning informed his
political life. Handsome and intelligent, his courteous manner
earned him the nickname ‘Affable Alfred’.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Federation was Edmund Barton’s ‘one great
thing’.One of the key architects of Australia’s
Constitution, Barton became the new nation’s first Prime
Minister at a grand ceremony in Centennial Park, Sydney, on 1
January 1901.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Crowds greet the new Prime Minister Edmund Barton (third from left)
and Governor-General Lord Hopetoun (third from right), as they
leave the rotunda in Sydney's Centennial Park, where the
Commonwealth of Australia was born on 1 January 1901.&lt;br/&gt;
Keenan, JJ, Inaugural Celebrations of the Commonwealth of
Australia, 1904.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Admired for his intellect and calm temper, Barton’s glowing
eyes revealed a keen sense of humour, while his ample girth was
evidence of a love of good food, fine wine and stimulating
conversation. With a rich and engrossing voice, he commanded
authority wherever he spoke.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In 1903 Barton resigned to become one of the three judges who
founded Australia’s High Court. </groundspeak:long_description>

Tosspot Toby, huh?

I was travelling from Victor Harbor to stay with a friend nearby this series, so thought I'd grab a couple of them. I want to do the series in order so this was FIRST of course.

Chilly night!

Land was first purchased for forestry at Mount Crawford in 1909. Plantings commenced in 1914; two species of eucalypts (Narrow-leaved Ironbark and South Australian Blue gum) and two species of pine (Radiata and Maritime pine).

Plantings continued to expand until the 1960?s. Many of the original plantations have since been clear felled and replanted.
Survival rate for the plantings range from 90-98% depending on the season.

About 70,000 tonnes of timber is harvested annually. Current reserve area is 12,367 hectares.

Many old gold diggings exist in the Mount Crawford district. John Watts made a rich strike in 1884 in the gully named after him. News of the discovery sparked a major rush in 1885.</groundspeak:long_description>

Gps may be affected by the trees a little so check the clue. Sweet reward for FTF. You are looking for a clear container with blue lid well labelled. Room for small swaps. </groundspeak:long_description>

You've got to be quick to get on the first page of the log book in a Hills cache! I must have missed cruiz-n by a few minutes as I was there 1315h with only a dog walker having a quick lunch to be seen. I was sure there was a FTF for me... But 3rd is pretty good too, especially as I remember saying I wasn't interested in FTFs.
GPS fix was OK, had to look around as there are a few candidate hiding spots. In the end it was quite easy access.
I used to go here for scouts a few decades back, but the hall was demolished long ago. The park itself hasn't changed much though.

Thanks for the chupachup too! I probably shouldn't have had it, but it was a nice reward as I drove back to work.

There is rarely water flowing at this waterfall but the view and the journey there is the best part and keep your eye out for the locals on the way.  This hike is not for the faint hearted but once you reach the top the cache is your reward. There is room for small trinkets only. happy hunting. Please cover carefully again. thank you.
You can get to this point from closer locations but the hike from the bottom is well worth the effort.
There is a fee to enter the park in a vehicle however there is a carpark outside for hikers and walkers to use and no fee to enter.
This cache is not accessible by vehicle sorry. 
Please be wary of the cliff neaby the cache is not down there...
Do not try this one at night either.</groundspeak:long_description>

I parked on Sheoak road and bushwhacked over, missing the path by a few metres!Don'y try it at night: the cliff is high and the blackberries are thorny!Coordinates have been updated with the owner, so hopefully it is a reasonable estimate of GZ now, I was 30 m off the mark at first.A nice spot to visit.

Away from the creek and the wetlands this area is a haven for the local kids to come and have fun; watch out for the local inhabitants and thrill seekers!

The area is a bit of a mess, so why not practice a little Cache In Trash Out while you are here.

SAFETY FIRST: Look out for the council sign &quot;Beware of Snakes&quot;, you can find the cache if you stick to the paths.</groundspeak:long_description>

The District comprises an area of the southern&lt;br/&gt;foothills south east of Adelaide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blackwood Scout Group had humble beginnings in the then rural&lt;br/&gt;hamlet of Blackwood in 1909 with the formation of the &quot;Hound&quot;&lt;br/&gt;Patrol. State Council registered the patrol on 16th November of&lt;br/&gt;that year (Published in &quot;The Advertiser&quot; on 20th November) and&lt;br/&gt;listed as No. 31 on the first official day of registration on 11th&lt;br/&gt;December 1909.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A woolshed was brought from Port Adelaide in 1928 and transported&lt;br/&gt;to land at 288 Main Road, Blackwood donated by the Davey-Thomas&lt;br/&gt;family. The hall was opened with much ceremony in 1929.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Group is now coming up to 100 years old. The Group currently&lt;br/&gt;provides a Joey Scout Mob (Tuesday), two Cub Scout Packs (Tuesday&lt;br/&gt;and Thursday) and a Scout Troop (Wednesday). The Group services a&lt;br/&gt;catchment area for boys and girls that includes the suburbs of&lt;br/&gt;Blackwood, Glenalta, Hawthorndene, Coromandel Valley and&lt;br/&gt;beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache name &quot;Drop off a Dead Marine&quot; comes from the bottle&lt;br/&gt;recycling activities nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the younger cachers, what a dead marine is about can be found&lt;br/&gt;at Dead&lt;br/&gt;Marine

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Lane Cove was hidden on 18-May-2000, so 18-May-2010 will see the
10th anniversary of geocaching in Australia.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To celebrate this milestone, this cache has been hidden as one of
many placed to commemorate the occasion.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is located in the Frank Smith Park Wetland.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Located in Coromandel Valley, Frank Smith Park is a reserve
approximately 12 hectares in size.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The need for a wetland on the site was identified in the initial
management plan for the Patawalonga Catchment Water Management
Board. Community support for the project saw the development of the
Frank Smith Park Wetland Working Group, which included
representatives from:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cities of Onkaparinga and Mitcham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patawalonga Catchment Water Management Board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greening Australia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coromandel Valley Community Association&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coromandel Primary School&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In 1998, a concept plan for the wetland was developed. Construction
began in December 2000 and was completed in 2001.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The purpose of the wetland is to:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improve water quality downstream of the Sturt River&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enhance the existing corridor linking native vegetation along
the river&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;form part of the Sturt River Linear Park, catering for passive
recreation activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide environmental education opportunities by promoting
issues such as water quality, catchment care and biodiversity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The wetland area is made up of three ponds, which sit at different
levels. Each pond was designed to perform a separate function. The
upstream pond forms an inlet zone, the central pond provides rock
islands for bird loafing and the downstream pond forms a mudflat.
Additional features include:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boardwalks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a jetty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a lookout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;walking and riding trails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;informal meeting areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
As part of the response to extinguish the fires, the Sturt CFS
Group sent a strike team from Coromandel Valley, Blackwood, Eden
Hills and Belair.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
On the fire appliances that responded in the strike team were a
couple of geocachers, firesafe and EmZee Wild'rs.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
And what do cachers do while waiting to get down to firefighting -
they look for a spot to hide a cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Finding this cache will allow you to see the scrub that burnt
regenerate over time. Post some photos so that we can see the
transformation.</groundspeak:long_description>
