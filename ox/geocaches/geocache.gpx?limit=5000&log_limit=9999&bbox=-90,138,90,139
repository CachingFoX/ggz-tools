&lt;br /&gt;
The rippled structure of the Brachina Formation (or 'slippery dip'
as it is affectionately known) is evidence of formation in a
shallow marine environment which saw frequent wave action.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The asymmetry of the ripples suggests a single-direction 'stream
flow.' Further downstream, there is a parasitic fold (anticline)
which demonstrates compressional forces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Further downstream still, there is another major tectonic structure
- an unconformity. Essentially, the overlaying of the Ulupa
Siltstone on the Brachina Formation is a consequence of silt and
clay being deposited by a lake (which came into being when a river
was dammed by surrounding mountains some 100,000 years
later).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In itself, this means little but the endurance of the lake suggests
a cooler climate and/or higher rainfall rates than at
present.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the location in front of you, a couple of questions:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Question 1.&lt;br /&gt;
How long is the break in time between the two distinct rock
units?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Question 2:&lt;br /&gt;
Looking at the size of the ripples and the direction they are
moving. Was it really wave action or stream movement that caused
these ripples? Or is this caused by folding and uplifting? Let me
know your theory and the reasons for your theory.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And of course the obligatory photo of your GPSr in front of the
formation. Enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Access to the Flinders Ranges National Park is subject to entry
fees. The Geological Trail is accessible to all types of vehicles;
however, the roads can be very rough in spots and at times there
may be some flooding, so it's a good idea to use a vehicle with
good ground clearance.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On May 2, 2000, at approximately midnight, US Eastern savings time, the great blue switch* controlling selective availability was pressed. Twenty-four satellites around the globe processed their new orders, and instantly the accuracy of GPS technology improved tenfold. Tens of thousands of GPS receivers around the world had an instant upgrade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The announcement a day before came as a welcome surprise to everyone who worked with GPS technology. The government had planned to remove selective availability - but had until 2006 to do so. Now, said the White House, anyone could &quot;precisely pinpoint their location or the location of items (such as game) left behind for later recovery.&quot; How right they were.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For GPS enthusiasts, this was definitely a cause for celebration. Internet newsgroups suddenly teemed with ideas about how the technology could be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On May 3, one such enthusiast, Dave Ulmer, a computer consultant, wanted to test the accuracy by hiding a navigational target in the woods. He called the idea the &quot;Great American GPS Stash Hunt&quot; and posted it in an internet GPS users' group. The idea was simple: Hide a container out in the woods and note the coordinates with a GPS unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The finder would then have to locate the container with only the use of his or her GPS receiver. The rules for the finder were simple: &quot;Take some stuff, leave some stuff.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On May 3rd he placed his own container, a black bucket, in the woods near Beaver Creek, Oregon, near Portland. Along with a logbook and pencil, he left various prize items including videos, books, software, and a slingshot. He shared the waypoint of his &quot;stash&quot; with the online community on sci.geo.satellite-nav:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 45° 17.460 W 122° 24.800&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within three days, two different readers read about his stash on the Internet, used their own GPS receivers to find the container, and shared their experiences online. Throughout the next week, others excited by the prospect of hiding and finding stashes began hiding their own containers and posting coordinates. Like many new and innovative ideas on the Internet, the concept spread quickly - but this one required leaving your computer to participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the first month, Mike Teague, the first person to find Ulmer's stash, began gathering the online posts of coordinates around the world and documenting them on his personal home page. The &quot;GPS Stash Hunt&quot; mailing list was created to discuss the emerging activity. Names were even tossed about to replace the name &quot;stash&quot; due to the negative connotations of that name. One such name was &quot;geocaching.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In celebration of the first 10 years of Geocaching, I placed this cache out in the middle of nowhere - but near a lot of other caches.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Kevin Rudd is Australia’s 26th Prime Minister and the 19th
Leader of the Australian Labor Party. He came to office on 3
December 2007.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kevin Rudd departed from firm Labor Party practice when he selected
his own ministers – he was the first Labor Prime Minister to
break the traditional role of the Caucus. There are 42 members of
the Rudd government executive, 20 Cabinet members, 10 other
ministers and 12 parliamentary secretaries. Kevin Rudd is also the
first Australian Prime Minister to appoint a female deputy, Julia
Gillard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The historic highlight of his first months in office, however, was
his apology to Indigenous people in the opening week of
Australia’s 42nd parliament.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Kevin Rudd, 2007.&lt;br /&gt;
ALP National Secretariat&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Prime Minister followed the lead of all Australian post-war
prime ministers and visited countries considered significant in
Australia’s international and trade relations. With the issue
of climate change at the forefront, Kevin Rudd’s first visit
abroad was to Indonesia for a conference on climate change where,
on behalf of the Australian Government, he ratified the Kyoto
Protocol. In his first months in office Kevin Rudd also visited
China, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, East Timor,
Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At home, the new government gave immediate priority to its key
policy areas of education, employment and health, and introduced
legislation to reverse some of the major workplace reforms of the
Howard government.&lt;br /&gt;
But a series of political mistakes - including ditching the
emissions trading scheme and rolling out a new 40 per cent &quot;super&quot;
profits take on the mining sector - saw a collapse in Mr Rudd's and
Labor's vote.&lt;br /&gt;
On June 24, 2010, when a spil in the Leadership of the Labour Party
occured. Ms Gillard's victory was assured after most of the Rudd
Government ministers - including Treasurer Wayne Swan - decided to
oust Mr Rudd as the Labor leader. A confident Ms Gillard, flanked
by the Treasurer who will become her deputy, walked into the Caucus
meeting, confident they had the numbers to defeat Mr Rudd. At
9.36am, Caucus spokesman and NSW Senator Michael Forshaw emerged to
declare Ms Gillard would become Australia's next Prime Minister.</groundspeak:long_description>

From 1996 to 1998 she served as Chief-of-Staff to the then
Opposition Leader of the State of Victoria, John Brumby.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Julia Gillard first contested the Federal seat of Lalor for the

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Australia’s 25th Prime Minister served from 11 March 1996
until 3 December 2007, the second-longest prime ministerial term
after Robert Menzies. When he lost the seat of Bennelong in 2007,
John Howard also became the second Australian prime minister to
lose his seat, the first being Stanley Melbourne Bruce in
1929.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Prime Minister John Howard with Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor
Castle, June 1997.&lt;br /&gt;
AUSPIC&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John Howard entered parliament as the Member for Bennelong in May
1974. After the controversial dismissal of the Whitlam government
in November 1975, he took his first portfolio as Minister for
Business and Consumer Affairs in the Coalition government of
Malcolm Fraser and Doug Anthony. John Howard was then Treasurer
from 1977 until the Fraser government lost office in 1983.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Leader of the Opposition from 1985 to 1989, and again from 1995,
John Howard became Prime Minister following the
Liberal–National Party Coalition’s victory in the 1996
federal election.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Prime Minister, John Howard led a government with a wide reform
agenda, initiated by the sale of Telstra, the nation’s chief
telecommunications carrier. His government achieved a restructuring
of industrial relations, including the introduction of direct
employer–employee enterprise agreements. A key economic
reform was the introduction of a goods and services tax.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In international relations, the government provided support
enabling East Timor to achieve independence and developed an
‘Asia-first, but not Asia only’ diplomacy. After the
terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, DC on 11 September
2001, Australia’s role in international responses to
terrorism was a major element in the foreign and defence policies
of the Howard government.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Paul Keating was Australia’s 24th Prime Minister and held
office from 20 December 1991 to 11 March 1996.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Paul Keating at the APEC meeting in Bogor, Indonesia in November
1994 with heads of government Jim Bolger (New Zealand), Julius Chan
(Papua New Guinea), Mahathir Mohamad (Malaysia), Jiang Zemin
(People's Republic of China) and Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle (Chile).

&lt;br /&gt;
The Keating government pursued economic growth as a precondition
for improving the daily lives of all Australians. Keating’s
initiatives as Prime Minister included the passage of Indigenous
land rights legislation, encouraging the process of reconciliation
between Aboriginal and other Australians, and supporting the
writing of a ‘new national story’ that acknowledged the
conquest and capture of the continent from Indigenous peoples. The
government also established the Republican Advisory Committee to
facilitate debate on the possibility of an Australian republic,
supported reform of vocational education and training, and
introduced policies encouraging economic competitiveness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Treasurer and as Prime Minister, Paul Keating transformed
Australia’s financial system and economy. As Treasurer from
1983 to 1991 in the government of Bob Hawke, Paul Keating was the
architect of Australia’s economic deregulation. The
government floated the Australian dollar and allowed foreign banks
to operate in Australia from 1983.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Paul Keating first entered parliament when he won the House of
Representatives seat of Blaxland in 1969. He was only 25 years old,
making him one of the youngest federal parliamentarians.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Malcolm Fraser was Australia’s 22nd Prime Minister. He began
his term as caretaker Prime Minister on 11 November 1975, after
Governor-General Sir John Kerr dismissed Gough Whitlam’s
Labor government. The Fraser Coalition government was returned with
the largest landslide of any federal election a month later, and
remained in office until 1983. Nonetheless, the constitutional
crisis made its beginning controversial and marked Fraser’s
prime ministership.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Malcolm Fraser emerges from Parliament House on 11 November 1975,
after announcing that Governor-General Sir John Kerr had appointed
him caretaker Prime Minister.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A6180, 13/11/75/31&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Malcolm Fraser had an important influence on the changing relations
of countries within the British Commonwealth, and on shaping
Australia’s relations with the countries of East and
Southeast Asia. Though economic rationalism was introduced in
policy debate during his term of office, his government reflected
more traditional principles in financial management and fiscal
policy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before becoming Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser had spent ten years
as a backbencher in the government of Robert Menzies. He became
Minister for the Army in 1966, under Harold Holt, and was also a
minister in the governments of John Gorton and William
McMahon.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Gough Whitlam became Australia’s 21st Prime Minister on 5
December 1972. His Labor government, the first after more than two
decades, set out to change Australia through a wide-ranging reform
program. Whitlam’s term abruptly ended when his government
was dismissed by the Governor-General on 11 November 1975.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Whitlam’s lead, participation in international agreements
transformed Australian law and politics.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The public lives of Gough Whitlam and his wife Margaret extend over
half a century. After serving in the Royal Australian Air Force,
Whitlam joined the Australian Labor Party in 1945. He became the
Member for Werriwa in Sydney’s south in 1952, retaining the
seat in 11 more federal elections over the next 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whitlam led the reform of the Labor Party platform during the long
years in Opposition. As Prime Minister he immediately set about
implementing a reform program that included strengthening
Australia’s status by making Queen Elizabeth II Queen of
Australia. His government drew on international agreements to
develop programs on human rights, the environment and
conservation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Margaret Whitlam played an important role as a political and prime
ministerial wife. An outspoken public speaker, broadcaster and
columnist, she accompanied Gough Whitlam on his countless overseas
travels. As a qualified social worker, she was particularly
interested in social conditions. Their public lives have continued
since they left The Lodge in 1975.&lt;br /&gt;

unusual circumstances. He was elected Liberal Party leader to
replace Harold Holt, who had disappeared the previous month while
swimming off the Victorian coast, and was presumed dead. Gorton
also left the job in unusual circumstances – he declared
himself out of office after a tied party vote of confidence in his
leadership on 10 March 1971.&lt;br /&gt;

A determined non-conformist and a passionate Australian
nationalist, Gorton wanted to turn thinking in the party, and in
the nation, in a more independent direction.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">John McEwen was Prime Minister from 19 December 1967 to 10 January
1968 following the death of Harold Holt. His term as Prime Minister
came near the end of his 37 years in parliament.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The moment of office: John McEwen is sworn in by Governor-General
Lord Casey at Yarralumla on 19 December 1967.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A1200, L68079&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though only briefly Prime Minister, McEwen served as deputy Prime
Minister for twelve years, in the governments of Robert Menzies,
Harold Holt and John Gorton. He was acting Prime Minister many
times in the years from 1958 to 1971.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
McEwen held the key ministerial responsibilities of Commerce and
Trade for 20 years from 1949 to 1971. During this time the
portfolio emphasis moved away from agriculture and into the broader
industry area. Though a farmer and Country Party leader, McEwen
also moved the emphasis from low tariffs to protection of
manufacturing industries.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Australia's 17th Prime Minister, Harold Holt was in office from 26
January 1966 to 19 December 1967, when he was officially pronounced
dead after drowning at sea.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Harold Holt with Lyndon Baines Johnson, the first US president to
visit Australia, and 'First Lady' Ladybird Johnson, in October
1966.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A1200, L59270&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Holt won his first seat in parliament in 1935. He became
Australia's youngest minister in 1939 when Prime Minister Robert
Menzies allocated him a junior role. For three-quarters of his 32
years in parliament, he was on the government benches. His only
period in Opposition was from 1941 to 1949. Holt held the senior
portfolios of Immigration and of Labour and National Service in the
1950s, and became Treasurer in 1958.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the most hard-working of Australia's Cabinet ministers,
after 32 years as a parliamentarian, Harold Holt reached the prime
ministerial office in 1966. The third Prime Minister to die in
office, Harold Holt is widely remembered for the unusual
circumstances of his death while swimming off the Victorian coast
in December 1967.</groundspeak:long_description>

PS - EDIT - The first attempt on this one took us 30 mins for a DNF, we Searched everywherew within 10m of the pole/GZ. NUFFIN!!!!!!! And we scratched around like chooks in the leaf litter too. Can see why the previous people had DNF's - cache creep ???????

Came back the next day, found in a few minutes - fortunately someone else had found it a few hours earlier, and it was now not covered (aka as ridiciously buried !!!!!) and/or cache creep had replaced it to where it belongs - NEAR THE POLE !!!!!!!!!.

Signed log then made it easier for others to find. All good now.</groundspeak:text>

However the next time i pass i will add something for you.
it is impossible for me to give you a fair rating as i have nothing to compare it to. i will say difficulty easy, terrain easy, Awesomeness is o.k depends on your age and /or interests and the size is good. Thank-you for making day.

and have a nice day from willi2.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Ben Chifley was Australia’s 16th Prime Minister. A railway
engine driver in his home town of Bathurst, New South Wales, Ben
Chifley became one of the most highly regarded of Australia’s
Prime Ministers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Ben Chifley, briefly in London for an Imperial Conference in April
1946, enjoys the spring sunshine in Kew Gardens with his head of
Postwar Reconstruction, HC Coombs.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: M2153, 6/1&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First elected to a Labor seat in parliament in 1928, Chifley lost
his seat in 1931, but was re-elected in 1940. Chifley was Treasurer
in the Curtin Labor government in 1941 and was a prime mover of the
economic organisation for the war. Chifley was elected leader of
the Labor Party after John Curtin died in July 1945.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ben Chifley was a committed centralist. As Prime Minister he
introduced national projects such as the Snowy Mountains
hydro-electric scheme and the assisted immigration program. He also
pushed through legislation that enabled the Commonwealth to become
the collector of income tax and sought nationalisation of the
private banks so that the federal government could have more
control over the economy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chifley lost office at the 1949 federal election, after his attempt
to nationalise the banks. In Opposition, Chifley was against RG
Menzies’ proposal to ban the Communist Party – a major
issue at the federal election of April 1951. Two months after the
Labor Party was again defeated, Ben Chifley died on 13 June
1951.</groundspeak:long_description>

1945, after the death of John Curtin. With unswerving loyalty to
his party and its leadership, Forde was a federal parliamentarian
for 24 years. For 14 years he was deputy leader of the federal
parliamentary Labor Party, and for nine of those years was deputy
Leader of the Opposition.&lt;br /&gt;

Arthur Calwell on an inspection tour with senior Army officers in
1944.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: M4267, 10&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Forde was Minister for Trade and Customs in 1931, during the
government of James Scullin, and Minister for the Army from 1941 to
1946, during the governments of John Curtin and Ben Chifley. He
lost his seat in the 1946 election.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After leaving federal politics, Forde served as Australian High
Commissioner in Ottawa, Canada until 1954. He then returned to
Queensland State politics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Frank Forde died on 28 January 1983 at the age of 92, the
longest-lived of Australia’s Prime Ministers.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Australia’s 14th Prime Minister is widely regarded as one of
the greatest. John Curtin’s achievement rests on his
leadership of the nation during much of World War II.
Curtin’s rejection of the British strategy for Australian
troops enabled the successful defence of New Guinea. And, in a
remarkable move, he put US General Douglas MacArthur in charge of
Australia’s defence forces. Although he had been a strong
opponent of conscription during World War I, as leader during the
1939–45 conflict, Curtin made the decision to send
conscripted troops to serve outside Australia.&lt;br /&gt;

House on 26 March 1942.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A1200, L36449&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Curtin was also intent on ensuring that Australia emerge from the
war free from the unemployment problems of the 1930s. He aimed for
a policy of work for all who wanted it, arguing this could be
achieved in peacetime as it had in war.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John Curtin died in office, on 5 July 1945, just six weeks before
the end of the war in the Pacific.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Arthur Fadden was Prime Minister from 29 August to 7 October 1941.
As well as his ‘40 days and 40 nights’ in office, he
was acting Prime Minister for periods totalling nearly two years
during his coalition governments with Prime Minister Robert
Menzies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
A Cabinet vote made the new Country Party leader, Arthur Fadden,
the man sworn in as Prime Minister on 29 August 1941.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A6180, 4/2/77/30&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A Queenslander, Fadden was a member of the House of Representatives
for 22 years, from 1936 to 1958, and leader of the Country Party
for 17 years, from 1941 to 1958. As Treasurer in 1940–41 and
from 1949 to 1958, he presented a record 11 budgets, including a
‘horror budget’ in 1951.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Described as amiable and a great conversationalist and
story-teller, Fadden enjoyed good working relationships with his
colleagues and staff throughout his long parliamentary career. He
retired from parliament in 1958, and died on 21 April 1973.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Robert Gordon Menzies was Australia’s longest serving Prime
Minister. He held the office twice, from 1939 to 1941 and from 1949
to 1966. Altogether he was Prime Minister for over 18 years –
still the record term for an Australian Prime Minister.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Prime Minister Robert Menzies escorts Queen Elizabeth II at the
State banquet at Parliament House, Canberra on 16 February 1954,
with Pattie Menzies and the Duke of Edinburgh following.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A1773, RV490&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Born into humble circumstances, Menzies obtained a first-class
secondary and university education by winning a series of
scholarships. He established himself as one of Australia’s
leading constitutional lawyers, then entered the Victorian
parliament in 1928. He won a seat in the federal parliament in 1934
and served as Attorney-General and Minister for Industry in the
United Australia Party government of Joseph Lyons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Menzies was Prime Minister when World War II began in 1939. In 1941
he lost the confidence of members of Cabinet and his party and was
forced to resign. As an Opposition backbencher during the war
years, he helped create the Liberal Party and became Leader of the
Opposition in 1946. At the 1949 federal election, he defeated Ben
Chifley’s Labor Party and once again became Australia’s
Prime Minister.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Menzies’ second period as Prime Minister laid the foundations
for 22 consecutive years in government for the
Liberal–Country Party Coalition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Menzies was often characterised as an extreme monarchist and
‘British to his bootstraps’, but as Prime Minister he
maintained Australia’s strong defence alliance with the
United States. During his second period in office the ANZUS and
SEATO treaties were signed, Australian troops were sent to support
US-led forces in Korea, and Australia made its first commitment of
combat forces to Vietnam.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Menzies retired as Prime Minister and from parliament in 1966.
Knighted in 1963, he was further honoured in 1965 by being
appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque
Ports.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Robert Gordon Menzies died on 15 May 1978.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Earle Christmas Grafton Page was Prime Minister for only 20 days,
from 7 April 1939 to 26 April 1939. Page was also deputy Prime
Minister to SM Bruce in 1923–29, and to Joseph Lyons in
1934–39. A founder of the Country Party, Page led the party
in parliament from 1921 to 1939. He is also remembered for his long
term as Minister for Health, from 1949–56, in the government
of Robert Menzies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Though Prime Minister for only three weeks in 1939, Dr Earle Page
was deputy Prime Minister for six years from 1923 to 1929.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A1200, L69705&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Described as ‘a man of boundless energy, fertile in
ideas’, Page spoke at a rapid rate, rarely pausing for
breath. His partnership with the deliberate and measured SM Bruce
was an ideal political combination – particularly for
political cartoonists. During the 1920s, cartoons depicted Bruce as
a dapper gentleman and Page as ‘a rather riotous-looking
lady’.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Joseph Lyons was Prime Minister for seven years – only a few
days short of matching the then record term of WM Hughes. He was
the first Australian Prime Minister to die in office.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Lyons was a very successful electoral campaigner, with Enid Lyons a
major factor in his winning popularity and appeal. His cautious and
orthodox financial management transformed him from a dissident
Labor minister to a conservative Prime Minister. His Cabinet also
needed careful management. He reshuffled ministries several times
and negotiated a coalition with the Country Party after the 1934
election.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
James and Sarah Scullin were given a triumphal welcome when they
arrived in Canberra on 21 October 1929 for the swearing in of the
new Labor government. But two years later, Scullin said his term as
Prime Minister was like a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Prime Minister James Scullin's red hair stood out in the crowd when
he and Sarah Scullin received a rousing welcome at Canberra's
railway station on 21 October 1929.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A3560, 6104&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Australia’s ninth Prime Minister was unlucky in his timing.
The New York Stock Exchange failure – the ‘Wall Street
crash’ – took place in the first week of his
government. He faced the crisis of economic depression by
attempting to manage a failing economy while implementing Labor
reforms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was probably the right moment for a Prime Minister remembered
as ‘a teetotal, non-smoking, budget pruner’ who was
also an honest and stoical man.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
William Morris Hughes was Australia’s longest serving Prime
Minister until 1957 when Robert Menzies overtook Hughes’
record term from 1915 to 1923. Hughes’ other record still
stands: no parliamentarian has surpassed his 51 years and 7 months
of continuous service as a member of Australia’s House of
Representatives – from the 1st parliament in 1901 to the 20th
in 1952.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Before Federation, Hughes had been a Labor member of the New South
Wales parliament from 1894 to 1901. In March 1901 he won a seat in
the first House of Representatives. He served in the Labor Cabinets
of JC Watson and Andrew Fisher. He then replaced Andrew Fisher as
Prime Minister in 1915 and led Australia during World War I.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hughes’ campaign for conscription during the 1914–18
war split the Labor Party and affected political alignment in
Australia for the next half century. After the war, Hughes was
instrumental in the international recognition of Australia as an
independent nation through its membership of the League of
Nations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hughes lost office in February 1923, but served in parliament for
three decades more.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Australia’s eighth Prime Minister is also the second
youngest. He was a decorated war hero before he became Prime
Minister in 1923. Stanley Melbourne Bruce was perfectly suited to
the elegance and confidence of his period – the
‘Roaring Twenties’.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The Prime Minister (front centre) and Ethel Bruce (front right)
welcome the Duke and Duchess of York (front left and front centre),
arriving at Canberra’s tiny railway station for the
celebration of the opening of Parliament House Canberra in May
1927.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: A6180, 20/5/74/41&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In office for six years, his government sought management of
imperial trade in Australia’s interests and a voice for
Australia in shaping British foreign policy. His uncompromising
stand on industrial relations brought down his government in
1929.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ethel Bruce was as stylish and dignified a figure as her husband.
She fulfilled her official tasks with aplomb, both at home and
abroad. As the first tenants of the official prime ministerial
residence in the new capital city, the Bruces left their mark on
the form and style of The Lodge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
SM Bruce became Australia’s longest-serving High Commissioner
in London and his work at the League of Nations laid the
foundations of enduring international agencies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The highest of the many official honours he earned was his peerage
and from 1947 he was titled Lord Bruce of Melbourne. His chosen
coat of arms features two Australian lyrebirds and the motto
‘We have been faithful’.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Joseph Cook was 31 in 1891 when he became Labor member for Hartley
in the New South Wales parliament. Three years later, he was a
minister in George Reid’s Free Trade government. He joined
the first federal parliament in 1901 as a Free Trade member and,
despite being described as having ‘no glow’, held the
federal seat of Parramatta for 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

people of Parramatta, New South Wales on 2 November 1913, the 125th
anniversary of its foundation.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: M3614, 8&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A man of great determination, he was quick to make the most of two
major re-alignments of political parties in the parliament’s
first two decades. In 1909 he became Defence Minister, after taking
a key role in the fusion of non-Labor parties that year. In 1917,
he led the Liberal Party in a merger to form the Nationalist Party
and served as Navy Minister and as Treasurer in WM Hughes’
government.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joseph Cook was Australia’s sixth Prime Minister, taking
office in 1913 with a Liberal Party majority of only one seat in
the House of Representatives. On leaving politics, Cook served as
Australia’s third High Commissioner in London from 1921 to
1927. </groundspeak:long_description>

Please leave him sitting in peace and only extract the cache, which is near his feet.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; How many reasons do you need to come and score a smiley for finding a cache? How about kangaroos hopping alongside the car on this beautiful back road? How about paddocks of golden Canola flowers? How about a road which a two wheel drive can travel but which is still fun due to it's sticky clay make up? How about ups and downs into and out of small valleys? How about AWESOME views almost all around you while you locate the cache? A quick drive by on a very pretty dirt road discovered by Team Jacob and kindly shared while we were out together with parislaura on a caching day :)&lt;br /&gt;
I hope you enjoy the pretty countryside and the cache guardian.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Like Alfred Deakin, Andrew Fisher was Prime Minister three times,
in 1908–09, 1910–13 and 1914–15. Although very
different in background, these two men share the title of founder
of the new nation’s statutory structure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
A studio portrait of the prime ministerial family in 1910 shows
Andrew and Margaret Fisher with Robert (left), Andrew junior,
Henry, Margaret junior, and new baby John. The youngest child,
James, was born in 1912, during Fisher's second term in
office.&lt;br /&gt;
NAA: M1406, 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Andrew Fisher’s politics were formed at the coalface. At the
age of ten, he became one of many boys working in Scottish mines.
He was still a coalminer when he migrated to Queensland thirteen
years later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fisher was a founding member of both the Labor Party in Queensland
and of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. He held the House of
Representatives seat of Wide Bay from 1901 until 1915.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Fisher was Prime Minister a number of important projects were
undertaken. The Royal Australian Navy was established, the
Commonwealth Bank was set up, the Northern Territory of South
Australia was transferred to the Commonwealth, the federal capital
of Canberra was founded, and the construction of the
trans-Australian railway line linking Perth to the other capitals
was begun. As well as introducing maternity allowances, Fisher
acknowledged the need for greater political equality for
women.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tall and handsome, Andrew Fisher always retained his distinctive
Scots accent. </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">While attending McKee Clan's CITO, numerous caches were published. There was one that was north near Two Wells and as I had nothing planned for after the event I had come for a nice drive and scored a FTF.  [:D]
I really do enjoy dirt roads and seeing stumpy tailed lizards sunning themselves in the warmth.
A nice quick locus cache here and then I had to decide... was I going to drive 50kms for another try at a FTF on a cache that had beaten me some weeks ago or was I going to head home?  [?]
I rang muggle partner and he was still working on computers and so with permission and as it was such a nice day, I then headed off further north to try again.

His contemporaries saw him as honest and trustworthy, but surpassed by Hughes in wit, oratory and brilliance. Fisher's record however reveals a legacy of reforms and national development which lasted beyond the divisions that Hughes left in the Labor Party and in Australia.

Opposition for six of the first seven years of the Australian
parliament.&lt;br /&gt;

George Reid at his desk, a copy of the progressive United States
journal The World’s Work ready at hand.&lt;br /&gt;

Reid is remembered more for his quirks than his acquittal of the
roles of parliamentary representative, party leader, Prime
Minister, and Australia’s founding High Commissioner in
London.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though he held office for less than a year, Reid’s story
makes him one of the most interesting of Australia’s prime

Happy hopping around dirt roads ... and caching :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha, found in several parts of the world. There are eight different genera in the family classified as rabbits, including the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), cottontail rabbits (genus Sylvilagus; 13 species), and the Amami rabbit (Pentalagus furnessi, an endangered species on Amami Ōshima, Japan). There are many other species of rabbit, and these, along with pikas and hares, make up the order Lagomorpha. The male is called a buck and the female is a doe; a young rabbit is a kitten or kit. The rabbit's long ears, which can be more than 10 cm (4 in) long, are probably an adaptation for detecting predators. They have large, powerful hind legs. The two front paws have 5 toes, the extra called the dewclaw. The hind feet have 4 toes. They are plantigrade animals while at rest; however, they move around on their toes while running, assuming a more digitigrade form. Wild rabbits do not differ much in their body proportions or stance, with full, egg-shaped bodies. Their size can range anywhere from 20 cm (8 in) in length and 0.4 kg in weight to 50 cm (20 in) and more than 2 kg. The fur is most commonly long and soft, with colors such as shades of brown, gray, and buff. The tail is a little plume of brownish fur (white on top for cottontails). Because the rabbit's epiglottis is engaged over the soft palate except when swallowing, the rabbit is an obligate nasal breather. Rabbits have two sets of incisor teeth, one behind the other. This way they can be distinguished from rodents, with which they are often confused. Carl Linnaeus originally grouped rabbits and rodents under the class Glires; later, they were separated as the predominant opinion was that many of their similarities were a result of convergent evolution. However, recent DNA analysis and the discovery of a common ancestor has supported the view that they share a common lineage, and thus rabbits and rodents are now often referred to together as members of the superclass Glires. Rabbits are hindgut digesters. This means that most of their digestion takes place in their large intestine and cecum. In rabbits the cecum is about 10 times bigger than the stomach and it along with the large intestine makes up roughly 40% of the rabbit's digestive tract. The unique musculature of the cecum allows the intestinal tract of the rabbit to separate fibrous material from more digestible material; the fibrous material is passed as feces, while the more nutritious material is encased in a mucous lining as a cecotrope. Cecotropes, sometimes called &quot;night feces&quot;, are high in minerals, vitamins and proteins that are necessary to the rabbit's health. Rabbits eat these to meet their nutritional requirements; the mucous coating allows the nutrients to pass through the acidic stomach for digestion in the intestines. This process allows rabbits to extract the necessary nutrients from their food. Rabbits are prey animals and are therefore constantly aware of their surroundings. For instances, in Mediterranean Europe, rabbits are the main prey of red foxes, badgers, and Iberian lynxes. If confronted by a potential threat, a rabbit may freeze and observe then warn others in the warren with powerful thumps on the ground. Rabbits have a remarkably wide field of vision, and a good deal of it is devoted to overhead scanning. They survive predation by burrowing, hopping away in a zig- zag motion, and, if captured, delivering powerful kicks with their hind legs. Their strong teeth allow them to eat and to bite in order to escape a struggle. (Thanks to Wikipedia)</groundspeak:long_description>

four months in 1904, but his imprint on legislation extended
through the first decade of the Australian parliament.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'His Vandyke beard was exquisitely groomed, his abundant brown hair
smoothly brushed. His morning coat and vest set off by dark striped
trousers, beautifully creased ... He was the perfect picture of the
statesman, the leader'. So the new Prime Minister was described (by
WM Hughes) at the first meeting of his Cabinet in 1904.&lt;br /&gt;

Six weeks later, Deakin was unable to gather the numbers for a government amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. He resigned as Prime Minister on 27 April. The same day, the Governor-General, Lord Northcote, summoned Watson to form a government. 

Despite the ability of the new Prime Minister for his role, the government hung on the fine thread because of the lack of a definite majority in the parliament after the second federal election. 

Although Watson sought a double dissolution of parliament so that an election could be held, Lord Northcote, who was the Governor-General, refused. Being unable to command a majority in the House of Representatives, he resigned, and his term in office ended on 18 August 1904 after spending only 4 months in office.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Alfred Deakin, Australia’s second Prime Minister, was also
the fifth and the seventh. He was in office three times in the
first ten years of Federation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Often referred to as ‘the constructor’, his work in
building soundly on the nation’s constitutional foundations
is evident a century later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps the finest speaker in the Australian parliament’s
first century, Deakin’s love of learning informed his
political life. Handsome and intelligent, his courteous manner
earned him the nickname ‘Affable Alfred’.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Prime Minister Alfred Deakin, a notable political orator, was also
a scholar and writer.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Federation was Edmund Barton’s ‘one great
thing’.One of the key architects of Australia’s
Constitution, Barton became the new nation’s first Prime
Minister at a grand ceremony in Centennial Park, Sydney, on 1
January 1901.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Crowds greet the new Prime Minister Edmund Barton (third from left)
and Governor-General Lord Hopetoun (third from right), as they
leave the rotunda in Sydney's Centennial Park, where the
Commonwealth of Australia was born on 1 January 1901.&lt;br /&gt;
Keenan, JJ, Inaugural Celebrations of the Commonwealth of
Australia, 1904.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Admired for his intellect and calm temper, Barton’s glowing
eyes revealed a keen sense of humour, while his ample girth was
evidence of a love of good food, fine wine and stimulating
conversation. With a rich and engrossing voice, he commanded
authority wherever he spoke.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1903 Barton resigned to become one of the three judges who
founded Australia’s High Court. </groundspeak:long_description>

Tosspot Toby, huh?

I was travelling from Victor Harbor to stay with a friend nearby this series, so thought I'd grab a couple of them. I want to do the series in order so this was FIRST of course.

Chilly night!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Australian Magpie - Quick facts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listed below are some interesting facts about this bird:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magpies are actually from the same family as the Butcher bird (&lt;em&gt;Cracticus torquatus)&lt;/em&gt; and not related to the Pied crows from which they got their name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are highly intelligent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magpies generally mate for life , although the alpha male generally has more than one female with which to mate and they live as a type of family commune.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are very territorial and will fight with other Magpies to keep their neck of the woods. However they will share their space with other species without a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike other birds they walk fairly upright and do not hop or waddle like most other birds.&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Elizabeth North Training Depot is Commonwealth land as it is owned by the Department of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area is approximately 33 hectares in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2007, the future of many Defence Force Bases was considered under the Force Disposition Program. This program was established to consider proposals for base collocation aimed at creating larger, more operationally effective and cost efficient military bases around Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government continued to review the studies which were conducted in relation to the remaining bases under consideration through the Force Disposition Program. These bases were Defence Establishment Berrimah in the Northern Territory, Borneo Barracks in South Queensland, and Elizabeth North Training Depot, Hampstead Barracks and Keswick Barracks, all in South Australia.  Given the size and complexity of this review of Defence basing, and the costs involved in future Defence estate planning, the Defence-prepared studies, along with other considerations, continued to be reviewed and were considered by the Government as part of the 2008/09 Budget deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Consequently, the Elizabeth North Training Depot is currently considered to be 'surplus property' and it is expected that around 2013 to 2014 this land will be sold off. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another housing development in the north, I assume!  &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

These things are popping up all around the area so please also take care getting to and from this, and other, caches. Please also keep a close eye on children and animals as this is a high traffic location.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There used to be a quite regular SAPOLpresence just near here but it appears that technology has now made SAPOL redundant.&lt;br /&gt;
Since this is a location that many people I know pass on a daily basis, I thought a cache here may just remind us all to be mindful that flashing may occur at any given moment and may have unwanted consequences.&lt;br /&gt;
Extremely high muggle factor due to Womma Station (the real station and not the cache) being so very near so please use extreme caution, in the hope that this cache may last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;P13NNJ3 - Parking&lt;br /&gt;S 34° 42.253 E 138° 40.282&lt;br /&gt;Car park entrance. Bitumen car park accessible at all times however you will need to cross the road to get to GZ.&lt;br /&gt;P23NNJ3 - Second car parking option&lt;br /&gt;S 34° 42.186 E 138° 40.153&lt;br /&gt;This WP is on the same side of the road as the cache but is dirt and rocks and so may be muddy or cause tyre damage: use at your discretion.</groundspeak:long_description>

So, thanks to ma7:7hew's What Were They Thinking?, here is a nano to welcome you to Elizabeth :)&lt;br/&gt;Is it a boy or a girl is the ongoing discussion regarding the gender of the smallest figure on this artwork.&lt;br/&gt;Please use the car park (additional waypoint) and be careful with children as the cache is close to Main North Rd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6 years ago, Playford Council developed a Regional Centre signage strategy and decided to place entry to Playford - welcome to Elizabeth signs in the middle of Main North Road near Elizabeth City Centre. &lt;br/&gt;Initially, Playford Council had planned to use the letter ‘E’ however as the cursive ‘e’ was already being used by the Elizabeth City Centre shopping precinct, the council decided to obtain some artwork instead. They searched and found Will Hendriks and subsequently he created these two art pieces. &lt;br/&gt;These pieces are the first artwork purchased by Playford council in 50 years since ‘the tusks’,  which now reside at Munno Para train station. &lt;br/&gt;Installation of these artworks was delayed due to ‘red tape’ and eventually the art pieces were installed in 2011 but NOT in the middle of Main North Rd due to DTEI regulations. &lt;br/&gt;The red frame around these artworks represents the harmony experienced despite the diverse regional areas of Playford council and also the building blocks of the families and the people who create this community.&lt;br/&gt;The shapes of the human beings who represent the families and the people of Playford’s community are bright and stand united as you enter their world. &lt;br/&gt;Fremont Park has car parks (additional waypoint), toilets, playgrounds and BBQs. &lt;br/&gt;This park has held many birthday parties, get togethers and spur of the moment picnics and I hope that you enjoy the short walk past the duck pond to the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;CP3GVV2 - Car Park&lt;br/&gt;S 34° 43.121 E 138° 40.542</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Mount Crawford Forest is situated about an hours drive north of Adelaide amongst the Northern Adelaide Hills, just south of the Warren Reservoir. Both towns Gumeracha, well known as the home of the Big Rocking Horse and Williamstown bordering the Barossa Valley are close townships to the Mount Crawford Forest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Land was first purchased for forestry at Mount Crawford in 1909. The plantation mainly consists of native eucalyptus species (South Australian Blue gum, Narrow leaved Ironbark) and Pine species (Maritime pine and Radiata), these plantations started to progress from 1914. The current reserve area is 12,367 hectares and the annual timber harvested at Mount Crawford is about 70,000 tonnes. Along with the impressive size and the beautiful and peaceful environment that surrounds, there are many activities you can do at Mount Crawford Forest. Many people come to enjoy the serenity such as campers, bushwalkers, cyclists, horse riders, fossickers or even those wishing to do a simple activity such as walking their pets throughout one of the many tracks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exploring the Mount Crawford Forest is a great adventure, and you are bound to come across some of the native wildlife. Regular sightings can include the Gray Kangaroo, bird life and feral deer. Conservation and bio-diversity are under constant protection at Mount Crawford Forest, so if you are to bring along your pet make sure to keep them on a leash and keep to the walking trails on your weekend outing. There is plenty to explore keeping to the permitted areas and trails, and this also ensures visitors, plantations in forest and the native wildlife are all kept safe. As you drive, walk, ride or cycle through the tracks you must also be conscious that there are multiple use trails in the forest so it's a good idea to always take due care.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

His work influenced generations of artists and although many of his works were not finished and others had not survived, he was considered to be a universal genius.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a painter, Leonardo used innovative techniques in order to convince viewers of the reality of what they were seeing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He wanted to inspire ideals of beauty, especially in his portraits and his religious works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple slightly artistic cache in a well themed area.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">But for 3 days a year the silence is broken by the roar of Rally Cars. This was hidden in an area which you can see them &quot;fly&quot; past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Land was first purchased for forestry at Mount Crawford in 1909. Plantings commenced in 1914; two species of eucalypts (Narrow-leaved Ironbark and South Australian Blue gum) and two species of pine (Radiata and Maritime pine).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plantings continued to expand until the 1960?s. Many of the original plantations have since been clear felled and replanted.&lt;br/&gt;Survival rate for the plantings range from 90-98% depending on the season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 70,000 tonnes of timber is harvested annually. Current reserve area is 12,367 hectares.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many old gold diggings exist in the Mount Crawford district. John Watts made a rich strike in 1884 in the gully named after him. News of the discovery sparked a major rush in 1885.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is a fully sealed road with fantastic views and bends. I did consider calling this cache 'Kurrajongs Rollercoaster' but did not want to take anything away from the amazing views on your travels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please take caution if you are driving up here at night, with no street lights this would be a very dark and windey road and there is not too many barriers near those edges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small sistema container and can take small swaps. I am hoping you will find this an interesting little drive-by cache. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Finally got to this cache after hearing about it many times. 
Seems I picked a great day for the views: NOT! ;)
Beautiful silence due to the fog/cloud all around me and the grey/whiteness of a winter's day as I did the locus cache:) 
I wonder how the nearby residents would like a 'knicker tree' at GZ: it is starting to grow already! ;)

Still very pretty though. 
So if no one else has logged this here, then I guess I got FTF on opencaching ;)

No need to enter the garden what so ever with this cache, stay on the path, check the clue and it will be obvious to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Playford Council has developed this public seed orchard to allow the convenient, safe and rapid collection of high volumes of local-native seeds with minimal impact on remnant populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This seed orchard allows the use of high volume collection techniques such as planting and weed matting to allow falled seeds and fruits to be collected by sweeping and the use of trellising that greatly facilitates the access to seeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These local plants in turn provide habitate and food sources that attract local native birds, insects and animals.  Unlike most of its namesakes this orchard has been specifically designed to encourage and accomodate these visitors! Heavy mulches, logs  and locally sourced quarry rubble provide additional shelter and opportunities for fauna to make a temporary or even permanent home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A lovely spot and I have never been into this place before, despite having lived nearby for about 18years.  
A quick locus cache and a FTF for me. Woohoo!!  :)  :)  
Thanks for the PT too.

All that was missing was a cache. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a small park, so it is also a small camoflagued cache! &lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When hiking the Parosa Trail in Cobbler Creek I came across this lovely rest spot that has been put up by the 'friends of Cobbler Creek'.  It is a great spot to stop, rest, sit, admire, drink, eat and reflect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;40 Years ago there was plenty of native bush in this area.  Today wedged between the suburbs of Golden Grove and Salisbury.  Cobbler Creek recreation Park contains some of the last stands at Mallee Box Grassy woodland in Adelaide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since settlement in the 1800's new houses and suburbs have gradually encroached on Adelaide's natural areas.  Cobbler Creek is not only a precious reminder of the plants and animals that used to be around Adelaide, but also an important example of a grassy woodland, one of the most poorly conserved habiats in South Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why are grassy woodlands important? Unlike the denser native forests of the Mount Lofty Ranges, grassy woodlands are usually opened spaced providing plenty of light for rich understory of shrubs, grasses and herbs.  The diversity of plants makes grassy woodlands perfect habitat for many animals such as the Eastern Bearded Dragon, Sleepy Lizard and Black-shouldered Kite, species that are more commonly seen in drier, open habitat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Park Code&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Help protect your national parks by following these guidelines:&lt;br/&gt;•Restrain your dog on a lead at all times and clean up after it&lt;br/&gt;•take your rubbish with you&lt;br/&gt;•observe fire restrictions 1 November to 30 April .&lt;br/&gt;•camping is not allowed in this park&lt;br/&gt;•respect geological and heritage sites&lt;br/&gt;•keep wildlife wild - do not feed or disturb animals or remove native plants&lt;br/&gt;•keep to defined vehicle tracks and walking trails&lt;br/&gt;•be considerate of other park users&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Stock trucks, stock, horses, dogs, dust and men.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Unity Park was redeveloped in 2012 to assist with water resource management.&lt;br /&gt;
The starting coordinates are at the newly erected memorial and on here you will find a map of Adelaide which shows the area that was once covered by the abbattoirs.&lt;br /&gt;
Shame they didn't preserve more of the old fences and gates from the stock yards to put around this park to add to the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;
Check out the artwork created in memory of the old abattoirs and use the circles to find your next set of coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
The smallest circle is A. The largest is H. I am sure you can work out the rest. The coords you need are:&lt;br /&gt;
South CD E(D-D). AHH&lt;br /&gt;
East ACH CF.HHD&lt;br /&gt;
Follow the paths to the cache!&lt;br /&gt;
Please leave the 'oinker' for other finders to enjoy but there are a few swaps for kids.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Driving Main North Rd one day, I spied someone who was acting like a geocacher. I parked the car &amp; wandered off, in pouring rain, to give him a hand. However by the time I arrived, the log had been signed and the cache replaced. We stood across the road from this park and chatted and he said something about 'park' and 'cache'. I thought he said 'that park needs a cache'. So here it is: a spur of the moment random cache just because C4 suggested it!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is NOT one of my usual caches. It is not a pretty or unusual container.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is not big enough for swaps. It is not even big enough for a scribing implement. :(&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is however bigger than a nano (bison tube) and big enough to give you a smiley when you find it. :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a couple of seats to sit upon while signing the log and rolling it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are pretty roses and a mural on the wall to admire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a brick plinth in the middle of the park but I have no idea what may once have been displayed upon it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Beware lunchtime muggles enjoying the view and the sunshine and the passing traffic, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please do not dismantle the hedge or the wall. Considerate caching shows respect for all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You may need a tool for retrieval from its hidey hole!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Well this is my cache experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adelaide is a beautiful city with many lovely historical buildings such as the one guarding this cache.  Being a small city it is already pretty much covered in GC caches, if you do some crop circles there are very few spots available left to hide a cache.  Hence the reason when I found this spot just metres from my work it just seemed too perfect for me to leave it without a cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have decided to have a look at all the alternative Geocaching sites and list this cache on them, and conduct an experiment as to see who looks at the geocaching alternatives, whether it is more tourists finding the cache or if it is the locals which are giving it a go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you log your cache, please therefore give me a brief description of which sites you choose to use and where you are from, please also let me know if you are a tourist or a local.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As this cache is not being listed on the GC site, please do not leave trackables, but feel free to drop a pathtag or two to entice the next person to find the cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THIS IS A VERY BUSY LOCATION - STEALTH IS DEFINATELY REQUIRED</groundspeak:long_description>

I do enjoy the rating system of opencaching.  It lets the users create a consensus rating of a cache. After the first few though, it has averaged out, so to make it count, you have to get on early.
Interesting experiment. I shall keep an eye on it.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As on several previous caching occasions, when we stopped here tonight this place was used (much to ours and many other geocachers' relief)  to put things 'in one end and out the other'. Hence the cache name!  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We hope you will also obtain some relief through finding a cache while you are here.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Obviously, this is a high muggle area at all hours of the day so please use extra stealth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Coords may be a tad off due to tree cover.</groundspeak:long_description>

Skynet is operational. &lt;br /&gt;
Cyberdyne Systems has been busy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The machines are here, and they're not friendly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is guarded by a T-800 model Terminator, your basic cyborg
assassin from the year 2029.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the day, the high muggle factor will probably pose more of a
problem than the terminator. Don't get caught! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hasta la vista, baby!

He came out to me as I was signing the log and wonderered why so many people were signing the log book - which he also found. I explained all to him, had a good chat, he said he even saw a family of kids geocaching here and the kids loved it.
He is even thinking of creating a female one, sometime. 
Thanks for a great spot.</groundspeak:text>

You've got to be quick to get on the first page of the log book in a Hills cache! I must have missed cruiz-n by a few minutes as I was there 1315h with only a dog walker having a quick lunch to be seen. I was sure there was a FTF for me... But 3rd is pretty good too, especially as I remember saying I wasn't interested in FTFs.
GPS fix was OK, had to look around as there are a few candidate hiding spots. In the end it was quite easy access.
I used to go here for scouts a few decades back, but the hall was demolished long ago. The park itself hasn't changed much though.

Thanks for the chupachup too! I probably shouldn't have had it, but it was a nice reward as I drove back to work.

There is rarely water flowing at this waterfall but the view and the journey there is the best part and keep your eye out for the locals on the way.  This hike is not for the faint hearted but once you reach the top the cache is your reward. There is room for small trinkets only. happy hunting. Please cover carefully again. thank you.&lt;br/&gt;You can get to this point from closer locations but the hike from the bottom is well worth the effort.&lt;br/&gt;There is a fee to enter the park in a vehicle however there is a carpark outside for hikers and walkers to use and no fee to enter.&lt;br/&gt;This cache is not accessible by vehicle sorry. &lt;br/&gt;Please be wary of the cliff neaby the cache is not down there...&lt;br/&gt;Do not try this one at night either.</groundspeak:long_description>

I parked on Sheoak road and bushwhacked over, missing the path by a few metres!Don'y try it at night: the cliff is high and the blackberries are thorny!Coordinates have been updated with the owner, so hopefully it is a reasonable estimate of GZ now, I was 30 m off the mark at first.A nice spot to visit. It was rainy and the waterfall was flowing. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

Some of those jumps are amazing. I'd love to see someone using them, but today there was noone about.
Had my daughter and Ingrid with me. Son was in a grump and didn't make the journey across from the path till after we'd found this one.

The District comprises an area of the southern&lt;br /&gt;foothills south east of Adelaide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blackwood Scout Group had humble beginnings in the then rural&lt;br /&gt;hamlet of Blackwood in 1909 with the formation of the &quot;Hound&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Patrol. State Council registered the patrol on 16th November of&lt;br /&gt;that year (Published in &quot;The Advertiser&quot; on 20th November) and&lt;br /&gt;listed as No. 31 on the first official day of registration on 11th&lt;br /&gt;December 1909.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woolshed was brought from Port Adelaide in 1928 and transported&lt;br /&gt;to land at 288 Main Road, Blackwood donated by the Davey-Thomas&lt;br /&gt;family. The hall was opened with much ceremony in 1929.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Group is now coming up to 100 years old. The Group currently&lt;br /&gt;provides a Joey Scout Mob (Tuesday), two Cub Scout Packs (Tuesday&lt;br /&gt;and Thursday) and a Scout Troop (Wednesday). The Group services a&lt;br /&gt;catchment area for boys and girls that includes the suburbs of&lt;br /&gt;Blackwood, Glenalta, Hawthorndene, Coromandel Valley and&lt;br /&gt;beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache name &quot;Drop off a Dead Marine&quot; comes from the bottle&lt;br /&gt;recycling activities nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the younger cachers, what a dead marine is about can be found&lt;br /&gt;at Dead&lt;br /&gt;Marine

Terrain is reasonably steep in cache location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a small cache in a plastic &quot;sandwich&quot; style container. It is best accessed from the north, via the Tom Roberts Horse Trail and a small side track (see photograph). Access is also possible from the south but is very steep and not for the faint hearted. Also, best to do in dry weather as last 50 meters can get very slippery. Enjoy this quiet bush setting.</groundspeak:long_description>

A nice walk and a quick find although the creek wasn't all that dry this morning. Grabbed the GC to move on. TFTC. [:D]

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Lane Cove was hidden on 18-May-2000, so 18-May-2010 will see the
10th anniversary of geocaching in Australia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To celebrate this milestone, this cache has been hidden as one of
many placed to commemorate the occasion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is located in the Frank Smith Park Wetland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Located in Coromandel Valley, Frank Smith Park is a reserve
approximately 12 hectares in size.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The need for a wetland on the site was identified in the initial
management plan for the Patawalonga Catchment Water Management
Board. Community support for the project saw the development of the
Frank Smith Park Wetland Working Group, which included
representatives from:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cities of Onkaparinga and Mitcham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patawalonga Catchment Water Management Board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greening Australia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coromandel Valley Community Association&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coromandel Primary School&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1998, a concept plan for the wetland was developed. Construction
began in December 2000 and was completed in 2001.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose of the wetland is to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improve water quality downstream of the Sturt River&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enhance the existing corridor linking native vegetation along
the river&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;form part of the Sturt River Linear Park, catering for passive
recreation activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide environmental education opportunities by promoting
issues such as water quality, catchment care and biodiversity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Structure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The wetland area is made up of three ponds, which sit at different
levels. Each pond was designed to perform a separate function. The
upstream pond forms an inlet zone, the central pond provides rock
islands for bird loafing and the downstream pond forms a mudflat.
Additional features include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;boardwalks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a jetty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a lookout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;walking and riding trails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;informal meeting areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Last 15 meters or so is off the track and through a clearing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A microcache, which only contains a paper log. There is no pencil so bring your own. I would only recommend reasonably fit and agile geocachers attempt this as the last 100m is steep and slippery, with loose rocks.

When we ventured up we found a picnic table with amazing views, a comfy seat along with some amazing ruins, flowers everywhere and huge butterflies. The cache is not in the ruins, it's further up the hill. A nicely placed rock makes a lovely place to sit and take in the view.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
As part of the response to extinguish the fires, the Sturt CFS
Group sent a strike team from Coromandel Valley, Blackwood, Eden
Hills and Belair.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the fire appliances that responded in the strike team were a
couple of geocachers, firesafe and EmZee Wild'rs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And what do cachers do while waiting to get down to firefighting -
they look for a spot to hide a cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finding this cache will allow you to see the scrub that burnt
regenerate over time. Post some photos so that we can see the
transformation.</groundspeak:long_description>
