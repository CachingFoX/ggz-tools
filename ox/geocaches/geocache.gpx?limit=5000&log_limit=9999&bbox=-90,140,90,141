            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There was a group of 15 SA cachers that went to Mildura for the
event and to assimilate into the local environment we all dressed
as Mexicans (if in Mexico do what the Mexicans do). A great time
was had by all. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 On coming home and doing the last of Jardry's Old Mail Road caches
then heading up to Wacky's Jeepers Creepers and then onto the Old
Escort House, it seemed just like doing a Border Run - so just what
was needed for a new cache adjoining the Border Fence and Track -

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Paringa Bridge was built in 1927 for the railway extension over
the River Murray to Renmark. It is one of South Australia's
significant engineering monuments.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Paringa Bridge was designed so that one of the six steel spans
could be raised to allow the river boats to pass through. It
carried a single-track railway and also catered for road traffic
with cantilevered roadways on both sides of the central
spans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Paringa Bridge is a State Heritage Place protected by the
Heritage Places Act 1993.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is a Yamazaki Shop convenience store nearby too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a new paid parking lot next to the SL,  but you can park free behind the soba shop, or at the nearby community building Ma-in</groundspeak:long_description>

Both stages require a bit&lt;br/&gt;of hunting once you reach the coordinates. But are easily&lt;br/&gt;accessible. Daytime can have LOTS of muggles. The path is lit and&lt;br/&gt;the cache can easily be done at night. Private homes are above the&lt;br/&gt;walkway, and during nice weather people fish, walk, ride bicycles,&lt;br/&gt;and can also be seen in the back of their homes. Plenty of space to&lt;br/&gt;bring lunch and watch the ducks, fish and people. Stage 1 is a&lt;br/&gt;small black plastic box about the size of a deck of playing cards.&lt;br/&gt;It also has a log book &amp; pen. Stage 2 is a rectangular clear&lt;br/&gt;plastic 1.0L container, labeled as a cache. Initial contents: FTF&lt;br/&gt;Mickey Mouse keitai strap; Batteries (just in case you've found a&lt;br/&gt;lot of caches); Chinese &quot;silk&quot; purse; mini buddah statue; mini&lt;br/&gt;yo-yo; and of course Log Book &amp; pen.

WARNING: You do NOT need to enter the cave to obtain cache. This area can be dangerous. Caution is advised especially with children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK1ZA3A - Parking&lt;br/&gt;S 37° 43.912 E 140° 31.805&lt;br/&gt;Parking area </groundspeak:long_description>

We have done this walk twice and managed to see a kangaroo and joey, an echidna, a snake and plenty of water birds. The walk is relatively easy this a few minor up and downs. A parking area and toilet is available nearby. Please bring binoculars if available. Enjoy the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have the time to spare there are a few plaques near car park and an optional walk ( away from getting cache ) towards the beach that may be worth a look. There is sometimes an information sheet available with points of interest along the walk to GZ supplied by parks Victoria. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Container is small with log book, pen and small swaps. Please replace in same spot so it can not easily be seen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK1N0FC - Parking Area&lt;br/&gt;S 38° 03.373 E 140° 59.659&lt;br/&gt;Parking Area</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We really enjoyed this walk.It started with Pam walking in front and calmly observing a young brown/tiger/copperhead snake of about 1m length slowly moving along the edge of the path.Then as we descended towards the wooden board-walk, we were going down the narrow pathway, again with Pam in front when a large kangaroo broke cover just as I walked past and bounded up the track away from and behind us. I'm glad he didn't spook as Pam walked past him or he would have run straight into me.Then after seeing the birds we found the cache and did out business.On the way back I spotted a large echidna in the bush beside the track.Not a bad afternoons spotting.Thanks for enhancing our visit here.</groundspeak:text>
