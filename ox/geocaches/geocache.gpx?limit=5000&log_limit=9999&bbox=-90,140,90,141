            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There was a group of 15 SA cachers that went to Mildura for the
event and to assimilate into the local environment we all dressed
as Mexicans (if in Mexico do what the Mexicans do). A great time
was had by all. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
 &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 On coming home and doing the last of Jardry's Old Mail Road caches
then heading up to Wacky's Jeepers Creepers and then onto the Old
Escort House, it seemed just like doing a Border Run - so just what
was needed for a new cache adjoining the Border Fence and Track -

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Paringa Bridge was built in 1927 for the railway extension over
the River Murray to Renmark. It is one of South Australia's
significant engineering monuments.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Paringa Bridge was designed so that one of the six steel spans
could be raised to allow the river boats to pass through. It
carried a single-track railway and also catered for road traffic
with cantilevered roadways on both sides of the central
spans.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Paringa Bridge is a State Heritage Place protected by the
Heritage Places Act 1993.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is a Yamazaki Shop convenience store nearby too.

There is a new paid parking lot next to the SL,  but you can park free behind the soba shop, or at the nearby community building Ma-in</groundspeak:long_description>

stage has the coordinates for the second. Both stages require a bit
of hunting once you reach the coordinates. But are easily
accessible. Daytime can have LOTS of muggles. The path is lit and
the cache can easily be done at night. Private homes are above the
walkway, and during nice weather people fish, walk, ride bicycles,
and can also be seen in the back of their homes. Plenty of space to
bring lunch and watch the ducks, fish and people. Stage 1 is a
small black plastic box about the size of a deck of playing cards.
It also has a log book &amp; pen. Stage 2 is a rectangular clear
plastic 1.0L container, labeled as a cache. Initial contents: FTF
Mickey Mouse keitai strap; Batteries (just in case you've found a
lot of caches); Chinese &quot;silk&quot; purse; mini buddah statue; mini
yo-yo; and of course Log Book &amp; pen. THANKS! Good luck!</groundspeak:long_description>

Night Cache. Please do this cache at night after dark. It is easy to find and will only require a torch and you can park very close. But this location is amazing at night. Look at the stars, notice the &quot;red stars&quot;, listen to the &quot;wind&quot; and if you look close enough you'll see a light house beam in the distance over the hill. The cache is a small container suitable for small swaps only. Please bring your own pen. Obviously for best results overcast night not recommended. Enjoy.</groundspeak:long_description>

Hence it is named after them and their adventures that is published in our geocaching magazine. The walk here is nice and it can be done 24 hours a day. Close parking nearby and only a short walk to cache while your geo-dogs play off lead. Please bring your own pen. This one only has room for a log book.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This walk will take you past some different areas in a walk around 700m (1.4km return) to GZ from parking spot. We have done this walk twice and managed to see a kangaroo and joey, an echidna, a snake and plenty of water birds. The walk is relatively easy this a few minor up and downs. A parking area and toilet is available nearby. Please bring binoculars if available. Enjoy the cache.

If you have the time to spare there are a few plaques near car park and an optional walk ( away from getting cache ) towards the beach that may be worth a look. There is sometimes an information sheet available with points of interest along the walk to GZ supplied by parks Victoria. 

Container is small with log book, pen and small swaps. Please replace in same spot so it can not easily be seen. 

Thank you
