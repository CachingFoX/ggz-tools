Spanning 82 acres in the Pecos River valley, Fort Lancaster State
Historic Site commemorates the vestiges of one of four posts
established in 1855 to protect the military route between San
Antonio and El Paso. Visitors wander through ruins imagining the
once-impressive establishment of 25 permanent buildings —
including a blacksmith shop, hospital, sutler’s store and
bakery — and enjoy the sights, sounds and wildlife of West
Texas.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Cache is located at the entrance to the Fort, highly recommend you
check it out.</groundspeak:long_description>

Lancaster. Park at the Picnic area and hike to the cache, no need
to cross any fence lines unless you park in the wrong spot.

As always when caching in West Texas watch out for wildlife, when I
placed this cache I saw two deer, one porcupine (very near the
cache location) and one Mountain Lion, from a distance as I was
back at the car.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The hike from the picnic area is roughly 1/4 mile, mostly even yet
rocky terrain, I recommend you don't go it alone unless you must,
you'll be fairly close to a little cliff that you'll want to watch
out for. Use Caution.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;Star Trek (2009 Movie)&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Star Trek is a 2009 American science fiction film directed by J. J.
Abrams, written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, distributed by
Paramount Pictures. It is the eleventh film based on the Star Trek
franchise and features the main characters of the original Star
Trek television series, portrayed by a new cast. The film follows
James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Dr. McCoy
(Karl Urban) aboard the USS Enterprise as they combat Nero (Eric
Bana), a Romulan from their future who threatens the United
Federation of Planets. The story takes place in an alternate
reality due to time travel by both Nero and the original Spock
(Leonard Nimoy). The alternate timeline was created in an effort to
free the film and the franchise from established continuity
constraints while simultaneously preserving the original continuity
via the utilization of the alternate timeline plot idea.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Development of the film began in 2005. Filming took place from
November 2007 to March 2008 under intense secrecy. Midway through
the shoot, Paramount chose to delay the release date from December
25, 2008 to May 2009, believing that the film would reach a wider
audience.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The film earned high critical praise, gaining a 94% on Rotten
Tomatoes. It has become the highest-grossing film in the Star Trek
series (not accounting for inflation); as such, it is credited by
the media as a reboot of the series. It was nominated for four
Oscars at the 82nd Academy Awards and won the Academy Award for
Best Makeup, making it the first Star Trek film to win an
Oscar.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
My favorite of the Star Trek Movies. I think they pulled off the
timeline changes quite well and allows for a fantastic reboot of
the series.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;Nemesis&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Star Trek Nemesis is a 2002 science fiction film directed by Stuart
Baird, written by John Logan (from a story developed by Logan,
Brent Spiner, and producer Rick Berman), and with music composed by
Jerry Goldsmith. It is the tenth feature film in the Star Trek
franchise, and the fourth and final film to star the cast from the
television series Star Trek: The Next Generation. It follows the
mission of the crew of the USS Enterprise-E as they are forced to
deal with a threat to the United Federation of Planets from a Reman
clone of Captain Picard named Shinzon who has taken control of the
Romulan Star Empire in a coup.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Nemesis acted as a swan song for The Next Generation cast, as could
be seen from the film's tagline of &quot;A generation's final journey
begins&quot;. The film was the least commercially successful in the
franchise, and was poorly received by the majority of
critics.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I remember watching this at a movie house in San Antonio, I really
like this one, it was a great way to wrap up TNG.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;Enterprise&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Star Trek: Enterprise (originally titled simply Enterprise until
the start of the third season) is a science fiction television
series. It follows the adventures of humanity's first Warp 5
starship, the Enterprise, ten years before the United Federation of
Planets shown in previous Star Trek series was formed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Enterprise premiered on September 26, 2001. The pilot episode,
&quot;Broken Bow&quot;, takes place in the year 2151 (exactly 150 years from
the then current year), halfway between the 21st-century events
shown in the movie Star Trek: First Contact and the original Star
Trek television series. Low ratings prompted UPN to cancel Star
Trek: Enterprise on February 2, 2005, but the network allowed the
series to complete its fourth season. The final episode aired on
May 13, 2005. After a run of four seasons and 98 episodes, it was
the first Star Trek series since the original Star Trek to have
been cancelled by its network rather than finished by its
producers. It is also the last series in an 18-year run of
back-to-back new Star Trek shows beginning with Star Trek: The Next
Generation in 1987.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I watched this Star Trek from the beginning and I enjoyed it, was
confused by it some, but it was a good series in my opinion.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;Insurrection&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Star Trek: Insurrection is a 1998 American science fiction film
directed by Jonathan Frakes, written by Michael Piller (with the
story developed by producer Rick Berman and Piller), and with music
composed by Jerry Goldsmith. It is the ninth film in the Star Trek
franchise, and the third to feature the cast from the television
series Star Trek: The Next Generation. It revolves around the
insurrection of the USS Enterprise-E as they discover that
Starfleet has been conspiring with a species known as the Son'a to
steal the planet of the peaceful Ba'ku for themselves.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Insurrection was also the first Star Trek film to feature
completely digital visual effects. No physical models were
used.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is probably my least favorite of TNG films, but still pretty
good.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;First Contact&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Star Trek: First Contact is the eighth feature film in the Star
Trek science fiction franchise, released in November 1996, by
Paramount Pictures. First Contact is the first film in the
franchise to feature no cast members from the original Star Trek
television series of the 1960s. The primary cast for First Contact
is from the Star Trek: The Next Generation television series, to
which the film's producers added Alice Krige, Neal McDonough, James
Cromwell and Alfre Woodard. In the film's plot, the crew of the USS
Enterprise travel from the 24th to 21st century to save their
future after the cybernetic Borg conquer Earth by changing the
timeline.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
First Contact was the highest-grossing film on its opening weekend,
making $30.7 million. The film made $92 million in the United
States and an additional $57.4 million in other territories, for a
theatrical run of about $146 million worldwide. Critical reception
was mostly positive; critics including Roger Ebert considered it
one of the best Star Trek films. The Borg and the special effects
were lauded, while characterization was less evenly received.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I enjoyed this one, good time travel story line and the borg is
always fun!</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;Voyager&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Star Trek: Voyager (also referred to as ST:VOY or ST:VGR) is a
science fiction television series set in the Star Trek universe.
Set in the 24th century from the year 2371 through 2378, the series
follows the adventures of the Starfleet vessel USS Voyager, which
becomes stranded in the Delta Quadrant 70,000 light-years from
Earth while pursuing a renegade Maquis ship. Both ships' crews
merge aboard Voyager to make the estimated 75-year journey
home.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Voyager was produced to launch UPN, a television network planned by
Paramount. This was the second time that Paramount had considered
launching a network anchored by a Star Trek show: the studio
planned to launch a network showcasing Star Trek: Phase II in
1977.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It had been years since I watched any Voyager and I remembered it
being fairly bad, but I've recently watched it more recently and
it's not quite as bad as I remembered.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;Generations&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Star Trek: Generations is a 1994 American science fiction film
released by Paramount Pictures. Generations is the seventh feature
film based on the Star Trek television series and the first film in
the series to star the cast of the spinoff television series Star
Trek: The Next Generation. The entire main cast of Star Trek: The
Next Generation appear in Generations.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
After the release of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country in
1991, it was expected that the next Star Trek feature film would
feature the cast of the Star Trek: The Next Generation television
spinoff series. Paramount Pictures executives approached The Next
Generation producer Rick Berman in late 1992 about creating a
feature film, four months before the official announcement.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Marketing for the film included a web site, the first on the
internet to officially publicize a motion picture. The site was a
success, being viewed millions of times worldwide in the weeks
leading to the film's release at a time when fewer than a million
Americans had internet access.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;Deep Space Nine&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A spin-off from Star Trek: The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine
began while its parent series was still on the air, although there
were few crossover episodes between the two shows. In addition, two
Next Generation characters, Miles O'Brien and (from Season 4
onwards) Worf, became regular members of DS9.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Unlike the other Star Trek programs, DS9 took place on a space
station instead of a starship, so as not to have two series with
starships at the same time (the starship USS Defiant was introduced
in season 3, but the station remained the primary setting for the
show). This made continuing story arcs and the appearance of
recurring characters much more feasible. The show is noted for its
well-developed characters and its original, complex plots. The
series depended on darker themes, less physical exploration of
space, and an emphasis (in later seasons) on many aspects of
war.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I never watched much DS9, I remember mom watching it some when I
was little and therefore my thinking of it as a Star Trek Soap
Opera... I guess I need to watch it some.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;The Undiscovered Country&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is the sixth feature film in
the Star Trek science fiction franchise and is the last of the Star
Trek films to include the entire main cast of the 1960s Star Trek
television series. It was released in 1991 by Paramount Pictures.
It was directed by Nicholas Meyer and written by Meyer with Denny
Martin Flinn. After an ecological disaster leads to two
longstanding enemies—the Federation and the Klingon
Empire—brokering a tenuous truce, the crew of the USS
Enterprise must prevent war from breaking out on the eve of
universal peace.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Undiscovered Country was initially planned as a prequel to the
original series, with younger actors portraying the crew of the
Enterprise while attending Starfleet Academy, but the idea was
discarded because of negative reaction from the cast and the fans.
This idea was later used to create the 2009 film, Star Trek. Faced
with producing a new film in time for Star Trek's 25th anniversary,
Flinn and Meyer, the director of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,
wrote a script based on a suggestion from Leonard Nimoy about what
would happen if &quot;the wall came down in space&quot;, touching on the
contemporary events of the Cold War.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The film was released in North America on December 6, 1991. The
Undiscovered Country garnered positive reviews, with publications
praising the lighthearted acting and facetious references. The film
performed strongly at the box office; it posted the largest opening
weekend gross of the series before going on to earn $96,888,996
worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry died shortly before the movie's
premiere, just days after viewing the film.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is a 1989 American science fiction
film released by Paramount Pictures. It is the fifth feature in the
franchise and the penultimate to star the cast of the original Star
Trek science fiction television series. Taking place shortly after
the events of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, the plot follows the
crew of the USS Enterprise-A as they confront a renegade Vulcan,
Sybok, who is searching for God at the center of the galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The film was directed by cast member William Shatner, following two
films directed by his co-star, Leonard Nimoy. Shatner also
developed the initial storyline in which Sybok searches for God,
but instead finds Satan. The original script was disliked by series
creator Gene Roddenberry, while Nimoy and DeForest Kelley objected
to the premise that their characters, Spock and Leonard McCoy,
would betray Shatner's James T. Kirk. The script went through
multiple revisions to please the cast and studio, including cuts in
the effects-laden climax of the film. Despite a writers' guild
strike cutting into the film's preproduction, Paramount commenced
filming in October 1988.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Final Frontier was released in North America on June 9, 1989,
amidst a summer box office crowded by sequels and blockbuster
films. It had the highest opening gross of any film in the series
at that point and was number one its first week at the box office,
but its grosses quickly dropped in subsequent weeks. The film
received generally mixed or poor reviews by critics on release, and
according to its producer nearly killed the franchise. The next
entry in the series, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,
received a kinder reception.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;The Next Generation&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Star Trek: The Next Generation (often abbreviated to TNG) is an
American science fiction television series created by Gene
Roddenberry as part of the Star Trek franchise. Roddenberry, Rick
Berman, and Michael Piller served as executive producers at
different times throughout the production. The show was created 21
years after the original Star Trek show, and set in the 24th
century from the year 2364 through 2370 (about 100 years after the
original series timeframe). The program features a new crew and a
new starship Enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It premiered the week of September 28, 1987 to 27 million viewers
with the two-hour pilot &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;. With 178 episodes
spread over seven seasons, it ran longer than any other Star Trek
series, ending with the two-hour finale &quot;All Good Things...&quot; the
week of May 23, 1994.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Enterprise is commanded by Captain Jean-Luc Picard, and is
staffed by first officer Commander William Riker, the android
Lieutenant Commander Data, security chief Lieutenant Tasha Yar,
ship's counsellor Deanna Troi, Klingon tactical officer Lieutenant
Worf, Doctor Beverly Crusher, and conn officer Lieutenant Geordi La
Forge. The death of Lieutenant Yar in the show's first season
prompts an internal shuffle of personnel, making Worf official
chief of security. Geordi La Forge is promoted to chief engineer at
the beginning of season 2.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
My wife, absolutely HATES Commander Data, I'm not sure why, just
hates him... I greatly enjoy TNG, it is often on SyFy lately and I
spend alot of time with the kiddo watching it.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Voyage Home&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is a 1986 American science fiction
film released by Paramount Pictures. It is the fourth feature film
based on the Star Trek science fiction television series. It
completes the story begun in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and
continued in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. Intent on
returning home to Earth to face trial for their crimes, the former
crew of the USS Enterprise finds the planet in grave danger from an
alien probe attempting to contact now-extinct humpback whales. The
crew travel to Earth's past to find whales who can answer the
probe's call.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
After directing The Search for Spock, cast member Leonard Nimoy was
asked to direct the next feature, and given greater freedom
regarding the film's content.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
William Shatner plays James T. Kirk, former captain of the
Enterprise. Shatner was unwilling to reprise the role of Kirk until
he received a salary of $2 million and the promise of directing the
next film.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This movie was alittle out there for me. Though I did enjoy it it
just doesn't feel like Star Trek to me.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;The Search for Spock&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Star Trek III: The Search for Spock is a 1984 motion picture
released by Paramount Pictures. The film is the third feature based
on the Star Trek science fiction franchise. After the death of
Spock (Leonard Nimoy) during the events of Star Trek II: The Wrath
of Khan, the crew of the USS Enterprise returns to Earth. When
James T. Kirk (William Shatner) learns that Spock's spirit, or
katra, is held in the mind of Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Kirk
and company steal the Enterprise to return Spock's body to his home
planet. The crew must also contend with hostile Klingons, led by
Kruge (Christopher Lloyd), bent on stealing the secrets of a
powerful terraforming device.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This film was directed by Leonard Nemoy. The Search for Spock
opened June 1, 1984. In its first week of release, the film broke
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom's gross records, making $16
million from almost 2,000 theaters across the United States. It
went on to gross $76 million at the domestic box office, toward a
total of $87 million worldwide. Critical reaction to The Search for
Spock was mixed. Reviewers generally praised the cast and
characters, while criticism tended to focus on the plot; the
special effects were conflictingly received. Roger Ebert called the
film a compromise between the tones of the first and second Star
Trek films. The Search for Spock was released on multiple home
video formats, including VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray high definition
discs. Nimoy went on to direct The Search for Spock's sequel, Star
Trek IV: The Voyage Home.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I'll gladly watch this movie, but I'm not real big on this one
overall.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;The Wrath of Khan&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a 1982 American science fiction
film released by Paramount Pictures. The film is the second feature
based on the Star Trek science fiction franchise. The plot features
James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and the crew of the starship USS
Enterprise facing off against the genetically-engineered tyrant
Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalbán), a character who first
appeared in the 1967 Star Trek television series episode &quot;Space
Seed&quot;. When Khan escapes from a 15-year exile to exact revenge on
Kirk, the crew of the Enterprise must stop him from acquiring a
powerful terraforming device named Genesis. The film concludes with
the death of Enterprise crewmember Spock (Leonard Nimoy), beginning
a story arc that continues with the 1984 film Star Trek III: The
Search For Spock and concludes with 1986's Star Trek IV: The Voyage
Home.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
After the lackluster critical and commercial response to Star Trek:
The Motion Picture, series creator Gene Roddenberry was forced out
of the sequel's production. Executive producer Harve Bennett wrote
the film's original outline, which Jack B. Sowards developed into a
full script. Director Nicholas Meyer completed the final script in
12 days, without accepting a writing credit. Meyer's approach
evoked the swashbuckling atmosphere of the original series, and the
theme was reinforced by James Horner's musical score. Leonard Nimoy
only reprized his role as Spock because the character's death was
intended to be irrevocable. Negative test audience reaction to
Spock's death led to significant revisions of the ending over
Meyer's objections. The production used various cost-cutting
techniques to keep within budget, including utilizing miniatures
from past projects and re-using effects footage and costumes from
the previous movie. Among the film's technical achievements is that
it is the first feature film to contain a complete sequence created
entirely with computer-generated graphics.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Wrath of Khan was released in North America on June 4, 1982. It
was a box office success, earning US$97 million worldwide and
setting a world record for first-day box office gross. Critical
reaction to the film was positive; reviewers highlighted Khan, the
film's pacing and the character interactions as strong elements.
Negative reaction focused on weak special effects and some of the
acting. The Wrath of Khan is generally considered one of the best
films of the Star Trek series and is credited with the creation of
substantial renewed interest in the franchise.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I enjoyed this one the most of the original cast Star Trek
Movies.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;The Motion Picture&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a 1979 American science fiction
film released by Paramount Pictures. It is the first film based on
the Star Trek television series. The plot of the film is set in the
twenty-third century, when a mysterious and immensely powerful
alien cloud called V'Ger approaches the Earth, destroying
everything in its path. Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner)
assumes command of his old starship—the USS
Enterprise—to lead it on a mission to save the planet and
determine V'Ger's origins.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When the original television series was cancelled in 1969, Star
Trek creator Gene Roddenberry lobbied Paramount to continue the
franchise through a film. The success of the series in syndication
convinced the studio to begin work on a feature film in 1975. A
series of writers attempted to craft a suitably epic script, but
the attempts did not satisfy Paramount, so the studio scrapped the
project in 1977. Paramount instead planned on returning the
franchise to its roots with a new television series, Star Trek:
Phase II. The box office success of Close Encounters of the Third
Kind convinced Paramount that science fiction films other than Star
Wars could do well at the box office, so the studio cancelled
production of Phase II and resumed its attempts at making a Star
Trek film. In 1978, Paramount assembled the largest press
conference held at the studio since the 1950s to announce that
double Academy Award–winning director Robert Wise would helm
a $15 million film adaptation of the television series.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Released in North America on December 7, 1979, Star Trek: The
Motion Picture received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom
criticized the film for its lack of action and over-reliance on
special effects. The final production cost ballooned to
approximately $46 million. The film earned $139 million worldwide,
falling short of studio expectations but enough for Paramount to
propose a cheaper sequel. Roddenberry was forced out of creative
control for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Personally I did like this movie but it was a bit lacking for me as
well.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;The Animated Series&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I've never actually watched any of the Animated Series, though I do
intend to begin!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Star Trek: The Animated Series (originally known as simply Star
Trek but also known as The Animated Adventures of Gene
Roddenberry’s Star Trek) is an animated science fiction
television series set in the Star Trek universe following the Star
Trek: The Original Series of the 1960s. The animated series was
aired under the name Star Trek, but it has become widely known
under this longer name (or abbreviated as ST: TAS or TAS) to
differentiate it from the original live-action Star Trek. The
success in syndication of the original live action series and fan
pressure for a Star Trek revival led to The Animated Series from
1973–1974, as the source of new adventures of the Enterprise
crew, the next being the 1979 live-action feature film Star Trek:
The Motion Picture. TAS was the first Star Trek series to win an
Emmy Award.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Airing on NBC, the series premiered on September 8, 1973 and was
broadcast until October 12, 1974, although only twenty-two episodes
were produced. The series aired Saturday mornings at 10:30am
Eastern/9:30am Central in 1973 and at 11:30am Eastern/10:30am
Central the following year.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As is usual for animation, the voice actors did not perform
together but recorded their parts separately to avoid clashing with
other commitments. For instance, William Shatner, who was touring
in a play at the time, would record his lines in whatever city he
happened to be in and have the tapes shipped to the studio.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The USS Enterprise in this series, while supposedly the same ship
as from the original series, had a holodeck very similar to the one
introduced on Star Trek: The Next Generation, which was set
approximately eighty years later. It only appeared once, in Chuck
Menville's &quot;The Practical Joker&quot;, and was known as the &quot;Rec Room&quot;.
This feature was originally proposed for the original series (see,
e.g., Gerrold, The World of Star Trek) but was never used.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;The Original Series&lt;/h1&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Star Trek is an American science fiction television series created
by Gene Roddenberry, produced by Desilu Productions (later
Paramount Television). Star Trek was telecast on NBC from September
8, 1966, through June 3, 1969.[2] Although this TV series had the
title of Star Trek, it has acquired the retronym of Star Trek: The
Original Series (Star Trek: TOS or TOS) to distinguish the show
within the media franchise that it began. Star Trek's Nielsen
ratings while on NBC were low, and the network canceled it after
two seasons. After a grass roots appeal to save the show, NBC
brought it back for a third season. Ratings were still not high and
NBC again cancelled the series. In all, there were three seasons
and 79 episodes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Star Trek follows the adventures of the starship USS Enterprise
(NCC-1701) and its crew, led by Captain James T. Kirk (William
Shatner), Enterprise's science officer and first officer Mr. Spock
(Leonard Nimoy), Enterprise's second officer and chief engineer
Montgomery Scott (James Doohan) also known as &quot;Scotty,&quot; and chief
medical officer Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley), in the 23rd
century. Shatner's voice-over introduction during each episode's
opening credits stated the starship's purpose:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the
starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new
worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go
where no man has gone before.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is the first cache in another series of caches for Star Trek
to be tacked onto the end of the James Bond Series (which will
hopefully grow so I left some room in between)</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This was the second Bond movie to have Daniel Craig playing the
role of James Bond and number 22 in the series.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I loved the way this movie opened, the car scene was great, then
the following foot chase and fighting. Overall I quite enjoyed this
Bond movie, not my favorite but a great one.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is the only Bond Sequel, a movie directly following the
previous one, it uses a books name but not the plot.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This movie has it all, Car Chases, Foot chases, boat and even plane
chases!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Still not over gadgety like the ones with Peirce Brosnan, I did
quite enjoy the touch screen table computer they were using, so if
someone is looking to buy me a gift, I'll take one of those
:)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Was released November 14th, 2008 (My Birthday) we went and watched
it the following evening after my birthday supper with the family,
while my parents took our little man for the night.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The film premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 29 October
2008, gathering mixed reviews which mainly praised Craig's gritty
performance and the film's action sequences while feeling that
Quantum of Solace was not as impressive as the predecessor Casino
Royale. It is also the second highest grossing James Bond film,
without adjusting for inflation, making $586,090,727 worldwide,
while becoming one of the highest grossing Bond films in the United
States.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is by far my favorite of the Bond movies. 21st film in the
James Bond film series and the first to star Daniel Craig as MI6
agent James Bond.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The film is a reboot, establishing a new timeline and narrative
framework not meant to precede or succeed any previous Bond film.
This allowed the film to show a less experienced and more
vulnerable Bond and therefore for the first time in the series the
character of Miss Moneypenny does not appear.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Casino Royale premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on November
14, 2006 (I turned 21 that day this is the 21st Bond, that's neat).
It received largely positive critical response, with reviewers
highlighting Craig's performance and the reinvention of the
character of Bond. It earned over $594 million worldwide, making it
the highest-grossing James Bond film to date.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Bond 20, fourth and last with Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. This
movie marks the 40th anniversary of the Bond Franchise.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Though like all Bond movies I enjoy watching this one, I feel they
went a bit overboard on CGI effects, it just didn't feel like Bond
to me. My biggest issue with the Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore
films was they got a bit gadget heavy, afterall I don't expect an
MI6 agent to have a utility belt (Can't remember if I mentioned it
before, did you know Adam West screen tested for Bond?) Halle Berry
did quite well in this one, and they nearly made a Jynx movie after
the way the critics talked about this one, going a less techy
route, but they eventually scrubbed that project and went with the
next Bond Movie, but that's for another cache writeup.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Die Another Day was released on 20 November 2002 in both the United
States and London. The Queen and Prince Philip were guests of honor
at the world premiere, which was the second to be attended by the
Queen after You Only Live Twice. The Royal Albert Hall had a
make-over for the screening and had been transformed into an ice
palace. Proceeds from the premiere, about £500,000, were donated to
the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund of which the Queen is
patron. On the first day, ticket sales reached £1.2 million. Die
Another Day was the highest grossing James Bond film until the
release of Casino Royale. It earned $432 million worldwide,
becoming the sixth highest grossing film of 2002.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Nineteenth spy film in the James Bond film series, and the third to
star Pierce Brosnan as Mr. Bond.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I really liked the opening in this one, the rest was decent but not
my favorite. Robert Carlyle was another good villain, he played the
role great.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The World Is Not Enough premiered on 19 November 1999 in the USA
and on 26 November 1999 in the UK. At that time MGM signed a
marketing partnership with MTV, primarily for American youths, who
were assumed to have considered Bond as &quot;an old-fashioned secret
service agent&quot;. As a result MTV broadcast more than 100 hours of
Bond-related programes immediately after the film was released,
most being presented by Denise Richards.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The film grossed $361 million worldwide, with $126 million in the
United States alone, becoming the highest grossing James Bond film
of all time until the release of Die Another Day. The opening
weekend collections in USA were $35.5 million.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This was the 18th movie in the franchise, second to have Pierce
Brosnan playing Bond.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Jonathan Pryce made a great Bond villian on a more modern playing
ground, the pen is mightier than the sword, but that sea drill is
much more mighty.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As had been the case previously, with no Ian Fleming novels
remaining unadapted, an entirely original story was required. The
scriptwriting process was finished very late and after lengthy
disputes. Spottiswoode said that MGM had a script in January 1997
revolving round Hong Kong being returned to the Chinese, which
happened in July; this couldn't be used for a film opening at the
end of the year, so they had to start &quot;almost from scratch at
T-minus zero!&quot; Wilson said &quot;we didn't have a script that was ready
to shoot on the first day of filming&quot;, with Pierce Brosnan saying
&quot;we had a script that was not functioning in certain areas.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The film had a World Charity Premiere at The Odeon Leicester
Square, on 9 December 1997; this was followed by an after premiere
party at Bedford Square, home of original Ian Fleming publisher,
Jonathan Cape. The film went on general release in the UK and
Iceland on 12 December, and in most other countries during the
following week. It opened at #2 in the US, with a weekend gross of
$25,143,007 from 2,807 theaters, for an average of $8,957 per
theater. It ended up achieving a worldwide gross of over $330
million, although it did not surpass its predecessor GoldenEye,
which grossed almost $ 20 million more.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Seventh film in the James Bond series, and the first to star Pierce
Brosnan as the MI6 agent James Bond.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Personally I quite enjoyed this movie, as is evident in my favorite
movie series not far from here where this one is listed as my
favorite in 95.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Unlike previous Bond films, is the first film to not take any story
elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming. The story was
conceived and written by Michael France, with later collaboration
by other writers. In the film, Bond fights to prevent an arms
syndicate from using the GoldenEye satellite weapon against London
in order to cause a global financial meltdown.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
GoldenEye was released in 1995 after legal disputes forced a
six-year hiatus in the series, during which Timothy Dalton resigned
from the role of James Bond and was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. M
was also recast, with actress Judi Dench becoming the first woman
to portray the character, replacing Robert Brown. GoldenEye was the
first Bond film made after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and
the end of the Cold War, which provided a background for the
plot.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The film accumulated a worldwide gross of US$350.7 million,
considerably better than Dalton's films, without taking inflation
into account. Some critics viewed the film as a modernization of
the series, and felt Brosnan was a definite improvement over his
predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The name &quot;Goldeneye&quot; pays homage to James Bond's creator, Ian
Fleming. While working for British Naval Intelligence as a
Lieutenant Commander, Ian Fleming liased with the American OSS to
monitor developments in Spain after the Spanish Civil War. The
operation was codenamed Operation Goldeneye. Fleming's estate in
Oracabessa, Jamaica is also known as Goldeneye.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
GoldenEye was edited in order to be guaranteed a PG-13 rating from
the MPAA and a 12 rating from the BBFC. The cuts included the
visible bullet impact to Trevelyan's head when he is shot in the
prologue, several additional deaths during the sequence in which
Onatopp guns down the workers at the Severnaya station, more
explicit footage and violent behaviour in the Admiral's death,
extra footage of Onatopp's death, and Bond giving her a rabbit
punch in the car. In 2006, the film was remastered and re-edited
for the James Bond Ultimate Edition DVD in which the BBFC cuts were
restored, causing the rating to be changed to 15. However, the
original MPAA edits still remain.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is across from a shooting range so the shots you may
hear while at the cache, its not a Bond villain after you (Most
likely)
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Sixteenth official entry in the James Bond series, and the first
one not to use an Ian Fleming novel's title as its title. While
enjoying a generally positive critical reception, it was the first
James Bond film to be given a PG-13 rating in the United States and
also the first to gain a 15 rating in the United Kingdom, being
noted as significantly darker and more violent than its
predecessors. Due to these issues, as well as marketing problems
including a last minute title change, Licence to Kill had poor US
box office returns, making just USD$34,667,015, barely more than
its estimated USD$32,000,000 budget, though it performed well
overseas.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This was Timothy Dalton's second and final performance in his brief
tenure in the lead role. Legal wrangling over control of the series
and James Bond character resulted in a six year long delay in
production of the next Bond film which resulted in Dalton deciding
to not pursue a return. It is also the final Bond film for actors
Robert Brown (as M) and Caroline Bliss (as Moneypenny),
screenwriter Richard Maibaum, title designer Maurice Binder,
cinematographer Alec Mills, producer Albert R. Broccoli (he would
later act as a consulting producer for GoldenEye before his death)
and director John Glen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This one had a good cast and a good story line in my opinion, but
they did things that were pretty far fetched, like putting a semi
on it's side driving down the road to miss a rocket, carrying the
airplane with a helicopter.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Bond number fifteen and first one with Timothy Dalton to play James
Bond.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dalton had been considered for the role of James Bond four times.
In 1968, he was asked to play Bond in On Her Majesty's Secret
Service (1969) after Sean Connery decided that You Only Live Twice
(1967) would be his last Bond film. Dalton turned the offer down,
feeling he was too young for the role; it finally went to George
Lazenby. During the late-1970s, he was approached again, but he did
not favour the direction the movies were taking. As he explained,
his idea of Bond was different. In a 1979 episode of the television
series Charlie's Angels, Dalton played the role of Damien Roth, a
millionaire playboy described by David Doyle's character as &quot;almost
James Bond-ian&quot;, either an amusing coincidence, or a specific
in-joke, since it was around that time that Dalton was also asked
to star in For Your Eyes Only (1981)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In 1986, Dalton was the first choice to replace the retiring Roger
Moore, but obligations to the film Brenda Starr and the stage
productions of Antony and Cleopatra and The Taming of The Shrew
kept him from accepting the role. Sam Neill was then screen-tested
for the part of Bond, but was ultimately rejected by Albert R.
Broccoli. Pierce Brosnan was then approached for the role, but was
forced by NBC to turn it down (after initially accepting it)
because of his contractual commitments to the television series
Remington Steele. By this time, when Dalton completed the filming
of Brenda Starr, he was now available to assume the role as James
Bond.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The film reunites Bond with British car maker Aston Martin.
Following Bond's use of the Aston Martin DBS in On Her Majesty's
Secret Service, the filmmakers then turned to the brand new Lotus
Esprit in 1977s The Spy Who Loved Me, which reappeared four years
later in For Your Eyes Only. Despite the iconic status of the
submersible Lotus however, Bond's Aston Martin DB5 is recognized as
the most famous of his vehicles. As a consequence, Aston Martin
returned with their V8 Vantage.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Prince and Princess of Wales attended the film's premiere on 27
June 1987 at the Odeon Leicester Square Cinema in London. The
Living Daylights grossed the equivalent of $US191.2 million
worldwide. In the United States it earned $US51,185,000., including
an opening weekend of $US11,051,284, surpassing the $US5 million
grossed by The Lost Boys that was released on the same day.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Bond fourteen and the seventh and last to have Roger Moore as
Bond.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Although the title is adapted from Ian Fleming's short story &quot;From
a View to a Kill&quot;, the film is the third Bond film after The Spy
Who Loved Me and Octopussy to have an entirely original screenplay.
In A View to a Kill, Bond is pitted against Max Zorin, who plans to
destroy California's Silicon Valley.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This was the last Bond movie to feature Lois Maxwell as Miss
Moneypenny. Despite being a commercial success and earning a Golden
Globe nomination for Best Song, A View to a Kill was poorly
received by critics and was also disliked by Roger Moore himself
due to his age. Christopher Walken, however, was praised for
portraying a &quot;classic Bond villain&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A View to a Kill was the first Bond film with a premiere outside
the UK, opening on 22 May 1985 at San Francisco’s Palace of
Fine Arts. The British premiere was held on 12 June 1985 at the
Odeon Leicester Square Cinema in London. The film was first
broadcast on British television on 31 January 1990. It achieved a
box office collection of US $152.4 million worldwide with 50.3
million in the United States alone. On its opening weekend in the
US it earned $10.6 million..</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Lucky number 13 in the series and number 6 with Roger Moore.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The film's title is taken from Ian Fleming's 1966 short story
Octopussy. However, the film's story is original though the film
includes a portion inspired by the Fleming short story The Property
of a Lady.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Octopussy's premiere took place at the Odeon Leicester Square on 6
June 1983 in the company of Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of
Wales. Within five months of its premiere, it was released in 16
countries worldwide. The film earned slightly less than For Your
Eyes Only, but still grossing $187,500,000, with $67.8 million in
the United States alone. It also performed slightly better than
Never Say Never Again, the non-EON Bond remake of Thunderball which
came out a few months later.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Twelfth film in the series and fifth with Roger Moore.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The screenplay takes its characters from and combines the plots of
two short stories from Ian Fleming's collection For Your Eyes Only;
the title story and &quot;Risico&quot;. It also includes elements inspired by
the novels Live and Let Die (the keelhauling sequence), Goldfinger
(the identigraph sequence) and On Her Majesty's Secret Service (the
opening at the graveyard).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The film was released on 24 June 1981; despite its mixed critical
reception, the film was a monetary success, generating $195.3
million worldwide, which helped save United Artists from bankruptcy
after their 1980 box-office disaster Heaven's Gate by Michael
Cimino. For Your Eyes Only was the last James Bond movie to be
distributed solely by United Artists; they merged with MGM soon
after and began focusing on blockbusters rather than personal
films.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Series is meant to be hit from north to south, all but the
first cache are on the correct side of the road for this.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Eleventh film and fourth to star Roger Moore&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Moonraker was intended by its creator Ian Fleming to be turned into
a film even before he completed the novel in 1954, since he based
the novel on a manuscript he had written even earlier than this.
The producers of the James Bond film series had originally intended
to do Moonraker in 1973 with Roger Moore making his debut as Bond,
but the making of this movie was put on hold and it was finally
released in 1979, coinciding with the rise of the science fiction
genre in the wake of the Star Wars phenomenon.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Moonraker was the highest grossing film of the series until the
Pierce Brosnan Bond film GoldenEye (1995). Moonraker earned a total
of $210,300,000 worldwide — surpassing the preceding Bond
movie The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). Moonraker was also noted for its
high production cost for a Bond film, spending almost twice as much
money as The Spy Who Loved Me.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is the Tenth movie in the Bond Series and 3rd with Roger
Moore.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I always loved the character of Jaws, though not sure why, and I
wish I had his car from this one, just cause I could drive it into
the water, that'd be swell.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Spy Who Loved Me opened with a Royal Premiere attended by
Princess Anne at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 7 July
1977. It grossed $185.4 million worldwide, with $46 million in the
United States alone. After watching the opening scene of Bond
opening a Union Jack parachute to save himself from death, the
reaction from the audience was like that of fans at a football
game.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Ninth film and second to have Roger Moore as Bond.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I never, NEVER would have thought that was Christopher Lee as
Scaramanga until today reviewing the movie, watching it and
building the page. (Christopher Lee is best known now days as Count
Doku from Star Wars, or Soromon from The Lord of the Rings.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Man with the Golden Gun was released on December 18, 1974. Made
with an estimated budget of $7 million, the film earned a total of
$97,600,000 worldwide at the box office, with $21 million earned in
the USA, making it the sixth lowest-grossing Bond film, adjusted
for inflation.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
The Series is meant to be hit from north to south, all but the
first cache are on the correct side of the road for this.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This was number 8 in the James Bond Movie Series, and the first to
star Roger Moore as Bond. Producers wanted Sean Connery for this
movie as well but he declined. Did you know that Roger Moore is
older than Sean Connery?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The film is adapted from a novel with the same name written by Ian
Fleming&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Live and Let Die was released during the height of the
blaxploitation era, and many blaxploitation archetypes and cliché
are depicted such as afro hairstyles, derogatory racial epithets
(&quot;honky&quot;), black gangsters, and &quot;pimpmobiles&quot;. It departs from the
former plots of the James Bond films about megalomaniac
super-villains, and instead focuses on drug trafficking, depicted
primarily in blaxploitation films.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Jane Seymour played the Bond Girl in this one.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
From a budget estimated to be around $7 million, the film grossed
$126.4 million worldwide including $35.4 million from the United
States</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
The Series is meant to be hit from north to south, all but the
first cache are on the correct side of the road for this.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The seventh spy film in the EON Productions James Bond series, and
the sixth and final official film to star Sean Connery as the
fictional MI6 agent James Bond.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The producers originally intended to have Diamonds Are Forever
re-create commercially successful aspects of Goldfinger, including
hiring its director, Guy Hamilton.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
George Lazenby portrayed James Bond in the previous Bond film, On
Her Majesty's Secret Service, but left the franchise on the
questionable advice of his agent. Producers contemplated replacing
him with John Gavin (though Batman star Adam West was also
considered).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Diamonds are Forever was released on 17 December 1971. It grossed
$43 million in the United States, and $116 million worldwide.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
The Series is meant to be hit from north to south, all but the
first cache are on the correct side of the road for this.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This was the sixth film in the James Bond Series and the only one
that starred George Lazenby as Bond.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
On Her Majesty's Secret Service was released on 18 December 1969.
It grossed $ 87,400,000 worldwide, with $22.8 million in the United
States alone. It was one of the highest-grossing films worldwide in
1969.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Personally I enjoyed this movie, reviews have always been sharply
divided, but has turned more favorable to Mr. Lazenby's
performance.

I've decided to make a nice little series of caches over a few
miles stretch of my favorite movies that came out over the course
of my life. Each year around my birthday I intend to add the latest

Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as
both victim and villian by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage,
no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now
vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone
vexation, stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and
virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently
vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is
vengence; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value
and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the
virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose,
so let me simply add that it is my very good honor to meet you and
you may call me V.&lt;br/&gt;

The Series is meant to be hit from north to south, all but the
first cache are on the correct side of the road for this.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The fifth film in the James Bond series, and the fifth to star Sean
Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Originally, this movie was Sean Connery's last time to play the
role of Bond as he was announced that he would be resigning from
the role during the Japanese location filming; however, Connery did
later return in Diamonds Are Forever and the non EON Bond film
Never Say Never Again.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The first Bond film to be released in the northern hemisphere
summertime, the film was a great success, with positive reviews and
over $111M in worldwide box office, and has been parodied most
prominently by the Austin Powers series and its scar-faced, Nehru
suit-wearing Dr. Evil</groundspeak:long_description>

2010 was a decent year for movies, I quite enjoyed the Iron Man
Sequel, The A-Team movie turned out to be very good, was pretty
happy with it. How to Train your Dragon was a pretty good movie,
and Toy Story 3 was better than I expected. Some will say Inception
was the best and you may be correct, I haven't seen it yet :P
However RED Took the prize this year, with a great cast and an
interesting and more unique story, I quite enjoyed it, and highly
recommend others take the time to see it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to post in your log your thoughts on the movie I list,
and maybe your favorite from that year.&lt;br/&gt;

Batman begins relaunched the Batman franchise into a much better
series thus far, I really liked this movie, 2005 was a great year
for movies. I've always enjoyed Batman, the ones with Micheal
Keaton were pretty good, I didn't like Val Kilmer or Clooney as
batman though, when they did the movies they were way too cartoony.
However the new series is great.&lt;br/&gt;

The Series is meant to be hit from north to south, all but the
first cache are on the correct side of the road for this.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Fourth in the Bond Movie world continuing with Sean Connery playing
James Bond.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The film was a success, earning a total of $141.2 million
worldwide, exceeding the earnings of the three previous Bond films
and breaking box office records on the first weekend of opening in
France and Italy. Thunderball is, to date, the most financially
successful movie of the series, and, adjusting for inflation, made
the equivalent of $966.4 million in 2008 currency.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you have time read the stuff about the making of this movie,
it's an interesting story, and you should see what those stunt guys
did with sharks etc... in the water, crazy people nearly killed
themselves...&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In 1983, Warner Brothers released a second film adaptation of the
novel under the title Never Say Never Again.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
The Series is meant to be hit from north to south, all but the
first cache are on the correct side of the road for this.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The film was the first official Bond blockbuster that made
cinematic history by recouping its production costs in
record-setting time, despite a budget equal to that of the two
preceding films combined. Many consider it to be the greatest and
most iconic film in the series. Goldfinger was also the first Bond
film to use a pop star to sing the theme song during the titles, a
hallmark that would follow for every Bond film except On Her
Majesty's Secret Service.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Goldfinger was originally released on 17 September 1964, in the
United Kingdom, and on 21 December 1964, in the United States. To
promote the film, the two Aston Martin DB5s were showcased at the
1964 New York World's Fair, and it was dubbed &quot;the most famous car
in the world&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The film was both a critical and financial success. The film's $3
million budget was recouped in two weeks, and it broke box office
records in multiple countries around the world.[5] Goldfinger went
on to be included in the Guinness Book of World Records as the
fastest grossing film of all time. The film grossed a total of
$51,081,062 in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is one of my personal favorites in the Bond Franchise, not #1
however.</groundspeak:long_description>

There were quite a few great movies in 1994 but I really love
Stargate. It's probably not because the movie was that great, but I
loved the series after the movie. Stargate SG-1 was great, and I
quite enjoyed Atlanits, and the new Stargate Universe is great as
well, though quite different.&lt;br/&gt;

Though he's not my favorite Bond, was a good movie. Not near as

alot of good movies that year.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The Series is meant to be hit from north to south, all but the
first cache are on the correct side of the road for this.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Based on the 1957 Novel of the same name this was the second Bond
movie, still with Sean Connery as James Bond.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
From Russia with Love is widely considered to be the best of the
bond movies, I don't consider it the best, but it was a good
overall movie.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Did you know President John F. Kennedy had named Fleming's novel
From Russia with Love among his ten favorite books of all time in
Life magazine, producers Broccoli and Saltzman chose this as the
follow-up to the cinematic debut of Dr. No. From Russia with Love
was the last film President Kennedy saw at the White House on 20
November 1963 before going to Dallas.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The budget for the film was $2 million; double that of Dr. No. At
the box office, it grossed $24 million in North America, and $54
million internationally for a total of $78 million worldwide.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">James Bond Series: Dr No (1962)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Series is meant to be hit from north to south, all but the
first cache are on the correct side of the road for this.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The first Bond movie. Not the first Bond story however, that would
be Casino Royale. This was the sixth novel written by writer Ian
Fleming.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Sean Connery was the first actor to play James Bond on the big
screen, and did a great job. Some things in the movie were changed
from in the novel, for instance:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bond's fight with a giant squid is excluded from the film&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the novel, No's hands were cut off by Tong hit men; in the
film his hands were destroyed by radiation, and his island fortress
is nuclear-powered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honey Rider is never seen nude; when Bond first sees her she is
wearing a bikini. In the book she is pegged out to be eaten by
beach crabs; in the film, she is tied to drown in a water pool (the
film makers did originally plan to film this scene. But when the
crabs arrived at the studio they were dead.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The film had a budget of US$1,000,000, and grossed a total of
$16,067,035 in U.S. domestic box office and $59,600,000 worldwide,
making it a financial success. The results place it as the lowest
grossing film in the Bond series.</groundspeak:long_description>

All these caches will be easy little micro's that shouldn't present much trouble.

I was born November 14th, 1985. Looking through the list of movies that came out in 1985 my favorite has to be Back to the Future.  The only other one that came close was National Lampoons European Vacation.

I've decided to make a nice little series of caches over a few
miles stretch of my favorite movies that came out over the course
of my life. Each year around my birthday I intend to add the latest
to the list.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
All these caches will be easy little micro's that shouldn't present
much trouble.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In 1988 I had a hard time. The Dead Pool is a great movie, but so
is Die Hard, was a very hard choice but I re-watched them both and
barely finally decided The Dead Pool wins.&lt;br/&gt;

Total Recall. I'm a SciFi geek and yes this one took it to the
limit on cheesy dumb stuff I still loved it. There were many others
this year I enjoyed and probably others that are my actual
favorites, but this is the one that sticks out as of now.&lt;br/&gt;
