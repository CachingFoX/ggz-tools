military caches. Bring your running shoes or a bicycle, you might
want them, but not needed to find the cache. There is a marina and
several boat launches nearby as well!

&lt;p&gt;Wanted to place this one near the coast, but the choices were
limited by private property and British Petroleum. I couldn't even
get onto the Coast Guard base with ID, because of them. Thanks
guys, love ya!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I dedicate this, my final physical cache in Mississippi, to all
the fine men and women geocacher's on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. I
will not get to say farewell to many of you before I leave. But,
let it be known I will miss you all greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for making my last year in Biloxi memorable and
enjoyable. For this you deserve a &quot;Salute&quot; and a &quot;High
Five-Five.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Can you solve the Leprechaun's Limericks?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son and I went outside to play. It was a fine day for a geocache, I thought. We fought another Leftygator hide. We cruised by a previously found Biloxi Bay cache. Paddling for our dear life, we headed out to grab another Mitrustme cache. Starting our trek down the sound, the beach began to get longer and longer it seemed. Don't worry AFwingman, I left you enough beach to plant one more cache on this island. I dedicate the lower mile and a half to you. My eyes maybe started to play tricks on me. We passed shipwrecked boats galore. When finally, I saw a sight I almost didn't believe. Perched upon one of the dunes, a wee man danced wearing the garb of a merry green. He had a little orange beard snug around his face and nestled in the center was a pipe of Irish clay. When he saw us, he leaped a spry and yelled out, &quot;Fiddely diddely dee, catch and riddle me! Quick, or I'll be gone! Fiddely diddly dee, catch and riddle me! I'm a leprechaun!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quickly, he ran away, and was gone in seconds. I had heard stories of leprechauns when I was but a child. I had never considered it to be true, that was, until I saw the little man. My heart was a flutter and I raced after him. Over log, around a tree, stumble on the rock, dodge the thorn brush... farther along we raced. They say that if you catch a leprechaun, he'd grant you a wish, just to avoid giving you his gold. But, first you'd have to catch him, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the leprechauns seemed to disappear whenever they are seen. They are masters of magic and tricksters beyond belief. You should approach them carefully. When I came onto a clearing, I saw that leprechaun, and I was determined to catch him. It was late, and it was getting dark outside. He was singing and dancing. When he saw me, he laughed and said, &quot;Fiddely diddely dee, catch and riddle me! Quick, or I'll be gone! Fiddely diddly dee, catch and riddle me! I'm a leprechaun!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I waited behind some trees for many hours. The leprechaun returned to the clearing. He lit a little campfire. He danced and sang his songs for a long time, until he finally fell asleep. When he was asleep, I slowly approached him. I went as close as I could, and then I threw myself against him. I caught him in my hands, and he woke up with a surprised look upon his little face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fiddely diddely dee, catch and riddle me! Quick, or I'll be gone! Fiddely diddly dee, catch and riddle me! I'm a leprechaun!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Riddles&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;**************************&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dozen a gross and a score,
Plus 3 times the square root of four,
Divided by seven,
Plus five times eleven,
Equals nine square and not a bit more.

(DIGITS AB)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a young lady of Lee,
Whose age had its last digit three.
If you total the two,
Which is easy to do,
One less than a square you will see.

(DIGITS CD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My age?&quot;, answered Barbara Blatt,
&quot;just keep it right under your hat.
Adding one to each figure,
Makes it nineteen years bigger,
Than half what it is. So what's that?&quot;

(DIGITS EF)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an old lady in Sheen,
Whose grandchildren numbered sixteen.
Four-ninths of the boys,
Were too old to want toys,
So how many girls must that mean?

(DIGIT G)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a fair maid in Rabat,
Who was plump, not excessively fat.
The square of her weight,
When divided by eight,
All in pounds was a cube. How was that?

(DIGITS HIJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said a feller out felling a tree
&quot;My age I've divided by three.
The result is a square,
Yet my age, I declare,
Is six times a cube, Glory be!&quot;

(DIGITS KL)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There once was a cube 'twas found 
Whose two digits, when switched clear around,
         Was the product (quite fair)
            Of a cube and a square,
   And its name will most surely astound.

(DIGITS MN)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Final Resting Spot of the Leprechaun’s Magical Treasure is:&lt;/h4&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The cache is not located at the posted coordinates, but the leprechaun will point the way once you have caught and riddled him.You will need a boat, water shoes, plenty of water, rations, sunscreen, bug spray, and a cell phone wouldn't hurt either to do this cache.Depending on how you approach this cache, it can be a 1 hour or 5 hour excursion.Regardless of your method, you will experience deep water, potentially deep mud or marshy areas, tall foliage, bugs, sand, and heat.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

nonvenomous and others are not so nice to play with. Check the
associated website to brush up on your native snakes. Then go out
to the parks and woods of Mississippi and enjoy yourself&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cache you are looking for is bison tube sized. It is located
near a little fishing spot in Shepard State Park. The park asks a
meager $3.00 admission fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are boat launches, barbecue grills, picnic tables, and a
small playground for you to enjoy. The location I chose is far back
so you should not be bothered by anyone. It is an easy walk across
the usual grass and leafy terrain. You will not have to go trail
hiking to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to AFWingman for the FTF!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by R. Causer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Naviguessers for FTF&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most dangerous moment in any story is at the beginning. From
the first moment, every ending is equally possible, every path
untraveled, every question not only unanswered, but unasked. The
unread story is infinite in possibility. Yet the ending is already
written, and though you are clever, there is no outwitting it. Are
you brave enough to begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, move onto waypoint 1. If not, remain safe, turn away from
this GeoQuest. No one will think any less of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 1 – The Clearing N 30° 23.983’ W 088°
47.690’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You find yourself standing in the middle of a partially cleared
grove. It teems with all the birds of the air, and all of the
creatures of the Earth, and every good thing that grows. As you
explore, you feel an incredible sense of peace and rightness, as if
the clearing had been created just for you. This is the place you
belong. Still, you feel restless like someone is calling to you
from the distance. You begin to explore your surroundings. At the
western edge of the clearing, there is a path which you stand near
now. Do you follow the path?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If yes, continue to Waypoint 2. If no, continue to Waypoint
3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 2 - Ranger Office N 30° 23.869 W 088° 47.737&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathways are meant to be followed, and you would never truly be
content if you did not know what lay at the end. You come up to
what appears to be a Park Ranger office. The door is locked. You
begin to pace back and forth wondering what you should do. You look
to the east and you see the path fading into the dark forest. You
hesitate for a moment and look back. The forest stretches behind
you as if the clearing had never been. You rub your eyes and face
back to the ranger station, but all you see is a small man with
pigeon toes standing before you. He is kind of comical looking. He
is wearing a peaked red hat, a pair of blue pants, and birch shoes.
Around his waist is a belt with a tool kit attached. It holds a
knife, a hammer, etc. He proudly beams at you with his rosy red
cheeks puffing out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Welcome Ranger,” he calls out, temporarily
forgetting himself. He beckons you to lean closer to him. You lean
down to the tiny man and he begins to whisper in your ear. He tells
you of a bayou king who seeks to poison the woods and create
something called a shopping mall. He tells you that you have been
chosen to amass the denizens of the woods into a powerful army and
stop this menace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you listen to the jabbering fool, the shadows deepen. An owl
calls. Something cries out in the distance and is quickly silenced
in mid-shrill. The man has disappeared from sight as if he were
never there. You crave sleep; a brief rest to clear your mind. Do
you close your eyes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If yes, continue to waypoint 3. If not, continue to waypoint
4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 3 – Alternate Route N 29° 57.367’ W 90°
04.150’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You close your eyes, and drift into sleep. When you awaken, you
are feeling greatly refreshed. You push aside the overstuffed
comforter and prepare to head down to the continental breakfast
bar. The previous events were a dream. You spend your life trying
to return to the clearing with the winding path in the dark forest.
You never will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STOP, go back to Waypoint 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 4 - The Gateway N 30° 23.875’ W 088°
47.586’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You scrub your hands across your eyes and push yourself back to
your feet. You brush the dust from your clothing. Things are really
weird right now and where did these Sherwood Forest clothes come
from? You sigh and begin to follow the path that takes you on a
short, downhill curve, and winds around to a crossroads. A signpost
stands before you and in a vision you see the land stretch out
before you. It is as though you have seen all the trails of the
forest before. You make mental note of your intended paths and
continue on your journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) Record the number of trails______&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to waypoint 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 5 – Feathered Fishers N 30° 23.713’ W 088°
47.A04’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You begin to follow what you think is the correct direction.
Soon, you begin to feel lost. You grow chilled, and your feet
develop a talent for finding uneven spots on the ground, tree
roots, and rocks. After the third time you fall, you lean against
the very tree whose roots last tangled your feet. The bark prickles
and rubs against your back, but it is a welcome distraction from
your bruised knees and skinned palms. Your bones are weary and your
muscles ache. The voice of the little man returns to your head.
“Ranger there is strong magic in these woods. Do not ignore
your geosenses. The mark you seek is the number of trails plus one,
so to speak.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you arrive, you must rally together the creatures you meet.
Their numbers will be important in the fight against the Bayou
King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B) Record the number of different animals who join your army
_____&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to Waypoint 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 6 N 30° 23.732’ W 088° 47.513’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You follow the birds back to the main path in the forest.
Despite their advantage, your fleet feet keep up with them. When
you arrive at your next destination, the birds circle in the air.
They fear the gators of the bayou. The gators are languishing in
the sun. You chastise them. “Gators of the bayou, don’t
you know the bane of the Bayou King affects you too!” Calmly
they reply, “Settle your tongue, Ranger. We do not ignore the
impending threat, but instead prepare for battle. We recharge the
magical energies of our armor in the sun for the upcoming epic
battle.” Humbly, you apologize and accept the solar
collecting armor they offer you. They also ask that you take some
to their brothers deeper in the forest. You bid them god speed on
their arrival to the final battle. As you begin your way to the
next rallying point, you turn the armor over in your hand and feel
its smooth, strong texture. Purely out of habit, you count the
letters in the name of the armor and tuck it away in your
rucksack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C) Record the number of letters in the name of the solar
collectors _____&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to Waypoint 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 7 – Salt Marsh Nursery N 30° 23.8C9’ W
088° 47.73B’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you begin to approach the next village, you see the battle
has already begun. The denizens of the forest are in a heated
battle and cannot return to their fortifications. You will need to
use the solar collectors (C) and the combined strength of the
Feathered Fishers (B) to repel the Bayou King’s forces into
retreat. The tiny animals assure you they are small, but pack a
mean punch. Your numbers continue to grow stronger and you begin to
feel more confident about the upcoming battle against the Bayou
King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D) Record the number of new recruits to your army _____&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to Waypoint 8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 8 – Life in a Gator Pond N 30° 23.876’ W
088° 47.406’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group of warriors is easy to find as they quickly swim
across the pond to you. You see many are already decked out in
their battle gear. You nod in approval and welcome the new recruits
and cross back onto the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E) Record the number of new recruits to your army _____&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to waypoint 9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 9 – Bustling with Life N 30° 23.844’ W
088° 47.40D’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you come up on this busy little village, a busy little possum
scampers up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia says, “Hail Ranger, checking in with the morning
report…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprised by the display, you stammer, “Shoot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well the buzz from the bees is that the leopards are in a
bit of a spot. And the baboons are going ape over this. Of course,
the giraffes are acting like they're above it all... The tick birds
are pecking on the elephants. I told the elephants to forget it,
but they can't. The cheetahs are hard up, but I always say,
cheetahs never prosper...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this possum has been watching too much television.
You cut him off with a wave of the hand and ask the animals of the
village to join in your cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F) Record the number of new recruits to your army _____&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to Waypoint 10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 10 – Absorbing the Punch N 30° 23.82C’ W
088° 4F.428’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The air is crisp here. You feel refreshed by the smell. The moon
paints the trees in a silver glow and lights your path. You hear
music coming from just ahead. It is so beautiful, you wonder if you
are dreaming once again. The pound of the drum speeds the pulse of
your heart and the skirl of the bagpipes pulls your feet through
the night. As you race forward, you recognize the lugubrious and
harsh sound of the carnyx. A battle rages on ahead. By the time you
reach the standing stones, you are nearly dancing down the path to
the beat of the magical instruments. Inside the ring of stones, the
dancers spin and leap, a bright chaos of form and shape, carried
along by an exultation of song. But, a closer look shows the mighty
woodland elves engaged in mortal combat with the evil forces of the
Bayou King. As it seems the battle is won for the elves, a great
eye opens in the sky above. The Bayou King has been scrying from a
distance. A fury of wind and rain come forth from the nothingness.
You climb the ladder of a nearby guard tower to assess the
situation better. Grasping the support beams strongly, you look up
to see a thunderous bolt of force approaching you. You have no time
to react. The tower is splintered and thrown from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G) If you were standing on the observation tower, the distance
you were thrown is _____ feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retreat quickly to Waypoint 11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 11 – Elvin Command Post N 30° 23.F81’ W
088° 47.3C2’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly, you race down the trail looking for a place to recover.
The Bayou King, obviously, is much more dangerous than you may have
thought. You start to second guess your abilities. Why did you ever
listen to that silly little man? You have this weird feeling that
you should be off somewhere enjoying a nice bratwurst. You shake
the cobwebs from your head and you come up to what appears to be a
command post of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you can make any further assessment, you hear a voice
shout out “Halt! State the code!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baffled, you look around and yell out the number from the sign
marker. You realize that couldn’t possibly be the pass code
to an Elvin Command Post and expect your last visions on earth to
be a thunderstorm of Elvin fletching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guard calmly calls out, “Approach and state your
business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, elves are not as intelligent as the Lord of the Rings
movies would have you believe. After the initial pleasantries, the
elf tells you the stock of rations on the lines are growing thin.
He asks you to journey forward to see what is holding up the supply
train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H) Record the pass code here ________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to Waypoint 12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 12 – Treant of Many Names N 30° 23.84H’ W
088° 4F.312’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you journey forth searching for the supply caravan, you hear
a sound that is almost mumbling intermixed with the rustling of
leaves. You dismiss it as just the wind passing through the
branches of the strange tree to your right. As you continue on, you
are stopped in your tracks, literally. One of the large vines of
the tree reaches out and wraps itself around your arm. You begin to
shriek, but quickly calm yourself so as not to embarrass yourself
in front of anyone who may be nearby. You look back at the tree and
realize the mumbling was the tree trying to say something to
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Lbhat enatre, qb abg srne zr! V nz na nyyl va gur onggyr

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having resolved the situation, you are glad you stopped. But,
onward you must continue to find the missing supply train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I) Enter the key that binds here ____&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to Waypoint 13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 13 – Restocking the Pantries N 30° 23.C21’
W 088° 4F.2B0’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After emerging from the forest into another clearing, you see a
couple animals here arguing around many boxes of cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stop, animals of the bayou! Why do you argue? We have a
battle to wage, don’t you know!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Aye, ranger. But the tides are fluctuating by the
moment,” says the Herons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Egrets chime in, “Yes and we can’t all harvest
at the same time and our timing is out of wack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You ponder this for a moment, then the Fiddler Crab pipes up,
“I could care less about their problems. All I want is for
them to stop trying to eat me while I am harvesting the
crops!” Realizing that there is no easy answer to their
problem, you ask them to set their differences aside and help the
crab harvest and carry the vegetation to where it is needed. Once
the Bayou King has been defeated, normalcy will return to the
bayou. The birds nod in agreement and the crab wipes the sweat from
his brow with his oversized claw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to Waypoint 14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 14 – Hide and Seek N 30° 23.E2F’ W 088°
47.483’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you venture across the forest, you can almost see the eerie
glow rising from the Halls of the Bayou King in the distance. You
continue down the trail and you feel as though thousands of eyes
are set upon you. You crouch down and ready an arrow in your bow.
Peering from left to right, you begin to see entire platoons of
animals fortified among the foliage and rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You relax your draw on your bow and call out to the animals,
“It is only I, the Ranger. Rally to me troops and we will
march forward to victory!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J) Record the number of new recruits to your army _____&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to Waypoint 15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 15 – Life of a Salt Marsh N 30° 23.D3B’ W
088° 47.4F8’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now stand on the edge of what might be your last stand. You
and the Armies of the Salt Marsh stand assembled on the docks,
ready to charge. All of the animals you have met along your journey
and several more have joined the cause. Some look a little more
afraid than others, but you know all are fearful of the upcoming
battle. You realize you must rally them to the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sons of the forest, I am the Ranger!” you boast
proudly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A young otter whimpers, “The Ranger is 7 feet
tall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You reply, “Yes, I've heard. Eats burgers by the hundreds,
and if he were here he'd consume the mall bringers with fireballs
from his eyes and bolts of lightning from his fingertips. I AM the
Ranger. And I see a whole army of warriors here in defiance of
corporate tyranny. You have come to fight as free beasts, and free
animals you are. What would you do without freedom? Will you
fight?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animals look warily at each other and a snail questions
back, “Fight? Fight against the Bayou King and the mall
bringers? No, we cannot win. We will run and we will
live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You counter, “Aye, fight and you may die. Run and you'll
live -- at least a while. And dying in your nests and burrows many
years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from
this day to that for one chance, just one chance to come back here
and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll
never take our freedom!!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animals stand in silence and think. Then one calls out
“Trbpnpuvat sberire!” The others pick up the call and
the chant becomes fever pitched, “Trbpnpuvat sberire!
Trbpnpuvat sberire! Trbpnpuvat sberire!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to the Final Waypoint&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final –Storm the Halls of the Bayou King N G°
23.DI’ W 088° 4F.4AJ’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You thrust open the doors with your army at your back. The haze
of fury clouds your vision as you enter the dark, dank halls. You
thrust your bow gripped tightly by your bloodied fist into the air
and let loose a battle-cry. As you turn to march down the corridors
looking for the final confrontation, you notice a kindly old woman
staring at you in admiration and amazement. The Bayou King has
retreated from his fortress and the magic has left the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are victorious today, but you have a feeling this is not the
last you will see of the Bayou King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You wipe the sweat from your brow and ask the lady where you can
find the local bard. She looks at you in amusement and you think
maybe she doesn’t understand you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where can I record my visit and exploits in this glorious
bayou,” you briskly rephrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She gestures to her right, a log book sprawled out waiting for
you. You record your name amongst the log of heroes for the
generations to come to speak of in awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, great hero.

&lt;p&gt;Clayjar gave it a a 3 terrain rating because of heavy
overgrowth. I left it that way, because the sign I passed on the
way to the site said there may be &quot;snakes&quot; and &quot;alligators&quot; nearby.
Honestly though... is there many places in the southeast that don't
have this present?&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

39530&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container you seek is a short walk, in visual distance, of
this historic site.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though the Old Brick House, located in Biloxi, Mississippi
was damaged during hurricane Katrina, it is still standing and
people are allowed to visit it during the week. The house, which
was saved from destruction by the Ladies' Garden Club of Biloxi,
serves as a reminder of the way people lived in Biloxi during the
later 1700's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house is used as a museum and as a community center for a
variety of activities. While the house may have been damaged by
fierce winds and water, its structure is sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When visiting Biloxi, you may find many buildings and other
attractions still recovering from the hurricane. Because the Old
Brick House is only a few feet from Back Bay, it was not shielded
by much during the storms. When visiting the Old Brick House, you
will be able to see first hand how well the structure was
constructed. If you want to learn more about the building and the
time in which it was built, you should visit the museum to view
pictures, documents, and talk with the staff that is very
knowledgeable about the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those visiting Biloxi, you will be able to see many old
buildings and structures that are now used as museums and other
functions. These buildings are being preserved by town as a way to
tell others the story of Biloxi. Take advantage of these small
museums as you will learn much about the area, the people, and who
they say &quot;saw the future.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

It is always good to come back home and this cache is very near the house I lived in when I went to high school and is in the town where I was raised. Both of my parents are in the nearby cemetary along with my grandparents on my mother's side. If you would like to visit their final resting place they are at N30 25.083 W088 33.970. I spent many hours on the Pascagoula river which you can see from the cache location. My father and I were avid hunters and fishermen. I hope you will take some time to reflect on your roots when you visit the cache and sign the log.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
A Norwegian Tale
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Once upon a time there were three billy goats, who were to go up to
the hillside to make themselves fat, and the name of all three was
&quot;Gruff.&quot;
&lt;p&gt;On the way up was a bridge over a cascading stream they had to
cross; and under the bridge lived a great ugly troll , with eyes as
big as saucers, and a nose as long as a poker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first of all came the youngest Billy Goat Gruff to cross the
bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Trip, trap, trip, trap! &quot; went the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who's that tripping over my bridge?&quot; roared the troll .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, it is only I, the tiniest Billy Goat Gruff , and I'm going
up to the hillside to make myself fat,&quot; said the billy goat, with
such a small voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,&quot; said the troll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, no! pray don't take me. I'm too little, that I am,&quot; said
the billy goat. &quot;Wait a bit till the second Billy Goat Gruff comes.
He's much bigger.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, be off with you,&quot; said the troll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little while after came the second Billy Goat Gruff to cross
the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap, went the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who's that tripping over my bridge?&quot; roared the troll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, it's the second Billy Goat Gruff , and I'm going up to the
hillside to make myself fat,&quot; said the billy goat, who hadn't such
a small voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now I'm coming to gobble you up,&quot; said the troll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, no! Don't take me. Wait a little till the big Billy Goat
Gruff comes. He's much bigger.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Very well! Be off with you,&quot; said the troll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just then up came the big Billy Goat Gruff .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap! went the bridge, for the
billy goat was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under
him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who's that tramping over my bridge?&quot; roared the troll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's I! The big Billy Goat Gruff ,&quot; said the billy goat, who
had an ugly hoarse voice of his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now I 'm coming to gobble you up,&quot; roared the troll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, come along! I've got two spears,&lt;br/&gt;
And I'll poke your eyeballs out at your ears;&lt;br/&gt;
I've got besides two curling-stones,&lt;br/&gt;
And I'll crush you to bits, body and bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was what the big billy goat said. And then he flew at the
troll, and poked his eyes out with his horns, and crushed him to
bits, body and bones, and tossed him out into the cascade, and
after that he went up to the hillside. There the billy goats got so
fat they were scarcely able to walk home again. And if the fat
hasn't fallen off them, why, they're still fat; and so,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snip, snap, snout.&lt;br/&gt;
This tale's told out.&lt;/p&gt;

Also do not attempt if it is wet outside due to rain. You will be hiking close to 3 miles round trip so bring plenty of water. Most of the hiking is done on the trails but you will do some bushwhacking. Part of the challenge is to determine which trail to take. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First 2 stages are decon containers located near the trail and these contain coordinates to the next stage. Please remember to snap the lids completely shut on the decon container. Last stage is an ammo can. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added note:&lt;/b&gt; If you have physical limitations then please do not attempt this cache as this cache requires hiking a significant distance and some climbing. It is meant to be a challenge.

I had been saving this one for my #300 milestone. I brought the whole iJEEP family out for this one and we were not disappointed.

I walked a little further than necessary for stage #1. The path I was on seemed to circle it without ever getting any closer, so we backtracked and found a better way in. When I got to stage #1, I wasn't so much worried about how the retrieve it as I was how to put it back. Luckily my wife had something that did the trick nicely.

We went straight to stage #2, no problem. I sent my 7-yr old after it. She could reach it, but couldn't quite retrieve it. I had to go after it. Then we stopped nearby for a bite of lunch.

I looked at the topo on my GPSr and the tracks that I had plotted for other caches I found around here and had a good idea where we were. I probably did not take the trail intended to get the cache, but it worked just fine all the same.

We got the cache and traded TBs. My girls were troopers the whole way. Thanks David for contributing to the fun of this milestone....

I took a couple of wrong turns along the way. Once because I didn't listen to my instincts and once because I did. Anyway, I got there in the end.

Lots and lots of tracks on the trail (deer, turkey, and 'coon). Saw a couple deer on one of my wrong turns. I bushwacked to their bedding area.

Later, I heard a big crashing sound that I HOPE was a dear! My dog looked a little worried too. 

SL. Dropped a GC.com geocoin.

Thanks for the adventure. (Off to grab End of the Trail)</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder who this cache made angry?!?!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ancient people of different civilizations had Gods or
Goddess and worship this phenomenon. Many of them believed that
thunder was the primary and lightning the secondary. We have come
to see it the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Greek, Zeus is the supreme ruler. He was Lord of the Sky,
the Rain-god and the Cloud-gatherer, who wielded the awful
thunder-bolt. The Greeks worshipped him because rain was an
important necessity for agriculture, but feared his random
lightning strikes.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Romans had the same god except he was called Jupiter.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Norse the god is Thor. Thor controls the sky, thunder and
lightning.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Japanese has a god whose name is Susanowo. This is a
spiteful storm god of Shinto belief. He was God of tempest. Instead
of looking after the oceans, Susanowo just hung around in heaven
and on earth, causing trouble wherever he went. He uprooted trees,
destroyed rice paddies, and knocked down buildings. Some believe he
and his powerful storms are still causing mischief on earth.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Egyptian god is Set also known as Seth. He is lord of the
desert and god of storms, confusion, and destruction.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Aztec had a god named Tlaloc. This fearsome god was the
bringer not only of beneficial rain but of storms, killing
lightning bolts, flood, and disease.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Babylonian they have Enlil. A god of the wind. Enlil acted
as Anu's enforcer, destroying mortal cities that refuses to pay
tribute and enemies with lightning, hurricanes, and
tornadoes.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;India has a god of storms and warriors. His name is
Indra.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persians god is Vayu. He is god of the winds. Vayu controls the
winds, storms and lightning.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Brule Sioux Indians god is Wakinyan Tanka. The great
Thunderbird. There are also four large, old Thunderbirds, one for
each direction - north, east, south, west. They are wrapped in
robes of dark clouds. Their symbol is the zigzag lightning, forked
at the ends. If you lie, the Wakinyan will kill you with their
lightning bolts. so the Sioux believe the thunderbirds stand for
rain, fire, and the truth.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Miwok Indians believe that whenever the fawn girls known as
Thunders, ran around in the sky they made rain and hail fall. The
sound of thunder was made from the two fawn girls running with the
dried bear skin who tried to eat them. The pieces of skin crackled
loudly to make thunder.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basilosaurus are one of the most common of the primitive whales,
called &quot;archaeocetes&quot; by paleontologists. The bones of Basilosaurus
cetoides (Owen) and other primitive whales have been found
throughout a belt across Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;


 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1981, Mississippi Senate Current Resolution No. 557
designated &quot;the prehistoric whale&quot;, both Basilosaurus cetoides
(Owen) and Zygorhiza kochii (Riechenbach), as the official fossil
of Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alabama designated Basilosaurus cetoides (Zeuglodon) as the
official state fossil in 1984. Fossil remains of this prehistoric
whale were first found in Clarke County about 1833 and later
discovered in Choctaw and Washington Counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A complete skeleton of a basilosaur (which means &quot;king of the
lizards&quot;) was found on a plantation in southwestern Alabama in 1834
which was determined after study to be a meat - eating member of
the whale family, not a lizard. For this reason it was renamed the
zeuglodon (Genus Basilosaurus). They estimated this fossil to be
over forty - five million years old (Eocene period). Zeuglodons
averaged from 55 to 75 feet long with tails up to 40 feet long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ancient whale fossils are most abundant in Alabama and
many zeuglodon skeletons have been found there (fossil remains of
Basilosaurus cetoides may not be removed from the state without
prior written approval from the governor). The two most complete
Basilosaurus cetoides skeletons ever found are from Alabama - one
is displayed at the McWane Center in Birmingham and the other in
the Smithsonian Institutute in Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache you are looking for maybe one of these
Basilosaurus!&lt;/p&gt;

From DogRiver.Org: http://www.dogriver.org

Dog River Watershed is an urban watershed that refers to 90 square miles of land that drains into Dog River. The river and its tributaries drain most of the City of Mobile, Alabama and serve as important recreational waterways and food sources.

Dog River is greatly affected by upstream waters that flow into the river from Mobile City and County, Alabama. Dog River is approximately 7 miles long, located on the northwest side of Mobile Bay. Mobile Bay, the sixth largest watershed in the nation, flows into the Gulf of Mexico.

Sixty percent of the Dog River watershed is located within the City of Mobile. Forty percent is located in Mobile County, Alabama. 

Sources of Water: Where does the water in Dog River come from?

Upstream
When it rains in the Dog River Watershed, rainfall meanders downhill into storm drains, low spots, creeks and streams, in search of the lowest spot. Every time it rains, all these sources contribute water to Dog River and its tributaries. Mobile, Alabama is often listed as the U.S. city with the greatest rainfall per year, around 64 inches.

Downstream: Mobile Bay
Dog River drains into Mobile Bay which drains into the Gulf of Mexico. Mobile Bay is tidally influenced so water enters Dog River through Mobile Bay as the tides change. Check the tides at need best site to link for tide info.</groundspeak:long_description>

ThingOne was presented this pretty ammocan at a geocaching event. She was excited to hide it. We took some hikes around a few trails in the area. We heard the water roaring around this bend from recent rains and thought it sounded like a good spot for a cache.

Use your geosense and not your destructive power to find this one. The hide has ZERO camo of its own. Please cover better than found.

ThingOne hopes you enjoy the hike.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This area needed some more caches. So I put it near the furthest point on the Chickasabogue bike trail.   It also happens to be a major bicycle drop (hence the name).  This cache can be found on foot, but you'll be walking for awhile.  So dust off the old bicycle and come check out the trail system.  You will be looking for a  Decon container.  The terrain rating is really so high just because the cache is so far away from parking.  

FTF prize is a set us unused trackable dog tags.  

Also it would be awesome if I could get some pics of people going off the drop.</groundspeak:long_description>

He's my number one suspect in the&lt;br/&gt;picnic basket disappearances. As bears go, he can be very&lt;br/&gt;annoying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;WC and&lt;br/&gt;Cricket:&lt;/b&gt;  So, we take it you have issues with bears, Mr.&lt;br/&gt;Ranger, Sir?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ranger&lt;br/&gt;Smith:&lt;/b&gt;  No, and &lt;i&gt;don't call me that!  &lt;/i&gt; I&lt;br/&gt;like bears, and for the most part, bears are good.  But Yogi&lt;br/&gt;is a real puzzle for me.   This whole conundrum isn't&lt;br/&gt;about bears, it's about &lt;i&gt;Yogi,&lt;/i&gt; and nothing&lt;br/&gt;else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;WC and&lt;br/&gt;Cricket:&lt;/b&gt;  How so, Mr. Ranger, Sir? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ranger&lt;br/&gt;Smith: &lt;/b&gt;  I really wish you wouldn't call me&lt;br/&gt;that.  It's almost as annoying as Yogi always referring to&lt;br/&gt;picnic baskets as &quot;pic-a-nic&quot; baskets.  It grates on my&lt;br/&gt;nerves.  As I said, bears are fine, but Yogi is a&lt;br/&gt;mystery.  He annoys me on purpose, hangs out with Boo-Boo, his&lt;br/&gt;partner-in-crime, and nabs unwatched picnic baskets at every&lt;br/&gt;opportunity.  I'm sure he's behind this string of&lt;br/&gt;disappearances.  As I said, I'm not puzzled by his bear-ness,&lt;br/&gt;only by his Yogi-ness.  If I could trade out the Yogi part,&lt;br/&gt;I'd keep the bear part. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;WC and&lt;br/&gt;Cricket: &lt;/b&gt; Let's see if we have this straight, okay? &lt;br/&gt;You think Yogi and Boo Boo have a criminal&lt;br/&gt;mentality?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ranger&lt;br/&gt;Smith:&lt;/b&gt; Not exactly.  We had a bear-analyst examine them a&lt;br/&gt;few years ago,  and she reported that Boo Boo had a good&lt;br/&gt;character, but was an unwitting victim of Yogi's influence. &lt;br/&gt;She pegged Yogi's problem as being selfish.  &quot;Me, me , me&quot; is&lt;br/&gt;what he's all about.  From Yogi's standpoint, it's all about&lt;br/&gt;&quot;I, I, I&quot;, of course.  Yogi would be much less of a puzzle if&lt;br/&gt;he would do away with the &quot;I&quot; aspect, and be more&lt;br/&gt;community-minded. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;WC and&lt;br/&gt;Cricket:&lt;/b&gt; Thank you so much for visiting with us.  By the&lt;br/&gt;way, would you mind validating our parking, Mr. Ranger,&lt;br/&gt;Sir?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ranger&lt;br/&gt;Smith:&lt;/b&gt; DON'T CALL ME THAT! &lt;br/&gt;ARRRGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Helpful&lt;br/&gt;Suggestions For Seeking This Cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.&lt;br/&gt;Don't try to recover it between the hours of 7AM-9AM, or&lt;br/&gt;4PM-6PM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 2.

The premise of his&lt;br/&gt;dissertation was that large, significant numbers, when compressed&lt;br/&gt;and combined into a single value, could reveal the &quot;core essence&quot;&lt;br/&gt;of the original numbers.  He tried numerous methods of finding&lt;br/&gt;the single value of a series of large, significant numbers, and he&lt;br/&gt;declared that only the &quot;Humdinger Method&quot;, as he termed this&lt;br/&gt;process, would reveal the true &quot;core essence&quot; of any series of&lt;br/&gt;significant numbers.  Humdinger had sought the same solution&lt;br/&gt;in his earlier master's thesis, in which he discounted using the&lt;br/&gt;&quot;sum of all digits&quot; method, claiming he had trouble distinguishing&lt;br/&gt;between even and odd numbers, due to being raised in a family where&lt;br/&gt;all numbers were viewed as equal. Humdinger's thesis conclusion was&lt;br/&gt;that &quot;numbers are wacky and lots of fun&quot;.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humdinger's dissertation further raised&lt;br/&gt;eyebrows in the world of mathematics when he found that all&lt;br/&gt;mathematical operators, save one, were unnecessary.  &lt;br/&gt;Humdinger's dissertation committee, chaired by Prof. Wilhelm D.&lt;br/&gt;Wotacrok, tried in vain to discredit Humdinger's doctoral treatise,&lt;br/&gt;but found they could not argue with the conclusion of Humdinger's&lt;br/&gt;work, which was &quot;Numbers are fun, they make me&lt;br/&gt;giggle.&quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humdinger's dissertation was accepted by&lt;br/&gt;the committee, but he never received his doctorate.  During&lt;br/&gt;his oral defense, Humdinger insisted all questions be asked in Pig&lt;br/&gt;Latin.  The committee complied with his request, and this was&lt;br/&gt;Humdinger's downfall.  Dr. Emil Woopsy's pronounced accent&lt;br/&gt;caused Humdinger to misinterpret the question &quot;Explain the&lt;br/&gt;compression of large, significant numbers into a single value in&lt;br/&gt;terms of its effects upon mathematicians who still use the&lt;br/&gt;operators you have discarded.&quot;.  Humdinger interpreted this&lt;br/&gt;question from the original Pig Latin to mean &quot;Can you dance like a&lt;br/&gt;frog in a cyclone?&quot;. Humdinger repeated the question as he&lt;br/&gt;understood it, and against the objections of his committee, &lt;br/&gt;began trying to dance.  Dr. Woopsy, an avid fan of ballroom&lt;br/&gt;dancing, took this as a personal affront.  Humdinger failed&lt;br/&gt;his oral defense, and was dismissed from the&lt;br/&gt;program.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humdinger disappeared from the world of&lt;br/&gt;academics.  He spent years trying to interest elevator&lt;br/&gt;companies in a new numbering system for the floors on&lt;br/&gt;elevators.  Not surprisingly, the elevator manufacturers were&lt;br/&gt;not interested in a numbering system that replaced the digits &quot;6&quot;&lt;br/&gt;and &quot;2&quot; with the word &quot;Guess!&quot;.   He later found&lt;br/&gt;profitable and satisfying work writing the fine print on bank&lt;br/&gt;loans, and passed away in&lt;br/&gt;1982.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Click To Rate This Cache&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: PA17RER - A&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Utility pole with large oval tag.

This modest five and dime store eventually&lt;br/&gt;became the marketing megalith we know today as K-Mart.  &lt;br/&gt;Fans of K-Mart will remember the frequent &quot;Blue Light Specials&quot;&lt;br/&gt;that indicated a product had just become less&lt;br/&gt;expensive.   &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;In keeping with the idea that a Blue Light&lt;br/&gt;Special means a less costly product, this cache is a Blue Light&lt;br/&gt;Special.  It's  the least costly cache I've ever hidden,&lt;br/&gt;and the product you find there, especially the color scheme, might&lt;br/&gt;be considered to be consistent with a discount product.  The&lt;br/&gt;cache container is not maroon, and not maroon and white. The&lt;br/&gt;container is full blossom discount&lt;br/&gt;colors.   &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ADDITIONAL LOGGING REQUIREMENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additional&lt;br/&gt;Logging Requirement 1:   This log may be signed&lt;br/&gt;only in the night time. During Daylight Savings Time, that is&lt;br/&gt;usually between 9:00 PM and 6:00 AM.  During Standard Time,&lt;br/&gt;that is usually between 5:30 PM and 6:30 AM.  A good rule of&lt;br/&gt;thumb is this:  If you have to have your headlights on to&lt;br/&gt;drive legally, then it's dark enough to find this&lt;br/&gt;cache.   &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additional Logging Requirement&lt;br/&gt;2: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;You must drop me an email telling me why this cache was so easy to&lt;br/&gt;find.  It will be obvious once you have met Additional Logging&lt;br/&gt;Requirement 1.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOW TO FIND THE CACHE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Again, in keeping with the  discount nature&lt;br/&gt;of this cache, very little effort has been put into constructing&lt;br/&gt;the puzzle.  Convert the 1899 date into ABCD, and the correct&lt;br/&gt;coordinates will be 33 26.C36    0BB&lt;br/&gt;47.402.    Yes, it's too easy.  But, isn't that&lt;br/&gt;how a Blue Light Special should&lt;br/&gt;be?   &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: BL1DZ6T - Final location&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

It will be interesting to come back one night to see what is different with this cache in the dark. Don't know how long that will be until I have a reason to be in Starkville at night. Hopefully it is still around when that finally happens.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I teamed up with ADS1 this morning for an attack on the puzzle caches in town. We knocked off a couple, then started on this one. We had deciphered the first part with no problem, but the next part was giving us fits. We were actually on the right path to solving the last portion, but there was a little trick I had never heard of. A call to 1-800-PUSH gave me the hint of this new fangled cipher. Using the fine taxpayers computer (read low bid) from the dark ages in ADS1's office, I finally got the last part of the puzzle together. We set out to find the locations we needed only to realize there was more of a puzzle than answer at each location. Gathering the possible answers we moved on. Push arrived at the third one to heckle, er help us.  [:D] We quickly gathered the info at the other two locations and with a few quick calculations moved on to the final. My GPS was doing its usual lying act, but I noticed ADS1 acting a little strange and quickly figured he had the container in  his hand.  [}:)] S/L at 11:40 and retired to the Super Secret Mafia Event [;)]  for a fine meal of extra fat hamburgers, brats, Mrs. GoGlo's fine potato salad, chips and an overrated Smith County watermelon. Now I'm wondering if that meat came from a fine fat cow or some rejected animal at the MSU research farm. [:O]</groundspeak:text>

Lewis, the author of so many great Christian books, as well as&lt;br/&gt;classics such as the Chronicles Of Narnia.   It was&lt;br/&gt;Tolkien who led Lewis to accept the Christian faith while they&lt;br/&gt;taught together at Oxford University.   &lt;i&gt;(Note for Ole&lt;br/&gt;Miss graduates: &quot;Oxford University&quot; is not the same as &quot;Ole&lt;br/&gt;Miss&quot;.   They're not even in the same&lt;br/&gt;county.)&lt;/i&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tolkien loved codes and ciphers, and spent much of&lt;br/&gt;his boyhood developing new languages.  Tolkien specialized in&lt;br/&gt;Old English and Middle English at Oxford, and was a member of the&lt;br/&gt;Coal Biters Club.  The Coal Biters met regularly at Oxford,&lt;br/&gt;smoked their pipes, and read to each other chapters and poetry they&lt;br/&gt;had written in the now-dead Icelandic&lt;br/&gt;language.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In keeping with Tolkien's love of languages, codes,&lt;br/&gt;and scholarly endeavor, the solution of this cache will require&lt;br/&gt;some effort in all three areas.  (This was inspired, in part,&lt;br/&gt;by El-Kabong's need to stay busy when weather and vehicle&lt;br/&gt;maintenance made him immobile.) The physical finding of the cache&lt;br/&gt;will be simple.  Unraveling the solution to the cache...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;perhaps not so&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither search engines nor other internet sources&lt;br/&gt;were used in the construction of question and answer portion of&lt;br/&gt;this cache listing. Internet information may not be reliable. &lt;br/&gt;All information used to construct the question and answer portion&lt;br/&gt;of this cache came from the original source&lt;br/&gt;materials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solve chapters one,&lt;br/&gt;two, and three, and then tackle the questions and answers. Good&lt;br/&gt;luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your visit to Middle&lt;br/&gt;Earth.

Frodo&lt;br/&gt;left Hobbiton, he stayed with the Brandybucks, just north of&lt;br/&gt;Buckleberry. The Brandybucks' home was in what&lt;br/&gt;town? &lt;br/&gt;(11,4,I,0,4)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name of&lt;br/&gt;Thorin Oakenshield's sword, sometimes referred to as&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Goblin-Cleaver&quot;, and the mate of Glamdring. The Orcs feared this&lt;br/&gt;sword, and called it &quot;Biter&quot;. It was laid to rest atop Thorin's&lt;br/&gt;tomb. &lt;br/&gt;(7,5,H,0,3)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Griffo's last&lt;br/&gt;name. Griffo was married to the former Daisy&lt;br/&gt;Baggins. &lt;br/&gt;(6,5,III,3,1)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second&lt;br/&gt;most powerful wizard of the Istari order.  He was also known&lt;br/&gt;as Tharkun by the Dwarves. &lt;br/&gt;(7,0,I,0,1)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gilly's last&lt;br/&gt;name. Gilly was married to Posco, and before marriage, she was a&lt;br/&gt;Brownlock. &lt;br/&gt;(7,2,III,0,4)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An Orc in the&lt;br/&gt;Tower of Cirith. Shagrat squeezed his eyes out when he refused to&lt;br/&gt;obey an order after the fight between the Orcs of Cirith Ungol and&lt;br/&gt;Minas Morgul.&lt;br/&gt;(6,6,III,0,4)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This place was&lt;br/&gt;in Gondor, between Aduin and the Ephel Duath. This was originally&lt;br/&gt;Isuldur's home. After the return of the King, Faramir became its&lt;br/&gt;prince.&lt;br/&gt;(8,0,III,0,3)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name&lt;br/&gt;commonly used for referring to Wilcome Cotton. &lt;br/&gt;(5,0,III,1,1)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chief city&lt;br/&gt;of Gondor. The city was built on seven levels. This is where the&lt;br/&gt;Nazgul breached the Great Gate during the War of the Ring, and were&lt;br/&gt;stopped only when the Rohirrim arrived and saved the&lt;br/&gt;city. &lt;br/&gt;(11,0,III,0,11) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dunaden of&lt;br/&gt;Gondor, daughter of Imrahil, married to King Eomer of&lt;br/&gt;Rohan. &lt;br/&gt;(9,2,III,0,4)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The great&lt;br/&gt;spider who paralyzed Frodo in a trap laid by&lt;br/&gt;Gollum. &lt;br/&gt;(6,0,II,9,3)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord and&lt;br/&gt;master of the Old Forest. He wore a pointed hat with a blue&lt;br/&gt;feather, and large yellow boots. He loved to sing and make up&lt;br/&gt;songs. Find his last name, as used by Hobbits. &lt;br/&gt;(8,1,I,0,4)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He carried the&lt;br/&gt;Great Horn of the Stewards of Gondor. A Dunadan of Gondor, he was&lt;br/&gt;the eldest son of Denethor II.&lt;br/&gt;(7,1,I,2,1)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King Of Dale,&lt;br/&gt;slain in the Battle of Dale in year 3019. &lt;br/&gt;(5,0,I,0,3)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Son of Groin,&lt;br/&gt;father of Gimli, companion of Thorin and Thrain. &lt;br/&gt;(5,1,H,0,1)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geocaching is a lot&lt;br/&gt;of fun.  It takes all types of caches to keep things&lt;br/&gt;interesting, from simple park and grabs behind roadside banisters&lt;br/&gt;to the mind-busting, body-ripping complexities of Wonderland (the&lt;br/&gt;2evilguys/Pennsylvania version). This cache lies somewhere in the&lt;br/&gt;middle of the continuum. Please avoid hunting this cache between&lt;br/&gt;the hours of 5:00PM and midnight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I greatly enjoyed&lt;br/&gt;putting this together.  Support was provided by geocacher&lt;br/&gt;slwoodard, who provided the final stage&lt;br/&gt;container. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geochecker.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Click To Rate This Cache&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN10QBZ - Final, Middle Earth&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;One and only stage of this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

you're almost done....&lt;br/&gt;      almost.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now you'll need some extra information&lt;/b&gt; to retrieve the cache. &lt;br/&gt;Look to the south, and you'll see a mailbox.  Of all the&lt;br/&gt;information that may reside on that mailbox, there's only one four&lt;br/&gt;digit number.  Write down that four digit number, and change&lt;br/&gt;those four digits, in order, into ABCD. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using
your ABCD four digit number&lt;/b&gt;, solve the three numbers below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Number&lt;br/&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; = B + C + D&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Number&lt;br/&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; = ((A + B + C + D)  X  3) + B&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Number&lt;br/&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; = (A + B + C) X (A + C)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now
that you have your three numbers&lt;/b&gt;, you'll use them as part of this code:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;CWX3,

READ FURTHER FOR HINTS ON WHAT TO&lt;br/&gt;DO NEXT.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Education is such a&lt;br/&gt;necessary tool&lt;/b&gt; in today's world.  In days past, it was a&lt;br/&gt;benefit of the wealthy classes, or a diversion for the&lt;br/&gt;privileged.   In America, education is available freely&lt;br/&gt;for all citizens.  Unfortunately, some of our grand old school&lt;br/&gt;buildings no longer exist. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Self Creek School&lt;br/&gt;operated&lt;/b&gt; from the turn of the 20th century until the early&lt;br/&gt;1950s.  It had a large school house, and a teacher's home&lt;br/&gt;across the road, and a gymnasium that was built by the WPA in the&lt;br/&gt;1930's, but never finished.   The main building stood&lt;br/&gt;vacant until 2005, when it was bulldozed to make way for&lt;br/&gt;&quot;progress&quot;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cache is located&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;at the old Self Creek School.  There are two ways to find this&lt;br/&gt;cache.  You can find the location of the old Self Creek School&lt;br/&gt;and look in the only remaining symbol of Mississippi that resides&lt;br/&gt;there, or you can solve the following puzzle. (Local historical&lt;br/&gt;groups had several possible locations for the old school, all of&lt;br/&gt;which were wrong.) The location of the old school took me four&lt;br/&gt;months to find, so solving the puzzle may be the easier of the two&lt;br/&gt;methods.  When (if) you find the cache, please note in your&lt;br/&gt;log which method you used to find it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;To find the&lt;br/&gt;coordinates,&lt;/b&gt; take the quiz below.  If the answer is a&lt;br/&gt;name, take the first letter of the name, and find it's ordinal&lt;br/&gt;value. For example, if the name is &quot;Adams&quot;, the ordinal value of&lt;br/&gt;&quot;A&quot; is 1.  If the name is Buchanan, the ordinal value of &quot;B&quot;&lt;br/&gt;is 2, and so on.  If the question is a math question, use the&lt;br/&gt;value of the answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AB CD.EFG   HIJ&lt;br/&gt;KL.MNO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sound easy&lt;br/&gt;enough?&lt;/b&gt;  GREAT!  Now, class, turn your test papers&lt;br/&gt;over, and let's get busy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;A.&lt;/b&gt; The &quot;Eutaw Flag&quot; was&lt;br/&gt;created in 1780, carried in the battles of Cowpens and Eutaw, and&lt;br/&gt;is now in the possession of the Washington Light Infantry. &lt;br/&gt;What is the name of the city where the flag is&lt;br/&gt;kept?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;B.&lt;/b&gt; Born in 1874, he&lt;br/&gt;served as a reporter for London's &lt;i&gt;Daily Graphic&lt;/i&gt; in 1895, and&lt;br/&gt;later fought in Omdurman in the Sudan in 1898.

His &quot;Castles In Spain&quot; hangs in the&lt;br/&gt;Metropolitan Museum Of Art.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;I had this extra ammo&lt;br/&gt;box&lt;/b&gt; that needed to be in use, and I thought I'd put a little&lt;br/&gt;extra thought into building this little puzzle.  By the same&lt;br/&gt;token, extra thought should be put into the solution.  I will&lt;br/&gt;not give any help or lifelines on this until either (a) it's been&lt;br/&gt;logged online as found, or (b) a week has passed since its&lt;br/&gt;publication.  I have come to understand that the amount of&lt;br/&gt;time it takes to solve a cache's coordinates is inversely&lt;br/&gt;proportional to the number of people who will eventually sign the&lt;br/&gt;log book.  That's okay by me. This will probably not be found&lt;br/&gt;by more than ten people while then cache is active, and I&lt;br/&gt;understand that.  If you're one of those few who finds this&lt;br/&gt;cache, you'll be part of an elite group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;I will also ask&lt;/b&gt; that&lt;br/&gt;the answers to the questions, or the location of Self Creek School,&lt;br/&gt;if known, not be passed around.   In the spirit of good&lt;br/&gt;education everywhere, do your own homework, and don't let the guy&lt;br/&gt;next to you look on your paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have fun&lt;/b&gt;, drive safely,&lt;br/&gt;and don't forget to log this stating the method you used for&lt;br/&gt;finding it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on &lt;br/&gt;Geochecker.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Click To Rate This Cache&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: AC12Q5B - Academics 101&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Final (and only) waypoint for this cache.

We'll look into finding the&lt;br/&gt;correct coordinates later.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a remarkable cache container, nor is it&lt;br/&gt;in a creative hiding place.  The value of this cache is in its&lt;br/&gt;surroundings.  The little Methodist Church that started this&lt;br/&gt;cemetery was established in 1851, and many of the headstones here&lt;br/&gt;predate the War Between The States.  This neatly groomed&lt;br/&gt;cemetery is also the final resting place for many veterans,&lt;br/&gt;including some Confederate veterans.  Take time to look for&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Griffin's headstone, it is unique in its&lt;br/&gt;engraving.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Wesley began what was known in the early-mid&lt;br/&gt;1700's as the Methodist Movement.  The Methodists were fervent&lt;br/&gt;believers in structured study of Scripture and in the belief that&lt;br/&gt;salvation was available to all mankind. The Anglican hierarchy of&lt;br/&gt;the day found Wesley's practices distasteful, and Wesley was&lt;br/&gt;banished from the Anglican pulpits of England. Wesley then made&lt;br/&gt;graveyards, race tracks, and pubs his pulpit.  Wesley came to&lt;br/&gt;Georgia, and on the return voyage, thanks to the Moravians, he was&lt;br/&gt;introduced to the depth of faith that would become the hallmark of&lt;br/&gt;the rest of his ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, for our coordinates.  You'll need two&lt;br/&gt;bits of information in order to find this cache.  You'll need&lt;br/&gt;the year John Wesley was born, and the year he died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coordinates of the cache are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;N 33 58.ALPHA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; W 088 59.OMEGA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alpha is equal to the year of Wesley's birth minus&lt;br/&gt;1325.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Omega is equal to the year Wesley died, minus 1449.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Click To Rate This Cache&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN15MJX - Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

Just as I started to reach in I noticed not one, but two black widows guarding the area. Backed off and searched other possible areas before calling a lifeline to see if the widows were guarding the cache. After confirming the location I decided not to risk the cache, but as I was leaving spotted an object that would increase my height and allow retrival with a pair of pliers from my truck. S/L at 11:45 and then hauled the object off to be properly disposed of in the trash.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This one-acre site commemorates the last major Civil War battle in Mississippi. The engagement at Tupelo, July 14-15, 1864, was part of the effort on the part of Union forces to keep General Nathan Bedford Forrest in northeast Mississippi and away from General William T. Sherman's supply line running from Nashville to Chattanooga.

Federal forces under General A.J. Smith occupied the town of Harrisburg, present day Tupelo. Forrest and his commander General Steven D. Lee, realizing that Smith could take control of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, moved troops to Harrisburg for a two-day battle that would ultimately end in a draw. The Union objective had been achieved, and Sherman's supply line in eastern Tennessee remained open, allowing Sherman to continue his march to the sea.

The site contains two cannons, a monument to the battle, and an interpretive wayside

The cache is not within the memorial site but does provide a good angle for taking photos. Watch out for traffic. You will need to park at the carwash/detail shop across the street.</groundspeak:long_description>

&quot;And the sign said long haired freaky people need not apply
So I tucked my hair up under my hat and I went in to ask him why
He said you look like a fine upstanding young man, I think you'll do
So I took off my hat I said imagine that, huh, me working for you&quot;

Sometimes signs can be a good thing. Just like the guy in the song looks can be deceiving but this shouldn’t be too difficult.

Feel free to wave to the nice folks inside the shop.

The cache is large enough for a few small items of swag or travel bugs.

The cache is NOT connected to the AT&amp;T (big white) boxes in the area.
Has a 1.5 terrain but I think most handicapped should be able to access it.
Stealth will be the hardest part of this cache as traffic is constantly passing by.

We spend lots of hours here for our 8 year olds sporting events. If you come by while there are ballgames feel free to stop and enjoy one. There is a concession stand with cool drinks and goodies as well as restrooms and parking.

There is a set of train tracks at the North end of the park. You do not have to cross, climb on, or even go near the tracks to get this cache.

Hope you enjopy it. </groundspeak:long_description>

Wynoose is known for 3 things:

I was surprised to see the travel bug hotel has been archived and no caches Northbound so I had to fix that. 
You are looking for a cammo'ed pill bottle. When retrieving and replacing the cache please put back the same way as I had it or even better. There are some thorns in the area so be careful. Now go stretch those legs and grab a cache!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Monument to the 27000 workers who built the LSTs and ARLs in the
Prairie Shipyard of Seneca. 

 The wartime need for new shipyard facilities coincided with some
unique geological characteristics at Seneca’s location on the
Illinois River, characteristics favorable for building what would
become known as the “shipyard on the prairie.” So, in
1942, the new Seneca shipyard launched (with the traditional bottle
of champagne) its first LST, one of the Landing Ship Tanks (LST)
that would carry troops into battle. The LSTs left Seneca, sailed
down the Illinois to the Mississippi, and then entered the Gulf of
Mexico. The ships took troops and supplies to Iwo Jima, Dutch New
Guinea, southern Italy, and the Normandy coast. The shipyard built
157 LSTs, launching the last one in June 1945. At the
shipyard’s peak, 11,000 people worked there, living in Seneca
and nearby towns in temporary housing. For their dedication and
skill, workers at the Seneca shipyard helped the shipyard earn five
Army-Navy “E” awards. &lt;b&gt;Congratulations lgreeley1983
on FTF!&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

at N 41 19.558 W 088 42.612. The walk is uphill on the pedestrian
walkway along the bridge hence the 3 rating on terrain.
&lt;b&gt;Congratulations Team Peterson 08 on FTF!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt; • Structure: Marseilles Dam • Location: River Mile 247.0

Elevation (Pool): 483 Feet • River Elevation (Outflow): 459
Feet • Water Fall: 24 Feet • Date Built: 1933
Construction of the 9-foot navigation channel project on the upper
Illinois River was started by the State of Illinois in 1921. The
project was mostly complete by 1930 when the state ran out of money
and stopped the project. The project was turned over to the US Army
Corps of Engineers, who completed the project in 1933. The 1933 dam
replaced an 1867 era dam. Various mills had dams at this location
going back to 1832. The City of Marseilles was founded by Ephriam
Sprague in 1832 when he moved to the area to establish a sawmill.
He was aware the the Illinois and Michigan Canal would pass though
the city, and he wanted to be in on the ground floor. He named the
city Marseilles because he thought it was an ideal place for an
industrial center, much like the industrial city of Marseilles,
France. Sprague forgot, however, to secure his land claim. The next
year, Lovell Kimball moved into Marseilles, and built a new dam
just down river from Sprague, flooding out Spragues dam and mill,
and ruining his business. Kimball prospered for a decade, until his
grist mill burned in 1842. His insurance failed to pay off, leaving
Kimball both broke and broken. He died shortly after that.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK28CQR - Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 19.542 W 088° 42.609&lt;br/&gt;Park here and it's a mere .22 mi to the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

Marseilles,IL. 

 Eagle Scout is the highest rank in all of Scouting. The young man
who has met the requirements of Eagle Rank has passed many
milestones in his journey. The Eagle Project must demonstrate
leadership of others and provide service to a worthy institution
other than the Boy Scouts. This may be a religious institution,
school, or community. This exceptional young man chose to build a
ramp for the local city park so that the lower bowl of the park was
accessible for community events such as summer concerts, community
movie nights, etc. This cache is very tiny and log only , BYOP. The
cache is placed with the permission of the City of Marseilles.

0799 in Marseilles,IL. 

 Eagle Scout is the highest rank in all of Scouting. The young man
who has met the requirements of Eagle Rank has passed many
milestones in his journey. The Eagle Project must demonstrate
leadership of others and provide service to a worthy institution
other than the Boy Scouts. This may be a religious institution,
school, or community. This is the site of two Eagle projects. One
young man chose to design and build a sidewalk that linked the
parking lot to the entrance of the church. The church where this
cache is located is home to Troop 99 as well as Cub Scout Pack 3799
and a Girl Scout troop. The church also has a very active youth
program as well. With all those little feet cutting through the
bushes on the way to their many meetings, the sidewalk out near the
street wasn't used very often. This is the reason this exceptional
Scout decided to take on the project. The second project built on
this site is the beautiful garden that surrounds the walkway built
by the first scout. These two boys came up through the program
together and it is appropriate that their two projects complimented
one another the same way their friendship did. This cache is placed
with permission of the First Untied Methodist Church of Marseilles.
The cache has a Scout theme to it.(First Aid kits, Scout patches
etc.) Please be respectful of the site as it is a very active
church and there are usually lots of little muggles roaming about.
Remember, Indians chasing Buffalo always have the right of way!
&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to The Jackal and I am Legend on FTF!&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 Eagle Scout is the highest rank in all of Scouting. The young man
who has met the requirements of Eagle Rank has passed many
milestones in his journey. The Eagle Project must demonstrate
leadership of others and provide service to a worthy institution
other than the Boy Scouts. This may be a religious institution,
school, or community.This young man chose to sandblast and repaint
the cannon which sits in front of the local V.F.W. /American
Legion. This building has historic significance for Scouting as
well. It was once the clubhouse for the Marsatawa Golf Course which
once sat across the Illinois River in what is now Illini State
Park. The golf course was built by W.D. Boyce the founder of
Scouting in the United States. This cache is placed with permission

A hide on an object such as this can be frustrating but thank goodness for a larger container as it made the find a pleasure! Nice paint job to boot.

 This project took land that was in a flood plain and turned it into a playground for residents. There is a 9 hole Frisbee golf course here as well as a great walking path that connects down river to the YMCA. There are boat docks and fishing available as well as a water feature for cooling off on those hot summer days. Be sure to bring the kids, they should get a kick out of watching you make this grab.

Gates In 1925 this Dam was an innovation in design. The dam is
hollow thus used much less material in its construct while still
retaining it's strength. North American Hydro who owns and operates
this dam is very generous to the Scouting program and has developed
a very nice campground on it's properties for use by the Scouts.
The image I chose for the background is from the winter of 09/10
when a huge ice flow jammed up the river. Ice in this image is 20
feet thick. It is amazing what mother nature can do. This dam also
serves as a barrier to the Asian Carp which are the scourge of the
Illinois River. &lt;b&gt;Congratulations Myaki on FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK2CE0Q - GC2CE0Q Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 23.103 W 088° 47.572&lt;br/&gt;Public Parking is available and just a short walk will take you to this spectacular view. The terrain is flat but you do have to cross a set of tracks and walk through some grass but I'd say it's handicap accessible.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;The Knights of Pythias is a fraternal organization and secret
society founded in Washington, DC in the mid-nineteenth century.
The Knights of Pythias was the first fraternal organization to
receive a charter under an act of the United States Congress. It
was founded by Justus H. Rathbone, who had been inspired by a play
by the Irish poet John Banim about the legend of Damon and Pythias.
This legend illustrates the ideals of loyalty, honor and friendship
that are central to the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;************************************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The posted coordinates will bring you to a physical object
embedded in the ground. On this object will be a few bits of
information that you will need to take note of to determine the
location of the final cache.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the 4-digit number on the 3rd line of the object and
perform the following calculations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Subtract 7 from the last 2 digits of the number to find the
direction in degrees of the final cache location (AZIMUTH)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Add 6 to the first 3 numbers to find the number of feet
needed to travel to find the final cache location. (FEET)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have the direction and the distance that you need to
travel to find the final cache. Plug that information into the
Waypoint Projection feature of your GPSr and go find that
cache!&lt;/p&gt;

We found stage one (I really like to know the story behind that being there... such a strange location), did our waypoint projection... and found the cache in pretty short order.  My son took a happy meal toy and left a dinosaur.  I took LLS Hike for Discovery #10 travel bug and dropped off &quot;Mr. Potato Bug&quot; travel bug and left a signature LEGO. Well done multi and great use incorporating the object into the cache.  TFTH

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Xyval and I were at this park Jan 2007. Wow, have things changed...cache wise. Older caches are gone and new ones popped up. I really love this park, so I am glad to come at anytime, even better for new caches.

I was really impressed with stage one. This one was a team effort.  I really have no experiace with projection and puzzle cachers are not my forte, Xyval spotted me on this one.  We had 2 final answers to work with, so we put one number in one GPS and the other in the other. We headed out.  We got around GZ and then started our search.  Chalk another puzzle find for me.  Thanks for a very interesting cache, and for the projection lesson.  I need to do more of these.

&lt;p&gt;The old EJ&amp;E Plainfield Depot is the last wood-framed depot associated with the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railroad that is situated near active railroad tracks. It was moved from its original location on the south side of the railroad tracks on Center Street in 1999 by the Plainfield Historical Society, to it's new location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The depot dates back to 1887, it was mainly used as a freight depot, but did serve passengers for several years in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Plainfield Grain Co., which built the tower northeast of routes 126 and 59, relied heavily on the depot. But as road networks built out and trucking became the favored mode of transportation, the depot was used less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was considered an active depot through 1978, but mostly it was used as a check post for the EJ&amp;E workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern Railway officially ceased to exist January 31st, 2009, at 11:59 PM. At midnight, February 1st, the line became Canadian National property. Over 120 years of EJ&amp;E history came to an end.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

After a resting up with a bunch of other cache...We got back onto the matt for another beating.
TAA went up, I went down and all around. No luck. PAF again. They gave us some hints and TAA with the Hootie...on to stage two....ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!! ARGH!!! Nope, not going there.

We took 30 mins for a quick lunch and headed to the new GZ. Having inside info on this park, we took the longer indirect route.  Did a minor water crossing with no real issues and TAA got the hooty again. On our way back, we made a makeshift bridge for the next cacher. 

Stick a fork in me...i'm done!

&lt;br/&gt;
The stops are not hard and can be done from the car. The final is a
walk over a beautifully manicured lawn. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
------------------------------ &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Stop 1 - The Estate&lt;/b&gt; (Wally's Home) Count the number of
columns on the front of the estate.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Stop 2 - The Club&lt;/b&gt; (... and his work) Count the number of
columns all around the main building. (Note: 2 story columns count
as one column.)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Stop 3 - The Memorial&lt;/b&gt; (For his Wife, Beverly) Count the
number of GROUPS of columns. (Hint: Less than twenty)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Add the answers from the three stops to the posted coordinates
(both N and W). &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This will be the location of the final cache. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Dedication: to Team WO9LF &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Some of the most well crafted and thought out caches in the SW
suburbs by one of the nicest and interesting Geocaching couples.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Your caches are always a delight and always left me smiling on my
way back to work. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Your 'Brain Pain' series confounded many a geocacher (in a
wonderful park with a great history) and who would think a 2 ton
stage on your 'A Stroll Through Town' multi would or even could be
stolen? &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Too much fun. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks for the caches! &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 I managed to find a spot where the restrictions of the surrounding
forest preserves do not apply. It is an enchanting view into areas
forbidden to us (Lemont Woods, Keepataw Forest Preserve and Black
Partridge Nature Preserve). &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 Beautiful. Truly beautiful. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 This cache is larger than most ammo boxes and smaller than a 5
gallon container. Meow. Big enough for large travel bugs but too
tough of a walk to be a hotel. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 I left the container totally exposed, visable from all sides but
the approach side. Lets see how long it will last. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 Please feel free to take one of the 'Ready to Go' cache containers
which I have placed inside. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 ------------------------ &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 Since I started working in this area many local caches have
entertained me. I have been amused and challenged everyday when I
go out to grab a cache at lunch. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 This cache is my way of saying 'Thank You' to all of the local
area cachers. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 Especially to... &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 Dedication: To Eagle Son &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 Who has put many geocachers (myself included) thru the wringer.
Challenging us to 'Choose Wisely&quot; when selecting the parking and a
path from stage to stage on his fun multi's. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 Whether the obstacle being brambles or a river or even a great
distance he made us look at the maps and make a decision. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 Thanks for all of the fun caches; I know we all enjoy them very
much. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 Keep on challenging us!&lt;br/&gt;

I headed over to this cache from &quot;What is this doing here?&quot;  I definitely earned my terrain rating and then some today. I managed to bushwhack the whole way there and make (I'm sure) several unnecessary creek crossings.  But I loved the adventure, even the part where the fallen tree I was standing on broke under my weight and I fell to the ground.  I agree this area definitely offers some great views.  I found the cache easy enough, but it was completely filled with water. I emptied the container and swag bag of water the best I could. The log was mush. TFTH</groundspeak:text>

Was orginally set to do my 200th in Oswego, but that was bust. We needed to pick up the kids so we headed east and decided this one would be my 200th!! The cache was an awesome choice. Took us awhile to find the better parking.  We parked and headed toward GZ.  We stayed to one side, but Xyval quickly said let's double back and come around, which we did. With the newly fallen snow, I think added a star to the terrain. Luckily we had something to grab on to.  We got to with in 20 feet and switch to visual.  I knew what we were looking for but could not find it. We sat around, taking in veiw of the semi-frozen still flowing river and the light snowfall. WOW!! It was awesome.  I am glad we did it at this time of year.  I turned and made the find.  L: Rubber duck

Thanks &quot;Panther in the Den&quot; for a great 200th!!</groundspeak:text>

I found something hanging around, a lid laying around, then a log sheet laying a little ways off and.... oh there's the container. I put it all back together as I do believe NESAMOH intended. There is a tiny hole in the container as a critter seems to enjoy gnawing on plastic. LOL

Thanks for the cache NESAMOH.

Shouldn't be much trouble with muggles except possibly on weekdays around lunch time. Some minor bushwhacking required. If it gets too thick, your probably approaching from the wrong side. There might a better &quot;path&quot; to take!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small orange cannister, no room for trading items. No pen or pencil, so BYOP!

Out with the LEGS crew for a morning of caching.
There were some of us that wanted to dash for this cache as 

We were in the middle of two multis and came across this one. I had to think for a minute as to what cache was my milestone but finally figured out that signing the log constituted the find so here I am.  :)

This was a nice one for my milestone! Not far from the path and in a nice little wooded area. Just like geocaching should be.

Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

Found with MutherAndSun on a hot and humid day in the area. 100% humidity, 3 hours sleep, 998 caches in a 15 mi radius, perfect plan for a 24hr cache run. It's a shame I can't share all of the details of some of the hunts, but there is a reason MutherAndSun is my favorite driver. Orale! and TFTC.

There is no need to bring anything, for she'll just enjoy your company..

I ran across this location when I was scouting an area for an upcoming multi-cache.  There is a lot of bushwhacking, this is not for the faint of heart and a true cacher will say &quot;no pain, no smiley&quot;.

I named the cache after the mouse I saw when placing.

Good luck hunting!

Sit on one of the benches, you might see a beaver that lives on the creek banks. My kids and i like to come here and play and relax.

Placed in Memorial Park which there is a memorial service every Memorial day.

The hiding style inspired by Cindermouse, I used an ultra-nano on this one. You can park either before of after the park as long as you are on the &quot;sidewalk&quot; side of the street and the park closes at dusk.
This will not be too easy to spot, so take your time and look.
Have fun!!

FYI: BYOP and you might need a log extraction tool.

Drive-In Theater History
A brief history of the drive-in Theater from its inception to the present.

The drive-in Theater was the brainchild of one Richard Milton Hollingshead, Jr. The inventor's father, Richard Milton Hollingshead, Sr., owned and operated a business that first sold harness soap, later moving on to selling a complete line of automotive products under the name of the &quot;Whiz Auto Products Company.&quot; After Richard Jr. finished school, he took a position with his father's company as general sales manager.

Always on the lookout for new ideas, Richard Jr. began thinking about new business concepts. His preference was to have a cash business, as he didn't like the idea of going into debt. It dawned on him that in terms of buying habits, people gave up Food, Clothing, Autos and Movies last, in that order. He had noticed that even though the depression was in full swing, folks continued to go to motion pictures at their local Theater. From this, his first notion was to create a deluxe gas station, designed like a Hawaiian Village, that would feature a restaurant and outdoor movies where the customers could mingle while their cars were being serviced, utilizing Whiz Auto Products of course!

It is not clear why he dropped every other aspect of the idea other than the outdoor Theater, but soon Richard, 30 years old by this time, was experimenting with the concept in his back yard on 212 Thomas Avenue in Riverton, New Jersey. He started by placing an old Kodak projector on the hood of his car, projecting the movie onto a screen nailed to a tree. He turned on his sprinkler to simulate rainfall, and placed a radio behind the screen to provide the sound. He also reasoned that in order to ensure that all of the vehicles had an un-obstructed view of the screen, they would need to be positioned in a special way. He spent several weeks arranging vehicles in different configurations to solve the visibility problem. The final solution was a series of terraced ramps whose height increased as you parked closer to the screen. This arrangement of ramps was the core of his concept and Richard felt it was strong enough to be patentable, allowing him to collect royalties from future drive-in operators for a period of 17 years, the standard time limit for patents. Or so he thought.

The application for patent was filed on August 6, 1932, and it was later granted by the patent office on May 16, 1933 under patent number 1,909,537. The next thing on the agenda was to build the first drive-in in order to promote the idea to the public as well as potential investors. First off though, he needed to get some financial backing which came from Willie Warren Smith, his first cousin and parking lot operator. The two men then formed a company, called Park-In Theaters Inc. Richard assigned his patent to the company immediately. Edward Ellis, a road contractor, was brought in to grade the lot of the first Theater in exchange for stock. Oliver Willets, an executive of Campbell's Soup, also bought stock in the company at the time.

On May 16, 1933, the day the patent was granted, work began on constructing the drive-in on Crescent Boulevard in Pennsauken Township, New Jersey. The location is usually reported as Admiral Wilson Blvd. in Camden, but technically the Theater was just over the Camden town line, where the name of the road changes. Opening night was June 6, 1933, and it was known simply as &quot;Drive-In Theater&quot; although the actual name was the &quot;Automobile Movie Theater.&quot; Opening night was packed with cars, and the first film ever shown at a drive-in was the 1932 release of &quot;Wives Beware,&quot; which was in second-run status at the time. The problem of obtaining first-run films for drive-ins remains to this day! Admission was 25¢ for each car and an additional 25¢ for each person, somewhat higher than the prevailing price at the indoor houses at the time, who were also offering double features. Ironically, this has reversed itself over time and drive-ins are usually the only places to see double features today. 

Two such drive-in theaters in the Chicago area are the Cascade and the McHenry outdoor theaters.

You are looking for one of my favorite type of containers, a very evil Ultra-nano. When replacing, please put back exactly as I originally hid it. 
BYOP and remember Walter Park closes at sunset, please respect the park rules and regulations.

This cache is just like life where we have to make choices. Spanning 4 different parks in Carol Stream, I will take you to some nice parks that you may have not even known had existed.

**** Congrats to sgauss for the FTF!! ****

The first stage is at the headquarters of the Carol Stream Park District.


The second stage is at Red Hawk Park, Kuhn Rd and St. Charles, there is ample parking there.

The Third Stage takes you to Slepica Homestead Park, there is ample parking there too.

The Fourth stage is the final.
Park on Birchbark Road, it's a short walk.

At first 3 stages you will be given three (3) sets of coordinates. Each coordinate does have a cache container, though two (2) of them will tell you to try again. The &quot;Real&quot; cache container will have a set of three (3) coordinates for the next park.

Each stage keeps you in that park until you find the &quot;real&quot; set of coordinates, I did space them apart enough so that they are over 300-400ft apart. Heck we all need exercise, plus I want you to see what the Parks offer to you.

The final is in a park that I know LucknJoe would love, in fact I had them in mind when placing the final.

I hope you have fun finding this cache.

For the FTF I have placed a cherished pin from oak coins that reads &quot;Eat, Sleep,and Cache&quot;.

When you reach each stage, please keep the cards in the zip lock bags no need to open them. Happy Hunting, and remember most of these parks close at dusk.
The terrain level 3 is due because the longest distance from one stage to another is about 2 miles. This will take in account for travel.

And now a message from our sponsor for Stage 2:

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&quot;Who are you?&quot;  &quot;I'm the Doctor&quot;, &quot;The Doctor? Doctor Who?&quot;.....
What started in 1963 by the BBC quickly became a cult hit. The original series ended in late 80's early 90's only to be revived again in 2005.  The new series also became a huge hit in England and the U.S.
To this date, my two favorite Doctors are Tom Baker and David Tennant.

This cache is dedicated to all of the &quot;Whoivans&quot; out there.  We all love the Doctor and his witty manner, and his sidekicks that always seen to make the show work. 
So when you hear the whooosh whooosh whooosh, you know the Doctor is on his way in the famous T.A.R.D.I.S. (Time And Relative Dimension In Space).  His TARDIS is a blue police box. Hmm what could the container be?


The cache is located on the west end of East Harbor Park, that end is the West Harbor Park, and there is parking available on the east side.  This is a difficulty rating of 2.5 because there are many places it could be.. It could be low, high or even in the middle.. To open the container pull the bottom base off to reveal the log.

PLEASE PUT THE CONTAINER BACK IN THE ORIGINAL PLACE and PLEASE make sure the &quot;Nautral Cammo&quot; is used to keep Muggles from stealing this!

**** Congrats to BIGAPNEE for an amazingly fast FTF!!! ****


Please remember that the park closes at dusk.  </groundspeak:long_description>

Hidden by the Bartlett Park District Aquatic and Rec Center.  Please obey the rules of the park. Park closes at dusk.  Parking is available nearby. 
Please do not use any sticks to retrieve the cache!
Instead you'll need special tool(s)..

Round and round the cobbler's bench
The monkey chased the weasel,
The monkey thought 'twas all in fun
Pop! Goes the weasel.

A penny for a spool of thread
A penny for a needle,
That's the way the money goes,
Pop! Goes the weasel.

A half a pound of tupenny rice,
A half a pound of treacle.
Mix it up and make it nice,
Pop! Goes the weasel.

Up and down the London road,
In and out of the Eagle,
That's the way the money goes,
Pop! Goes the weasel.

I've no time to plead and pine,
I've no time to wheedle,
Kiss me quick and then I'm gone
Pop! Goes the weasel.

The terrain could be a 1.5 or a 3 depending on how you approach to retrieve the cache. I placed this with 1.5 rating in mind. How will you approach it?

The terrain rating WILL change depending on the season with winter being the easiest. Rainy months the terrain could be up to a 4-4.5! Be prepared!

Within the year caching, I have found many caches, seen some awesome places and best of all, met some of the greatest people both at events and on the trail. Who would know there are nut jobs just like me who likes to hunt Tupperware in the woods! Thanks to TourSport for creating an obsessive cacher.  

This cache I placed is really to honor everyone in the sport who really loves caching like myself. this is placed in a fairly true what caching is meant to be style. So again this cache is for you!

Parking is by Kermit's Corner Park which closes at dusk.

Can you find him???

Located in Abrahamsen Park, parking allowed across the street. Please follow the posted park rules..

You are looking for my most favorite type of container. 
The evil and dreaded ultra-nano.... The cammo on this helps blend in and makes it a tough find.. Are you up to it??

Now off and find my little Chameleon!!</groundspeak:long_description>

&quot;In the middle, the mighty middle, the cacher sleeps tonight...&quot;
After going caching and finding most of the caches in this forest preserve, I noticed how the return portion of this trail had no caches. What a bummer, I thought. Geocachers had just walked about a mile finding most or all of the caches along the way, and had no caches to find on the way back. I came prepared and brought a fully loaded cache. And this is that cache.

I call this cache &quot;In the Middle&quot; because I noticed how it was about halfway through the trail back to the parking lot (If you go clockwise) and relatively in the middle of the preserve.

There is a short hike from the trail to the cache, and no major bushwhacking is necessary.</groundspeak:long_description>

The container lying on the ground without any log. I put in a temporary log and replaced the container as best I could. Even thought that I may have had an FTF. Turns out that the FTF was long gone since this is a GC cache GC30CC4 placed 7/17/11 and published 7/18/11. It appears that most of the OpenCaching caches are imported GC caches.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Backstory:&lt;/b&gt; Many people had met the
man that went by the name wkellogg01, and his unexpected passing
shocked all of them. This hide is like some of his own hides. He
once described his methods as lame hides with the challenge of the
searcher having to use utmost stealth.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
tamaranathan said this in the initial post notifying those of GONIL
of his passing:&quot;wkellogg01 lived in Rockford and made a long
caching commute every day to work at Discover in Riverwoods. I had
the pleasure of meeting him on the trails a few times during
lunchtime outings and caching with him. He was on a rapid pace to
hit 1000 finds before he abruptly stopped caching at the end of
July.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
lucy (lucy92979) had this to say: &quot;We were taken aback to hear this
last weekend. tishman had Warren's commemorative hide ready to go
last year as we were watching his 1000th milestone fast
approaching. When he seemed to abruptly stop we emailed him several
times but he never replied.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We had met and talked to Warren more than a few times. We enjoyed
his hides and his enthusiasm for geocaching. We were shocked and
saddened to hear of his passing. Our prayers and thoughts are with
his family and friends.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Even though I never met him, I chose to place this cache in his
memory. He still has a few active caches West of here further into
Rockford. Those hides are good caches and are maintained by myself
and other local geocachers. If you are here visiting Rockford or
are new to Geocaching in general, I invite you to make an effort to
find those last few.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Here is a bookmark list of his remaining active caches in Rockford
that remain active with logged finds (with exception of !O which is
East towards Chicago): wkellogg01's Legacy&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Congrats to CasheNCarry for FTF!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

You will need to look in one of many to find this cache. It's there. It isn't too large, it isn't too small. While you are searching the kids can play on the nearby playground equipment or play in the fields. Parking is available nearby. If you hunt this cache during soccer season, you may encounter a lot of muggles and parking may be difficult. Use stealth if any muggles are around.

Please place the cache back the way you found it.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Peterson Park in McHenry Illinois. It is a 209 Acre park which is home to the annual Fiesta Days celebration. It provides access to McCullom Lake and is on the Illinois Prairie Bike/walking path. There are also Softball and Baseball games and tournaments held here. It has Basketball courts, Gazebo's, play areas, Playground equipment, a beach(fee), Picnic shelter's, soccer fields and more. There is ample parking all around. Depending on how the vote's go, it may have a Metra line running right through the center of it, too.

You won't have to worry about a train over here, though. Depending on the parking lot you pick, you may have a shorter walk or a longer walk. Depending on the trail you take, this can have a little bushwhacking or it can have much more. I'll leave that up to decide. I didn't encounter any ticks, but there were mosquitoes so I suggest some bug spray. There are quite a few hidey spots and thick tree cover, so you may have to use more Geosense and less GPS once you get near GZ. Make sure you do a thorough search of the area and expand it if you need to.

It has Basketball courts, Gazebo's, play areas, Playground equipment, a beach, Picnic shelter's, soccer fields and more.

I decided to place this(and one other) cache since we were here for a Softball Tournament and realized the park didn't have any caches.

The kids and I picked this spot after some deliberation as to where the best place would be...while they were arguing about it, I placed it.

If you hunt this in July during Fiesta Days, parking will be more difficult.

That's not only the Boy Scout's motto, it should be the motto of every Geocacher too.

Be Prepared.

I wish I was more prepared when I went to hide this cache. I thought it would be an easy trip in and out since there is a nice trail to follow most of the way. I guess I should have brought the bug spray or at least put it on before hand. The mosquitoes were were feasting on me. The deer flies decided to get in on the act too and dive bombed me for a bit as I hiked in. Shorts and sandals weren't the best choice of attire either. It was pretty warm out and 1 bottle of water just didn't do the trick. It was silly of me to not be prepared.

When going on the hunt, you should always be prepared too. Do you have a cache bag with your &quot;tools&quot; in it? Is it fully stocked with the essentials? Are you prepared for anything when you go to make a find?

This cache will help you to decide if you really are prepared or not.

There is no reason to cross any private property, developed or not, to get to the cache.

The best parking is found at: N 42 22.254 W 88 15.507

This area is listed as a park in the Village of Johnsburg. It doesn't have much more than a small parking area and a nature trail into a woodsy area at this time. Per the village, once the subdivision to the south gets filled in more, this is supposed to have a tot lot or some other type of playground equipment.

You are searching for a container that is large enough to hold small trackables. It's best to bring your own writing utensil. There is a trail that takes you to another trail which takes you to GZ.

There is no reason to cross private property, developed or not, to find this cache.

Parking can be found at N 42 22.254 W 88 15.507

Please obey the posted 25 mph speed limit. There are kids in this neighborhood and we don't want to draw any unwanted attention from the homeowners in the area.

Permission to place this cache has been granted by the Village of Johnsburg Parks &amp; Recreation director and by the Johnsburg Police Department. </groundspeak:long_description>

caches in the container as well. If you place one of the two,
please credit this cache!&lt;br/&gt;

My thanks go out to my Mother who traded me this container for an
official Groundspeak Geocaching Bison Tube. I hope that
the bison tube works well for her first cache when she places
it!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Directions Help: Quick and easy exit and
re-entry to I-39/90 in both directions, but you will have to pay
toll to go South (Eastbound) and exiting North (Westbound). The
toll is $0.60 for non-I-Pass and $0.30 for I-Pass. Change and
I-Pass are the only thing accepted at the toll, No Attendant on
Duty. Drive and park on the paved lane but do not go North of the
Gate... No need to anyways... When making a turn back out onto IL
Route 173, be aware that the stoplight for this lane is not active.
Cross traffic does not stop.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Cache Information: Pretty straightforward
hide on an undeveloped plat of land. Container is a Cammoed
Rubbermaid &quot;Lock&amp;Lock&quot; type container. Some small trade items
are in the cache so while the adults trade trackables, the children
can trade swag.&lt;br/&gt;
I spotted a Deer Stand in a tree to the North in the treeline. It
looks like it faces Northwest on the other side of the treeline
from the lane but pay close attention to it anyways. Please do not
climb into it either. Please keep this cache concealed as best as
it can be!</groundspeak:long_description>

This park has a set of play equipment for the really little kids, 2 sand volleyball courts, a Basketball court, swings, play equipment for the bigger kids and is home to for the trainers of our local soccer club. These things may make hunting this cache a little more difficult during high muggle times. Each evening during soccer season, there will be multiple teams out here, so stealth will be needed. There is a less obvious way to get to this cache and the path doesn't show up well on the map, but it is the best way. Recommended parking in the large parking lot to the north. The tree canopy may play havoc with your GPS signal, so you may need to use geo-sense once in there.

The container is camo'd and has room for small tradables. Please re-hide the container as well or better than you found it.

It also has swings and play ground equip for the kids. Depending on when you hunt this cache, you may see the Kiddie Kickers practicing their soccer, the Boys playing Baseball, the girls either playing or practicing Softball or even the Lacrosse team out there.

You are looking for a small container that only contains a log, so make sure to bring a writing utensil. The thing that the cache is hidden in is a bit pokey, so you may want some gloves on when looking for it. There really isn't a need to untie the cache from its location, you can just screw the bottom off.

Legal parking is in the lot to the south...
N42 24.514 W88 14.097. Parking on the streets around the park isn't recommended, or legal.

This is the 4th in the series of &quot;Our Love of Labs&quot; caches. This cache is for the labs we have fostered over the years. Bob, our Velcro lab, was always at your side, Doc, a stretch for a lab, but he was Black, Bailey, 110 lbs. of pure pleasure, Hunter, our lover boy, he followed Tess (our chocolate lab) around like a love sick puppy, Ruger, was just a typical lab, Walker spent his life in an outdoor kennel, but he learned the pleasure of being a house lab very quickly, Shadow lived up to his name he was always behind you tripping you up whenever he could, and lastly Sirus aka &quot;Devil Dog&quot; he really lived up to that name. He was just a puppy and chewed on everything in site. When we took Sparky back (also one of our fosters) we decided our house was not big enough for 3 labs so we gave up fostering and also it got harder and harder to give them up because of course we are the perfect masters. 


This cache is on private property. Permission was given by the owner, Michael Kunkel, to place this cache. Please be respectful of his property.

This is the 6th in the series of &quot;Our Love of Labs&quot; caches. Oreo &amp; Zephyr's owner is kmhiker's hiking buddy. Oreo is a layed back lab who has one speed &quot;moderate&quot;. We lovingly decided that she was a state worker in a previous life. The only time she moves fast is if she picks up an interesting scent while out walking or if food is involved. Zephyr is a typical 4yr. old lab, full of boundless energy and loves to chase and play with all the other labs. They are members of what we like to call the &quot;Lab Pack&quot; Tess, Sparky, Oreo, Zephyr and the late Chico. 

Parking co-ordinates for this cache are N43 36.965 W088 11.931 If this lot is full you can park at Zillmer Trail where a state sticker is required. This is a busy area during hunting season so please wear the appropriate clothing (50% blaze orange).

Located in the Kettle Moraine, you are looking for a Camo covered plastic coffee container. This is the second in a series of 'Our love of Labs&quot; caches. We fostered Sparky for a lab rescue organization about 8 yrs ago and because the adopters could no longer keep him he was returned to us about 1 1/2 yrs ago and we decided to keep him. Sparky loves to wallow in mud puddles, we call him our resident mud duck. He can smell a mud puddle 100 yards away. We have planted this cache near his favorite puddle which we have renamed Lake Sparky and you will see why during the rainy season when you reach the parking co-ordinates. Parking co-ordinates are N43 37.890 W088 09.594 ish.

Located off the horse trail in the Kettle Moraine State Forest. Parking available on Division Rd. south of Hwy F at top of hill. 


This is the 5th cache in our series &quot;Our Love of Labs&quot;. Chico was the Senior Statesman of our lab pack. Cary would pick him up when he went hiking in the kettle moraine. This was his favorite area. As you approach GZ you will see an artesian well,Chico would jump in and splash round, summer, fall, winter, or spring, in he would go, so of course we renamed it CHICO'S BATHTUB. Chico left us in late spring for the Rainbow Bridge and he is sadly miss by his family and his good friend kmhiker.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Camping at Mauthe Lake with some caching newbies and their kids. After a trip to the Tower, I decided to introduce them to the great &quot;bakrdz&quot; of Hausehalter Lane and hit a few more caches and trails. The discovery at Chico's Bathtub was great! The kids had so much fun in the bathtub, the adults were forced to search for the cache. I let the others and Mrz. BakRdz do most of the searching. I spotted it from a bit of distance away. When Mrz was going to walk away from it I yelled to her to look at a certain spot. Ta-Da! She couldn't believe she missed it! Anyway, we cleaned up the kids after their &quot;baths&quot; and moved on to the next cache. By far our favorite discovery of the day. Thanks for bringing us here. Can see why it would be a favorite spot for dogs.

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia: Eyes are organs that detect light, and send
signals along the optic nerve to the visual and other areas of the
brain. The simplest &quot;eyes&quot;, in even unicellular organisms, do
nothing but detect whether the surroundings are light or dark. Eyes
are generally adapted to the environment and lifestyle of the
organism which bears them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know the human eye can see &lt;b&gt;10
Million Colors?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kid Friendly geocache in High Cliff State Park between the
Horse/Bike trail and the Family Campground. This cache is located
within High Cliff State Park, so you will need a park sticker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache can be accessed very easily from the Family Campground
area. It can also be accessed from the Horse/Bike trail but this is
much more of a hike from the nearest trail parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take the trail around the rock wall and do not climb over
it. There is a break in the wall and a trail going through that
will allow you to easily access where the cache is hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This regular sized cache contains many trade items for kids
(both boys and girls).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please re-hide the cache as you found it so that it is not
accidentally found by campers and hikers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permission for this cache was granted by Jay Vosters, HCSP
Geocaching Coordinator. The WI DNR Geocache Notification Form has
been submitted via mail to Jason Wiese, park manager of High Cliff
State Park. Geocaches placed on Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resource managed lands require permission by means of a
notification form. Please print out a paper copy of the
notification form, fill in all required information, then submit it
to the land manager. The DNR Notification form and land manager
information can be obtained at: visit
link&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This Cache is a KFC. KFC is a designation that stands for Kid
Friendly Cache. (not to be confused with a popular chicken place)
It is a movement to keep the young ones wanting to stay active in
geocaching. Kids love to trade so having a cache of decent trading
size is a must. Also kids minds are like sponges wanting to soak up
all the information that they can fit in their heads. With that in
mind, please leave a little bit of knowledge for them to learn
about the environment they are walking in. Look at it as a living
classroom. Topics can be of any variety such as Nature, Geology, or
History.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winter Friendliness Rating: Will get buried
in the snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations &lt;b&gt;labrat_wr and Zuma&lt;/b&gt; on the co-FTF!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;King Bergeronneau commissioned the excavation of a moat around
his castle. While the project was just getting underway, a major
causeway was built running through the Kings land from afar. This
interfered with the king's plans for a moat. Frustrated, the King
had a fence built around his un-finished project and a guard was
posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all that remains is a small watering hole along the road.
The fence is over-grown but if you look closely, you will see that
the Red-wing blackbirds now call this place their home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are passing by on US 41, Winneconne Ave Exit is your
easy-on, easy-off route to get to this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations &lt;b&gt;Sagasu&lt;/b&gt; on the FTF!&lt;/p&gt;

and sometimes never ever shared. With this series of Geocaches, I
am going to share many of my favorite onshore fishing spots with
you. These are all locations along waterways that I have spent many
hours fishing on. All of these spots bring back wonderful childhood
memories of biking to the park and fishing until (sometimes past)
supper time. Some of the spots still produce excellent off-shore
fishing opportunities so you may just want to bring along your
pole. I will also share what kinds of fish you might expect to
cache (I mean catch!) at these locations. I will leave it up to you
to choose the bait or lure! Can't share every secret....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will rarely see an empty shoreline here at the Neenah dam
(which may cause you some heartburn while geocaching here!) We used
to fish here for hours and hours catching all sorts of different
fish including perch, sunfish, walleye, and of course carp. I
remember when we used to get down below the bridge (not as easy now
with the hospital &amp; bridge reconstruction over the years) and
fish right bellow the spillway and walk in the water when it was
shallow. Enjoy the view, and perhaps the company of an on-shore
fisherman or 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish you may catch here include:&lt;br/&gt;
- Pumpkinseed (sunfish) &amp; Bluegill&lt;br/&gt;
- Perch&lt;br/&gt;
- Rock bass&lt;br/&gt;
- Walleye&lt;br/&gt;
- Sheepshead&lt;br/&gt;
- Carp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring a pen to log your find. This is also a city park
with plenty of parking in the lot and some picnic tables &amp;
benches if you are looking for a nice place to eat your lunch.
Please return the cache exactly as you found it so others will
enjoy the challenge and so the muggles don't take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winter Friendliness Rating: Findable in all

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith park is one of our favorite secrets. Little -cheeto- and I
have spent many mornings and evenings fishing on the nearby dock
and along this shoreline. The water is always calm when it's rough
elsewhere. There are always hungry rock bass and small mouth waitin
to be caught! As a teenager, I remember coming here and catching
over 100 rock bass under the nearby walk-bridges! Beware, you may
catch quite a few &lt;b&gt;weed&lt;/b&gt; bass here as well as some drift
&lt;b&gt;wood&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish you may catch here include:&lt;br/&gt;
- Bluegill&lt;br/&gt;
- Pumpkinseed (sunfish)&lt;br/&gt;
- Perch&lt;br/&gt;
- Rock bass&lt;br/&gt;
- Small Mouth Bass&lt;br/&gt;
- Large Mouth Bass&lt;br/&gt;
- White Bass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a Micro-sized container and you should bring
a pen to log your find. Please return the cache as you found it so
others will enjoy the hide.&lt;/p&gt;

I knew -cheeto- was eying up this dam spot too, so I called him in
on the set-up.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you've done any caching in the area, you will no doubt have seen
this crazy place. The former resident and dam tender, Joe
Wimberger, tended the dam for Fox River Paper for 15 years, taking
up position in 1992 and retiring this year, 2009. Joe had decorated
the property with his own dam art and was more than half the way
across the spillway with his metal works when his tour came to an
end. He had installed some interesting sculptures of various
mediums, mostly metal and wood outdoor pieces, but certainly no dam
plastic!.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The new Tender, Martin, is also an artist in various media. While
he has been tasked with removing Joe's art to prevent eaglets from
swallowing what they might mistake for a fish, he has no intention
of completely stripping and removing all the art. Some will get
relocated to the back of the premises and some will stay. Take some
time to look at what's left of Joe's dam art and perhaps some of
Martin's dam new art, to see if there is anything that appeals to
you.&lt;br/&gt;

3 or 4 caching teams may recognize the location, hide, and
container as I have turned a prior puzzle cache into a traditional
so others may enjoy the cache location.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You are looking for a camo'ed medicine container that's larger than
a micro. Please bring a pencil to sign the log. There is room for a
geocoin or small trackable as well as small swag items.&lt;br/&gt;

The villagers loved her dinners so much they encouraged her to set up a cookery for passersby as well. Hence, the banquet hall opened for weary knights to rest their bones while partaking of fabulous fare!

This should be a fairly easy find for the well traveled knights of Camelot. The cache is a nano, so be sure to bring a quill to scrawl your initials on the log. Gary Graefs property manager has granted permission for placement of cache.
