Funnily lady came up to me after I congratulated me on finding it. Apparently she has been watching people look around that area and decided to investigate herself, and wound up finding out all about it. Neat!

It was way awesome to actually get to do some geocaching while on my first Carnival Western Caribbean cruise. Although I really don't recommend this part of Belize, the cache was a great one to make my first international.  Cache was in good shape, and concealed it as I found it. Lots of muggles around, but that's to be expected in this area. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

What a good chat this started! He told me everything about Belizian history, that it was a british colony; that it's commonwealth, that we have the same queen! I did not know, and it was totally unexpected to have an english speaking country in the middle of latin america! What a clash! But that's it! The rest of Belize is looking moreover like expected - an adventurous place, where you can buy cheap fruits. Hmmm, had good papayas and bananas! That alone is worth coming here! The officer also told me about his family. He grew up further inside the country, in the mountains. His father had a farm, producing everything you need for living. But the farm is not enough for all the growing family, that's why he has to work here...

Good, let's check Belize City! Still a potential cache container in the pocket - prepared with everything - laminated cache note, log sheets etc. Walked through the streets, but did not yet find a good place ... keep trying - as some of the cachers note, would be good to have some outside the convict area...

Probably going on a reef snorkeling tour later on, before boarding the  Liberty of the Seas again, and resuming hard work convening at the SMEC 2011 meeting.

The Arkaroo, who loves the mountains and the waters.

military caches. Bring your running shoes or a bicycle, you might
want them, but not needed to find the cache. There is a marina and
several boat launches nearby as well!

&lt;p&gt;Wanted to place this one near the coast, but the choices were
limited by private property and British Petroleum. I couldn't even
get onto the Coast Guard base with ID, because of them. Thanks
guys, love ya!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I dedicate this, my final physical cache in Mississippi, to all
the fine men and women geocacher's on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. I
will not get to say farewell to many of you before I leave. But,
let it be known I will miss you all greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for making my last year in Biloxi memorable and
enjoyable. For this you deserve a &quot;Salute&quot; and a &quot;High
Five-Five.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Can you solve the Leprechaun's Limericks?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son and I went outside to play. It was a fine day for a geocache, I thought. We fought another Leftygator hide. We cruised by a previously found Biloxi Bay cache. Paddling for our dear life, we headed out to grab another Mitrustme cache. Starting our trek down the sound, the beach began to get longer and longer it seemed. Don't worry AFwingman, I left you enough beach to plant one more cache on this island. I dedicate the lower mile and a half to you. My eyes maybe started to play tricks on me. We passed shipwrecked boats galore. When finally, I saw a sight I almost didn't believe. Perched upon one of the dunes, a wee man danced wearing the garb of a merry green. He had a little orange beard snug around his face and nestled in the center was a pipe of Irish clay. When he saw us, he leaped a spry and yelled out, &quot;Fiddely diddely dee, catch and riddle me! Quick, or I'll be gone! Fiddely diddly dee, catch and riddle me! I'm a leprechaun!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quickly, he ran away, and was gone in seconds. I had heard stories of leprechauns when I was but a child. I had never considered it to be true, that was, until I saw the little man. My heart was a flutter and I raced after him. Over log, around a tree, stumble on the rock, dodge the thorn brush... farther along we raced. They say that if you catch a leprechaun, he'd grant you a wish, just to avoid giving you his gold. But, first you'd have to catch him, that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the leprechauns seemed to disappear whenever they are seen. They are masters of magic and tricksters beyond belief. You should approach them carefully. When I came onto a clearing, I saw that leprechaun, and I was determined to catch him. It was late, and it was getting dark outside. He was singing and dancing. When he saw me, he laughed and said, &quot;Fiddely diddely dee, catch and riddle me! Quick, or I'll be gone! Fiddely diddly dee, catch and riddle me! I'm a leprechaun!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I waited behind some trees for many hours. The leprechaun returned to the clearing. He lit a little campfire. He danced and sang his songs for a long time, until he finally fell asleep. When he was asleep, I slowly approached him. I went as close as I could, and then I threw myself against him. I caught him in my hands, and he woke up with a surprised look upon his little face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fiddely diddely dee, catch and riddle me! Quick, or I'll be gone! Fiddely diddly dee, catch and riddle me! I'm a leprechaun!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Riddles&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;**************************&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dozen a gross and a score,
Plus 3 times the square root of four,
Divided by seven,
Plus five times eleven,
Equals nine square and not a bit more.

(DIGITS AB)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a young lady of Lee,
Whose age had its last digit three.
If you total the two,
Which is easy to do,
One less than a square you will see.

(DIGITS CD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My age?&quot;, answered Barbara Blatt,
&quot;just keep it right under your hat.
Adding one to each figure,
Makes it nineteen years bigger,
Than half what it is. So what's that?&quot;

(DIGITS EF)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an old lady in Sheen,
Whose grandchildren numbered sixteen.
Four-ninths of the boys,
Were too old to want toys,
So how many girls must that mean?

(DIGIT G)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a fair maid in Rabat,
Who was plump, not excessively fat.
The square of her weight,
When divided by eight,
All in pounds was a cube. How was that?

(DIGITS HIJ)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said a feller out felling a tree
&quot;My age I've divided by three.
The result is a square,
Yet my age, I declare,
Is six times a cube, Glory be!&quot;

(DIGITS KL)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There once was a cube 'twas found 
Whose two digits, when switched clear around,
         Was the product (quite fair)
            Of a cube and a square,
   And its name will most surely astound.

(DIGITS MN)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Final Resting Spot of the Leprechaun’s Magical Treasure is:&lt;/h4&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The cache is not located at the posted coordinates, but the leprechaun will point the way once you have caught and riddled him.You will need a boat, water shoes, plenty of water, rations, sunscreen, bug spray, and a cell phone wouldn't hurt either to do this cache.Depending on how you approach this cache, it can be a 1 hour or 5 hour excursion.Regardless of your method, you will experience deep water, potentially deep mud or marshy areas, tall foliage, bugs, sand, and heat.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

nonvenomous and others are not so nice to play with. Check the
associated website to brush up on your native snakes. Then go out
to the parks and woods of Mississippi and enjoy yourself&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cache you are looking for is bison tube sized. It is located
near a little fishing spot in Shepard State Park. The park asks a
meager $3.00 admission fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are boat launches, barbecue grills, picnic tables, and a
small playground for you to enjoy. The location I chose is far back
so you should not be bothered by anyone. It is an easy walk across
the usual grass and leafy terrain. You will not have to go trail
hiking to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by R. Causer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Naviguessers for FTF&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most dangerous moment in any story is at the beginning. From
the first moment, every ending is equally possible, every path
untraveled, every question not only unanswered, but unasked. The
unread story is infinite in possibility. Yet the ending is already
written, and though you are clever, there is no outwitting it. Are
you brave enough to begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, move onto waypoint 1. If not, remain safe, turn away from
this GeoQuest. No one will think any less of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 1 – The Clearing N 30° 23.983’ W 088°
47.690’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You find yourself standing in the middle of a partially cleared
grove. It teems with all the birds of the air, and all of the
creatures of the Earth, and every good thing that grows. As you
explore, you feel an incredible sense of peace and rightness, as if
the clearing had been created just for you. This is the place you
belong. Still, you feel restless like someone is calling to you
from the distance. You begin to explore your surroundings. At the
western edge of the clearing, there is a path which you stand near
now. Do you follow the path?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If yes, continue to Waypoint 2. If no, continue to Waypoint
3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 2 - Ranger Office N 30° 23.869 W 088° 47.737&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathways are meant to be followed, and you would never truly be
content if you did not know what lay at the end. You come up to
what appears to be a Park Ranger office. The door is locked. You
begin to pace back and forth wondering what you should do. You look
to the east and you see the path fading into the dark forest. You
hesitate for a moment and look back. The forest stretches behind
you as if the clearing had never been. You rub your eyes and face
back to the ranger station, but all you see is a small man with
pigeon toes standing before you. He is kind of comical looking. He
is wearing a peaked red hat, a pair of blue pants, and birch shoes.
Around his waist is a belt with a tool kit attached. It holds a
knife, a hammer, etc. He proudly beams at you with his rosy red
cheeks puffing out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Welcome Ranger,” he calls out, temporarily
forgetting himself. He beckons you to lean closer to him. You lean
down to the tiny man and he begins to whisper in your ear. He tells
you of a bayou king who seeks to poison the woods and create
something called a shopping mall. He tells you that you have been
chosen to amass the denizens of the woods into a powerful army and
stop this menace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you listen to the jabbering fool, the shadows deepen. An owl
calls. Something cries out in the distance and is quickly silenced
in mid-shrill. The man has disappeared from sight as if he were
never there. You crave sleep; a brief rest to clear your mind. Do
you close your eyes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If yes, continue to waypoint 3. If not, continue to waypoint
4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 3 – Alternate Route N 29° 57.367’ W 90°
04.150’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You close your eyes, and drift into sleep. When you awaken, you
are feeling greatly refreshed. You push aside the overstuffed
comforter and prepare to head down to the continental breakfast
bar. The previous events were a dream. You spend your life trying
to return to the clearing with the winding path in the dark forest.
You never will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STOP, go back to Waypoint 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 4 - The Gateway N 30° 23.875’ W 088°
47.586’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You scrub your hands across your eyes and push yourself back to
your feet. You brush the dust from your clothing. Things are really
weird right now and where did these Sherwood Forest clothes come
from? You sigh and begin to follow the path that takes you on a
short, downhill curve, and winds around to a crossroads. A signpost
stands before you and in a vision you see the land stretch out
before you. It is as though you have seen all the trails of the
forest before. You make mental note of your intended paths and
continue on your journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) Record the number of trails______&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to waypoint 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 5 – Feathered Fishers N 30° 23.713’ W 088°
47.A04’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You begin to follow what you think is the correct direction.
Soon, you begin to feel lost. You grow chilled, and your feet
develop a talent for finding uneven spots on the ground, tree
roots, and rocks. After the third time you fall, you lean against
the very tree whose roots last tangled your feet. The bark prickles
and rubs against your back, but it is a welcome distraction from
your bruised knees and skinned palms. Your bones are weary and your
muscles ache. The voice of the little man returns to your head.
“Ranger there is strong magic in these woods. Do not ignore
your geosenses. The mark you seek is the number of trails plus one,
so to speak.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you arrive, you must rally together the creatures you meet.
Their numbers will be important in the fight against the Bayou
King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B) Record the number of different animals who join your army
_____&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to Waypoint 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 6 N 30° 23.732’ W 088° 47.513’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You follow the birds back to the main path in the forest.
Despite their advantage, your fleet feet keep up with them. When
you arrive at your next destination, the birds circle in the air.
They fear the gators of the bayou. The gators are languishing in
the sun. You chastise them. “Gators of the bayou, don’t
you know the bane of the Bayou King affects you too!” Calmly
they reply, “Settle your tongue, Ranger. We do not ignore the
impending threat, but instead prepare for battle. We recharge the
magical energies of our armor in the sun for the upcoming epic
battle.” Humbly, you apologize and accept the solar
collecting armor they offer you. They also ask that you take some
to their brothers deeper in the forest. You bid them god speed on
their arrival to the final battle. As you begin your way to the
next rallying point, you turn the armor over in your hand and feel
its smooth, strong texture. Purely out of habit, you count the
letters in the name of the armor and tuck it away in your
rucksack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C) Record the number of letters in the name of the solar
collectors _____&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to Waypoint 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 7 – Salt Marsh Nursery N 30° 23.8C9’ W
088° 47.73B’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you begin to approach the next village, you see the battle
has already begun. The denizens of the forest are in a heated
battle and cannot return to their fortifications. You will need to
use the solar collectors (C) and the combined strength of the
Feathered Fishers (B) to repel the Bayou King’s forces into
retreat. The tiny animals assure you they are small, but pack a
mean punch. Your numbers continue to grow stronger and you begin to
feel more confident about the upcoming battle against the Bayou
King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D) Record the number of new recruits to your army _____&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to Waypoint 8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 8 – Life in a Gator Pond N 30° 23.876’ W
088° 47.406’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group of warriors is easy to find as they quickly swim
across the pond to you. You see many are already decked out in
their battle gear. You nod in approval and welcome the new recruits
and cross back onto the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E) Record the number of new recruits to your army _____&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to waypoint 9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 9 – Bustling with Life N 30° 23.844’ W
088° 47.40D’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you come up on this busy little village, a busy little possum
scampers up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia says, “Hail Ranger, checking in with the morning
report…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprised by the display, you stammer, “Shoot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well the buzz from the bees is that the leopards are in a
bit of a spot. And the baboons are going ape over this. Of course,
the giraffes are acting like they're above it all... The tick birds
are pecking on the elephants. I told the elephants to forget it,
but they can't. The cheetahs are hard up, but I always say,
cheetahs never prosper...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this possum has been watching too much television.
You cut him off with a wave of the hand and ask the animals of the
village to join in your cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F) Record the number of new recruits to your army _____&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to Waypoint 10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 10 – Absorbing the Punch N 30° 23.82C’ W
088° 4F.428’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The air is crisp here. You feel refreshed by the smell. The moon
paints the trees in a silver glow and lights your path. You hear
music coming from just ahead. It is so beautiful, you wonder if you
are dreaming once again. The pound of the drum speeds the pulse of
your heart and the skirl of the bagpipes pulls your feet through
the night. As you race forward, you recognize the lugubrious and
harsh sound of the carnyx. A battle rages on ahead. By the time you
reach the standing stones, you are nearly dancing down the path to
the beat of the magical instruments. Inside the ring of stones, the
dancers spin and leap, a bright chaos of form and shape, carried
along by an exultation of song. But, a closer look shows the mighty
woodland elves engaged in mortal combat with the evil forces of the
Bayou King. As it seems the battle is won for the elves, a great
eye opens in the sky above. The Bayou King has been scrying from a
distance. A fury of wind and rain come forth from the nothingness.
You climb the ladder of a nearby guard tower to assess the
situation better. Grasping the support beams strongly, you look up
to see a thunderous bolt of force approaching you. You have no time
to react. The tower is splintered and thrown from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G) If you were standing on the observation tower, the distance
you were thrown is _____ feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retreat quickly to Waypoint 11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 11 – Elvin Command Post N 30° 23.F81’ W
088° 47.3C2’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly, you race down the trail looking for a place to recover.
The Bayou King, obviously, is much more dangerous than you may have
thought. You start to second guess your abilities. Why did you ever
listen to that silly little man? You have this weird feeling that
you should be off somewhere enjoying a nice bratwurst. You shake
the cobwebs from your head and you come up to what appears to be a
command post of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you can make any further assessment, you hear a voice
shout out “Halt! State the code!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baffled, you look around and yell out the number from the sign
marker. You realize that couldn’t possibly be the pass code
to an Elvin Command Post and expect your last visions on earth to
be a thunderstorm of Elvin fletching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guard calmly calls out, “Approach and state your
business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, elves are not as intelligent as the Lord of the Rings
movies would have you believe. After the initial pleasantries, the
elf tells you the stock of rations on the lines are growing thin.
He asks you to journey forward to see what is holding up the supply
train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H) Record the pass code here ________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to Waypoint 12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 12 – Treant of Many Names N 30° 23.84H’ W
088° 4F.312’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you journey forth searching for the supply caravan, you hear
a sound that is almost mumbling intermixed with the rustling of
leaves. You dismiss it as just the wind passing through the
branches of the strange tree to your right. As you continue on, you
are stopped in your tracks, literally. One of the large vines of
the tree reaches out and wraps itself around your arm. You begin to
shriek, but quickly calm yourself so as not to embarrass yourself
in front of anyone who may be nearby. You look back at the tree and
realize the mumbling was the tree trying to say something to
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Lbhat enatre, qb abg srne zr! V nz na nyyl va gur onggyr

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having resolved the situation, you are glad you stopped. But,
onward you must continue to find the missing supply train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I) Enter the key that binds here ____&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to Waypoint 13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 13 – Restocking the Pantries N 30° 23.C21’
W 088° 4F.2B0’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After emerging from the forest into another clearing, you see a
couple animals here arguing around many boxes of cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stop, animals of the bayou! Why do you argue? We have a
battle to wage, don’t you know!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Aye, ranger. But the tides are fluctuating by the
moment,” says the Herons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Egrets chime in, “Yes and we can’t all harvest
at the same time and our timing is out of wack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You ponder this for a moment, then the Fiddler Crab pipes up,
“I could care less about their problems. All I want is for
them to stop trying to eat me while I am harvesting the
crops!” Realizing that there is no easy answer to their
problem, you ask them to set their differences aside and help the
crab harvest and carry the vegetation to where it is needed. Once
the Bayou King has been defeated, normalcy will return to the
bayou. The birds nod in agreement and the crab wipes the sweat from
his brow with his oversized claw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to Waypoint 14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 14 – Hide and Seek N 30° 23.E2F’ W 088°
47.483’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you venture across the forest, you can almost see the eerie
glow rising from the Halls of the Bayou King in the distance. You
continue down the trail and you feel as though thousands of eyes
are set upon you. You crouch down and ready an arrow in your bow.
Peering from left to right, you begin to see entire platoons of
animals fortified among the foliage and rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You relax your draw on your bow and call out to the animals,
“It is only I, the Ranger. Rally to me troops and we will
march forward to victory!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J) Record the number of new recruits to your army _____&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to Waypoint 15&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waypoint 15 – Life of a Salt Marsh N 30° 23.D3B’ W
088° 47.4F8’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now stand on the edge of what might be your last stand. You
and the Armies of the Salt Marsh stand assembled on the docks,
ready to charge. All of the animals you have met along your journey
and several more have joined the cause. Some look a little more
afraid than others, but you know all are fearful of the upcoming
battle. You realize you must rally them to the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sons of the forest, I am the Ranger!” you boast
proudly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A young otter whimpers, “The Ranger is 7 feet
tall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You reply, “Yes, I've heard. Eats burgers by the hundreds,
and if he were here he'd consume the mall bringers with fireballs
from his eyes and bolts of lightning from his fingertips. I AM the
Ranger. And I see a whole army of warriors here in defiance of
corporate tyranny. You have come to fight as free beasts, and free
animals you are. What would you do without freedom? Will you
fight?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animals look warily at each other and a snail questions
back, “Fight? Fight against the Bayou King and the mall
bringers? No, we cannot win. We will run and we will
live.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You counter, “Aye, fight and you may die. Run and you'll
live -- at least a while. And dying in your nests and burrows many
years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from
this day to that for one chance, just one chance to come back here
and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll
never take our freedom!!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animals stand in silence and think. Then one calls out
“Trbpnpuvat sberire!” The others pick up the call and
the chant becomes fever pitched, “Trbpnpuvat sberire!
Trbpnpuvat sberire! Trbpnpuvat sberire!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue to the Final Waypoint&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final –Storm the Halls of the Bayou King N G°
23.DI’ W 088° 4F.4AJ’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You thrust open the doors with your army at your back. The haze
of fury clouds your vision as you enter the dark, dank halls. You
thrust your bow gripped tightly by your bloodied fist into the air
and let loose a battle-cry. As you turn to march down the corridors
looking for the final confrontation, you notice a kindly old woman
staring at you in admiration and amazement. The Bayou King has
retreated from his fortress and the magic has left the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are victorious today, but you have a feeling this is not the
last you will see of the Bayou King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You wipe the sweat from your brow and ask the lady where you can
find the local bard. She looks at you in amusement and you think
maybe she doesn’t understand you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where can I record my visit and exploits in this glorious
bayou,” you briskly rephrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She gestures to her right, a log book sprawled out waiting for
you. You record your name amongst the log of heroes for the

&lt;p&gt;Clayjar gave it a a 3 terrain rating because of heavy
overgrowth. I left it that way, because the sign I passed on the
way to the site said there may be &quot;snakes&quot; and &quot;alligators&quot; nearby.
Honestly though... is there many places in the southeast that don't
have this present?&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

39530&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container you seek is a short walk, in visual distance, of
this historic site.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though the Old Brick House, located in Biloxi, Mississippi
was damaged during hurricane Katrina, it is still standing and
people are allowed to visit it during the week. The house, which
was saved from destruction by the Ladies' Garden Club of Biloxi,
serves as a reminder of the way people lived in Biloxi during the
later 1700's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house is used as a museum and as a community center for a
variety of activities. While the house may have been damaged by
fierce winds and water, its structure is sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When visiting Biloxi, you may find many buildings and other
attractions still recovering from the hurricane. Because the Old
Brick House is only a few feet from Back Bay, it was not shielded
by much during the storms. When visiting the Old Brick House, you
will be able to see first hand how well the structure was
constructed. If you want to learn more about the building and the
time in which it was built, you should visit the museum to view
pictures, documents, and talk with the staff that is very
knowledgeable about the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those visiting Biloxi, you will be able to see many old
buildings and structures that are now used as museums and other
functions. These buildings are being preserved by town as a way to
tell others the story of Biloxi. Take advantage of these small
museums as you will learn much about the area, the people, and who
they say &quot;saw the future.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
A Norwegian Tale
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Once upon a time there were three billy goats, who were to go up to
the hillside to make themselves fat, and the name of all three was
&quot;Gruff.&quot;
&lt;p&gt;On the way up was a bridge over a cascading stream they had to
cross; and under the bridge lived a great ugly troll , with eyes as
big as saucers, and a nose as long as a poker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first of all came the youngest Billy Goat Gruff to cross the
bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Trip, trap, trip, trap! &quot; went the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who's that tripping over my bridge?&quot; roared the troll .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, it is only I, the tiniest Billy Goat Gruff , and I'm going
up to the hillside to make myself fat,&quot; said the billy goat, with
such a small voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now, I'm coming to gobble you up,&quot; said the troll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, no! pray don't take me. I'm too little, that I am,&quot; said
the billy goat. &quot;Wait a bit till the second Billy Goat Gruff comes.
He's much bigger.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, be off with you,&quot; said the troll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little while after came the second Billy Goat Gruff to cross
the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap, went the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who's that tripping over my bridge?&quot; roared the troll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, it's the second Billy Goat Gruff , and I'm going up to the
hillside to make myself fat,&quot; said the billy goat, who hadn't such
a small voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now I'm coming to gobble you up,&quot; said the troll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, no! Don't take me. Wait a little till the big Billy Goat
Gruff comes. He's much bigger.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Very well! Be off with you,&quot; said the troll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just then up came the big Billy Goat Gruff .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap! went the bridge, for the
billy goat was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under
him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who's that tramping over my bridge?&quot; roared the troll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's I! The big Billy Goat Gruff ,&quot; said the billy goat, who
had an ugly hoarse voice of his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now I 'm coming to gobble you up,&quot; roared the troll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, come along! I've got two spears,&lt;br /&gt;
And I'll poke your eyeballs out at your ears;&lt;br /&gt;
I've got besides two curling-stones,&lt;br /&gt;
And I'll crush you to bits, body and bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was what the big billy goat said. And then he flew at the
troll, and poked his eyes out with his horns, and crushed him to
bits, body and bones, and tossed him out into the cascade, and
after that he went up to the hillside. There the billy goats got so
fat they were scarcely able to walk home again. And if the fat
hasn't fallen off them, why, they're still fat; and so,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snip, snap, snout.&lt;br /&gt;
This tale's told out.&lt;/p&gt;

I had been saving this one for my #300 milestone. I brought the whole iJEEP family out for this one and we were not disappointed.

I walked a little further than necessary for stage #1. The path I was on seemed to circle it without ever getting any closer, so we backtracked and found a better way in. When I got to stage #1, I wasn't so much worried about how the retrieve it as I was how to put it back. Luckily my wife had something that did the trick nicely.

We went straight to stage #2, no problem. I sent my 7-yr old after it. She could reach it, but couldn't quite retrieve it. I had to go after it. Then we stopped nearby for a bite of lunch.

I looked at the topo on my GPSr and the tracks that I had plotted for other caches I found around here and had a good idea where we were. I probably did not take the trail intended to get the cache, but it worked just fine all the same.

We got the cache and traded TBs. My girls were troopers the whole way. Thanks David for contributing to the fun of this milestone....

I took a couple of wrong turns along the way. Once because I didn't listen to my instincts and once because I did. Anyway, I got there in the end.

Lots and lots of tracks on the trail (deer, turkey, and 'coon). Saw a couple deer on one of my wrong turns. I bushwacked to their bedding area.

Later, I heard a big crashing sound that I HOPE was a dear! My dog looked a little worried too. 

SL. Dropped a GC.com geocoin.

Thanks for the adventure. (Off to grab End of the Trail)</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder who this cache made angry?!?!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ancient people of different civilizations had Gods or
Goddess and worship this phenomenon. Many of them believed that
thunder was the primary and lightning the secondary. We have come
to see it the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Greek, Zeus is the supreme ruler. He was Lord of the Sky,
the Rain-god and the Cloud-gatherer, who wielded the awful
thunder-bolt. The Greeks worshipped him because rain was an
important necessity for agriculture, but feared his random
lightning strikes.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Romans had the same god except he was called Jupiter.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Norse the god is Thor. Thor controls the sky, thunder and
lightning.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Japanese has a god whose name is Susanowo. This is a
spiteful storm god of Shinto belief. He was God of tempest. Instead
of looking after the oceans, Susanowo just hung around in heaven
and on earth, causing trouble wherever he went. He uprooted trees,
destroyed rice paddies, and knocked down buildings. Some believe he
and his powerful storms are still causing mischief on earth.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Egyptian god is Set also known as Seth. He is lord of the
desert and god of storms, confusion, and destruction.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Aztec had a god named Tlaloc. This fearsome god was the
bringer not only of beneficial rain but of storms, killing
lightning bolts, flood, and disease.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Babylonian they have Enlil. A god of the wind. Enlil acted
as Anu's enforcer, destroying mortal cities that refuses to pay
tribute and enemies with lightning, hurricanes, and
tornadoes.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;India has a god of storms and warriors. His name is
Indra.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persians god is Vayu. He is god of the winds. Vayu controls the
winds, storms and lightning.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Brule Sioux Indians god is Wakinyan Tanka. The great
Thunderbird. There are also four large, old Thunderbirds, one for
each direction - north, east, south, west. They are wrapped in
robes of dark clouds. Their symbol is the zigzag lightning, forked
at the ends. If you lie, the Wakinyan will kill you with their
lightning bolts. so the Sioux believe the thunderbirds stand for
rain, fire, and the truth.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Miwok Indians believe that whenever the fawn girls known as
Thunders, ran around in the sky they made rain and hail fall. The
sound of thunder was made from the two fawn girls running with the
dried bear skin who tried to eat them. The pieces of skin crackled
loudly to make thunder.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basilosaurus are one of the most common of the primitive whales,
called &quot;archaeocetes&quot; by paleontologists. The bones of Basilosaurus
cetoides (Owen) and other primitive whales have been found
throughout a belt across Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1981, Mississippi Senate Current Resolution No. 557
designated &quot;the prehistoric whale&quot;, both Basilosaurus cetoides
(Owen) and Zygorhiza kochii (Riechenbach), as the official fossil
of Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alabama designated Basilosaurus cetoides (Zeuglodon) as the
official state fossil in 1984. Fossil remains of this prehistoric
whale were first found in Clarke County about 1833 and later
discovered in Choctaw and Washington Counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A complete skeleton of a basilosaur (which means &quot;king of the
lizards&quot;) was found on a plantation in southwestern Alabama in 1834
which was determined after study to be a meat - eating member of
the whale family, not a lizard. For this reason it was renamed the
zeuglodon (Genus Basilosaurus). They estimated this fossil to be
over forty - five million years old (Eocene period). Zeuglodons
averaged from 55 to 75 feet long with tails up to 40 feet long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ancient whale fossils are most abundant in Alabama and
many zeuglodon skeletons have been found there (fossil remains of
Basilosaurus cetoides may not be removed from the state without
prior written approval from the governor). The two most complete
Basilosaurus cetoides skeletons ever found are from Alabama - one
is displayed at the McWane Center in Birmingham and the other in
the Smithsonian Institutute in Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache you are looking for maybe one of these
Basilosaurus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to the dynamic duo of Biloxi Bay and Leftygator
for the FTF!&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

The river and its tributaries drain most of the City of Mobile, Alabama and serve as important recreational waterways and food sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dog River is greatly affected by upstream waters that flow into the river from Mobile City and County, Alabama. Dog River is approximately 7 miles long, located on the northwest side of Mobile Bay. Mobile Bay, the sixth largest watershed in the nation, flows into the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sixty percent of the Dog River watershed is located within the City of Mobile. Forty percent is located in Mobile County, Alabama. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sources of Water: Where does the water in Dog River come from?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upstream&lt;br/&gt;When it rains in the Dog River Watershed, rainfall meanders downhill into storm drains, low spots, creeks and streams, in search of the lowest spot. Every time it rains, all these sources contribute water to Dog River and its tributaries. Mobile, Alabama is often listed as the U.S. city with the greatest rainfall per year, around 64 inches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Downstream: Mobile Bay&lt;br/&gt;Dog River drains into Mobile Bay which drains into the Gulf of Mexico. Mobile Bay is tidally influenced so water enters Dog River through Mobile Bay as the tides change. Check the tides at need best site to link for tide info.</groundspeak:long_description>

It also happens to be a major bicycle drop (hence the name).  This cache can be found on foot, but you'll be walking for awhile.  So dust off the old bicycle and come check out the trail system.  You will be looking for a  Decon container.  The terrain rating is really so high just because the cache is so far away from parking.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF prize is a set us unused trackable dog tags.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also it would be awesome if I could get some pics of people going off the drop.</groundspeak:long_description>

He's my number one suspect in the&lt;br /&gt;picnic basket disappearances. As bears go, he can be very&lt;br /&gt;annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WC and&lt;br /&gt;Cricket:&lt;/b&gt;  So, we take it you have issues with bears, Mr.&lt;br /&gt;Ranger, Sir?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ranger&lt;br /&gt;Smith:&lt;/b&gt;  No, and &lt;i&gt;don't call me that!  &lt;/i&gt; I&lt;br /&gt;like bears, and for the most part, bears are good.  But Yogi&lt;br /&gt;is a real puzzle for me.   This whole conundrum isn't&lt;br /&gt;about bears, it's about &lt;i&gt;Yogi,&lt;/i&gt; and nothing&lt;br /&gt;else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WC and&lt;br /&gt;Cricket:&lt;/b&gt;  How so, Mr. Ranger, Sir? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ranger&lt;br /&gt;Smith: &lt;/b&gt;  I really wish you wouldn't call me&lt;br /&gt;that.  It's almost as annoying as Yogi always referring to&lt;br /&gt;picnic baskets as &quot;pic-a-nic&quot; baskets.  It grates on my&lt;br /&gt;nerves.  As I said, bears are fine, but Yogi is a&lt;br /&gt;mystery.  He annoys me on purpose, hangs out with Boo-Boo, his&lt;br /&gt;partner-in-crime, and nabs unwatched picnic baskets at every&lt;br /&gt;opportunity.  I'm sure he's behind this string of&lt;br /&gt;disappearances.  As I said, I'm not puzzled by his bear-ness,&lt;br /&gt;only by his Yogi-ness.  If I could trade out the Yogi part,&lt;br /&gt;I'd keep the bear part. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WC and&lt;br /&gt;Cricket: &lt;/b&gt; Let's see if we have this straight, okay? &lt;br /&gt;You think Yogi and Boo Boo have a criminal&lt;br /&gt;mentality?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ranger&lt;br /&gt;Smith:&lt;/b&gt; Not exactly.  We had a bear-analyst examine them a&lt;br /&gt;few years ago,  and she reported that Boo Boo had a good&lt;br /&gt;character, but was an unwitting victim of Yogi's influence. &lt;br /&gt;She pegged Yogi's problem as being selfish.  &quot;Me, me , me&quot; is&lt;br /&gt;what he's all about.  From Yogi's standpoint, it's all about&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I, I, I&quot;, of course.  Yogi would be much less of a puzzle if&lt;br /&gt;he would do away with the &quot;I&quot; aspect, and be more&lt;br /&gt;community-minded. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;WC and&lt;br /&gt;Cricket:&lt;/b&gt; Thank you so much for visiting with us.  By the&lt;br /&gt;way, would you mind validating our parking, Mr. Ranger,&lt;br /&gt;Sir?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ranger&lt;br /&gt;Smith:&lt;/b&gt; DON'T CALL ME THAT! &lt;br /&gt;ARRRGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Helpful&lt;br /&gt;Suggestions For Seeking This Cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.&lt;br /&gt;Don't try to recover it between the hours of 7AM-9AM, or&lt;br /&gt;4PM-6PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2.

The premise of his&lt;br /&gt;dissertation was that large, significant numbers, when compressed&lt;br /&gt;and combined into a single value, could reveal the &quot;core essence&quot;&lt;br /&gt;of the original numbers.  He tried numerous methods of finding&lt;br /&gt;the single value of a series of large, significant numbers, and he&lt;br /&gt;declared that only the &quot;Humdinger Method&quot;, as he termed this&lt;br /&gt;process, would reveal the true &quot;core essence&quot; of any series of&lt;br /&gt;significant numbers.  Humdinger had sought the same solution&lt;br /&gt;in his earlier master's thesis, in which he discounted using the&lt;br /&gt;&quot;sum of all digits&quot; method, claiming he had trouble distinguishing&lt;br /&gt;between even and odd numbers, due to being raised in a family where&lt;br /&gt;all numbers were viewed as equal. Humdinger's thesis conclusion was&lt;br /&gt;that &quot;numbers are wacky and lots of fun&quot;.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humdinger's dissertation further raised&lt;br /&gt;eyebrows in the world of mathematics when he found that all&lt;br /&gt;mathematical operators, save one, were unnecessary.  &lt;br /&gt;Humdinger's dissertation committee, chaired by Prof. Wilhelm D.&lt;br /&gt;Wotacrok, tried in vain to discredit Humdinger's doctoral treatise,&lt;br /&gt;but found they could not argue with the conclusion of Humdinger's&lt;br /&gt;work, which was &quot;Numbers are fun, they make me&lt;br /&gt;giggle.&quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humdinger's dissertation was accepted by&lt;br /&gt;the committee, but he never received his doctorate.  During&lt;br /&gt;his oral defense, Humdinger insisted all questions be asked in Pig&lt;br /&gt;Latin.  The committee complied with his request, and this was&lt;br /&gt;Humdinger's downfall.  Dr. Emil Woopsy's pronounced accent&lt;br /&gt;caused Humdinger to misinterpret the question &quot;Explain the&lt;br /&gt;compression of large, significant numbers into a single value in&lt;br /&gt;terms of its effects upon mathematicians who still use the&lt;br /&gt;operators you have discarded.&quot;.  Humdinger interpreted this&lt;br /&gt;question from the original Pig Latin to mean &quot;Can you dance like a&lt;br /&gt;frog in a cyclone?&quot;. Humdinger repeated the question as he&lt;br /&gt;understood it, and against the objections of his committee, &lt;br /&gt;began trying to dance.  Dr. Woopsy, an avid fan of ballroom&lt;br /&gt;dancing, took this as a personal affront.  Humdinger failed&lt;br /&gt;his oral defense, and was dismissed from the&lt;br /&gt;program.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humdinger disappeared from the world of&lt;br /&gt;academics.  He spent years trying to interest elevator&lt;br /&gt;companies in a new numbering system for the floors on&lt;br /&gt;elevators.  Not surprisingly, the elevator manufacturers were&lt;br /&gt;not interested in a numbering system that replaced the digits &quot;6&quot;&lt;br /&gt;and &quot;2&quot; with the word &quot;Guess!&quot;.   He later found&lt;br /&gt;profitable and satisfying work writing the fine print on bank&lt;br /&gt;loans, and passed away in&lt;br /&gt;1982.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click To Rate This Cache&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: PA17RER - A&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Utility pole with large oval tag.

This modest five and dime store eventually&lt;br /&gt;became the marketing megalith we know today as K-Mart.  &lt;br /&gt;Fans of K-Mart will remember the frequent &quot;Blue Light Specials&quot;&lt;br /&gt;that indicated a product had just become less&lt;br /&gt;expensive.   &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;In keeping with the idea that a Blue Light&lt;br /&gt;Special means a less costly product, this cache is a Blue Light&lt;br /&gt;Special.  It's  the least costly cache I've ever hidden,&lt;br /&gt;and the product you find there, especially the color scheme, might&lt;br /&gt;be considered to be consistent with a discount product.  The&lt;br /&gt;cache container is not maroon, and not maroon and white. The&lt;br /&gt;container is full blossom discount&lt;br /&gt;colors.   &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ADDITIONAL LOGGING REQUIREMENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additional&lt;br /&gt;Logging Requirement 1:   This log may be signed&lt;br /&gt;only in the night time. During Daylight Savings Time, that is&lt;br /&gt;usually between 9:00 PM and 6:00 AM.  During Standard Time,&lt;br /&gt;that is usually between 5:30 PM and 6:30 AM.  A good rule of&lt;br /&gt;thumb is this:  If you have to have your headlights on to&lt;br /&gt;drive legally, then it's dark enough to find this&lt;br /&gt;cache.   &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additional Logging Requirement&lt;br /&gt;2: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You must drop me an email telling me why this cache was so easy to&lt;br /&gt;find.  It will be obvious once you have met Additional Logging&lt;br /&gt;Requirement 1.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOW TO FIND THE CACHE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Again, in keeping with the  discount nature&lt;br /&gt;of this cache, very little effort has been put into constructing&lt;br /&gt;the puzzle.  Convert the 1899 date into ABCD, and the correct&lt;br /&gt;coordinates will be 33 26.C36    0BB&lt;br /&gt;47.402.    Yes, it's too easy.  But, isn't that&lt;br /&gt;how a Blue Light Special should&lt;br /&gt;be?   &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: BL1DZ6T - Final location&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

It will be interesting to come back one night to see what is different with this cache in the dark. Don't know how long that will be until I have a reason to be in Starkville at night. Hopefully it is still around when that finally happens.

Once that was done, we headed to the final where Searching4Fun made a fairly quick find for Team JOS. Thanks for the cache and the history.

Enjoyed the first stage and its surrounding items. Now if I could just figure out how a tick was lurking on the brick wall and climbed onto my hand while I was making the calculations to get to the second stage.

The USA geocoin was not in the cache when I got there, so I ain't the one that lost it this time.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I teamed up with ADS1 this morning for an attack on the puzzle caches in town. We knocked off a couple, then started on this one. We had deciphered the first part with no problem, but the next part was giving us fits. We were actually on the right path to solving the last portion, but there was a little trick I had never heard of. A call to 1-800-PUSH gave me the hint of this new fangled cipher. Using the fine taxpayers computer (read low bid) from the dark ages in ADS1's office, I finally got the last part of the puzzle together. We set out to find the locations we needed only to realize there was more of a puzzle than answer at each location. Gathering the possible answers we moved on. Push arrived at the third one to heckle, er help us.  [:D] We quickly gathered the info at the other two locations and with a few quick calculations moved on to the final. My GPS was doing its usual lying act, but I noticed ADS1 acting a little strange and quickly figured he had the container in  his hand.  [}:)] S/L at 11:40 and retired to the Super Secret Mafia Event [;)]  for a fine meal of extra fat hamburgers, brats, Mrs. GoGlo's fine potato salad, chips and an overrated Smith County watermelon. Now I'm wondering if that meat came from a fine fat cow or some rejected animal at the MSU research farm. [:O]</groundspeak:text>

Lewis, the author of so many great Christian books, as well as&lt;br /&gt;classics such as the Chronicles Of Narnia.   It was&lt;br /&gt;Tolkien who led Lewis to accept the Christian faith while they&lt;br /&gt;taught together at Oxford University.   &lt;i&gt;(Note for Ole&lt;br /&gt;Miss graduates: &quot;Oxford University&quot; is not the same as &quot;Ole&lt;br /&gt;Miss&quot;.   They're not even in the same&lt;br /&gt;county.)&lt;/i&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tolkien loved codes and ciphers, and spent much of&lt;br /&gt;his boyhood developing new languages.  Tolkien specialized in&lt;br /&gt;Old English and Middle English at Oxford, and was a member of the&lt;br /&gt;Coal Biters Club.  The Coal Biters met regularly at Oxford,&lt;br /&gt;smoked their pipes, and read to each other chapters and poetry they&lt;br /&gt;had written in the now-dead Icelandic&lt;br /&gt;language.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In keeping with Tolkien's love of languages, codes,&lt;br /&gt;and scholarly endeavor, the solution of this cache will require&lt;br /&gt;some effort in all three areas.  (This was inspired, in part,&lt;br /&gt;by El-Kabong's need to stay busy when weather and vehicle&lt;br /&gt;maintenance made him immobile.) The physical finding of the cache&lt;br /&gt;will be simple.  Unraveling the solution to the cache...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;perhaps not so&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither search engines nor other internet sources&lt;br /&gt;were used in the construction of question and answer portion of&lt;br /&gt;this cache listing. Internet information may not be reliable. &lt;br /&gt;All information used to construct the question and answer portion&lt;br /&gt;of this cache came from the original source&lt;br /&gt;materials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solve chapters one,&lt;br /&gt;two, and three, and then tackle the questions and answers. Good&lt;br /&gt;luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your visit to Middle&lt;br /&gt;Earth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br

/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Frodo&lt;br /&gt;left Hobbiton, he stayed with the Brandybucks, just north of&lt;br /&gt;Buckleberry. The Brandybucks' home was in what&lt;br /&gt;town? &lt;br /&gt;(11,4,I,0,4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name of&lt;br /&gt;Thorin Oakenshield's sword, sometimes referred to as&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Goblin-Cleaver&quot;, and the mate of Glamdring. The Orcs feared this&lt;br /&gt;sword, and called it &quot;Biter&quot;. It was laid to rest atop Thorin's&lt;br /&gt;tomb. &lt;br /&gt;(7,5,H,0,3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Griffo's last&lt;br /&gt;name. Griffo was married to the former Daisy&lt;br /&gt;Baggins. &lt;br /&gt;(6,5,III,3,1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second&lt;br /&gt;most powerful wizard of the Istari order.  He was also known&lt;br /&gt;as Tharkun by the Dwarves. &lt;br /&gt;(7,0,I,0,1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gilly's last&lt;br /&gt;name. Gilly was married to Posco, and before marriage, she was a&lt;br /&gt;Brownlock. &lt;br /&gt;(7,2,III,0,4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Orc in the&lt;br /&gt;Tower of Cirith. Shagrat squeezed his eyes out when he refused to&lt;br /&gt;obey an order after the fight between the Orcs of Cirith Ungol and&lt;br /&gt;Minas Morgul.&lt;br /&gt;(6,6,III,0,4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This place was&lt;br /&gt;in Gondor, between Aduin and the Ephel Duath. This was originally&lt;br /&gt;Isuldur's home. After the return of the King, Faramir became its&lt;br /&gt;prince.&lt;br /&gt;(8,0,III,0,3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name&lt;br /&gt;commonly used for referring to Wilcome Cotton. &lt;br /&gt;(5,0,III,1,1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chief city&lt;br /&gt;of Gondor. The city was built on seven levels. This is where the&lt;br /&gt;Nazgul breached the Great Gate during the War of the Ring, and were&lt;br /&gt;stopped only when the Rohirrim arrived and saved the&lt;br /&gt;city. &lt;br /&gt;(11,0,III,0,11) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dunaden of&lt;br /&gt;Gondor, daughter of Imrahil, married to King Eomer of&lt;br /&gt;Rohan. &lt;br /&gt;(9,2,III,0,4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great&lt;br /&gt;spider who paralyzed Frodo in a trap laid by&lt;br /&gt;Gollum. &lt;br /&gt;(6,0,II,9,3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lord and&lt;br /&gt;master of the Old Forest. He wore a pointed hat with a blue&lt;br /&gt;feather, and large yellow boots. He loved to sing and make up&lt;br /&gt;songs. Find his last name, as used by Hobbits. &lt;br /&gt;(8,1,I,0,4)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He carried the&lt;br /&gt;Great Horn of the Stewards of Gondor. A Dunadan of Gondor, he was&lt;br /&gt;the eldest son of Denethor II.&lt;br /&gt;(7,1,I,2,1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King Of Dale,&lt;br /&gt;slain in the Battle of Dale in year 3019. &lt;br /&gt;(5,0,I,0,3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Son of Groin,&lt;br /&gt;father of Gimli, companion of Thorin and Thrain. &lt;br /&gt;(5,1,H,0,1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geocaching is a lot&lt;br /&gt;of fun.  It takes all types of caches to keep things&lt;br /&gt;interesting, from simple park and grabs behind roadside banisters&lt;br /&gt;to the mind-busting, body-ripping complexities of Wonderland (the&lt;br /&gt;2evilguys/Pennsylvania version). This cache lies somewhere in the&lt;br /&gt;middle of the continuum. Please avoid hunting this cache between&lt;br /&gt;the hours of 5:00PM and midnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I greatly enjoyed&lt;br /&gt;putting this together.  Support was provided by geocacher&lt;br /&gt;slwoodard, who provided the final stage&lt;br /&gt;container. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geochecker.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click To Rate This Cache&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN10QBZ - Final, Middle Earth&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;One and only stage of this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

you're almost done....&lt;br /&gt;      almost.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now you'll need some extra information&lt;/b&gt; to retrieve the cache. &lt;br /&gt;Look to the south, and you'll see a mailbox.  Of all the&lt;br /&gt;information that may reside on that mailbox, there's only one four&lt;br /&gt;digit number.  Write down that four digit number, and change&lt;br /&gt;those four digits, in order, into ABCD. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using
your ABCD four digit number&lt;/b&gt;, solve the three numbers below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Number&lt;br /&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; = B + C + D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Number&lt;br /&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; = ((A + B + C + D)  X  3) + B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Number&lt;br /&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; = (A + B + C) X (A + C)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now
that you have your three numbers&lt;/b&gt;, you'll use them as part of this code:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;CWX3,
Number 1, CCWX2, Number 2, CWX1, Number 3&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

READ FURTHER FOR HINTS ON WHAT TO&lt;br /&gt;DO NEXT.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Education is such a&lt;br /&gt;necessary tool&lt;/b&gt; in today's world.  In days past, it was a&lt;br /&gt;benefit of the wealthy classes, or a diversion for the&lt;br /&gt;privileged.   In America, education is available freely&lt;br /&gt;for all citizens.  Unfortunately, some of our grand old school&lt;br /&gt;buildings no longer exist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Self Creek School&lt;br /&gt;operated&lt;/b&gt; from the turn of the 20th century until the early&lt;br /&gt;1950s.  It had a large school house, and a teacher's home&lt;br /&gt;across the road, and a gymnasium that was built by the WPA in the&lt;br /&gt;1930's, but never finished.   The main building stood&lt;br /&gt;vacant until 2005, when it was bulldozed to make way for&lt;br /&gt;&quot;progress&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cache is located&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at the old Self Creek School.  There are two ways to find this&lt;br /&gt;cache.  You can find the location of the old Self Creek School&lt;br /&gt;and look in the only remaining symbol of Mississippi that resides&lt;br /&gt;there, or you can solve the following puzzle. (Local historical&lt;br /&gt;groups had several possible locations for the old school, all of&lt;br /&gt;which were wrong.) The location of the old school took me four&lt;br /&gt;months to find, so solving the puzzle may be the easier of the two&lt;br /&gt;methods.  When (if) you find the cache, please note in your&lt;br /&gt;log which method you used to find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;To find the&lt;br /&gt;coordinates,&lt;/b&gt; take the quiz below.  If the answer is a&lt;br /&gt;name, take the first letter of the name, and find it's ordinal&lt;br /&gt;value. For example, if the name is &quot;Adams&quot;, the ordinal value of&lt;br /&gt;&quot;A&quot; is 1.  If the name is Buchanan, the ordinal value of &quot;B&quot;&lt;br /&gt;is 2, and so on.  If the question is a math question, use the&lt;br /&gt;value of the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AB CD.EFG   HIJ&lt;br /&gt;KL.MNO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sound easy&lt;br /&gt;enough?&lt;/b&gt;  GREAT!  Now, class, turn your test papers&lt;br /&gt;over, and let's get busy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A.&lt;/b&gt; The &quot;Eutaw Flag&quot; was&lt;br /&gt;created in 1780, carried in the battles of Cowpens and Eutaw, and&lt;br /&gt;is now in the possession of the Washington Light Infantry. &lt;br /&gt;What is the name of the city where the flag is&lt;br /&gt;kept?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;B.&lt;/b&gt; Born in 1874, he&lt;br /&gt;served as a reporter for London's &lt;i&gt;Daily Graphic&lt;/i&gt; in 1895, and&lt;br /&gt;later fought in Omdurman in the Sudan in 1898.

Find his name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;O.&lt;/b&gt; The last name of a&lt;br /&gt;famous American painter.  His &quot;Castles In Spain&quot; hangs in the&lt;br /&gt;Metropolitan Museum Of Art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I had this extra ammo&lt;br /&gt;box&lt;/b&gt; that needed to be in use, and I thought I'd put a little&lt;br /&gt;extra thought into building this little puzzle.  By the same&lt;br /&gt;token, extra thought should be put into the solution.  I will&lt;br /&gt;not give any help or lifelines on this until either (a) it's been&lt;br /&gt;logged online as found, or (b) a week has passed since its&lt;br /&gt;publication.  I have come to understand that the amount of&lt;br /&gt;time it takes to solve a cache's coordinates is inversely&lt;br /&gt;proportional to the number of people who will eventually sign the&lt;br /&gt;log book.  That's okay by me. This will probably not be found&lt;br /&gt;by more than ten people while then cache is active, and I&lt;br /&gt;understand that.  If you're one of those few who finds this&lt;br /&gt;cache, you'll be part of an elite group. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I will also ask&lt;/b&gt; that&lt;br /&gt;the answers to the questions, or the location of Self Creek School,&lt;br /&gt;if known, not be passed around.   In the spirit of good&lt;br /&gt;education everywhere, do your own homework, and don't let the guy&lt;br /&gt;next to you look on your paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have fun&lt;/b&gt;, drive safely,&lt;br /&gt;and don't forget to log this stating the method you used for&lt;br /&gt;finding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on &lt;br /&gt;Geochecker.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click To Rate This Cache&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: AC12Q5B - Academics 101&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Final (and only) waypoint for this cache.

We'll look into finding the&lt;br /&gt;correct coordinates later.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a remarkable cache container, nor is it&lt;br /&gt;in a creative hiding place.  The value of this cache is in its&lt;br /&gt;surroundings.  The little Methodist Church that started this&lt;br /&gt;cemetery was established in 1851, and many of the headstones here&lt;br /&gt;predate the War Between The States.  This neatly groomed&lt;br /&gt;cemetery is also the final resting place for many veterans,&lt;br /&gt;including some Confederate veterans.  Take time to look for&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Griffin's headstone, it is unique in its&lt;br /&gt;engraving.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Wesley began what was known in the early-mid&lt;br /&gt;1700's as the Methodist Movement.  The Methodists were fervent&lt;br /&gt;believers in structured study of Scripture and in the belief that&lt;br /&gt;salvation was available to all mankind. The Anglican hierarchy of&lt;br /&gt;the day found Wesley's practices distasteful, and Wesley was&lt;br /&gt;banished from the Anglican pulpits of England. Wesley then made&lt;br /&gt;graveyards, race tracks, and pubs his pulpit.  Wesley came to&lt;br /&gt;Georgia, and on the return voyage, thanks to the Moravians, he was&lt;br /&gt;introduced to the depth of faith that would become the hallmark of&lt;br /&gt;the rest of his ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, for our coordinates.  You'll need two&lt;br /&gt;bits of information in order to find this cache.  You'll need&lt;br /&gt;the year John Wesley was born, and the year he died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coordinates of the cache are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;N 33 58.ALPHA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; W 088 59.OMEGA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alpha is equal to the year of Wesley's birth minus&lt;br /&gt;1325.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Omega is equal to the year Wesley died, minus 1449.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click To Rate This Cache&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN15MJX - Final&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This one-acre site commemorates the last major Civil War battle in Mississippi. The engagement at Tupelo, July 14-15, 1864, was part of the effort on the part of Union forces to keep General Nathan Bedford Forrest in northeast Mississippi and away from General William T. Sherman's supply line running from Nashville to Chattanooga.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Federal forces under General A.J. Smith occupied the town of Harrisburg, present day Tupelo. Forrest and his commander General Steven D. Lee, realizing that Smith could take control of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, moved troops to Harrisburg for a two-day battle that would ultimately end in a draw. The Union objective had been achieved, and Sherman's supply line in eastern Tennessee remained open, allowing Sherman to continue his march to the sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site contains two cannons, a monument to the battle, and an interpretive wayside&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is not within the memorial site but does provide a good angle for taking photos. Watch out for traffic. You will need to park at the carwash/detail shop across the street.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You are looking for a film canister.  We would suggest pulling onto the available side road instead of the main highway, which can be busy at times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is placed in honor of Trezevent's Gene Hickerson, who played football at Trezevent High School and went onto fame playing football at Ole Miss and in the NFL with the Cleveland Browns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hickerson was a six-time NFL Pro-Bowl offensive lineman who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2007.  Gene was drafted in the seventh round of the 1957 NFL Draft by the Browns. He was promptly shifted to the guard position on the offensive line in 1958 to better utilize his speed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After three seasons in the league, he broke his leg in 1961 and fractured the leg again later in the season while watching a game from the sidelines.  After missing two games in 1962, he recovered from the injury and never missed another game in his professional tenure. Hickerson only earned accolades after Jim Brown had retired and he was blocking for Leroy Kelly, but he earned first-team all-NFL honors five straight seasons from 1966-1970 and was voted to six consecutive Pro Bowls from 1966 to 1971. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During his career, Hickerson's Browns never experienced a losing season and started in four NFL title games, including a 1964 NFL Championship win over the Baltimore Colts 27-0. During Gene's 10 pro seasons, the Browns featured a 1,000-yard rusher every season but one. They also had the NFL's leading rusher seven seasons of those ten. He was elected to the Browns' legends team and the NFL 1960s All-Decade Team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Browns added a &quot;GH&quot; tribute badge to their helmets for the 2008 season in his honor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Wolfgora invites you to seek his domain! This cache is on private property owned by our family. Wolfgora will enjoy you all to take part in finding his domain.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Be sure to read below to avoid going to wrong area and trespassing. It may look closer to get to via neighbors yards, but please do not do so, follow parking instructions. You can park at the end of the long side asphalt drive, west of the main driveway. To get to the main trailhead, just walk the treeline at the edge of the yard, up a small hill, you can't miss it. Avoid the dirt road west of treeline, not our property.&lt;/b&gt; The trail is a little overgrown, but I have been working on maintaining it. The cache is off the trail and a little bushwacking required, so you may want long pants, the woods house many thorny plants. In summer, pour on the bug spray, many many bugs. Also keep your feet up, lots of roots on trail. No big hills, just small ones. You can walk the trail really close to the cache, unless you like bushwacking, just be careful of a small dried up creek bed, unless it rains. Be aware of a small smelly pug looking dog. He is friendly, but smelly. His name is Ozzy. To clarify where you should park and start: Be sure you go to 1340 Oakdale Road, park on the long side asphalt driveway. To get to the beginning of the trailhead, walk north along the treeline, you will see a 4-wheeler trail along the treeline. Please be sure to return this way and follow this to avoid trespassing on other properties. After find, would be a good idea to back track so that you do not mistakenly walk through a neighbors yard. This is not required, but if you would like to leave a note here of the day and time you may arrive before you head out to find. I would very much like to meet my fellow geocachers! This cache is winter accessible. Be sure to follow parking guideline. If you park on main driveway, chances are if ice or snow on driveway you will get stuck. Tread carefully on trails if snow and ice exist, and it should be a fun find in winter :)

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the sixth installment of my Cap Cache collection.  &lt;br/&gt;This is by far one of my favorite bridges. Its a great place to sit and listen to the world go by. Its also a bit scary standing under a wooden bridge while cars drive over it. This is another one of my Cap Caches that I hand make, it contains a log only BYOP. Please be sure to obey the rules of the Constitution Trail. This is not available before sunrise or after sunset. Thanks, here is some history behind this awesome bridge...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town of Normal was created at the junction of the Illinois Central and the Chicago and Alton Railroads. The Camelback Bridge is the last surviving structure in Normal associated with the railroad. Its location was chosen because here the railroad builders had been forced to excavate a deep cut through the crest of Normal Moraine. Even so, the bridge had to be built with a distinctive &quot;camelback&quot; shape in order to permit early wood burning locomotives, with their tall stacks, to pass under the bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first bridge in this location was made entirely of wood. About 1904 that bridge was replaced with a distinctive kingpost structure. The columns which now support the bridge were salvaged from another Illinois Central bridge which once crossed the Illinois River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These columns were cast at the nationally famous Phoenix Foundry in PA which gained acclaim in the Civil War by producing cannons for the Union army. The Bridge is a remarkable and unique survivor of Illinois most famous early railroad. It is the only known example of this type of bridge remaining in the state.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the opening of the Constitution Trail in 1988, the bridge became the trail's most noteworthy landmark. In 1997 the Camelback Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This historic bridge was rehabilitated by the town of Normal in 2001.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Monument to the 27000 workers who built the LSTs and ARLs in the&lt;br/&gt;Prairie Shipyard of Seneca. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The wartime need for new shipyard facilities coincided with some&lt;br/&gt;unique geological characteristics at Seneca’s location on the&lt;br/&gt;Illinois River, characteristics favorable for building what would&lt;br/&gt;become known as the “shipyard on the prairie.” So, in&lt;br/&gt;1942, the new Seneca shipyard launched (with the traditional bottle&lt;br/&gt;of champagne) its first LST, one of the Landing Ship Tanks (LST)&lt;br/&gt;that would carry troops into battle. The LSTs left Seneca, sailed&lt;br/&gt;down the Illinois to the Mississippi, and then entered the Gulf of&lt;br/&gt;Mexico. The ships took troops and supplies to Iwo Jima, Dutch New&lt;br/&gt;Guinea, southern Italy, and the Normandy coast. The shipyard built&lt;br/&gt;157 LSTs, launching the last one in June 1945. At the&lt;br/&gt;shipyard’s peak, 11,000 people worked there, living in Seneca&lt;br/&gt;and nearby towns in temporary housing. For their dedication and&lt;br/&gt;skill, workers at the Seneca shipyard helped the shipyard earn five&lt;br/&gt;Army-Navy “E” awards. &lt;b&gt;Congratulations lgreeley1983&lt;br/&gt;on FTF!&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

at N 41 19.558 W 088 42.612. The walk is uphill on the pedestrian
walkway along the bridge hence the 3 rating on terrain.
&lt;b&gt;Congratulations Team Peterson 08 on FTF!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; • Structure: Marseilles Dam • Location: River Mile 247.0
• Structure Width: 975 Feet, Total Of Three Dams • River
Elevation (Pool): 483 Feet • River Elevation (Outflow): 459
Feet • Water Fall: 24 Feet • Date Built: 1933
Construction of the 9-foot navigation channel project on the upper
Illinois River was started by the State of Illinois in 1921. The
project was mostly complete by 1930 when the state ran out of money
and stopped the project. The project was turned over to the US Army
Corps of Engineers, who completed the project in 1933. The 1933 dam
replaced an 1867 era dam. Various mills had dams at this location
going back to 1832. The City of Marseilles was founded by Ephriam
Sprague in 1832 when he moved to the area to establish a sawmill.
He was aware the the Illinois and Michigan Canal would pass though
the city, and he wanted to be in on the ground floor. He named the
city Marseilles because he thought it was an ideal place for an
industrial center, much like the industrial city of Marseilles,
France. Sprague forgot, however, to secure his land claim. The next
year, Lovell Kimball moved into Marseilles, and built a new dam
just down river from Sprague, flooding out Spragues dam and mill,
and ruining his business. Kimball prospered for a decade, until his
grist mill burned in 1842. His insurance failed to pay off, leaving
Kimball both broke and broken. He died shortly after that.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK28CQR - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 41° 19.542 W 088° 42.609&lt;br /&gt;Park here and it's a mere .22 mi to the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

This may be a religious institution,&lt;br/&gt;school, or community. This is the site of two Eagle projects. One&lt;br/&gt;young man chose to design and build a sidewalk that linked the&lt;br/&gt;parking lot to the entrance of the church. The church where this&lt;br/&gt;cache is located is home to Troop 99 as well as Cub Scout Pack 3799&lt;br/&gt;and a Girl Scout troop. The church also has a very active youth&lt;br/&gt;program as well. With all those little feet cutting through the&lt;br/&gt;bushes on the way to their many meetings, the sidewalk out near the&lt;br/&gt;street wasn't used very often. This is the reason this exceptional&lt;br/&gt;Scout decided to take on the project. The second project built on&lt;br/&gt;this site is the beautiful garden that surrounds the walkway built&lt;br/&gt;by the first scout. These two boys came up through the program&lt;br/&gt;together and it is appropriate that their two projects complimented&lt;br/&gt;one another the same way their friendship did. This cache is placed&lt;br/&gt;with permission of the First Untied Methodist Church of Marseilles.&lt;br/&gt;The cache has a Scout theme to it.(First Aid kits, Scout patches&lt;br/&gt;etc.) Please be respectful of the site as it is a very active&lt;br/&gt;church and there are usually lots of little muggles roaming about.&lt;br/&gt;Remember, Indians chasing Buffalo always have the right of way!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to The Jackal and I am Legend on FTF!&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This building has historic significance for Scouting as&lt;br/&gt;well. It was once the clubhouse for the Marsatawa Golf Course which&lt;br/&gt;once sat across the Illinois River in what is now Illini State&lt;br/&gt;Park. The golf course was built by W.D.

Out in the area for a BBQ and we were running ahead of time so why not grab a few?

A hide on an object such as this can be frustrating but thank goodness for a larger container as it made the find a pleasure! Nice paint job to boot.

Well done!

Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

Gates In 1925 this Dam was an innovation in design. The dam is
hollow thus used much less material in its construct while still
retaining it's strength. North American Hydro who owns and operates
this dam is very generous to the Scouting program and has developed
a very nice campground on it's properties for use by the Scouts.
The image I chose for the background is from the winter of 09/10
when a huge ice flow jammed up the river. Ice in this image is 20
feet thick. It is amazing what mother nature can do. This dam also
serves as a barrier to the Asian Carp which are the scourge of the
Illinois River. &lt;b&gt;Congratulations Myaki on FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK2CE0Q - GC2CE0Q Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 41° 23.103 W 088° 47.572&lt;br /&gt;Public Parking is available and just a short walk will take you to this spectacular view. The terrain is flat but you do have to cross a set of tracks and walk through some grass but I'd say it's handicap accessible.</groundspeak:long_description>

An early archaeological excavation in the 1900s unearthed mound remnants that pointed to three to four thousand years of history. The Potawatomie Indians named this area and called it Channahon, which means &quot;meeting of the waters.&quot;. The Potawatomie Indians solely inhabited this area until white settlers looking for good farmland began to settle here in 1832.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The Illinois and Michigan Canal (including several locks) runs through most of the village, where it is fed by the water of the DuPage River. The local Channahon State Park celebrates the region's unique geographical history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later in the 19th century, a railroad line that eventually came under the control of the Santa Fe Railroad was laid through the eastern portions of the township, but no railroad actually passed through the village itself. In the late 1920s, U.S. Highway 6 came through Channahon; Interstates 80 and 55 followed in the 1960s (although I-80 runs approximately two miles to the north of the village limits).&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

If you can pack out some of the litter that seems to be everywhere, all the better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very small tupperware, hidden (I think) fairly well. Enough space for a trinket or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I grew up in this park, and love the history of it. In the 1910's it was actually a zoo! I remember my grandma telling me about seeing live animals in the pens here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In light of this historical significance, I'll be dropping some concretions into it that may contain fossils. You'll have to get them open to see what's inside! I'll add one or two every once in awhile as I venture out and collect more. At time of hide, I didn't have one handy to drop in, there will be one in it very shortly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spot is easy to find, but beware of poison ivy and mud. Also, because of all the litter around here, watch out for metal debris. Be very careful when looking for the cache!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There can be a LOT of muggles around depending on time of day! </groundspeak:long_description>

society founded in Washington, DC in the mid-nineteenth century.
The Knights of Pythias was the first fraternal organization to
receive a charter under an act of the United States Congress. It
was founded by Justus H. Rathbone, who had been inspired by a play
by the Irish poet John Banim about the legend of Damon and Pythias.
This legend illustrates the ideals of loyalty, honor and friendship
that are central to the order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;************************************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The posted coordinates will bring you to a physical object
embedded in the ground. On this object will be a few bits of
information that you will need to take note of to determine the
location of the final cache.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the 4-digit number on the 3rd line of the object and
perform the following calculations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Subtract 7 from the last 2 digits of the number to find the
direction in degrees of the final cache location (AZIMUTH)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Add 6 to the first 3 numbers to find the number of feet
needed to travel to find the final cache location. (FEET)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have the direction and the distance that you need to
travel to find the final cache. Plug that information into the
Waypoint Projection feature of your GPSr and go find that
cache!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The family and I decided to take advantage of the beautiful weather and go for hike and find a few caches. We found stage one (I really like to know the story behind that being there... such a strange location), did our waypoint projection... and found the cache in pretty short order.  My son took a happy meal toy and left a dinosaur.  I took LLS Hike for Discovery #10 travel bug and dropped off &quot;Mr. Potato Bug&quot; travel bug and left a signature LEGO. Well done multi and great use incorporating the object into the cache.  TFTH

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Xyval and I were at this park Jan 2007. Wow, have things changed...cache wise. Older caches are gone and new ones popped up. I really love this park, so I am glad to come at anytime, even better for new caches.

I was really impressed with stage one. This one was a team effort.  I really have no experiace with projection and puzzle cachers are not my forte, Xyval spotted me on this one.  We had 2 final answers to work with, so we put one number in one GPS and the other in the other. We headed out.  We got around GZ and then started our search.  Chalk another puzzle find for me.  Thanks for a very interesting cache, and for the projection lesson.  I need to do more of these.

&lt;p&gt;The old EJ&amp;E Plainfield Depot is the last wood-framed depot associated with the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railroad that is situated near active railroad tracks. It was moved from its original location on the south side of the railroad tracks on Center Street in 1999 by the Plainfield Historical Society, to it's new location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The depot dates back to 1887, it was mainly used as a freight depot, but did serve passengers for several years in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Plainfield Grain Co., which built the tower northeast of routes 126 and 59, relied heavily on the depot. But as road networks built out and trucking became the favored mode of transportation, the depot was used less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was considered an active depot through 1978, but mostly it was used as a check post for the EJ&amp;E workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Elgin, Joliet &amp; Eastern Railway officially ceased to exist January 31st, 2009, at 11:59 PM. At midnight, February 1st, the line became Canadian National property. Over 120 years of EJ&amp;E history came to an end.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Then I remembered I purchased a tool for $1.50 at a store about a year go. It worked!! Best buck I ever spend. Thanks for the history lesson.

After a resting up with a bunch of other cache...We got back onto the matt for another beating.
TAA went up, I went down and all around. No luck. PAF again. They gave us some hints and TAA with the Hootie...on to stage two....ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!! ARGH!!! Nope, not going there.

We took 30 mins for a quick lunch and headed to the new GZ. Having inside info on this park, we took the longer indirect route.  Did a minor water crossing with no real issues and TAA got the hooty again. On our way back, we made a makeshift bridge for the next cacher. 

Stick a fork in me...i'm done!

There is transportation for a fast escape and even Big Bird's favorite bath toy. Hope you enjoy our little gifts and please share yours with us! Kids will love this one...

The inside of the cache and the log was completely soaked. I very carefully peeled the soaked paper apart to get the cache name and it's code so I could log it. I camoed it a little better when I put it back in the same spot after signing in.

&lt;br /&gt;
The stops are not hard and can be done from the car. The final is a
walk over a beautifully manicured lawn. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
------------------------------ &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Stop 1 - The Estate&lt;/b&gt; (Wally's Home) Count the number of
columns on the front of the estate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Stop 2 - The Club&lt;/b&gt; (... and his work) Count the number of
columns all around the main building. (Note: 2 story columns count
as one column.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Stop 3 - The Memorial&lt;/b&gt; (For his Wife, Beverly) Count the
number of GROUPS of columns. (Hint: Less than twenty)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Add the answers from the three stops to the posted coordinates
(both N and W). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This will be the location of the final cache. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Down by the riverside&quot; &lt;br /&gt;

Have fun! &lt;br /&gt;

Dedication: to Team WO9LF &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the most well crafted and thought out caches in the SW
suburbs by one of the nicest and interesting Geocaching couples.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your caches are always a delight and always left me smiling on my
way back to work. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your 'Brain Pain' series confounded many a geocacher (in a
wonderful park with a great history) and who would think a 2 ton
stage on your 'A Stroll Through Town' multi would or even could be
stolen? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Too much fun. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for the caches! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Check the location of your calculations for the final by clicking
here. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 Some might cuss at the difficulty of the terrain but if you choose
the right way in you will be rewarded with a niceish walk and a
outstanding view. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 I bet you were getting tired of all of those drive-ups anyway.
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 I managed to find a spot where the restrictions of the surrounding
forest preserves do not apply. It is an enchanting view into areas
forbidden to us (Lemont Woods, Keepataw Forest Preserve and Black
Partridge Nature Preserve). &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 Beautiful. Truly beautiful. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 This cache is larger than most ammo boxes and smaller than a 5
gallon container. Meow. Big enough for large travel bugs but too
tough of a walk to be a hotel. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 I left the container totally exposed, visable from all sides but
the approach side. Lets see how long it will last. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 Please feel free to take one of the 'Ready to Go' cache containers
which I have placed inside. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 ------------------------ &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 Since I started working in this area many local caches have
entertained me. I have been amused and challenged everyday when I
go out to grab a cache at lunch. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 This cache is my way of saying 'Thank You' to all of the local
area cachers. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 Especially to... &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;

Challenging us to 'Choose Wisely&quot; when selecting the parking and a
path from stage to stage on his fun multi's. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 Whether the obstacle being brambles or a river or even a great
distance he made us look at the maps and make a decision. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 Thanks for all of the fun caches; I know we all enjoy them very
much. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 Keep on challenging us!&lt;br /&gt;

I headed over to this cache from &quot;What is this doing here?&quot;  I definitely earned my terrain rating and then some today. I managed to bushwhack the whole way there and make (I'm sure) several unnecessary creek crossings.  But I loved the adventure, even the part where the fallen tree I was standing on broke under my weight and I fell to the ground.  I agree this area definitely offers some great views.  I found the cache easy enough, but it was completely filled with water. I emptied the container and swag bag of water the best I could. The log was mush. TFTH</groundspeak:text>

Was orginally set to do my 200th in Oswego, but that was bust. We needed to pick up the kids so we headed east and decided this one would be my 200th!! The cache was an awesome choice. Took us awhile to find the better parking.  We parked and headed toward GZ.  We stayed to one side, but Xyval quickly said let's double back and come around, which we did. With the newly fallen snow, I think added a star to the terrain. Luckily we had something to grab on to.  We got to with in 20 feet and switch to visual.  I knew what we were looking for but could not find it. We sat around, taking in veiw of the semi-frozen still flowing river and the light snowfall. WOW!! It was awesome.  I am glad we did it at this time of year.  I turned and made the find.  L: Rubber duck

Thanks &quot;Panther in the Den&quot; for a great 200th!!</groundspeak:text>

The van's battery got drained over the night.  We parked in an Industrial Park and headed to GZ. As always, we jumped in the forrest to soon and had to do some bushwacking.  Out popped a trail and we took that to the cache. Found in good order. I left a glass duck and we all signed the log.  Getting back to the car had no bushwacking, of course.</groundspeak:text>

I am still trying to figure out how OC and GC are going to get along.  Other caches I have found from other listing sites were not cross listed, and I get confused easily, so this promises to be a challenge!  Thanks for the hide.  It certainly had me going for a while.</groundspeak:text>

This was our first Opencaching find--didn't even know about this site until a few weeks ago when a forum I was viewing made reference to it.  An unfound cache only minutes from our house?  We had to go after it at the first nice day opportunity--today was it.After an initial reconnaissance visit we came back later with all that we needed (turns out it wasn't that much) and started our way to to site.  Younger Son commented that he should have brought his wet suit but later allowed that would have been overkill as only our ankles and below were exposed to the elements.  There's a very neat fort on the island complete with picnic table, lofted area, and a deck with a great view of the river.  Very nice spot.  We were rewarded for our willingness to go into chilly water with an unactivated geocoin which we goinked.  Thanks Greenback!!!</groundspeak:text>

I found something hanging around, a lid laying around, then a log sheet laying a little ways off and.... oh there's the container. I put it all back together as I do believe NESAMOH intended. There is a tiny hole in the container as a critter seems to enjoy gnawing on plastic. LOL

Thanks for the cache NESAMOH.

Located just a few yards off the paved Gilman Trail.  This is a smallish micro I picked up from a GOJAC seed cache, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=8f04dfa2-d332-4445-a909-185956703595&quot;&gt;For You Shall Go in Joy and Be Led Back in Peace&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.  This one might take a while, there are lots of places near GZ where it could be. </groundspeak:long_description>

It appears we are the first to log here about the find, the log book already had several entries.</groundspeak:text>

Out with the LEGS crew for a morning of caching.
There were some of us that wanted to dash for this cache as 

We were in the middle of two multis and came across this one. I had to think for a minute as to what cache was my milestone but finally figured out that signing the log constituted the find so here I am.  :)

This was a nice one for my milestone! Not far from the path and in a nice little wooded area. Just like geocaching should be.

Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

Found with MutherAndSun on a hot and humid day in the area. 100% humidity, 3 hours sleep, 998 caches in a 15 mi radius, perfect plan for a 24hr cache run. It's a shame I can't share all of the details of some of the hunts, but there is a reason MutherAndSun is my favorite driver. Orale! and TFTC.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This hide is located about .4 miles from parking from the north and about .6 miles from parking from the south. It's on a dirt path off the east side Fox River Trail. It's a nice easy walk with no bushwhacking required or heavy brush. There's a northern entrance and a southern entrance to the path, depending on where you choose to park and walk from. Enjoy the scenery and serenity on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

His preference was to have a cash business, as he didn't like the idea of going into debt. It dawned on him that in terms of buying habits, people gave up Food, Clothing, Autos and Movies last, in that order. He had noticed that even though the depression was in full swing, folks continued to go to motion pictures at their local Theater. From this, his first notion was to create a deluxe gas station, designed like a Hawaiian Village, that would feature a restaurant and outdoor movies where the customers could mingle while their cars were being serviced, utilizing Whiz Auto Products of course!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not clear why he dropped every other aspect of the idea other than the outdoor Theater, but soon Richard, 30 years old by this time, was experimenting with the concept in his back yard on 212 Thomas Avenue in Riverton, New Jersey. He started by placing an old Kodak projector on the hood of his car, projecting the movie onto a screen nailed to a tree. He turned on his sprinkler to simulate rainfall, and placed a radio behind the screen to provide the sound. He also reasoned that in order to ensure that all of the vehicles had an un-obstructed view of the screen, they would need to be positioned in a special way. He spent several weeks arranging vehicles in different configurations to solve the visibility problem. The final solution was a series of terraced ramps whose height increased as you parked closer to the screen. This arrangement of ramps was the core of his concept and Richard felt it was strong enough to be patentable, allowing him to collect royalties from future drive-in operators for a period of 17 years, the standard time limit for patents. Or so he thought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The application for patent was filed on August 6, 1932, and it was later granted by the patent office on May 16, 1933 under patent number 1,909,537. The next thing on the agenda was to build the first drive-in in order to promote the idea to the public as well as potential investors. First off though, he needed to get some financial backing which came from Willie Warren Smith, his first cousin and parking lot operator. The two men then formed a company, called Park-In Theaters Inc. Richard assigned his patent to the company immediately. Edward Ellis, a road contractor, was brought in to grade the lot of the first Theater in exchange for stock. Oliver Willets, an executive of Campbell's Soup, also bought stock in the company at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On May 16, 1933, the day the patent was granted, work began on constructing the drive-in on Crescent Boulevard in Pennsauken Township, New Jersey. The location is usually reported as Admiral Wilson Blvd. in Camden, but technically the Theater was just over the Camden town line, where the name of the road changes. Opening night was June 6, 1933, and it was known simply as &quot;Drive-In Theater&quot; although the actual name was the &quot;Automobile Movie Theater.&quot; Opening night was packed with cars, and the first film ever shown at a drive-in was the 1932 release of &quot;Wives Beware,&quot; which was in second-run status at the time. The problem of obtaining first-run films for drive-ins remains to this day! Admission was 25¢ for each car and an additional 25¢ for each person, somewhat higher than the prevailing price at the indoor houses at the time, who were also offering double features. Ironically, this has reversed itself over time and drive-ins are usually the only places to see double features today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two such drive-in theaters in the Chicago area are the Cascade and the McHenry outdoor theaters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Congrats to TeamJds' for the FTF!!****</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perhaps you will find the time to stop for this cache in
between shopping for Christmas presents.  Let's not forget the
reason for the season.  Not far from this cache you will see a
reminder... and it's not a mall although it may look like
one!  Located in McCaslin Park, this one would be great for
the kids to find as well. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

You are looking for a small camouflaged lock n lock container.&lt;br/&gt;The terrain rating WILL change depending on the season with winter being the easiest. Rainy months the terrain could be up to a 4-4.5! Be prepared!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the year caching, I have found many caches, seen some awesome places and best of all, met some of the greatest people both at events and on the trail. Who would know there are nut jobs just like me who likes to hunt Tupperware in the woods! Thanks to TourSport for creating an obsessive cacher.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache I placed is really to honor everyone in the sport who really loves caching like myself. this is placed in a fairly true what caching is meant to be style.

I'm sure we made a lot of rookie mistakes like trekking through the forest on a warm winters day through all of the mud without hiking boots, even with the gps--going round and round in circles until we found the cache, forgetting to have a pen to sign the log, and finally, getting a “Hot Foot” leaving the cache…really wished I had those hiking boots!!  Hehehe…  But, we did bring a fun token that we hope the next explorers will like.  Our ratings might be a bit extreme because this was our first trek, so use them with caution.  Thanks for taking the time to keep this cache going!!  We look forward to exploring another cache soon!!

There has been so much talk about Stones lately, I just needed to put a Stones cache out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you can see, the coordinates are almost entirely Stones. There are cachers who honor stones by putting them in their name. There are also bands who have Stones in their name. Others honor stones by wanting to put them in their mouths. Depending on the situation, some stones can be rather colorful too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many uses for stones. They can be used as building blocks or used for destruction. They can be whole or crushed. They can be hot or cold when they are used. They come in all sizes. Some people just like to hold stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stones can be large or small, but a stone always weighs the same. This puzzle will require that you know your stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get the decimal portion of the North coordinates of the cache, You will need to convert 11158 pounds to its equivalent measurement in Stone. N 41 59.(???) Stone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get the decimal portion of the West coordinates of the cache, you will need to convert 5250 pounds to its equivalent measurement in Stone. W 88 00.(???)

What a bummer, I thought. Geocachers had just walked about a mile finding most or all of the caches along the way, and had no caches to find on the way back. I came prepared and brought a fully loaded cache. And this is that cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I call this cache &quot;In the Middle&quot; because I noticed how it was about halfway through the trail back to the parking lot (If you go clockwise) and relatively in the middle of the preserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a short hike from the trail to the cache, and no major bushwhacking is necessary.</groundspeak:long_description>

The container lying on the ground without any log. I put in a temporary log and replaced the container as best I could. Even thought that I may have had an FTF. Turns out that the FTF was long gone since this is a GC cache GC30CC4 placed 7/17/11 and published 7/18/11. It appears that most of the OpenCaching caches are imported GC caches.</groundspeak:text>

Park District land with permission. Do not place the following
items in the cache: food, inappropriate, offensive, or hazardous
materials. Absolutely no cutting of brush or other vegetation is
allowed. Visitors must remain on designated trails. It is the
visitor’s responsibility to orient themselves with the rules
of the District site.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;
To solve this problem you will have to work out how old both Micro
and his son were when they died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
'Here lies Micro,' the wonder behold. through art algebraic, the
stone tells how old: 'God gave him his boyhood one-sixth of his
life, one twelfth more as youth while whiskers grew rife; and then
yet one-seventh ere marriage begun; in five years there came a
bouncing new son. Alas, the dear child of master and sage after
attaining half the measure of his father's life chill fate took
him. After consoling his fate by the science of numbers for four
years, he ended his life.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once you have done that consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How old would Micro have been if he lived eleven years more? =
AB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What is the difference between the dying ages of both Micr and his
son? = CD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How old was Micro's son when his dad was 58? = EF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How old was Micro when his son was 35? = GH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The coordinates are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
N42 12.ABD W088 15.FGH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The geocache is on Cary
Park District land with permission. Do not place the following
items in the cache: food, inappropriate, offensive, or hazardous
materials. Absolutely no cutting of brush or other vegetation is
allowed. Visitors must remain on designated trails. It is the
visitor’s responsibility to orient themselves with the rules
of the District site.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;
The coordinates listed above are not the location of the cache.
Solve the puzzle to find the location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I hope you can stomach this puzzle. It's incredible but true that
more than 80%—that's right—more than eighty percent of
the manufactured beverages and foods sold in supermarkets and fast
food stores are compounded from chemicals using artificial colors
and flavors to make them salable. How absurd it is to drink a
beverage that is so distasteful it has to be dyed and artificially
flavored to be appealing! The potential danger in drinking these
beverages is the possibility of a chemical reaction causing serious
disturbances in the body. The greatest danger is when the brain
area is afflicted by the chemical constituents of soft drinks. Here
are some of the more common dyes and flavorings that soft drink
companies use. Marketed under many names, these ingredients can be
easily disguised. Be aware anything with the words &quot;coloring&quot; or
&quot;flavor&quot; probably has one or more of these ingredients. In order to
get the coordinates for the cache just match the description to the correct chemical.
For example for the following description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

X. You will rarely find this dye mentioned by it's real name
instead it is called &quot;orange 1&quot; or just &quot;artificial coloring.&quot; this
chemical is derived from the distillation of coal. Its main
ingredient: benzene is used as a motor fuel, as a solvent for
resins and rubber, and in the manufacture of such dyes. As a
chemical compound it is harmful because it afflict the nervous
system and cerebrospinal fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

After reading the hint/description, research it, and select the
correct answer from below. The answer for this question is #8
&quot;Bordeaux.&quot; Finally plug in the numeral 8 in the position for X in
the final coords. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
A.
This is a dye consisting of the dried bodies of lice which feed on
cacti in Mexico and other parts of central and south America.
Special cacti are extensively cultivated for the express purpose of
propagating the lice. The female louse is gathered and killed by
heat, then dried and pulverized. It yields a bright castillian red.
Unfortunately it is also found in tropicana ruby red grapefruit
juice as well as many generic soft drinks.
&lt;p&gt;

B. This chemicals occurs in the blood and urine. Artificially, it
is used as a dye, a coloring agent and is used in weighing silk. It
is also used as an artificial coloring for beverages. This chemical
interferes with normal, smooth flow of the endocrine glands,
throwing the body off balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
C. This is a dye obtained by the reaction of chloroform with
benzene and aluminum chloride. Chloroform has a sweetish taste. It
is used as an anesthetic to put people to sleep. It produces
violent gastroenteritis, which is an inflammation of the bowel and
if the stomach. It results in complete unconsciousness when taken
alone internally. Aluminum Chloride is derived from heating
aluminum with chloride. It is used in oil refineries for &quot;cracking&quot;
oils. The effect of aluminum on the body manifests in neuralgia,
loss of energy, constipation, skin troubles, nausea, loss of
appetite and many other afflictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
D. This chemical is obtained by the action of acetylene on
diazomethane, producing a poisonous chemical which is nonetheless
used as a coloring agent in beverages and foods. This word
&quot;poisonous&quot; should warn you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
E. This is obtained by heating sugar to more than 350°F or by using
ammonia with molasses or glucose. Besides using this chemical as a
red-yellow coloring agent, it adds a sugary zest to the flavor. The
use of This chemical tends to throw the blood out of balance
causing heart trouble which is intensified by the presence of
ammonia. When used in excessive amounts, it can cause mental and
other disorders particularly with children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
F. This chemical is also an acid component for fertilizers. It is
also used in soft drinks with carbonated water to effervesce, or
fiz the beverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
G. This is used as a prescription for certain genitourinary
diseases. It, too, is added to soft drinks to give them a citric
zip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
H. In citrus fruits this chemical is present in live, organic form
in which state it is beneficial as an alkalizing beverage. When it
is made chemically however, and used and soft drinks it increases
the negative acidity of the system. If the organic chemical was
used and soft drinks it would tend to make the price almost
prohibitive, whereas it can be made chemically very cheaply. This
chemical can cause canker sores in the mouth, and even ulcers in
the duodenum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to finding this cache is looking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my second try on such an idea. The previous one only lasted a week before it was muggled. Hopefully this hide with a new location and new container will last longer.&lt;/p&gt;
Since some are having trouble with the find I have posted some spoiler pictures here:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hiker-n.com/Hiker_N/Gramen_Spoiler_Photos.html&quot;&gt;visit link here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do NOT look at these unless you need to, they will ruin the fun of finding it. If you need help go ahead and check them out. I did not post them here because typically people view the gallery images without thinking of a spoiler in mind so I am just being safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started one Saturday in January, a fresh layer of snow
had just fallen the night before and it was undergirded by a couple
inch deep base that had come down a few days before. This was the
perfect formula for a great XC Ski excursion. I loaded the skis
into the trusty ol’ van and headed off to one of my favorite
preserves. I have been coming to the Hollows since I was so little
I can’t remember. It is a great place to cross country ski
because they groom the trails after a base of snow and indeed when
I arrived it was well groomed/ After signing the sheet at the
trailhead I began my trek. There are some great elevation changes
that help to maintain speed and my confidence grew in my balance
more and more each minute. When I rounded the bend I know so well,
I decided to do something I had never done before on my
XC’s—go full speed ahead down the hill, yes I knew that
that it had an abrupt turn at the end, yes I knew that I was very
far back in the park with no cell phone on me… You can
imagine the result, I took the biggest wipeout ever. It felt like a
triple summersault but of course no one was there to see it.
Luckily I wasn’t hurt bad and I got back safely and on my own
two feet. Always be safe and if you venture to get this cache on XC
skis, please be extra careful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In order to find this cache, You will have to solve a simple
puzzle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Look at the picture of 'Skier's Maze' - solve the puzzle and you
will see that you have passed through 10 letters (there is only one
correct answer), place these in order to make the
coordinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example- if the word is PERPLEXING Then the coordinates will
read N42 PE.RPL W088 EX.ING Now, using the clue word and the letter
to number conversion (see below) replace the letters with numbers
and you will reveal the coordinates for the final cache
location.&lt;/p&gt;




Number Conversion: A=4, B=7, C=9, D=7, E=7, F=4, G=5, H=3, I=1, J=1
K=2, L=5, M=3, N=3, O=7 P=1, Q=6, R=8, S=1, T=2, U=7, V=2, W=8,
X=9, Y=0, Z=7

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this particular cache, the story is rather funny. In the summer of 2010 I decided to take a canoe trip stating here at the location of the cache. It was a warm, sunny day. I planned to launch off at about 9am and paddle down to the Barrington Marina, have lunch, then explore the backwaters of Lion's Prairie. On the way back I'd stop in at the Heron Rookery nearby. I was excited and ready to begin: I had my lunch, camera, phone, any yes I even remembered the paddles this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shoved off in the metal canoe I had. To say the least by the time I arrived at the Barrington Marina I was more than enthused to get off that canoe! I felt like an ant being chard by a kid with a magnifying glass! After a nice lunch, trying to ignore the redness, I got back into the canoe and went over to Lion's Prairie. I got some good pictures and didn't really notice the bad burn starting to creep up. When I got back to the river I began to feel it. Getting back to my car was a struggle, or so it seemed. I was soooo scorched. I forgot about the Rookery stop and I just went back upriver trying to ignore my skin. I had nothing to cover myself with except the bag that my lunch came it, but I threw that out after I finished it. So I was stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I did arrive back I got a few snickers and giggles from those standing around fishing, but all I cared about was getting out of the sun. Overall it was a good trip, but the worst was yet to come. I got some Aloe Vera gel and settled in for a less-than-comfortable week.&lt;/p&gt;

This multi is for all those of us who love long hikes in beautiful scenic places. It is a fully walkable or skiable 10.5 mile round trip across four connected MCCD sites—Silver Creek, Hickory Grove Riverfront, Hickory Grove Highlands, and Lyons Prairie and Marsh. I highly recomend you download the path download below and plan your route in google earth! Expect at least 3 hours if you are walking. Of course you can spoil it for yourself and drive to the 8 separate stages but that ruins the fun in my opinion . At each stage you will collect one number to make up the final coords. The final is a medium transparent bin. And don't forget about stage H!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
STAGE A: On the top of the pipe it says: 11P ?1/2 Fill in the blank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STAGE B: What comes next 107...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STAGE C: There are ___ main lines of words on this sign. (not including the last two small ones)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STAGE D: Where was this pump manufactured? 1) Oregon, 2) Wisconsin, 3) Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STAGE E:Subtract the Superdeck® patent number from 3,964,230.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STAGE F: (You no longer have to visit this stage the answer is 9 and is in the answer below.This sign says “THIN ICE KEEP OFF” on the other side it says: “E3T4R 56 O7N 8I9K” The number your’e looking for is S&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STAGE G:How many things does it list you cannot place into this container?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STAGE H: Also while your hiking notice the fourth digit of the first number you should call if you see suspicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FINAL: N 42 1H.ECG W088 1A.BD9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The first school house was built at this location in 1841. Later in
1883, Washington School was built on this site. It was designed by
Louis Sullivan of the Adler and Sullivan firm. It was a K-12 school
until 1925. It served as a K-3 school until it closed in 1985. In
1993, it was torn down and replaced with the restaurant that exists
on the site today.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is cache number two in the series &quot;bloopers,&quot; a continuously
growing chronicle to some of my not-so-brilliant moments. This
series is also underscored by a recycled theme, where not only each
container is recycled, but also the logbook.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was little I used to call this park the &quot;bumpy slide
park&quot; This park is one of the oldest parks in this area. It once
hosted miles of hiking trails, two playgrounds, a softball field,
volley ball field, basketball court, picnic shelters, sledding
hill, and more. Really this park was one of the best kept secrets
of the area. When I was a boy my mom used to take me hiking on the
once well groomed, well marked trails; we would picnic by silver
creek, and play on the playground of course having to go down the
world famous bumpy slide made entirely of rollers (really you
should go check it out). Lately though, this park has been
neglected and the trails have become overgrown. Even though the
playground and groves are still intact it is only a shadow of its
once glorious past. While browsing the Oakwood Hills village site I
came across a page talking about the renovation of this park. Sure
enough they have already begun. It will once again be great under
the guidance of MCCD and the Land Conservatory. This cache is not
far back on the trails like I would have hoped. Instead it has been
requested that I keep it close to the entrance and out of the
construction zone. This happens to be where the blooper actually
happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started one Saturday morning a while back. I was out in
the woods with my sister and we were just finishing an hour hike. I
decided to stop off at a spot I knew had some great blackberries. I
came down the path at the trailhead coordinate and was about to
enter the open area when my hair stood up on end. I heard a sound
that was like the growl of a dog combined with the snarling of a
lion. I looked to my left and there was a medium sized, brown
coyote. I smiled nonchalantly and slowly took a step back. I had my
hand on my knife in my pocket and a stick in the other, I knew that
if he were to charge I could swiftly jam the stick into his gaping
jaws. This turned out to be not necessary as he soon backed out of
the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event was no so much of a blooper as it was a scare but I
thought you might enjoy it anyway. I would love to hear some of
your own similar stories, tell about them in your log.&lt;/p&gt;
Please
enter the woods by the trailhead waypoint. It will be much easier
than just blazing your own trail. To start, cross over the small
bridge and then when you reach the trailhead waypoint turn
left.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Backstory:&lt;/b&gt; Many people had met the
man that went by the name wkellogg01, and his unexpected passing
shocked all of them. This hide is like some of his own hides. He
once described his methods as lame hides with the challenge of the
searcher having to use utmost stealth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
tamaranathan said this in the initial post notifying those of GONIL
of his passing:&quot;wkellogg01 lived in Rockford and made a long
caching commute every day to work at Discover in Riverwoods. I had
the pleasure of meeting him on the trails a few times during
lunchtime outings and caching with him. He was on a rapid pace to
hit 1000 finds before he abruptly stopped caching at the end of
July.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
lucy (lucy92979) had this to say: &quot;We were taken aback to hear this
last weekend. tishman had Warren's commemorative hide ready to go
last year as we were watching his 1000th milestone fast
approaching. When he seemed to abruptly stop we emailed him several
times but he never replied.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We had met and talked to Warren more than a few times. We enjoyed
his hides and his enthusiasm for geocaching. We were shocked and
saddened to hear of his passing. Our prayers and thoughts are with
his family and friends.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even though I never met him, I chose to place this cache in his
memory. He still has a few active caches West of here further into
Rockford. Those hides are good caches and are maintained by myself
and other local geocachers. If you are here visiting Rockford or
are new to Geocaching in general, I invite you to make an effort to
find those last few.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is a bookmark list of his remaining active caches in Rockford
that remain active with logged finds (with exception of !O which is
East towards Chicago): wkellogg01's Legacy&lt;br /&gt;

There is parking at 2 different lots around the park. The container is a camo'd pre-form. It may prove more difficult in Winter...we'll have to let you tell me if it is. Stealth may be required depending on if anyone is using the park. This cache is only available during listed park hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please replace the cache exactly as you found it so others can have the same experience as you did.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache placed with the permission of the City of McHenry's Director of Parks &amp; Recreation.&lt;br/&gt;N 42° 20.743 W 088° 16.482 </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True"> Actually a bottle pre-form, but you get the idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 2 stage Multi-cache. Both stages are within .25 miles of each other. It shouldn't take you more than a half hour to find both stages. Depending on when you search, there may be high muggle activity at both stages(Especially during the middle of July when the local festival is taking place).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The posted coordinates are stage 1 and will take you to a marker. There you will have to perform some simple math.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get the North coordinates of the final, you will need to go to the marker and add all of the numbers found on the marker. Then add the day of the month it &quot;was sealed&quot; to that total. Take that grand total and add it to the posted North Coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get the West coordinates of the final, you will need to count the number of numbers found on the marker and multiply that by 12. Take that number and subtract it from the posted West Coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is plenty of legal parking around both stages of the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All parts of this cache are on McHenry Park District property and are posted with permission of the Director of McHenry Parks &amp; Recreation. Please hunt this cache during posted park hours only.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Peterson Park in McHenry Illinois. It is a 209 Acre park which is home to the annual Fiesta Days celebration. It provides access to McCullom Lake and is on the Illinois Prairie Bike/walking path. There are also Softball and Baseball games and tournaments held here. It has Basketball courts, Gazebo's, play areas, Playground equipment, a beach(fee), Picnic shelter's, soccer fields and more. There is ample parking all around. Depending on how the vote's go, it may have a Metra line running right through the center of it, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You won't have to worry about a train over here, though. Depending on the parking lot you pick, you may have a shorter walk or a longer walk. Depending on the trail you take, this can have a little bushwhacking or it can have much more. I'll leave that up to decide. I didn't encounter any ticks, but there were mosquitoes so I suggest some bug spray. There are quite a few hidey spots and thick tree cover, so you may have to use more Geosense and less GPS once you get near GZ. Make sure you do a thorough search of the area and expand it if you need to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache placed with the permission of the Director of McHenry Parks and Recreation.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Peterson Park in McHenry Illinois. It is a 209 Acre park which is home to the annual Fiesta Days celebration. It provides access to McCullom Lake and is on the Illinois Prairie Bike/walking path. There are also Softball and Baseball games and tournaments held here. It has Basketball courts, Gazebo's, play areas, Playground equipment, a beach, Picnic shelter's, soccer fields and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I decided to place this(and one other) cache since we were here for a Softball Tournament and realized the park didn't have any caches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The kids and I picked this spot after some deliberation as to where the best place would be...while they were arguing about it, I placed it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you hunt this in July during Fiesta Days, parking will be more difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache placed with the permission of the Director of McHenry Parks and Recreation.</groundspeak:long_description>

Per the village, once the subdivision to the south gets filled in more, this is supposed to have a tot lot or some other type of playground equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are searching for a container that is large enough to hold small trackables. It's best to bring your own writing utensil. There is a trail that takes you to another trail which takes you to GZ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no reason to cross private property, developed or not, to find this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking can be found at N 42 22.254 W 88 15.507&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please obey the posted 25 mph speed limit. There are kids in this neighborhood and we don't want to draw any unwanted attention from the homeowners in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Permission to place this cache has been granted by the Village of Johnsburg Parks &amp; Recreation director and by the Johnsburg Police Department. </groundspeak:long_description>

There is a barrier between the road and the Cache, so you'll be safe from the traffic here. There is no need to go by the guardrail!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have used this type of container in past hides, so keep that in mind when hunting this one...it may help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The parking for this park is only allowed from 6am - 10pm only. The LEO station is just down the road, so I wouldn't violate that for a smiley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please re-hide this one as good or better than you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Permission to place this cache has been granted by the Village of Johnsburg and the Johnsburg Police Department.</groundspeak:long_description>

These things may make hunting this cache a little more difficult during high muggle times. Each evening during soccer season, there will be multiple teams out here, so stealth will be needed. There is a less obvious way to get to this cache and the path doesn't show up well on the map, but it is the best way. Recommended parking in the large parking lot to the north. The tree canopy may play havoc with your GPS signal, so you may need to use geo-sense once in there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container is camo'd and has room for small tradables. Please re-hide the container as well or better than you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is placed with the permission of the Village of Johnsburg Parks &amp; Recreation department.</groundspeak:long_description>

Depending on when you hunt this cache, you may see the Kiddie Kickers practicing their soccer, the Boys playing Baseball, the girls either playing or practicing Softball or even the Lacrosse team out there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a small container that only contains a log, so make sure to bring a writing utensil. The thing that the cache is hidden in is a bit pokey, so you may want some gloves on when looking for it. There really isn't a need to untie the cache from its location, you can just screw the bottom off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legal parking is in the lot to the south...&lt;br/&gt;N42 24.514 W88 14.097.

Frequently on these trails you will run across deer and racoons. I have also seen a fox recently. Please park at N42 31.495 W089 00.121 to enter the trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few foreign coins, some poly-dice, and a good luck coin to start this out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CITO&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BYOP</groundspeak:long_description>

We don't like trudging through the forest looking for a film container, so our hides are fairly easy to find.  The only reason I'm giving this hide one star difficulty/terrain is because I can't give it half a star.  You shouldn't have to walk more than 5 feet from your car to find this cache.  The outer cache container is a design I came up with on my own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's in a business parking lot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Permission granted by Frank, building and grounds manager.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cache is part five of a series of caches which will provide a little trivia on the area you are searching. You are searching for a camouflaged bison tube. Please be sure to seal the top with the black o-ring in place and put the cache back in the same spot and manor that it was hidden.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cache is hidden in the Root River Parkway. This portion of the Root River Parkway, is home to many wild species of animals who “co-exist” alongside people, cars, trucks, dogs, motorcycles, etc.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The parkway is part of the Milwaukee County Park System, which contains over 140 parks and parkways totaling nearly 15,000 acres&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a relatively unknown part of the Root River Parkway. On the Milwaukee County Parks System map (section B 17) it is known as a “Parkway Drive”, sounding a bit oxymoronic. If you look across the river in certain spots, you can see there is another road, almost parallel to this one. Its name? Root River Parkway!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://county.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cntyParks/maps/Root_River_Parkway_Sout1.pdf&quot;&gt;http://county.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cntyParks/maps/Root_River_Parkway_Sout1.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The nearby soccer field can be full of cars, adults and kids during certain times of the year. They probably won’t even notice you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be sure to glance at the lovely gardens to the west. &lt;u&gt;(DO NOT TRESSPASS.)&lt;/u&gt; The incredible yard is owned by a former Boerner Botanical Garden employee.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We even found a youtube video that showcases the area you are in. Notice the end of the clip and the soccer field to the right side.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The cache is NOT at the posted coordinates.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ghost Mamma and her little spooklets were haunting the nearby human folk when one of the little haunters wandered off and got lost. Mamma spook knows where her little one is but alas she is bound to haunt the posted coordinates for eternity and so she cannot seek out her missing little one herself. If you stand at the posted coordinates she may mess with your GPS in an attempt to get you to go to her missing little Spooky Boy. All it takes for you to send him home is for you to see him...that will be enough to scare him back to his mamma.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We ran around with no real plan, just try to get a bunch of the event caches and whatever else we could find along the way. We had a lot of fun exploring the West Bend area today. We ended up being appropriately lazy as it was only .16 to the cache from where we parked but we biked through the campground to it anyway. This was another area where we seemed to arrive at the same time as everyone else as the grounds were full of cachers. We made quick work of this one. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Silver Maple grows to a height up to 100 feet, diameter 3 feet
or more; trunk usually short, divided into a number of long
ascending limbs which are again divided; their small branches
droop, but turn upward at tips, forming large, spreading round
crowns. The Silver Maple is found on river bottoms or other deep,
moist soils in the southern 2/3 of Wisconsin and is a popular shade
tree, but the branches are apt to be broken in storms. Permission

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Shagbark Hickory is found in the southern part of Wisconsin, on
moist, rich soils and well-drained hillsides. The wood is used
largely in the manufacture of agricultural implements and tool
handles; makes very good fuel and is best of all woods for smoking
meats. The Shagbark Hickory nut is an important wildlife food
source. It grows to a height of 60 to 100 feet, diameter 1 to 2
feet; open, rounded crown with conspicuous shaggy bark. Permission
to place this cache was given by Mike Kactro of the Washington
County Parks/Planning Department. As this section of the Eisenbahn

(Air Mission)

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rank and organization:&lt;/b&gt;Private First Class, U.S. Marine Corps, Company E, 2d Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division (Rein.).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Place and date:&lt;/b&gt;Seoul, Korea, 29 Septrmber 1950.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Entered service at:&lt;/b&gt; Mindoro, Wis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Born:&lt;/b&gt; 24 January 1925 Mindoro , Wis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;G.O. No.:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Citation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving with Company E, in action against enemy aggressor forces at Hill 132, in the early morning hours. Manning one of the several listening posts covering approaches to the platoon area when the enemy commenced the attack, Pfc. Christianson quickly sent another marine to alert the rest of the platoon. Without orders, he remained in his position and, with full knowledge that he would have slight chance of escape, fired relentlessly at oncoming hostile troops attacking furiously with rifles, automatic weapons, and incendiary grenades. Accounting for 7 enemy dead in the immediate vicinity before his position was overrun and he himself fatally struck down, Pfc. Christianson, by his superb courage, valiant fighting spirit, and devotion to duty, was responsible for allowing the rest of the platoon time to man positions, build up a stronger defense on that flank, and repel the attack with 41 of the enemy destroyed, many more wounded and 3 taken prisoner. His self-sacrificing actions in the face of overwhelming odds sustain and enhance the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service. Pfc. Christianson gallantly gave his life for his country.

This cache is for the labs we have fostered over the years. Bob, our Velcro lab, was always at your side, Doc, a stretch for a lab, but he was Black, Bailey, 110 lbs. of pure pleasure, Hunter, our lover boy, he followed Tess (our chocolate lab) around like a love sick puppy, Ruger, was just a typical lab, Walker spent his life in an outdoor kennel, but he learned the pleasure of being a house lab very quickly, Shadow lived up to his name he was always behind you tripping you up whenever he could, and lastly Sirus aka &quot;Devil Dog&quot; he really lived up to that name. He was just a puppy and chewed on everything in site. When we took Sparky back (also one of our fosters) we decided our house was not big enough for 3 labs so we gave up fostering and also it got harder and harder to give them up because of course we are the perfect masters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is on private property.

investigative and energetic. They have long, luxurious blue and
tan&lt;br /&gt;
coats. This portable pooch is one of thge most popular
breeds.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;MURPHY, AUDIE L.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rank and organization:&lt;/b&gt; Second Lieuentant, U.S. Army, Co B 1 5th Infantry, 3d Infantry Division.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Place and date:&lt;/b&gt; Near Holtzwihr, France, 26 January 1945.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Entered service at:&lt;/b&gt; Dallas, Tex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Birth:&lt;/b&gt; Hunt County, near Kingston, Tex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;G.O. No.:&lt;/b&gt; 65, 9 August 1945.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Citation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
2d Lt. Murphy commanded Company B, which was attacked by 6 tanks and waves of infantry. 2d Lt. Murphy ordered his men to withdraw to prepared positions in a woods, while he remained forward at his command post and continued to give fire directions to the artillery by telephone. Behind him, to his right, one of our tank destroyers received a direct hit and began to burn. Its crew withdrew to the woods. 2d Lt. Murphy continued to direct artillery fire which killed large numbers of the advancing enemy infantry. With the enemy tanks abreast of his position, 2nd Lt. Murphy climbed on the burning tank destroyer, which was in danger of blowing up at any moment, and employed its .50 caliber machinegun against the enemy. He was alone and exposed to German fire from 3 sides, but his deadly fire killed dozens of Germans and caused their infantry attack to waver. The enemy tanks, losing infantry support, began to fall back. For an hour the Germans tried every available weapon to eliminate 2d Lt. Murphy, but he continued to hold his position and wiped out a squad which was trying to creep up unnoticed on his right flank. Germans reached as close as 10 yards, only to be mowed down by his fire. He received a leg wound, but ignored it and continued the single-handed fight until his ammunition was exhausted. He then made his way to his company, refused medical attention, and organized the company in a counterattack which forced the Germans to withdraw. His directing of artillery fire wiped out many of the enemy; he killed or wounded about 50. 2d Lt. Murphy's indomitable courage and his refusal to give an inch of ground saved his company from possible encirclement and destruction, and enabled it to hold the woods which had been the enemy's objective.

After his platoon had suffered heavy casualties and 3 other noncommissioned officers had become casualties, Cpl. York assumed command. Fearlessly leading 7 men, he charged with great daring a machinegun nest which was pouring deadly and incessant fire upon his platoon. In this heroic feat the machinegun nest was taken, together with 4 officers and 128 men and several guns.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Eastern Cottonwood if found throughout Wisconsin, though rarer
in the north, often forming extensive groves along waterways; will
grow on dry locations but makes most rapid growth on moist sites.
It is soft, light-weight with dark brown heartwood and thick,
nearly white sapwood, warps easily when drying and rots readily;
used for boxes, fencing, fuel, rough lumber for inside use, making
high-grade magazine paper for printing half-tone illustrations, and
is grown extensively for windbreaks owing to rapid growth and
adaptabilty to soil. In the spring it dispurses its white cottony
clusters all over WEST BEND!!! .Permission to place this cache was
given by Mike Kactro of the Washington County Parks/Planning
Department. As this section of the Eisenbahn Trail is maintained by
the Washington County Parks/Planning Dept., the “DNR
Placement Notification Form” has been submitted to the
Washington County Parks/Planning Department at the request of the

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rank and organization:&lt;/b&gt; Captain, U.S. Air Force, 4th Allied POW Wing,Pilot of an F-4C aircraft.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Place and date:&lt;/b&gt; North Vietnam, 9 November 1967.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Entered service at:&lt;/b&gt; Milwaukee, Wis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Birth:&lt;/b&gt; 13 April 1942 Milwaukee, Wis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;G.O. No.:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Citation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
While on a flight over North Vietnam, Capt. Sijan ejected from his disabled aircraft and successfully evaded capture for more than 6 weeks. During this time, he was seriously injured and suffered from shock and extreme weight loss due to lack of food. After being captured by North Vietnamese soldiers, Capt. Sijan was taken to a holding point for subsequent transfer to a prisoner of war camp. In his emaciated and crippled condition, he overpowered one of his guards and crawled into the jungle, only to be recaptured after several hours. He was then transferred to another prison camp where he was kept in solitary confinement and interrogated at length. During interrogation, he was severely tortured; however, he did not divulge any information to his captors. Capt. Sijan lapsed into delirium and was placed in the care of another prisoner. During his intermittent periods of consciousness until his death, he never complained of his physical condition and, on several occasions, spoke of future escape attempts. Capt. Sijan's extraordinary heroism and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty at the cost of his life are in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Air Force and reflect great credit upon himself and the U.S. Armed Forces.

&lt;h2&gt;Ingman, Einar H., Jr.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rank and organization:&lt;/b&gt; Sergeant (then Cpl.),U.S. Army Co. E, 17th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Place and date:&lt;/b&gt; Near Maltari, Korea, 26 Feburary 1951.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Entered service at:&lt;/b&gt; Tomahawk, Wis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Born:&lt;/b&gt; 6 October 1929, Milwaukee, Wis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;G.O. No.:&lt;/b&gt; 68, 2 August 1951.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Citation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Sgt. Ingman, a member of Company E. distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy. The 2 leading squads of the assault platoon of his company, while attacking a strongly fortified ridge held by the enemy, were pinned down by withering fire and both squad leaders and several men were wounded. Cpl. Ingman assumed command, reorganized and combined the 2 squads, then moved from 1 position to another, designating fields of fire and giving advice and encouragement to the men. Locating an enemy machinegun position that was raking his men with devastating fire he charged it alone, threw a grenade into the position, and killed the remaining crew with rifle fire. Another enemy machinegun opened fire approximately 15 yards away and inflicted additional casualties to the group and stopped the attack. When Cpl. Ingman charged the second position he was hit by grenade fragments and a hail of fire which seriously wounded him about the face and neck and knocked him to the ground. With incredible courage and stamina, he arose instantly and, using only his rifle, killed the entire guncrew before falling unconscious from his wounds. As a result of the singular action by Cpl. Ingman the defense of the enemy was broken, his squad secured its objective, and more than 100 hostile troops abandoned their weapons and fled in disorganized retreat. Cpl. Ingman's indomitable courage, extraordinary heroism, and superb leadership reflect the highest credit on himself and are in keeping with the esteemed traditions of the infantry and the U.S. Army.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A sturdy hunting dog, the Beagle should look like a foxhound in
miniature. His hunting ability, combined with a merry personality,
has made the beagle one of the more popular dogs. The most famous
Beagle of all is Snoppy from the comic strio &quot;Peanuts&quot;. Today's
Beagle comes in two height varieties (13 in. and 15 in.) and any
true hound color, including tri-color, red and white and lemon.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The well-conditioned middleweight athlete of dogdom, the Boxer is a
powerful dog with an intelligent and alert expression. While
theyare instinctive guardians, the Boxer loves to be with people.
This personality has allowed them to succeed as couriers during war
time and as seeing-eye dogs for the blind. Appearing in both fawn
and brindle colors, the Boxer is another one of the most popular
breeds.

&lt;h3&gt;Citation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action above and beyond the call of duty in the Southwest Pacific area from 10 October to 15 November 1944. Though assigned to duty as gunnery instructor and neither required nor expected to perform combat duty, Maj. Bong voluntarily and at his own urgent request engaged in repeated combat missions, including unusually hazardous sorties over Balikpapan, Borneo, and in the Leyte area of the Philippines. His aggressiveness and daring resulted in his shooting down 8 enemy airplanes during this period.

Cpl. Red Cloud, Company E, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action against the enemy. From his position on the point of a ridge immediately in front of the company command post he was the first to detect the approach of the Chinese Communist forces and give alarm as the emeny charged from a brush-covered area less than 100 feet from him. Springing up he delivered devastating pointblank automatic rifle fire into the advancing enemy.His accurate and intense fire checked this assault and gained time for the company to consolidate its defense. With utter fearlessness he maintained his firing position until severely wounded by enemy fire. Refusing assistance he pulled himself to his feet and wrapping his arm around a tree continued his deadly fire again, until he was fatally wounded. This heroic act stopped the enemy from overrunning his company's position and gained time for reorganization and evacuation of the wounded. Cpl. Red Cloud's dauntless courage and gallant self-sacrifice reflects the highest credit upon himself and upholds the esteemed traditions of the U.S. Army.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Labrador Retrievers, originally from Newfoundland, were initially
used in work alongside fisherman, helping to pull in nets and catch
fish that escaped from fishing lines. After being crossed with
Setters, Spaniels and other Retrievers, the Labrador honed Its
skillsas a true retriever. From this point in the breed's history,
&quot;Labs,&quot; as they are affectionately called, were bred primarily to
preform as an efficient retriever of game, with a stable
temperament suitable for a variety of activities beyond hunting.

Parking at N43 31.999&lt;br /&gt;
W088 10.825

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is dedicated to our good geocaching friend Digger Donna's
wonderdog Grodon.&lt;br /&gt;
Gordon was a tad upset with me when we did the popular dog series
in order of popularity Labs on up etc.&lt;br /&gt;
Cocker Spaniels came in at 25 in 2010, so I didn't place enough
caches. Don't tell Gordon that. He's number ONE, to Donna.
&lt;p&gt;Despite their small size, the Cocker Spaniel is still an active
Sporting breed that needs daily exercise. Regular brushing and a
trim every few months helps keep the coat free of mats. Cockers are
intelligent, gentle dogs that thrive as part of a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Geocache notification form #2500-118 has been submitted to
the Northern Kettle Moraine Forest Hq. of the DNR and received
approval for placement by Jason Quast.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Maple is located in Waupaca County in the town of Union. Sugar
Maples are known and loved for their brillant orange-red colors in
fall and their fame for producing the best sap for making maple
syrup. It also used in the manufacture of flooring, furniture and
fuel. It is found throughout the state on the better soils.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A large genus of trees and shrubs, some varieties not commonly
distinguished from each other: become large when growing along
streams and other moist places; scraggly, dwarfed shrubs when
growing in drier, less favorable sites. The wood is light brown,
soft, weak, flexible, coarse-grained; thin, whitish sapwood; used
for fuel, erosion control, ornamental planting, windbreaks and
charcoal.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Yellow Birch is common in the northern half of Wisconsin on
rich, moist uplands with scattered trees as far south as Sheboygan,
Sauk and Grant counties. The wood is heavy, strong, hard,
close-grained, light brown with pale sapwood; takes good polish;
used for flooring, interior finish, veneers, wooden ware, furniture
and small wooden novelties; excellent firewood.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Paper Birch is generally abundant throughout the state and
occurs chiefly on the better sand and gravel soils in mixture with
pine and aspen. They reach heights of 65 to 70 ft. Hard, strong,
tough, they are used for spools, toothpicks, toys, handles, paper
pulp, flooring, firewood and interior finish. Years ago, birch bark
was extensively used by northern Native Americans for canoes and
wigwams and for making baskets, cups, bags and other useful
utensils.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Box Elder is common throughout the state; grows naturally
along&lt;br /&gt;
streams and in cool ravines; fairly rapid-growing tree, prolific
in&lt;br /&gt;
reproduction.This is a soft wood and decays rapidly in contact
with&lt;br /&gt;
heat and moisture. It is used occasionally for fuel, but has
no&lt;br /&gt;
general commercial value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permission to place this cache was given by the Fond du

Oreo &amp; Zephyr's owner is kmhiker's hiking buddy. Oreo is a layed back lab who has one speed &quot;moderate&quot;. We lovingly decided that she was a state worker in a previous life. The only time she moves fast is if she picks up an interesting scent while out walking or if food is involved. Zephyr is a typical 4yr. old lab, full of boundless energy and loves to chase and play with all the other labs. They are members of what we like to call the &quot;Lab Pack&quot; Tess, Sparky, Oreo, Zephyr and the late Chico. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking co-ordinates for this cache are N43 36.965 W088 11.931 If this lot is full you can park at Zillmer Trail where a state sticker is required. This is a busy area during hunting season so please wear the appropriate clothing (50% blaze orange).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Geocache Notification Form has been submitted to the Northern Kettle Moraine State Forest headquarters of the Wisconsin DNR and received approval for placement by Jason Quast.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The PharmGirl (Anne) really welcomed us to geocaching. We met her at Highcliff State Park for the WGA camp out. Later she invited us to join the West Bend Ca$h Bash comittee. I am always amazed at her &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:!@#$@@$#@&quot;&gt;!@#$@@$#@&lt;/a&gt; &quot; puzzle caches. We concider her a good caching friend.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; At the 2009 Cash Bash, we were new cacher's. We were setting our goal that day to do 10 to 15 caches. At a cache where there was a large pine tree, we were on one side, and a few cachers on the other. Then I heard a voice. It sounded very familar voice. We went around to the other side, and I ask what his name is. He said &quot;Lu&quot; and I finished with &quot;Lucian van Elsen&quot; We haven't seen each other for over 20 years. We were good friends when I was the director at the Camp long Lake BSA Camp. WOW!!&lt;br /&gt;

This is the second in a series of 'Our love of Labs&quot; caches. We fostered Sparky for a lab rescue organization about 8 yrs ago and because the adopters could no longer keep him he was returned to us about 1 1/2 yrs ago and we decided to keep him. Sparky loves to wallow in mud puddles, we call him our resident mud duck. He can smell a mud puddle 100 yards away. We have planted this cache near his favorite puddle which we have renamed Lake Sparky and you will see why during the rainy season when you reach the parking co-ordinates. Parking co-ordinates are N43 37.890 W088 09.594 ish. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Geocache Notification Form has been submitted to Northern Kettle Moraine State Headquarters of the Wisconsin DNR and received approval for placement by Jason Quast.

After a trip to the Tower, I decided to introduce them to the great &quot;bakrdz&quot; of Hausehalter Lane and hit a few more caches and trails. The discovery at Chico's Bathtub was great! The kids had so much fun in the bathtub, the adults were forced to search for the cache. I let the others and Mrz. BakRdz do most of the searching. I spotted it from a bit of distance away. When Mrz was going to walk away from it I yelled to her to look at a certain spot. Ta-Da! She couldn't believe she missed it! Anyway, we cleaned up the kids after their &quot;baths&quot; and moved on to the next cache. By far our favorite discovery of the day. Thanks for bringing us here. Can see why it would be a favorite spot for dogs.

Lake&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
It is very winter friendly.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We &quot;the lab pack&quot; were hikeing on this trail sine the first shovel
of dirt was dug. Tess would be running around with Zephyr. Oreo
would be checking out the smells in the area. Sparky would be stuck
in the bushes, and making &quot;Sparky Angels&quot; in the gravel path, and
Chico would be looking after Oreo.&lt;br /&gt;
So enjoy this new gem in the Northern Unit.
&lt;p&gt;Permission to place this cache was give by Jason Quast of the
“DNR Northern Unit, Kettle Moraine State Forest
Headquarters”. The Geocache Notification Form has been
submitted to the Northern Kettle Moraine State Forest Headquarters
of the Wisconsin DNR. Resource managed lands require permission by
means of a notification form Congrats to GeoB1ll on the first to
find.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Another cache for your hike/bike pleasure. Enjoy the Beautiful surrpundings. In the spring/early summer look due south from the cache site. You will notice a telephone pole with a platform on top. If you have binoculars you will see a Ospray Nest. So I hope you are one of the lucky ones to see this.&lt;br /&gt;

still referred to within various plat books, online resources, and
maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the equipment has been updated within the last few
years, but the swingset is still original from many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child I played here on a regular basis, and now my family
visits here regulary as it's the closest park to our home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're visiting in spring, summer, or early fall take notice
of the beautiful flowers maintained by &quot;Friends of the Park&quot;. This
volunteer group maintains the flowers in many of the Berlin parks
and does an excellent job.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Since we have cached out most of our area, we decided to head to the next closest town with parks. Told the Girlz if they help me find 4 caches, we'd end the day with ice cream. This was our last stop. Girlz went to the playground to be on &quot;muggle patrol&quot; while I went in for the find. I must spend enough time with the CO because, despite this being a tricky little hide, I found it almost immediately. Signed the log, replaced the cache, and found a nearby bench to watch the Girlz throw sand on the slide and to log this find. Next stop for the nite? Despite my requests elsewhere...McDs for cones and a flurry for dad. Thanks for the &quot;easy&quot; one CJ. ;)

Thanks Ed for placing this cache.  This one had us stumped for a while but we eventually got are brains from being stuck.  Just about the only place you could place a cache in this park.  Thanks again Ed--I'll see you soon.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia: Eyes are organs that detect light, and send
signals along the optic nerve to the visual and other areas of the
brain. The simplest &quot;eyes&quot;, in even unicellular organisms, do
nothing but detect whether the surroundings are light or dark. Eyes
are generally adapted to the environment and lifestyle of the
organism which bears them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know the human eye can see &lt;b&gt;10
Million Colors?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kid Friendly geocache in High Cliff State Park between the
Horse/Bike trail and the Family Campground. This cache is located
within High Cliff State Park, so you will need a park sticker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache can be accessed very easily from the Family Campground
area. It can also be accessed from the Horse/Bike trail but this is
much more of a hike from the nearest trail parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take the trail around the rock wall and do not climb over
it. There is a break in the wall and a trail going through that
will allow you to easily access where the cache is hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This regular sized cache contains many trade items for kids
(both boys and girls).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please re-hide the cache as you found it so that it is not
accidentally found by campers and hikers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permission for this cache was granted by Jay Vosters, HCSP
Geocaching Coordinator. The WI DNR Geocache Notification Form has
been submitted via mail to Jason Wiese, park manager of High Cliff
State Park. Geocaches placed on Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resource managed lands require permission by means of a
notification form. Please print out a paper copy of the
notification form, fill in all required information, then submit it
to the land manager. The DNR Notification form and land manager
information can be obtained at: visit
link&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This Cache is a KFC. KFC is a designation that stands for Kid
Friendly Cache. (not to be confused with a popular chicken place)
It is a movement to keep the young ones wanting to stay active in
geocaching. Kids love to trade so having a cache of decent trading
size is a must. Also kids minds are like sponges wanting to soak up
all the information that they can fit in their heads. With that in
mind, please leave a little bit of knowledge for them to learn
about the environment they are walking in. Look at it as a living
classroom. Topics can be of any variety such as Nature, Geology, or
History.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winter Friendliness Rating: Will get buried
in the snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations &lt;b&gt;labrat_wr and Zuma&lt;/b&gt; on the co-FTF!&lt;/p&gt;

his castle. While the project was just getting underway, a major
causeway was built running through the Kings land from afar. This
interfered with the king's plans for a moat. Frustrated, the King
had a fence built around his un-finished project and a guard was
posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all that remains is a small watering hole along the road.
The fence is over-grown but if you look closely, you will see that
the Red-wing blackbirds now call this place their home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are passing by on US 41, Winneconne Ave Exit is your
easy-on, easy-off route to get to this cache.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Favorite fishing spots are most of the time held in top secret
and sometimes never ever shared. With this series of Geocaches, I
am going to share many of my favorite onshore fishing spots with
you. These are all locations along waterways that I have spent many
hours fishing on. All of these spots bring back wonderful childhood
memories of biking to the park and fishing until (sometimes past)
supper time. Some of the spots still produce excellent off-shore
fishing opportunities so you may just want to bring along your
pole. I will also share what kinds of fish you might expect to
cache (I mean catch!) at these locations. I will leave it up to you
to choose the bait or lure! Can't share every secret....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will rarely see an empty shoreline here at the Neenah dam
(which may cause you some heartburn while geocaching here!) We used
to fish here for hours and hours catching all sorts of different
fish including perch, sunfish, walleye, and of course carp. I
remember when we used to get down below the bridge (not as easy now
with the hospital &amp; bridge reconstruction over the years) and
fish right bellow the spillway and walk in the water when it was
shallow. Enjoy the view, and perhaps the company of an on-shore
fisherman or 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish you may catch here include:&lt;br /&gt;
- Pumpkinseed (sunfish) &amp; Bluegill&lt;br /&gt;
- Perch&lt;br /&gt;
- Rock bass&lt;br /&gt;
- Walleye&lt;br /&gt;
- Sheepshead&lt;br /&gt;
- Carp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring a pen to log your find. This is also a city park
with plenty of parking in the lot and some picnic tables &amp;
benches if you are looking for a nice place to eat your lunch.
Please return the cache exactly as you found it so others will
enjoy the challenge and so the muggles don't take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winter Friendliness Rating: Findable in all
seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations &lt;b&gt;huffinpuffin2&lt;/b&gt; on the FTF!&lt;/p&gt;

This is one of those cases where spot on coordinates and the right idea right away made an unusual quick find. That was great because I needed the ego boost with the number of DNFs I had experienced prior to this. TFTC! Keep the 4 Stars cheeto!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Favorite fishing spots are most of the time held in top secret
and sometimes never ever shared. With this series of Geocaches, I
am going to share many of my favorite onshore fishing spots with
you. These are all locations along waterways that I have spent many
hours fishing on. All of these spots bring back wonderful childhood
memories of biking to the park and fishing until (sometimes past)
supper time. Some of the spots still produce excellent off-shore
fishing opportunities so you may just want to bring along your
pole. I will also share what kinds of fish you might expect to
cache (I mean catch!) at these locations. I will leave it up to you
to choose the bait or lure! Can't share every secret....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith park is one of our favorite secrets. Little -cheeto- and I
have spent many mornings and evenings fishing on the nearby dock
and along this shoreline. The water is always calm when it's rough
elsewhere. There are always hungry rock bass and small mouth waitin
to be caught! As a teenager, I remember coming here and catching
over 100 rock bass under the nearby walk-bridges! Beware, you may
catch quite a few &lt;b&gt;weed&lt;/b&gt; bass here as well as some drift
&lt;b&gt;wood&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish you may catch here include:&lt;br /&gt;
- Bluegill&lt;br /&gt;
- Pumpkinseed (sunfish)&lt;br /&gt;
- Perch&lt;br /&gt;
- Rock bass&lt;br /&gt;
- Small Mouth Bass&lt;br /&gt;
- Large Mouth Bass&lt;br /&gt;
- White Bass&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a Micro-sized container and you should bring
a pen to log your find. Please return the cache as you found it so
others will enjoy the hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winter Friendliness Rating: Can get buried in
the snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations &lt;b&gt;Sagasu&lt;/b&gt; on the FTF!&lt;/p&gt;

I knew -cheeto- was eying up this dam spot too, so I called him in
on the set-up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you've done any caching in the area, you will no doubt have seen
this crazy place. The former resident and dam tender, Joe
Wimberger, tended the dam for Fox River Paper for 15 years, taking
up position in 1992 and retiring this year, 2009. Joe had decorated
the property with his own dam art and was more than half the way
across the spillway with his metal works when his tour came to an
end. He had installed some interesting sculptures of various
mediums, mostly metal and wood outdoor pieces, but certainly no dam
plastic!.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The new Tender, Martin, is also an artist in various media. While
he has been tasked with removing Joe's art to prevent eaglets from
swallowing what they might mistake for a fish, he has no intention
of completely stripping and removing all the art. Some will get
relocated to the back of the premises and some will stay. Take some
time to look at what's left of Joe's dam art and perhaps some of
Martin's dam new art, to see if there is anything that appeals to
you.&lt;br /&gt;

Oh, where to park??? Please do not park on Hwy CE.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3 or 4 caching teams may recognize the location, hide, and
container as I have turned a prior puzzle cache into a traditional
so others may enjoy the cache location.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a camo'ed medicine container that's larger than
a micro. Please bring a pencil to sign the log. There is room for a
geocoin or small trackable as well as small swag items.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to &lt;b&gt;Sagasu&lt;/b&gt; on the FTF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winter Friendliness Rating: Should be
findable in all seasons.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is not a puzzle cache&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When ya find a park that has no treasure what else can you do but get one in thar, yar. I found several parks in the area conspicuously void of caches and decided to put out a few easy ones. Besides, I need to take a break from the puzzles for a spell and place some tenable caches before I get put up by my fellow cachmates for making their caching adventures so danged adventurous! Hard for me to set a cache without adding in a little bit of something for good measure, however. So, rather than bore you with dry Van Zeeland family history I thought I'd just include a really cool map of the place where the name originated. And this brief bit of info from Wiki: Zeeland, also called Zealand in English, is a province of the Netherlands. The province, located in the south-west of the country, consists of a number of islands (hence its name, meaning &quot;sea-land&quot;) and a strip bordering Belgium. Its capital is Middelburg. Its population is about 380,000 and its area is about 2930 kmÇ, of which almost 1140 kmÇ is water. Large parts of Zeeland are below sea level. The last great flooding of the area was in 1953. Tourism is an important economic activity. Its sunny beaches make it a popular holiday destination in the summer. Most tourists are Germans. In some areas, the population quadruples in the summer. The coat of arms of Zeeland shows a lion half-emerged from water, and the text &quot;luctor et emergo&quot; (Latin for &quot;I struggle and I emerge&quot;).</groundspeak:long_description>

In light of recent events involving a certain celebrity, I finally decided on one: Squatter's Paradise!  I also decided to revive the ICU series, adding one more rung on the ladder there.&lt;br/&gt;To &quot;squat&quot; is to move in to an abandoned property and live there for &quot;free,&quot; although it is illegal in most places in the U.S.  When you arrive at the cache site you will see why this cache is aptly named.&lt;br/&gt;Just a note:  what ever your GPS says, DO NOT GO INTO OR ONTO ANY ROADWAY TO SEEK THIS CACHE.  Also please respect any private property that may be around.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>

mothers. Howie Hidem lies on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.
Dewie Findem lies on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. On Sundays,
the truth is told by both. You meet the two of them on the trail
while looking for a geocache. They give you clues as to a cache
that they have just hidden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the following statements, can you determine what day of the
week it is? Solving who says what is not necessarily needed, but
may come in handy depending on your thought process. In the puzzle,
if you think that the answer for statement #J is Friday, then J in
the coordinates will be replaced with the number 3 and so on.&lt;br /&gt;

I toiled with a number of names and themes including &quot;The Hideout,&quot; a series and a few others.  I finally decided that the only name that made sense was a tribute to &quot;High and Lois.&quot;  &lt;br/&gt;The original cache was a nemisis to me, as I had searched for it unsuccessfully more times than any other cache in the history of my caching.  Naturally, I'm thrilled to be able to occupy this spot.  The cache is not in the exact same spot, but is in the same park.  Happy hunting [:)] !</groundspeak:long_description>

You would think that having not one, not two, but three GPS units would keep me on track and knowing where I'm going... but alas, all is lost on my complete and total inability to tell direction (which is what makes me being a geocacher so funny).  North, South, East, &amp; West... you might just as well throw them into a hat when you ask me what direction we're going (although I can do ok during the day sometimes- as long as I can see the sun.  SO while out looking for the perfect hiding spot for a cache, I set my sights on a park I had been to a couple of times.  Nope!  Ended up here instead.  But at least now Schmedley and Mubo have a new place to play [:)].&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*****PLEASE REPLACE THE CACHE EXACTLY AS &amp; WHERE YOU FOUND IT!!!*****</groundspeak:long_description>

Being our first cache, we (or at least I) decided to place it close to home.  I love to watch people, and Schmedley is quite nosey, so we thought that a cache location where we could potentially see some cache hunters would be fun.  We do not live right next to this cache, but rather about 450 feet down the street.  If you should happen to see us out in the yard, feel free to stop by and give a quick &quot;Howdy!&quot;  This cache is also what I hope to be the first in a series of caches that are to be placed along common routes that I travel.  The cache is a camouflaged pill bottle, with room for small trade items and it contains a military patch for FTF.  To assist you I have decided to include a couple of clues that will hopefully not make the cache TOO easy to find :&amp;gt;)  Happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a one-liner in the ever popular Lame Joke Series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the area isn't the most fun to get into (and if your GPS tries to put in the middle of any nearby busy road-DON'T DO IT!), but I really like this one for more than one reason.  You're hidden from view (depending on where you park), it's kind of like nature in the middle of rushing new age technology, and it forces you to see the two of these in cohabitation-if you will.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I found the spot as I was driving by and just happened to see Vince (that's what I named him-you'll see who/what I mean when you get to the cache sight) just standing there all by himself.  Vince Woodruff as he is formally known, actually does have a friend or two, they just aren't as tall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please, oh please, place the cache back EXACTLY AS YOU FOUND IT.  This will make it the most fun for all subsequent cachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, enough with the back story about the cache sight as I know you're all dying to get to this joke.  Well, here it is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A peanut was walking in a dark wooded area late at night -</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>- He was assaulted!

about the possibility of putting on a workshop about placing caches
and going through the publication process.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The stars haven't aligned to do the workshop, so we decided to take
a different approach and put out a few caches designed to be
&quot;adopted&quot; by other cachers. The idea is, we transfer ownership of
this cache to you, and we help you (if you want) to take the cache
listing, modify it, and make it your own.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Until such time as this cache is adopted out, we will of course
maintain it as we do all our caches.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, if you always wanted to put out a cache but just haven't found
the time, now's the time! Drop us a line through the contact link
above or post a note to your cache log if you're interested in
adopting this listing.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is dedicated to stay at home dads and the children they care for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During our weekly Wednesday morning mall walk at Bay Park Square with some of the other dads from the NEW At Home Dads group, I happened to mention geocaching.  We talked a bit more about it while we walked, and just kind of left it at that.  However, when I checked the message board a week or so later there was some chatter about the possibility of doing our Wednesday morning walk as a geocaching trip.  One of the dads also mentioned that he had gotten into Letterboxing, and that it would be a fun outing as well.  Well, to make a longer story just plain long, we decided to meander around Barkhausen because it has both cahces and letterboxes.  It does not, however, have any hybrids.  So we bring you the Northeast Wisconsin At Home Dads Letterbox Hybrid cache.  This cache contains a stamp called &quot;Daddy's Hands&quot; which was made by Suamicoathomedad.  Please remember to bring your inkpad and stamp book if you intend to log the stamp as well.  PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THE STAMP!!!  This is a kid friendly cache so dads (and moms) be sure to bring the little ones out for a walk to find this .50 cal ammo box.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You will need a credit card to solve this puzzle. Almost
any credit card should work as long as it does not have a
continuous line of numbers. It has to have seperate sets of four
numbers.


&lt;p&gt;Take the second set of four digits from any card and arrange
them in ascending and then descending order to get two seperate
four digit numbers. Subtract the smaller of these two numbers from
the larger. Take the result and again arrange the digits in
ascending and descending order and repeat the entire process.
Continue doing this until your answer is the same as it was in the
previous step. You shouldn't have to do this more than seven times.
Now take the resulting four digit number and add the digits
together. Multiply your answer by five and add it to this North
coordinate. N44 43.067.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now take the last three digits in the final set of four numbers
on your card and arrange them in ascending and descending order.
Subtract the smaller number from the larger. Repeat until your
answer repeats itself as above. Take the resulting three digit

The villagers loved her dinners so much they encouraged her to set up a cookery for passersby as well. Hence, the banquet hall opened for weary knights to rest their bones while partaking of fabulous fare!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This should be a fairly easy find for the well traveled knights of Camelot. The cache is a nano, so be sure to bring a quill to scrawl your initials on the log.

It is a &quot;winter friendly&quot; camouflage container&lt;br/&gt;about 4&quot; in diameter and 6&quot; long.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of the settlement of the &quot;Toledo War,&quot; between Michigan and&lt;br/&gt;Ohio, most of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was granted to&lt;br/&gt;Michigan for the &quot;Toledo Strip&quot; which was granted to Ohio. Captain&lt;br/&gt;Thomas Cram, of the U.S. Corps of Topographical Engineers,&lt;br/&gt;conducted a reconnaissance exploration and established the Mile&lt;br/&gt;Corner Zero in 1840 and the route of the line in 1841. He made a&lt;br/&gt;treaty for passage with Chief Ca-Sha-O-Sha and his band of Ojibwa&lt;br/&gt;(Chippewa) near a large tamarack tree near the Mile Corner Zero at&lt;br/&gt;the Brule River. William Austin Burt, famed surveyor of the Upper&lt;br/&gt;Peninsula and inventor of the Solar Compass, conducted the actual&lt;br/&gt;survey in 1847 after again making treaty with Chief Ca-Sha-O-Sha.&lt;br/&gt;Burt inscribed the following message on the Treaty Tree: WM. A.&lt;br/&gt;BURT June 7, 1847 State Boundary The boundary was the subject of&lt;br/&gt;much litigation between Michigan and Wisconsin. The dispute was&lt;br/&gt;settled by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1926 and a&lt;br/&gt;Joint Boundary Commission of the two states permanently monumented&lt;br/&gt;the boundary in 1928. The Historical Site has been developed by the&lt;br/&gt;U.S. Forest Service. The site includes a picnic area and a boat&lt;br/&gt;landing. The latter serves Brule Lake and is a launching point for&lt;br/&gt;canoe travel down the Brule and Menominee rivers. It also served&lt;br/&gt;the Indians as a junction of overland trails with water routes. A&lt;br/&gt;dedication of the State Line Historical Site was held July 23,&lt;br/&gt;1964. Enjoy the hike and history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wi-geocaching.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache, located a few miles NE of Alberta, is not for the faint of heart or weak of limb. Access is via logging roads; a high clearance - and preferably four wheel drive - vehicle is recommended. At the cache site, there are significant and rapid elevation changes, only those in good physical condition should attempt the find. However, those willing and able to search for this cache will be rewarded with a unique area that few have seen. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There may be multiple ways to reach this cache, however, I would recommend you begin by turning onto Old US-41. A 1.8 mile drive will bring you to a branch to the right that leads 1.3 miles to the dead end that is the parking area. The cache is a short hike from there. Searchers should note that Plumbago Falls is a very rugged area. The cache is placed near the top and should require minimal climbing, however, there will still be some involved. Reaching the cache may be difficult for those who are wide of girth. Please be careful not to drop the cache when retrieving or replacing the cache - it will not be recoverable if dropped. I would recommend that, while at the falls, you bring a flashlight and explore the cave system that is found underneath the giant fallen boulders adjacent to the cache. Additionally, there are many small falls along the next quarter mile of the stream and I would recommend you undertake the hike and get the full experience. During the middle of summer, there is not much water over the falls, if possible, visit during the spring or fall. There are deer hunters in the area, do not attempt to find the last two weeks of November. Good luck and happy caching. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK41TAR - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 46° 39.035 W 088° 26.090</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This trail was constructed in memory of the late Dr. Pepper, a local veterinarian. It is a short hike with a somewhat marked trail to follow. The cache is a gallon sized container located a hundred feet or so off the trail. Please replace just as found. (No stick pile, maybe a few pine needles for camo.) If you keep following the trail you will come back out on the road you started on just a hundred yards or so from where the trail starts. Happy caching.
