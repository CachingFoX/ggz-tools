This Puzzle Cache will take you along the Molonglo and Murrumbidgee Rivers visiting caches All the Rivers Run numbers 1-5.

Also read below about the All the Rivers Run Challenge.

&quot;The Molonglo River rises on the western side of the Great Dividing Range of eastern Australia in the state of New South Wales. Its source is on the other side of the mountain range from where the Shoalhaven River rises, in Tallaganda state forest at ~1200 metres altitude. The Molonglo River flows from south to north before turning northwest, through the outskirts of the New South Wales town of Queanbeyan, where it picks up its major tributary the Queanbeyan River, and then continues through the nation's federal capital city of Canberra, where it has been dammed to form Lake Burley Griffin. It then flows on to empty into the Murrumbidgee River to the northwest of Canberra. Over its course the Molonglo River alternates between long broad floodplains and narrow rocky gorges several times. One of these floodplains is called the Molonglo Plain.

The river's name was recorded as the &quot;Yeal-am-bid-gie&quot; in 1820 by the explorer Charles Throsby. This was probably the collective local Ngunnawal language name for the river. (The suffix &quot;bidgee&quot; was common in Aboriginal names for rivers in the Canberra area and presumably means &quot;water&quot; or &quot;river&quot;.) The Moolinggolah people of the district around Captains Flat probably gave the Molonglo its name.

A major tributary of the Murray River, the Murrumbidgee travels 900 kilometres (559 mi) from the foot of Peppercorn Hill in the Fiery Range of the Snowy Mountains, through the ACT, and to a confluence with the Murray.

The reaches of the Murrumbidgee in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) are now affected by the complete elimination of large spring snow melt flows and a reduction of average annual flows of almost 50%, due to Tantangara Dam. Tantangara Dam was completed in 1960 on the headwaters of Murrumbidgee River and diverts approximately 99% of the river's flow at that point into Lake Eucumbene. This had extremely serious effects on native fish populations and other native aquatic life and has led to serious habitat loss. It is said that the Murrumbidgee River through the ACT is only half the river it used to be.

The Murrumbidgee River was known to Europeans before it was actually discovered by them. In 1820 the explorer Charles Throsby informed the Governor of New South Wales that he anticipated finding &quot;a considerable river of salt water (except at very wet seasons), called by the natives Mur-rum-big-gee&quot;. In the expedition journal, Throsby wrote as a marginal note: &quot;This river or stream is called by the natives Yeal-am-bid-gie ...&quot;. The river he had stumbled upon was in fact the Molonglo River, Throsby reached the actual river in April 1821.

In 1823, Brigade-Major John Ovens and Captain Mark Currie reached the upper Murrumbidgee when exploring south of Lake George.  In 1829, Charles Sturt and his party rowed and sailed down the length of the river from Narrandera to the Murray, and then down the Murray to the sea. They also rowed, sailing when possible, back up against the current.  The Murrumbidgee basin was opened to settlement in the 1830s and soon became an important farming area.&quot;

This puzzle requires you to visit caches All the Rivers Run Numbers 1-5. Within these traditional caches (all ammo boxes) you will find numbers that are needed to find this cache.

I have listed this cache as a Level 4 terrain based mainly on the cumulative terrain rating of the 5 necessary caches required to complete this multi. I am happy to adjust this based on cacher's opinion once they have completed this series.

The All the Rivers Run caches are located along the Molonglo River (starting from Coppins Crossing) and finishes along the Murrumbidgee River downstream where the 2 rivers join.

To get to this cache please do not not cross Private Property without permission. In the A.C.T. all major rivers have a corridor on either side that allows for public access (apart from a few exceptions) and for general protection of the surrounding natural environment.

Many thanks to Newberys who helped place this cache. He will log a find after someone has claimed the FTF

To find this cache use the following formula using the numbers gathered from caches All the Rivers Run Numbers 1-5.

South 35 13.DBA

East 148 57.EFC

 

ALL THE RIVERS RUN CHALLENGE.

As an added incentive I will give the first person a geocoin who completes this multi in 1 day (ie by foot/push bike between 12.01.01am to 11.59.59pm of the same day) and has signed (dated with the individual's personal signature - no stickers) all the cache log books (All the Rivers Run Numbers 1-5 plus this cache). I will check the logs to ensure claim is legitimate and of course I will have to rely upon your honesty in this matter also.

I am also designing a limited edition &quot;All the Rivers Run Challenge&quot; Pathtag to give to those cachers who meet the above requirements and there will be a Honor Roll listing with this page naming those successful people. You can attempt this challenge more than once but you will still need to sign the log books on the day of your attempt.

Parked car at Coppins crossing in the dark at 6am, then proceeded to walk to #1. Arrived there at 6:15am by torchlight, light drizzle. My eyes coped with the pre-dawn overcast sky very well and I could see Black Mountain tower glowing over in the distance and dawn just arising. Nice little views of the Molonglo too. Nice spot #1.
Walked back to car, got out the Mountain bike, crossed the Molonglo, and then proceeded to ride and slosh down the track on the Nth side for some considerable distance until I was nearly directly above #2. Dumped bike, then I zig-zagged down the very steep embankment following well defined GOAT tracks. Arrived at #2 well hidden a la natural. Relieved the cache of its TB and Geocoin. Nice spot #2. Arrived there 7:50am.
Consulted GPS, Hmmmm, I need to cross the river for nos 3&amp;4. So, I crossed there and then – LOTS of water flowing, but OK. Then it was a pretty severe bush bash, steep gullies, deep side creeks (all flowing vigoursly), having enough of this I made for MUCH higher ground and followed the fence line till I was on the spur leading to No. 3. Down the spur I went, found no. 3 – WOW – TOP SPOT! Seeing the water flow through here is quite something – it must be speccie when in flood.  Arrived there 8:55am. Admired the geology and scenery for a while, then back up the hill a bit and headed off to #4.
Down again to the rivers edge for #4, another nice location. Arrived there 9:30am. Then I crossed the river there and went straight up and up and up till I had clear grass and an easy stroll back to the bike, admiring the gorge scenery from the heights as I went.
A drizzly ride back to car, hopped in car and drove to near #5. Met the local farmer and had a good chat as I wandered down the road.  Onwards to #5 – approached from the high ground, got to GZ coords, but no cache – looked vertically down, hmmmm, it must be down there. So backtrack a bit, round I go, and there I find it – another nice little hide with trickiness. (easily retrieved in the wet as there were good footholds). #5 – another great spot. Arrived there at 12:10pm.

GZ calculated, off I go, some tracks, some bushbashing, some rocks, arrived at GZ – Hmmmmm, this is NOTHING like rBirtles would do, and nothing like the other wonderful locations. Blackberries and more blackberries in the middle of more blackberries. Hmmmm, consulted my numbers, yep, all OK.  Arrived there 1pm. 
(*^&amp;^%^%^()*&amp;(*^%(*&amp;&amp;* - There was clearly something wrong with the formula, and I had no idea what as the numbers and formula were quite specific. OK, whip out phone and call rBirtles – DAMN – no signal down here. UP I go and UP I go, ah, at last, a signal, nobody home. Double Damn. Wrung out all my clothes as by now there was a fair bit of rain, and I was literally STEAMING. Waited a while, tried again, nothing. Dejected, I then wandered off back to the car, found a much easier way back. Took off gaiters, boots etc etc, and was about to drive off, ring ring…..hello – Yay, mr. Birtles with the correct coords. A bit of chat, and OMG – That’s further than I went before, and the rain is still falling. Oh well, I’m wet, WARM &amp; steamy, still OK after some lunch, so off I went. Some considerable time later (hey, after 15km walking and 16km riding one is allowed to slow down a bit), I found the elusive cache. Arrived there 3:30pm.
ANOTHER nice location. Then returned back to car, completing 16km bike riding and 21km walking for the day with considerable rock climbing.

In summary, 2 FTF’s (#2 and final Puzzle), [red][b], one top series of spectacular caches with simply excellent locations[/b][/red], [blue][b] Easily #3 was the top spot, such a wonderful geological and scenic spot.[/b][/blue]

Thanks rBirtles for the wonderful series, the sustenance and the geocoin too, well done.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The top of Pig Hill is quite obvious and can be seen from a long distance due to a clearing on top. This is a well known site for hang glider and para glider pilots when the wind from the east is blowing.

Back in the 90s I was a hang glider and knew this spot well. This was the site I got over 9000 feet above sea level and couldn't go any higher due to I was touching the bottom of the clouds. As a pilot this is one place you do not want to go behind the hill as the is nowhere you can crash land except in the trees - and with limited road access for the rescuers.

At about 970m Pig Hill offers some beautiful views over Canberra and the surrounding farm lands. You may even be lucky getting to watch the hang gliders at work but then again on such days it may be difficult to grab the cache.

Access to Pig Hill can be made in two ways. The easiest is by accessing the Hill directly by car (4WD recommended although a 2WD could make it with care) via Doctors Flat Road and the turn off to the Hill at S35 13.537 E148 53.134. Or, if you want a nice hike you can walk up from the bottom of Mountain Creek Road which is at 620m elevation.

There is also a trig station on this hill so don't forget the camera and log it via Geocaching Australia.

It is also a nice spot to bring a picnic lunch and blanket and don't forget to follow Doctors Flat Road along a little to visit Capital Glimpses cache.

Cache is an ammo box.

Please do not interfere with the ribbons on the posts and on the trig itself. They are used for pilots to ensure that the wind coming up the hill and over it is in the right direction before they take off.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is the 5th part of the All the Rivers Run Series which starts along the Molonglo River and provides a part of the co-ordinates necessary to find All the Rivers Run Puzzle No. 1 on the Murrumbidgee River.

Access to this cache can be done from a number of directions so I'll leave it up to you on deciding which way you'll approach this one. No matter which direction you come please be aware parts of this area of the Molonglo River does have some steep sides and drops with loose ground. If you choose to do this cache at night be very careful.

To get to this cache please do not not cross Private Property without permission. In the A.C.T. all major rivers have a corridor on either side that allows for public access (apart from a few exceptions) and general protection of the natural environment.

Rocks can be slippery when wet so be please careful when attempting this cache

The cache is an ammo box and on the inside of the box is 1 number that will be used to obtain the final locations for All the Rivers Run Puzzle No. 1. Consider the number as F.

Some considerable time later (hey, after 15km walking and 16km riding one is allowed to slow down a bit), I found the elusive cache. Arrived there 3:30pm.
ANOTHER nice location. Then returned back to car, completing 16km bike riding and 21km walking for the day with considerable rock climbings.

In summary, 2 FTF’s (#2 and final Puzzle), [red][b], one top series of spectacular caches with simply excellent locations[/b][/red], [blue][b] Easily #3 was the top spot, such a wonderful geological and scenic spot.[/b][/blue]

Thanks rBirtles for the wonderful series, the sustenance and the geocoin too, well done.</groundspeak:text>

This cache is the 4th part of the All the Rivers Run Series which starts along the Molonglo River and provides a part of the co-ordinates necessary to find All the Rivers Run Puzzle No. 1 on the Murrumbidgee River.

Access to this cache can be done from a number of directions so I'll leave it up to you on deciding which way you'll approach this one. No matter which direction you come please be aware parts of this area of the Molonglo River does have some steep sides and drops with loose ground. If you choose to do this cache at night be very careful.

To get to this cache please do not not cross Private Property without permission. In the A.C.T. all major rivers have a corridor on either side that allows for public access (apart from a few exceptions) and general protection of the natural environment.

Also be careful when it has rained or is raining as the river levels may rise suddenly. Expect a few blackberry bushes along the way but in most circumstances thety can be avoided.

The cache is an ammo box and on the inside of the box is 1 number that will be used to obtain the final locations for All the Rivers Run Puzzle No. 1.

Consider this number as E.


ALL THE RIVERS RUN CHALLENGE.

As an added incentive I will give the first person a geocoin who completes this multi in 1 day (ie by foot/push bike between 12.01.01am to 11.59.59pm of the same day) and has signed (dated with the individual's personal signature - no stickers) all the cache log books (All the Rivers Run Numbers 1-5 and Puzzle No.1). I will check the logs to ensure claim is legitimate and of course I will have to rely upon your honesty in this matter also.

I am also seriously considering making a limited edition &quot;All the Rivers Run Challenge&quot; pathtag to give to those cachers who meet the above requirements and there will be a Honor Roll listing with the All the Rivers Run Puzzle No. 1 webpage naming those successful people.

You can attempt this challenge more than once but you will still need to sign the log books on the day of your attempt.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Attempted to locate this cache today from the other side of the river but it was too dangerous to cross as it's very fast flowing and full from the previous heavy rains - and I was only 150 metres away from it $#@!*&amp;.  Was hoping to locate the last three caches of this puzzle today but it was all too difficult. The water is flowing right up to the steep rock faces making it too dangerous to climb the slippery rocks.  Will try again in the summer time when the river should be flowing far less. Thanks RBirtles - I think?</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Logs pretty much the same for all as I DID THEM ALL IN THE ONE DAY. Pics taken for all too.

Parked car at Coppins crossing in the dark at 6am, then proceeded to walk to #1. Arrived there at 6:15am by torchlight, light drizzle. My eyes coped with the pre-dawn overcast sky very well and I could see Black Mountain tower glowing over in the distance and dawn just arising. Nice little views of the Molonglo too. Nice spot #1.
Walked back to car, got out the Mountain bike, crossed the Molonglo, and then proceeded to ride and slosh down the track on the Nth side for some considerable distance until I was nearly directly above #2. Dumped bike, then I zig-zagged down the very steep embankment following well defined GOAT tracks. Arrived at #2 well hidden a la natural. Relieved the cache of its TB and Geocoin. Nice spot #2. Arrived there 7:50am.
Consulted GPS, Hmmmm, I need to cross the river for nos 3&amp;4. So, I crossed there and then – LOTS of water flowing, but OK. Then it was a pretty severe bush bash, steep gullies, deep side creeks (all flowing vigoursly), having enough of this I made for MUCH higher ground and followed the fence line till I was on the spur leading to No. 3. Down the spur I went, found no. 3 – WOW – TOP SPOT! Seeing the water flow through here is quite something – it must be speccie when in flood.  Arrived there 8:55am. Admired the geology and scenery for a while, then back up the hill a bit and headed off to #4.
Down again to the rivers edge for #4, another nice location. Arrived there 9:30am. Then I crossed the river there and went straight up and up and up till I had clear grass and an easy stroll back to the bike, admiring the gorge scenery from the heights as I went.
A drizzly ride back to car, hopped in car and drove to near #5. Met the local farmer and had a good chat as I wandered down the road.  Onwards to #5 – approached from the high ground, got to GZ coords, but no cache – looked vertically down, hmmmm, it must be down there. So backtrack a bit, round I go, and there I find it – another nice little hide with trickiness. (easily retrieved in the wet as there were good footholds). #5 – another great spot. Arrived there at 12:10pm.

GZ calculated, off I go, some tracks, some bushbashing, some rocks, arrived at GZ – Hmmmmm, this is NOTHING like rBirtles would do, and nothing like the other wonderful locations. Blackberries and more blackberries in the middle of more blackberries. Hmmmm, consulted my numbers, yep, all OK.  Arrived there 1pm. 
(*^&amp;^%^%^()*&amp;(*^%(*&amp;&amp;* - There was clearly something wrong with the formula, and I had no idea what as the numbers and formula were quite specific. OK, whip out phone and call rBirtles – DAMN – no signal down here. UP I go and UP I go, ah, at last, a signal, nobody home. Double Damn. Wrung out all my clothes as by now there was a fair bit of rain, and I was literally STEAMING. Waited a while, tried again, nothing. Dejected, I then wandered off back to the car, found a much easier way back. Took off gaiters, boots etc etc, and was about to drive off, ring ring…..hello – Yay, mr. Birtles with the correct coords. A bit of chat, and OMG – That’s further than I went before, and the rain is still falling. Oh well, I’m wet, WARM &amp; steamy, still OK after some lunch, so off I went.

Blackberries and more blackberries in the middle of more blackberries. Hmmmm, consulted my numbers, yep, all OK.  Arrived there 1pm. 
(*^&amp;^%^%^()*&amp;(*^%(*&amp;&amp;* - There was clearly something wrong with the formula, and I had no idea what as the numbers and formula were quite specific. OK, whip out phone and call rBirtles – DAMN – no signal down here. UP I go and UP I go, ah, at last, a signal, nobody home. Double Damn. Wrung out all my clothes as by now there was a fair bit of rain, and I was literally STEAMING. Waited a while, tried again, nothing. Dejected, I then wandered off back to the car, found a much easier way back. Took off gaiters, boots etc etc, and was about to drive off, ring ring…..hello – Yay, mr. Birtles with the correct coords. A bit of chat, and OMG – That’s further than I went before, and the rain is still falling. Oh well, I’m wet, WARM &amp; steamy, still OK after some lunch, so off I went. Some considerable time later (hey, after 15km walking and 16km riding one is allowed to slow down a bit), I found the elusive cache. Arrived there 3:30pm.
ANOTHER nice location. Then returned back to car, completing 16km bike riding and 21km walking for the day with considerable rock climbing.

In summary, 2 FTF’s (#2 and final Puzzle), [red][b], one top series of spectacular caches with simply excellent locations[/b][/red], [blue][b] Easily #3 was the top spot, such a wonderful geological and scenic spot.[/b][/blue]

Thanks rBirtles for the wonderful series, the sustenance and the geocoin too, well done.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A photo on the raining day of placing the cache. Will get a better one once I get back out there.

This cache site is bigger, better and harder than Corpora Cavernosa I.

Located near the Cotter Dam this site may go underwater in about 2 years time once the dam wall has been built and the waters rise.

Blackberries are everywhere in this area so long pants and gaiters would be recommended. Although getting to the cache may be a bit difficult some planning will make the task a bit easier. The cache is an ammo box and I have left a big box of bandaids and antiseptic cream as part of the contents.

Many thanks goes to TankEngine who informed me of this rock formation while seeking out a cache hide for his multicache Cotter Catchment II. I stronglly suggest that you do the first part of his cache first in order to avoid unnecessary backtracking.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Knowing the terrain and amount of blackberries, I came in from the nearby gate (only a short easy walk) and arrived above the rock. Hmmmm - I'm glad I didn't attempt this IN THE DARK!!!!!!. I also had long pants, gaiters and a balancing stick, an easy scramble down to the rock. Quite a view below to the creek. Thanks for the rock, cache &amp; view.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I saw this rock form many years ago and had a laugh. Couldn't resist preparing a cache for this area when I knew I was going to be in the vicinity.

There are a few blackberry vines to contend with depending upon your approach but overall not a hard cache to get to.

Parking on the side of the road is possible but please be careful when crossing and getting the car back on the road.

While in this area feel free to pop by and examine the Department of Interior Rural Bench Mark R561 - See Waypoint section for details.</groundspeak:long_description>
