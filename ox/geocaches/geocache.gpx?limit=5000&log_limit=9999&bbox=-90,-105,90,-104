This cache is located at **8,240 feet!**
The hike is straight up, but is on a trail for most of the way.
There are signs posted to not trespass off of the trail, you can not leave the trail until you get past the land owned by the YMCA,it's about .2 miles.
Park at 37° 56.903N / 104° 59.752W
This is the parking for Millset Trail-head, the entrance/parking area is approximately 200feet BEFORE mileage marker #24 on the left side of the road, for those of you who don't want to bother using the coordinated posted above. </groundspeak:long_description>

They vary in difficulty but are all fun hides. There are some great caches down here and there is a really great difficulty 5 (Bear of a Cache (GC1KTPX Premium Member Cache)) not too far away.  Enjoy the hunt!

A sentry is a guard, especially a soldier posted at a given spot to prevent the passage of unauthorized persons.  A palisades is a high cliff or a fortified structure.  Once you get to the cache area you might see the cache's connection.


Enjoy the views and other great caches in the area:

It is Safe (GC1KCJC)
Bear of a Cache (GC1KTPX) Premium Member Cache (One of our favorites)

and of course the rest of the Shy Anne series.

Parking is available at the cache but please be careful since this is a busy road.  There are a lot of &quot;unauthorized persons&quot; walking by so be discrete.

Bring tweezers to help with the log extraction.

Please place back as found for the next Cacher to enjoy.

Congratulations to rob14erguy for FTF.</groundspeak:long_description>

His heroic actions saved the lives of a woman and her grand daughter while they played in the backyard directly in the truck's path.

&lt;br/&gt;
 This spot was picked by Grand High Pobah himself.
Greaspot and Team Teman were down with GHP doing some caching in
the Springs. It was his Birthday, and Team Teman and Greasepot gave
him a small container for his birthday! While searching for other
caches, they placed one just along the Mt. Cutler Trail.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Unluckily, this area is restricted to micro caches by the City. So
I contacted the city and was unable to convince them at this time
to allow a small cache. So I went up to replace the small cache
with a micro.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It looks like the original cache was taken by the trail crew, as I
was unable to located it, even with a hint. But, in honor of Grand
High Pobah's Birthday, I placed a micro just a few feet from where
the original cache was hidden. And even better: now he can find
this micro!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I placed this during a thunderstorm, so the coordinates may be a
little rough. Please feel free to let me know if you get more
accurate readings.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In the process of checking the location for Mt. Cutler trail, I
came across this neat site, that includes GPX files to download for
trails at etrailmaps.com&lt;br/&gt;
Page
with GPX file for Mt. Cutler and more&lt;br/&gt;

This is #5 in the Peekin Robot series down in the Springs. joining
a few of the same series from the Denver area.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please try to be discreet -- the muggles will be the biggest
challenge for keeping this cache &quot;in play&quot; -- evenings and weekends
might be you best bet for hunting this one.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please rehide well! Many muggles! We want this to
last!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;The Adventures of Buddy Love, Geo Hound Extraordinaire.
Part 1&lt;/b&gt;



Buddy, was wandering through unfamiliar territory.
Yet this ally looked strangely familiar, just like all the other
allies in this part of the world. With its gravy-soaked trash and
urine coated fire hydrants, he could just as well been in East L.A.
as here in southern Colorado Springs. He needed a drink; bad!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;


As he reached the end of the block and rounded the corner he
thought of his favorite watering hole. It was just a few blocks and
a lifetime away. It was there that he met Snow Belle for the first
time. She was taking a well deserved nap under a picnic table in
the park. Her golden blond curls were gently waving in the soft
breeze. He could still smell her wonderful, alluring natural
fragrance.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Had it not been for L.U.K.E., they might have had a chance. But
fate was a cruel thing, and it had not spared him any of its twist
and turns. Buddy and Snow Belle had been torn apart after a
harrowing adventure through brambles and deep rivers. Just as their
love for one another reached its apex and they felt that all was
right with the world, a dark force emerged and their lives would
never be the same.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Buddy dashed through the woods, hoping against all hope. Would she
have received his message, would she have returned to meet him
there? Now only a stream separated him from the picnic table. He
picked his way down the embankment. When he reached the bottom he
lapped from the cold stream until he had his fill then climbed up
the other side. The place where he expected to find her was bare
except for a candy wrapper buried in a pile of dead leaves from the
previous fall.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;



He knew now that he was the only one left. The only
chance to rescue Snow Belle and thwart the evil plans.


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
But if he failed…&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
He must leave a trail of clues! He must pass on the knowledge that
he alone possessed in the hopes that another would follow in his
footsteps. He removed the vial from his vest pocket and poured its
deadly contents on the ground. After scratching his first clue onto
a small piece a paper and placing it into the vial he hid it. Then
he crawled under the nearby picnic bench and fell asleep. He
dreamed of better days.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Search Low, at the base of the yucca, as in under it. The Yucca should have a board that points right to the cache container's location, like a hand. Approach from the East, and kneel down, and reach under the yucca leaves for it. Container is a black 35mm film container, standing up, instead of lying down. Should be about 6 inches into the under brush/leaves.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

We wanted to place a cache there, but it was too close to the last cache, but it is worth stopping here to investigate on your way to this cache.

A really good mtn hike and historic scene. The hike was beautiful and the weather cooperated for the return hike. I would not recommend this after snowfall or rain.
Cache was well hidden in plain sight! Kudos!Definately a good training exercise for newbies!

This is a high muggle area. You are very exposed here. Best advice
is to park your vehicle on the south side of the street, facing
east, as close to GZ as possible.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO NOT leave the sidewalk! Your best bet to find this cache
is to sit on the retaining wall. Do not move the cap stones on the
wall!

&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The log is very very very small, and will require tweezers to
extract it. Please log with initials only to save space.&lt;/b&gt;

Neat to see a cache find a home here. This is definitely a tricky one! There was a piece of toy that had me going for a moment. After a bunch more searching, got a line on it.

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Chapter 5-Advice from a Caterpillar: Alice comes upon a mushroom and sitting on it is a Caterpillar smoking a hookah. The Caterpillar questions Alice and she admits to her current identity crisis, compounded by her inability to remember a poem. Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to her usual height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

after one of his series :) ).

     - got to replace this cache. Sorry about the delay. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Please note the new terrain rating - not as kid friendly
anymore&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; I moved it a ways from the spot where it was
muggled. I scraped off the scratched up paint and put on a new coat
of camo-tape. It has been refilled, and stocked with a new
notebook. So, except for the shell, it is a new cache. 
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Have you been waiting for a large geocache so you could trade
bigger items?&lt;br/&gt;
For the holiday's I had some frineds give me a 5-gallon bucket and
2 cans of plastic spray-paint: 1 green, 1 black. Cool!&lt;br/&gt;
I painted it. I was told it didn't have enough green. So I
touched-up the paint and added more green areas. I found that the
paint scratches off very easily, so please be careful! I also took
a dremmel to the lid and bucket to the lid would be reasonable to
pull off and put on.&lt;br/&gt;
Please make sure to rehide it well!&lt;br/&gt;
Starting with: a nerf-football, a DVD, a stuffed-animal, and a
bunch of other stuff. &lt;br/&gt;

Met up the Mr of Abunai, he on the way down back from the cache as I was headed up.
Discovered the Cache Movers TB, but already did Key to my hearts caches, so I left it behind for the next person.
Nice to see new hides!  Signed the log.  Thanks for the cache!
Oh - noticed scented bubbles in the cache - these should probably be removed soon - bubbles can leak and mess up everything in the cache, and the scent might attract animals - even if they do sound fun!</groundspeak:text>

This container was

GCGHMZ &quot;Colorado Keychain Exchange II at Cragmor&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It was missing since about November 2006. On 12/24/2007, we came
across the ammo can, just sitting out in the open about 40' from
the apartments. It was sitting in about 1/4&quot; of dried mud. There
was a note in the cache about being found in July 2007 - but
nothing was logged online.&lt;br/&gt;
It was pretty much as I remember it, except the TB and the coin
were missing. Plenty of keychains still in the box. The log was in
poor shape, but it pretty much had been when I'd found the first
time in April 2006.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So a new log has been put in the cache. I felt a need to try to
place the cache back in a similar way as it was originally hidden.
Well, the spot it had been hidden has a newer cache, so that spot
was out. &lt;br/&gt;
I checked the maps. I found a ridge that should have a similar
view, about 1/2 mile North of the original hide. I checked with
HCA, and he said the spot was clear for a new cache. I headed out
in the light snow and very cold temperatures.&lt;br/&gt;
The first spot I parked didn't seem quite right. So I went back
down a litte ways. I wound up going down a little trail and back up
a pretty steep hill to get to the spot. Once I got there, I found a
decent hiding spot within about 30 feet of where I had estimated
from the map. No, it is not hidden under an abandoned couch this
time. I figured that part of the orginial hide needed to be
corrected :) When I hiked back along the ridge, it took me right
near where I parked. Unluckily, they are building houses there, so
that access is likely go away. You may have to park back at the
little circle and work your way down.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to bring keychains to trade!

Christopher Robbins

He is boy for whom Winnie-the-Pooh was originally written. He is also a part of the stories and poems written by his father A.A. Milne. He is the master of the 100 Acre Woods. Christopher Robin’s address in the forest is – Top of the Forest (High Ground), 100 Acre Wood East. He is everyone’s best friend and mostly indulges in activities to help his friends to get them out of tricky situations, most of the times it’s the silly old Pooh bear that he helps. He will help Pooh collect honey, he will rescue Roo &amp; Tigger when they are stuck in high trees in the forest and shall nail Eeyore’s tail. His favorite food is probably Birthday cake and one of his favorite things to do is hosting birthday and hero parties. But what he likes doing best is nothing; &quot;It means just going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not bothering&quot;.
First cache in a new series.  This one should be easy to locate, just watch out for muggles from the nearby dentists office.

This cache contains a collection of small animals and pencils.  It will also start life with multiple trackable items.</groundspeak:long_description>

Cool trail and view of the stream.  Really enjoy caching this area of Colorado.

     - with camo tape on the lid.&lt;br/&gt;
This was a fantastic group effort. I brought a cache, almost ready
to go - but I forgot the stash-note. I was in luck, as MrCOgeo had
a page of them with him. I cut off one with my swiss-army knife,
and it was ready to go. Filled with a number of items, mostly
dollar-store toys. A nice stop along the way.&lt;br/&gt;
On our way over, we saw 2 deer - who continued to walk towards us
when we got near. They did not spook the way you would expect. We
wondered if they had been hand fed a number of times. We also
heard, and saw a number of coyotes as we wandered to this
area.&lt;br/&gt;
We all pitched in for the hide - giving a bit of camo to hide it
from muggles&lt;br/&gt;

Went by one spot that seemed likely. We decided to go back and check it after I chased down zero just a few feet away. I went around and spotted it. Showed KB with a shadow where it was. Nice hide! Wrote small. There is room for probably only one more find on the log. Day 56, if I'm correct. Thanks for the cache! Signed the log. KB+Witz with Pirate #2+3</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We needed an X to round out a set of finds. So we decided to hide
an X cache for each other, and perhaps help out other cachers too!
We both found the other cache before it was listed, but that still
leaves the official First-to-Find open. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
What do you need an X for? The 30 points on a triple letter score,
of course! And maybe you might want to look at ALR-cache 176M6 ; or
if you are heading a little North, look at 13JHC &lt;br/&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Day 111. We had gone to a high school foot ball game earlier - now we wanted to get a cache. KB picked this one as not too far away. I was pretty sure I knew the general location based on the name, and this was confirmed a little later as we checked the description. Got to the area, and found the secret trail to get to the area. Went down a little to use the cute crossover to the path. Got to the spot and started searching. I wondered if it could be there or there or there. Well, after I move away from the last there, KB came over and spotted it right where I'd been standing last! Sneaky! I told KB this container looked similar to another one I'd seen. I did my best to hold onto the bottom, worrying about losing it. Seems it has been a problem before on 7/30, so my fears were well grounded. We got it! Then I noticed some odd colors in the big tree about 100 feet away. Like an RV was covered up there or something. Got closer and wondered if it were some sort of kid's club house. Then I saw what looked like camping equipment. That was close enough. I waved the rest of the group off from getting any closer. It might be somebody living there, and we didn't want to give them any reason to worry that we were bothering them. Thanks for the cache! Signed the log. KB+Witz with Pirate #2+3</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br/&gt;
When 8888 went missing, little did the muggle who took it realize
that this cache is a Hydra!&lt;br/&gt;
When the mythical beast, the Hydra had a head cut off, 3 heads grew
back in that spot.&lt;br/&gt;
8888 is back as a micro, and has spawned this cache of the same
size and type as the original as Hydra head #2.&lt;br/&gt;
Off an openspace path along a stream behind some houses.

the only one of it's type in the area (by me) 

&lt;br/&gt;
A unique micro - almost a small - can hold just a few very small
items. There are 3 small trade items already in the
container.&lt;br/&gt;
This container may take some real searching. I made two of these
containers, so when you have found one, the opposite one is very
easy!&lt;br/&gt;
Please take the time to make sure you put it back so the contents
are not showing.&lt;br/&gt;
Placed in time for the Feb.06 Event right nearby - to make sure
everyone will have a cache to find!&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Eeyore&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Eeyore is a donkey and for some he is their favourite Pooh
character amongst all the others. He is a blue-gray donkey, about 3
years in age and stands 18 inches tall &amp; 27 inches in length.
He is originally like the other Pooh character stuffed with
sawdust. His appearance is highlighted by a small light pink bow on
his tail. He is an intelligent animal but tends to keep to himself.
Eeyore is the extremely gloomy donkey and has a very bad habit of
losing his tail! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Mostly he tends to depend on his friends to find his lost tail for
him and thereafter Christopher Robin fixes his tail using a drawing
pin. What he simple adores is that his friends remember him on his
birthday and celebrate it with him. He often says “Thanks for
noticin’ me” and “Oh, well”. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Log only, &lt;b&gt;BYOP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you have the time, there are several excellent caches further up
the trail.</groundspeak:long_description>

find with my pirates was right in this area: GCMB3V &quot;dirt's little
buddy&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
Not knowing much about the game, I tried a micro as my second
search. It did take a long time, luckily the hide wasn't too bad
and the clue was very good. Unluckily, the cache got muggled not
that many months after, and was eventually archived by the
admins.&lt;br/&gt;
Well, I've always felt this was a nice area for a caches, and I
finally got a chance to place one. We hid this one so that it may
be a bit challenging, we hope. Enjoy searching! Try to be careful
of muggles seeing too much - and please hide it back the way you
found it! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Hartsel Dr. is the name of the road that goes around the mall - if
you've ever checked you receipt from the K.S. Grocery Store, you
will see Hartsel as the address. A little play on words, and you
get the name of the cache :) &lt;br/&gt;
Also on the receipt, you will notice TXP - pay extra taxes at this
KS&lt;br/&gt;

This is #3 in the Peekin Robot series down in the Springs. joining
a few of the same series from the Denver area. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please try to be discreet -- the muggles will be the biggest
challenge for keeping this cache &quot;in play&quot; -- evenings and weekends
might be you best bet for hunting this one. &lt;br/&gt;

Castle Rock.&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks again to

Vorticity for the great container!&lt;br/&gt;
We placed this pretty near the house of a friend of Pirate #1. The
friend has gone out caching with us. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Log-only - Contains pencils (at least for now!). While the cache is
a log-only micro, the container is close to the size of a regular
cache.&lt;br/&gt;
This is very similar to a certain &quot;P.O.&quot; cache down the hill from
the Sun Bird in Rockrimmon. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Warning: may be a little surprising when you open the outer cache.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Enjoy the cache! &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
This is #2 in the Peekin Robot series down in the Springs. joining
a few of the same series from the Denver area. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please try to be discreet -- the muggles will be the biggest
challenge for keeping this cache &quot;in play&quot; -- evenings and weekends
might be you best bet for hunting this one. &lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">At the fork of the 'secret path': a walking trail along a drainage
ditch in Briargate. There is a packed-earth trail going uphill and
down from here, dividing two developments neatly in half. A paved
path forks off to meander through Briargate to the East. Some of
the entrances to this path are small sidewalks leading between
houses, and you might never know it was there, that is why we call
it the 'secret path'.&lt;br/&gt;
It is a screw-top tupperware-style container. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
2005-03-15 (Ides of March) Cache was muggled and returned a second
time a few days ago - lucky! I've camo-taped the container, and
moved it about 10 feet North - the coordinates listed are the new
location. Please be extra careful to hide it from view in this
muggle-prone area! Also watch out for the metal stake in the ground
at this location.&lt;br/&gt;
Added &quot;(Secret Trail)&quot; to name.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Original placement 9/24/2005&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
9/1/2006 - replaced the container is a slightly different spot.
Hopefully this will keep it from being taken.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
11/11/2007 replaced with a small container&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
6/14/2008 replaced with another small container&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PLEASE REHIDE VERY WELL - MUGGLE PRONE AREA&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

In this same area, I had a cache called &quot;S-Witz It On&quot;. That cache
just plumb wore out, being the weaker of the twins. So I decided it
was time to take it down and see if it will come back in a new
spot. But I wanted cachers to have a cache to find in the spot. So
enter a new cache. Smaller than a 35mm. BYOP Happy searching!

neighborhood. Bring a bag of bread if you want to make the ducks
happy. You can also get some birdwatching in. Beware of muggles out
walking their dogs at all hours. You are searching for a 1 gallon
plastic ice cream bucket, but you won't find it! Well, maybe you
will. Easy and fun for kids, prepare for the possibility of puddle
jumping in the area.&lt;br/&gt;
Please rehide well!&lt;br/&gt;

 Accepting all gecachers to find the new container! &lt;i&gt;(You may log
this as a new find even if you found one of the previous versions
of this cache)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
6/10/2007 - moved outside the new fence a fence that came after I
hid the original cache. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
5/8/2007 - New spot in the general area, new container (changed
hide date from 10/4/2005 to 5/8/2007)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
6/17/2006 - New spot in the same location. Rebuilt after being
muggled. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
5/12/2006 - for all those who have worried about this spot being
built up, I found out later that this is open space/park. This was
confirmed today in the Gazette: it listed that a park will be built
here, &quot;John Venezia Park&quot;. From the map, it looks like the cache is
just outside the area to be built up (likely due to the floodway).
We will keep an eye on the area, as construction is slated to begin
next year. &lt;br/&gt;

When The Witz-ing Hour went missing, little did the muggle who took
it realize that this cache is a Hydra!&lt;br/&gt;
When the mythical beast, the Hydra had a head cut off, 3 heads grew
back in that spot.&lt;br/&gt;
The Witz-ing Hour is back as a small, and has spawned this Micro
cache as a revenge and as Hydra head #3.&lt;br/&gt;
On the far end of a large dranage area. As always, use caution if
there is any concern of high water!

&lt;br/&gt;
When The Witz-ing Hour went missing this last time, little did the
muggle who took it realize that this cache is a Hydra!&lt;br/&gt;
When the mythical beast, the Hydra had a head cut off, 3 heads grew
back in that spot.&lt;br/&gt;
The Witz-ing Hour is back as a small, and has spawned this cache of
the same size and type as the original as Hydra head #2. At one end
of a large dranage area, near the new hospital. As always, use
caution if there is any concern of high water! &lt;br/&gt;

Something odd going on at the cache location. Does not look family-friendly. But I guess it might keep the muggles away. I seriously suspect it was all fake and staged - but looks pretty convincing. Certainly not a spot I wanted to hang around. Last one of the day. Turns out I got 50, when I hadn't planned to get any. Thanks for the cache and the cache run! Glad I could help!

     Witz-Pedition!&lt;br/&gt;
I built this out to hide in the new Spruce Mountain open space
during my first excursion to this area. But it was the second trip
for the mtn_goat team - which helped things go very well. Team
mtn_goat and I went up and managed to get all the caches - and
decided to hide this one on the 'lonlier' side of the loop.&lt;br/&gt;
So the Witz is me - Mr.WitzAbout&lt;br/&gt;
The Goat is team mtn_goat.&lt;br/&gt;
The Way the goat went is the other part of the loop. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Many thanks to mtn_goat for the adding to the fun of the first
Witz-Pedition - and to being a co-hider for this cache.&lt;br/&gt;
It is a fully camo-taped hex-plastic container filled with a varied
of simple toys and items. &lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Well, there must be some fate going on for me to win this ammo box.
Considering I often put up items for raffle at the events down by
me, and don't accept them if I am the winner - it works out well
that I won this at the Denver event - because it is the only way I
would win one at this rate.
 And I had someone who read some very
positive feelings into my winning - which I really appreciate -
thanks TT!&lt;br/&gt;
Of course, the Denver people were not that happy when they realized
someone from South won it - they wanted it to stay in Denver. Well,
I don't feel comfortable trying to maintain a cache like this up in
Denver. And an interesting fact is that the cache was donated by a
Castle Rock cacher! :)&lt;br/&gt;
So I didn't hide in Denver - but I did put it North of Colorado
Springs. North of Monument even!&lt;br/&gt;
I put it in Greenland open space. About 35 minutes South on I25
coming from Denver. It should be rather convienient from I25.
Quick-on and quick-off. I could almost name it a stop for certain
geocaching hitch-hikers - but those type of caches can have issues,
so I won't call it that.
 &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I won this at the Chili Cook-Off event GCX8TT... So, if it is a
cook-off, I have to wonder who won? Thus the title for this cache.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I went up to the event with Buzz Lightyear 1 - and we did a
record-breaking (well, for me) bit of caching before and after.
Usually I hide a cache on one of these expeditions, from the
members who cached that day. But Buzz and I did not have time to
hide one. But as he did help me with lugging this cache, I give a
nod to him here. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks to RocketMan for donating this wonderful ready-to-hide
geocache ammo-can! I know the person who is FTF will be very happy
with the picture you put in for them to grab! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As this is a cache from Denver - but placed by a Colorado Springs
cacher - I will note a FTF for the first person to find the cache -
and if the first isn't from Denver, I will list a FTF on this page
for the first Denver-area cacher to find the cache as well! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I25 to Greenland exit 167 - Go West, follow the road as it curves
South - Continue South when the road curves West, going through the
gate that says Greenland Open Space. Drive past the fake general
store/picnic area. Park. Hike a couple of hundred feet. The opening
in the fence around the parking area is to the West, so you may
have to hike an extra 100 feet.&lt;br/&gt;
Rehide well! Please be discreet!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;9/19/2006 FTF to: ernie66 and jp66!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;9/26/2006 FTF Denver-based cacher: sassydil&lt;/b&gt; (even though she
didn't claim it, I realized she is the first Denver-metro cache to
find this cache - congrats!)&lt;br/&gt;

Where the Sidewalk Ends by Shel Silverstein
There is a place where the sidewalk ends
And before the street begins,
And there the grass grows soft and white,
And there the sun burns crimson bright,
And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
To cool in the peppermint wind.

Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
And the dark street winds and bends.
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And watch where the chalk-white arrows go
To the place where the sidewalk ends.

Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
For the children, they mark, and the children, they know
The place where the sidewalk ends.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a War Veterans Memorial.  This is a beautiful memorial and has a great view of the mountains. There is also a park across the street with a lake that you can fish in or ride pedal boats in. There is also a great play area in the park for the kids. Bring a flower along and place it in the sand pit that circles the Statue and view the names around the statue.
Both my grandpas served in World War 2. One was a ranger in the The 82nd Airborne 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment and parachuted on Normandy in June 1944. My other grandpa was a Navy Sea Bee in the Pacific Battles and helped build the bridges and structures around the island of Okinawa to prep for the arrival of the Marines and he also did double duty as a sniper. Remember to thank a Vet for your freedom.

Feel free to share your veteran stories or family remembrance stories. I hope you enjoy this cache.
To get credit for this cache,you have to enter the password.  The password is the number of soldier figures on the memorial.  When entering the password, please use the number, not spelled out.
Thank you.  I hope you enjoy this memorial and think about those who sacrificed and are currently sacrificing for our freedoms in this great country.</groundspeak:long_description>
