The cache of small toys, log book, and other goodies is located in a metal ammo container on Lover's Key just past Bonita Beach, Bonita Springs, FL. You enter the Park (a $5 fee is required) and take the main road approximately 1/2 mile to a stop sign and major parking area. On the left is the entrance to Black Island Trail. You follow the trail 1/2 mile to Post #4 and proceed to the crest of &quot;The Hill&quot; (the highest point in Lee County, FL at 30 feet). Enjoy the walk and the truly natural surroundings.</groundspeak:long_description>

 Cache is in an ammo box. Contents are an odd mixture: can koozie,
BrainTwist game, baseball change purse, magnets, bottle opener,
puzzle, survival book, lures, camo bandaids, fake fingernails and a
whoopie cushion. I'm not giving any hints on this one. I want it to
be a little tough. The only thing I will say is you should wear
long pants, sneakers and a hat. This place has lots of wildlife. We
saw a huge buck about 25 yards ahead of us on the trail. Hogs can
be found here, as well as bears, bobcats and rattlesnakes-so WATCH
WHERE YOU WALK! Have fun and enjoy the views!

A fairly easy park &amp; grab, though muggle traffic can make it a bit tricky. We believe this is one of the neatest spots in town. Listen closely and we bet you'll think so, too! The cache is accessible 24 hours a day, but if you do it at night, you'll be missing out on the thing that makes this spot so cool. </groundspeak:long_description>

 We have a place not far from here and used to bring our dog, Indy
swimming here until one day, as she was coming in from a retrieve,
a big gator decided he wanted her for lunch! Thankfully, with all
our excited yelling, she made it to shore before becoming that
gator's next meal. We haven't let her swim here since then. But
it's still a nice, quiet little spot to eat lunch and enjoy the
view. When you find this cache, please do not remove the container.
It is glued in place. Just remove the cap to get to the log.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The above coordinates will take you to Polk’s Nature Discovery
Center that is located within Circle B Bar Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 


&lt;p&gt;When you think of wetlands you do not think of geology, however
geology is a very important part of understanding wetland dynamics.
There are three characteristics that make wetlands unique –
vegetation, soils, and hydrology. Vegetation consists of plants
that have adapted to wet conditions. The soils are developed from
the water-saturated materials located in the wetlands. Hydrology is
very important for the continued existence of wetlands as it as it
is imperative to maintains an environmental friendly flow of water
through the wetlands to the local lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the mid 1850’s Florida’s General Land Office Survey
collected information related to the suitability of the area for
cultivation. Deputy surveyor John Westcott’s hand drawn maps and
notes described Circle B Bar Reserve property as a mix of open
prairie, pineland, and swampland. The property was dotted with
creeks, ponds, and hammocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1900s, most of the land where Circle B Bar Reserve
is today was very wet and productive as a wetland. The topographic
maps from back in the 1920s show most of the area being completely
underwater. In the 1950s, mining and other agricultural activities
were common in these wetlands. The area now known as Circle B Bar
Reserve was drained and transformed to be pasture land for cattle.
Water was pumped from the land to a central canal running through
the middle of the reserve and the water from the canal flowed
directly into Lake Hancock. Because of this, runoff from treated
sewage and agricultural land usage the water quality of Lake
Hancock was severely degraded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000 the Southwest Florida Water Management District and Polk
County in a joint effort purchased this 1,267-acre property. The
purpose of this joint effort is to help protect the floodplain of
Lake Hancock and also to restore the Banana Creek marsh system.
Soon after the purchase the pumps that drained the property were
shut down. In 2006 part of the central canal system was filled in
to help restore the original flow of water from Banana Creek to
flow across the surface of the land instead of a canal. The wetland
is divided into four cells by roads, berms, and some of the
remaining canal. There are large pipes under the roads which allow
water to move from one cell to another to provide continuity. As
the water flows over the land and from one cell to another it is
naturally filtered before it is discharged into Lake Hancock.&lt;/p&gt;









&lt;p&gt;The current wetland is very much like what it was like back in
the mid 1900s. With the increase in the amount of saturated land
there has been a dramatic rise in the amount of wildlife in the
area. This wildlife includes many wading birds, amphibians,
reptiles, insects and nesting bald eagles.&lt;/p&gt;









Wetlands not only get their water from ordinary rain water but also
from surface water runoff. As the Discovery Center was built this
was taken into account. The designers of the Discovery Center,
roadways into the Reserve, and the even the walkways utilized
geoweb, geoblock, flexipave, and pervious concrete. Utilizing these
materials will help preserve this Reverve for many years in the
future. 



&lt;p&gt;The Reserve is open daily, year-round, from 6:30 A.M. to 6:30
P.M. Standard Time and until 8:30 P.M. during Daylight Savings
Time. Dogs are no longer allowed in the preserve because of the
number of alligators present. Also, April is the mating season for
gators and they appear to be more active. This area may become wet
during the rainy season. Don’t forget the insect repellent and
water. Be careful and enjoy the area. Be advised that there are
always risks associated with visiting nature preserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please sign in at the visitor’s desk in the Discovery Center,
and note that you're there to Geocache. Polk County's Environmental
Lands Program is receptive to caching. Signing in shows that you
appreciate this. Please be respectful of this property, its
vegetation &amp; wildlife. Make sure you grab a map of the reserve
at the Discovery Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To receive credit for this Virtual cache you
must complete questions below.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Before heading out to trails locate the
display above describing the different types of construction used
by the designers of the Discovery Center, roadways, and paths. Find
one of the areas described and describe in your log. Currently the display is between the Discovery Center and the
parking lot.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. At the four corners of Heron Hideout,
Marsh Rabbit Run, Eagle Roost, and Alligator there is a measuring
stick in the water showing the depth of the water for the cell on
the SW corner.
Post the level at the time of your visit. (Located at R11NGDC
Waypoint)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. After visiting the four corners make
your way down Marsh Rabbit Run to Wading Bird Way. There is a
measuring stick in the water SW of the control pipes.
Post the level at the time of your visit. (Located at R21NGDC
Waypoint)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you are at the Circle B Bar Reserve be sure to check out
all the caches that are in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get a online trail map and location map from Polk
County's Official Website for

&lt;p&gt;Information included in the cache was obtained from Circle B Bar
Reserve Discovery Center and Southwest Florida Water Management
District displays as well as research on wetlands. All photos were
taken by the g8orRaiders.&lt;/p&gt;

Project 365 caches in order you might be looking for a palm tree. I
decided to change it up for the next few caches. Still probably not
what you are expecting when you get there! Please replace it where
you found it.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just another simple P&amp;G for your numbers. You are looking for a 35mm Film Canister. Has log, so BYOP!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left a little prize for the FTF. It is a certain kind of paper
folded into Origami . It's nothing special but we got the
idea from a GeoCaching friend &quot;ARH&amp;Buddy&quot; and thought it was
cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;***PLEASE! Put cache back the way you found it or re-hide
better than you found it, PLEASE!………Thanks***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**CONGRATS. and THANKS to &quot;G8RGRL869&amp;Strike&quot; for the FTF, and to everybody who has found it and who will.** AWESOME!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simple P&amp;G for your numbers. It is at a little
shopping plaza (strip mall) where most of the stores are gone.
There is a store there that coincides with the name of the
cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a 35mm Film Canister with a small, black &amp;
yellow, GeoCaching.com logo sticker. Has log, so BYOP!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;***PLEASE! Put cache back the way you found it or re-hide
better than you found it, PLEASE!………Thanks***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;

of my favorite Johnny Depp movies.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;--Ahh Yes, another micro--&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are looking for 35mm film canister hidden in Central Park of
Downtown Winter Haven. This should be another easy find to bump up
your #s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S., Beware of mugglers (sometimes).......Happy Geocaching.......and BYOP, has log.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The park has plenty of benches and nice trees for shade and
there are a lot of art sculptures here so take a walk and check
them out. Also, the sculptures come out every February and the new
ones installed just in time for the Central Park Art Festival the
third weekend of March every year! (sculpture info. Provided by
&quot;wh10sbum60&quot;, Thanks!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one other cache we hid in the park as well; (OX2CNV5)Art Exhibit 1.0.1 So grab it too while on your walk through the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you are here, check out the really big benchmark near by
if you want a BM find, you can see it from the park. Also, check
out the other BMs and great caches in the Winter Haven area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;***PLEASE! Put cache back the way you found it or re-hide
better than you found it, PLEASE!………Thanks***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*This is the 1st stage of a 3 stage multi-cache. Cache is not located at listed coordinates, you must do all stages to get real / true coordinates.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Got Gas?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terrain and difficulty level is at a 3 due to the total trip of 3.0± miles. Not really that long, just depends how far away you come from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is how it's done...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;STAGE 1 =&lt;/b&gt; As you already know, this is at the W. side of Lk. Howard at a public boat ramp w/fishing dock. This is where you will find the coords. for STAGE 2.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;STAGE 2 =&lt;/b&gt; This is at a public boat ramp w/fishing dock and where you will find the coords. for STAGE 3 (the final stage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;STAGE 3 =&lt;/b&gt; This is where the cache container is actually located. It is another public boat ramp w/fishing dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;...so go have some FUN!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left a little prize for the FTF. It is a certain kind of paper folded into Origami . It's nothing special but we got the idea from a GeoCaching friend &quot;ARH&amp;Buddy&quot; and thought it was cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our 1st multi-cache hide so we hope it works out and you
enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S., Beware of mugglers.......Happy Geocaching, always remember to CITO.......and BYOP, has log.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

puzzle to find the final coordinates. Muggles will be around during
business hours. Wearing the right clothing will help you blend in.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To find the coordinates you will have to research former
quarterbacks of Florida's highly acclaimed football team. I
shouldn't have to tell you which one but FSUDad may get confused!
So you are looking for former University of Florida quarterbacks.
&lt;p&gt;Final coordinates are at: N28 A.BBC W81 DE.FGH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A - Kerwin Bell's # - 10&lt;br/&gt;
BB - Steve Spurrier's # + 8&lt;br/&gt;
C - Larry Libertore's # - 12&lt;br/&gt;
D - Wayne Peace's # - 10&lt;br/&gt;
E - Danny Wuerffel's #&lt;br/&gt;
F - Chris Leak's # / 3&lt;br/&gt;
G - John Reaves' # - 5&lt;br/&gt;
H - Tim Tebow's # / 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extra brownie points if you can tell us which of the above lives
in Lakeland! Hope this cache doesn't cause heartburn to too many
people. But OH Well! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The First To Find Lakeland Series is a project designed to
motivate those cachers who are quick enough to snag an FTF to hide
their own FTF geocache in the Lakeland area. There is a similar
series FTF Series Florida that is all over the place. Since there have
been a lot of Lakeland caches that have been archived a new series
has been started to help replenish the Lakeland area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever is the FTF at a FTF cache is encouraged to keep the
series moving forward by hiding the next cache in the FTF series,
numbering the cache accordingly. The only twist is that you have to
place the new FTF cache within the borders of I-4 and the Polk
Parkway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no limits on the type of cache created. If you are
FTF, please do your part to expedite this series' growth! All of
you FTF hounds know who you are! If, however, you are FTF and are
unable or unwilling to continue this series, please make it clear
in your online log that you are passing on the option to the next
finder. There is no obligation to participate! Hope you have fun
with it!&lt;/p&gt;
If after a few days of posting a new FTF cache and it hasn't shown
up in the FTF Series Lakeland bookmark list drop g8orRaiders a gentle reminder to add your cache to the list.

area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Saddle Creek Park is made up of many former Phosphate pits.
There are many trails surounding the &quot;pits&quot; as well as oportunity
for boating.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; When a local thinks of Florida mining probably the first thing that
comes to their mind would be phosphate mining. Florida phosphate
accounts for one-quarter of world’s needs and three-quarters of US
domestic needs. Almost all of the phosphate that is mined in
Florida is used to manufacture fertilizer which is then used for
agricultural purposes. In 2000 28.6 million metric tons was mined
in Florida which in turn allowed $1.13 billion dollars worth of
fertilizer to be exported from Florida. This makes phosphate one of
Florida’s leading export commodities. 



&lt;p&gt;Saddle Creek flows into Lake Hancock and is considered to be one
of the headwater streams of Peace River. Saddle Creek flows through
Saddle Creek Park which is made up of many “phosphate pits.” This
area was mined for phosphate until the mid-1970s along with the
surrounding Tenoroc Pits. When the phosphate companies were done
mining they were required to transform the areas into “reclaimed”
land. Many of these areas are now parks and reclaimed lakes donated
to the county or state. The lakes were stocked with fish and are
very popular with fishermen from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To receive credit for this Virtual Cache you
must post the answers to the questions below in your logs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Throughout the park are signs
describing some of the features of the local area. Based on this
information or physical observations post something about the area that you learned&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Pick one of the “pits” and the elevation from your GPSr at the spot.  Who says Florida doesn’t have
“mountains”.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. While you are exploring the “pits” and
watching wildlife.  Post what wildlife you saw while in the area&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you are in the area make sure you visit the other great
caches in the area for additional up close views of the local
“pits” and wildlife. Some of the local wildlife are some of my
favorite creatures on earth but you might not want to try to get
too friendly with them or you might be their dinner. So do be
watchful of your surroundings!&lt;/p&gt;

Explored the &quot;pits&quot;, and marveled at how nice it is when an area like this can be transformed into a lovely recreational facility.  Answers will be e-mailed and pics to be posted.

Thanks!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As we were out kayaking and on our way back we noticed this
tunnel...over all the years being out a Saddle Creek I had never
noticed this pathway between the two sides of the water! This is
easier to get without a kayak and is more of a P&amp;G.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Saddle Creek is one of the largest county parks in central
Florida and has facilities for all the family, whether you just
want to cruise your boat on a beautiful lake, take advantage of
some great fishing, or hike along some wonderful forest trails. In
addition, Saddle Creek Park is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://floridabirdingtrail.com/&quot;&gt;Great Florida Birding Trail&lt;/a&gt;.
There are also facilities for target shooting, as well as
children's playgrounds, sports facilities and picnic gazebos. If
you love spending time outdoors, you will love Saddle Creek
Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until the early nineteen sixties Saddle Creek Park was an
open-cast phosphate mine. After that it was given to the local
county authorities to administer and it became a local park
facility. It has taken a large part of the time since then to allow
nature to fully recover the mines to the point that the casual
observer would never think that the park had ever been used for
anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saddle Creek used to be one of the main water flow channels from
the Green Swamp to the Peace River, however, due to the increased
urbanization over the last few decades this has ceased to be the
case. There are some current plans to rectify this situation and
hopefully they will be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Depending on your luck this will be easy or very hard! This is the
only one of my kayak caches that you should be able to get to
without getting out of the kayak.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Saddle Creek is one of the largest county parks in central
Florida and has facilities for all the family, whether you just
want to cruise your boat on a beautiful lake, take advantage of
some great fishing, or hike along some wonderful forest trails. In
addition, Saddle Creek Park is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://floridabirdingtrail.com/&quot;&gt;Great Florida Birding Trail&lt;/a&gt;.
There are also facilities for target shooting, as well as
children's playgrounds, sports facilities and picnic gazebos. If
you love spending time outdoors, you will love Saddle Creek
Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until the early nineteen sixties Saddle Creek Park was an
open-cast phosphate mine. After that it was given to the local
county authorities to administer and it became a local park
facility. It has taken a large part of the time since then to allow
nature to fully recover the mines to the point that the casual
observer would never think that the park had ever been used for
anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saddle Creek used to be one of the main water flow channels from
the Green Swamp to the Peace River, however, due to the increased
urbanization over the last few decades this has ceased to be the
case. There are some current plans to rectify this situation and
hopefully they will be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

place to hide a cache...I found the perfect spot! I know FSUDad
will hate this one as soon as he sees it! :) The hide is easy but
finding a way to get to it will be harder! Be very careful geting
up on the mound. Will be easier if there are two of you to help
steady to get up on the mound.

&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long

sure it is secured when you rehide it.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Saddle Creek is one of the largest county parks in central
Florida and has facilities for all the family, whether you just
want to cruise your boat on a beautiful lake, take advantage of
some great fishing, or hike along some wonderful forest trails. In
addition, Saddle Creek Park is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://floridabirdingtrail.com/&quot;&gt;Great Florida Birding Trail&lt;/a&gt;.
There are also facilities for target shooting, as well as
children's playgrounds, sports facilities and picnic gazebos. If
you love spending time outdoors, you will love Saddle Creek
Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until the early nineteen sixties Saddle Creek Park was an
open-cast phosphate mine. After that it was given to the local
county authorities to administer and it became a local park
facility. It has taken a large part of the time since then to allow
nature to fully recover the mines to the point that the casual
observer would never think that the park had ever been used for
anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saddle Creek used to be one of the main water flow channels from
the Green Swamp to the Peace River, however, due to the increased
urbanization over the last few decades this has ceased to be the
case. There are some current plans to rectify this situation and
hopefully they will be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please re-hide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the container properly by pressing down on all sides
until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay&lt;br/&gt;
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

P&amp;G.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The First to Find Lakeland Series was a project designed to
motivate those cachers who are quick enough to snag a FTF to hide
their own FTF geocache in the Lakeland area. This was to help
encourage other cachers to place more caches in the Lakeland
area.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is to be the last in the series hence the name! I tried
to find a good location so the cache name has double meaning! This
cache is not accessible via I-4 or the off ramp of I-4. Access to
it is from another direction only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Auburndale TECO Trail is a 5.5 mile, multi-use, non-motorized trail
extending from the trailhead located on Denton Avenue to Daniels
Road. The 12-foot wide paved trail which bypasses Lake Myrtle Park,
was constructed along an abandoned railroad right-of-way. The easy
grade makes the trail accessible to all ability levels. There is
now a connector trail connecting it to the Van Fleet Trail.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This series of caches is the first stage of the TECO/Van Fleet
trail. This will take you down a ~36 mile trek. You can do it in
stages or try to attempt the full trail. These will be best
attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of water, sunscreen and
a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to

extending from the trailhead located on Denton Avenue to Daniels

attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of water, sunscreen and
a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Auburndale TECO Trail is a 5.5 mile, multi-use, non-motorized trail
extending from the trailhead located on Denton Avenue to Daniels
Road. The 12-foot wide paved trail which bypasses Lake Myrtle Park,
was constructed along an abandoned railroad right-of-way. The easy
grade makes the trail accessible to all ability levels. There is
now a connector trail connecting it to the Van Fleet Trail.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This series of caches is the first stage of the TECO/Van Fleet
trail. This will take you down a ~36 mile trek. You can do it in
stages or try to attempt the full trail. These will be best
attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of water, sunscreen and
a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a city park for the public to use in big o'l L.A
(Lk.Alfred, Fl.)lol. They call it &quot;Lake Swoope&quot;, aka to the locals
as &quot;The Twin Lakes&quot;. The terrain is not bad, just be careful as
always.............very nice place............check it out!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in this neighborhood (1970's to early 1990's) &amp;
this is where I meet my wife, (hence the name above). The park was
not here when we lived here, just the boat ramp, field &amp; good
fishing (bass) back then.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Please respect the neighborhood &amp; the park &amp; CITO.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;***PLEASE! Put cache back the way you found it or re-hide better than you found
it, PLEASE!………Thanks***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

**CONGRATS. and THANKS to &quot;mugster&quot; for the FTF (sorry so late) and to everybody

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

back while eating nearby but then realized there were two caches
close to the location. There was not enough room for another cache.
One of them has now ben archived and that opened up the area for a
new cache.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; With a name like this and it being the 1st in the series I couldn't
let it be just a easy park and grab! &lt;a href=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/9163c1d6-0322-4df8-84de-797b5d4d643c.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However if you figure out the puzzle and

area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

I have to add. We looked on the way north, didn't find it, then looked on the way back and 'bout gave up when Mo had a stroke of genius that led us to the hiding place. The cammo really blends in here for some reason, it's harder then the rest. </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Auburndale TECO Trail is a 5.5 mile, multi-use, non-motorized trail
extending from the trailhead located on Denton Avenue to Daniels
Road. The 12-foot wide paved trail which bypasses Lake Myrtle Park,
was constructed along an abandoned railroad right-of-way. The easy
grade makes the trail accessible to all ability levels. There is
now a connector trail connecting it to the Van Fleet Trail.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This series of caches is the first stage of the TECO/Van Fleet
trail. This will take you down a ~36 mile trek. You can do it in
stages or try to attempt the full trail. These will be best
attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of water, sunscreen and
a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

Travel Bugs and Coins. Anybody taking trackables should at least
try to trade even or better. We would like for this hotel to always
have a good supply of trackables with a wide variety of goals. If
you are taking a trackable please make sure you are able to assist
in helping it toward its goal. Any trackables you place in the
cache please make sure that the trackables goal is noted for future
cachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original set of trackables placed in this cache were found
in Arizona, Germany and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please make note in both the online and physical log which
trackables you are trading out.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Auburndale TECO Trail is a 5.5 mile, multi-use, non-motorized trail
extending from the trailhead located on Denton Avenue to Daniels
Road. The 12-foot wide paved trail which bypasses Lake Myrtle Park,
was constructed along an abandoned railroad right-of-way. The easy
grade makes the trail accessible to all ability levels. There is
now a connector trail connecting it to the Van Fleet Trail.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This series of caches is the first stage of the TECO/Van Fleet
trail. This will take you down a ~36 mile trek. You can do it in
stages or try to attempt the full trail. These will be best
attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of water, sunscreen and
a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

neighborhood animals looking for a handout. I was surprised how

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

place a few on Cabage Palms and used &quot;Florida Style&quot; as the hint. I
was &quot;informed&quot; that true &quot;Florida Style&quot; was Palmetto Palms not
Cabage Palms. So I addopted &quot;Psuedo Florida Style&quot; for Cabage
Palms! This cache is filling in some gaps and is near some &quot;Florida
Style&quot; palms however it is not in them. :) On looking up the Cabage
Palm I found that it IS in the palmetto species as well so
technically I can use &quot;Florida Style&quot; for them too and just tell
those that &quot;informed&quot; me to Google it!!! :) Will probably stick to
&quot;Psuedo Florida Style&quot; though, just for the fun of it. The things
we learn from Geocaching!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

extending from the trailhead located on Denton Avenue to Daniels
Road. The 12-foot wide paved trail which bypasses Lake Myrtle Park,
was constructed along an abandoned railroad right-of-way. The easy
grade makes the trail accessible to all ability levels. There is
now a connector trail connecting it to the Van Fleet Trail.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This series of caches is the first stage of the TECO/Van Fleet
trail. This will take you down a ~36 mile trek. You can do it in
stages or try to attempt the full trail. These will be best
attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of water, sunscreen and
a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

than you find it.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The original contents of this cache were obtained from a technology
conference in Orlando. Every year I go and come home with lots of
extra stuff that ends up sitting around collecting dust around the
house. This year when I got home I said to myself this stuff would
fill up a cache very nicely and so it did! :) &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Cache is located along the Deer Run Trail in Polk County's
beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.polk-county.net/county_offices/natural_resources/environmental_lands/gator_creek.aspx&quot;&gt;
Gator Creek Reserve&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Absolutely no bushwhacking is required to find this cache. This
site is one of Polk County’s Environmental Land’s sites. There's
over 4 miles of well-groomed trails winding through almost 1,100
acres that you should take time to explore. Please sign in at the
information board in the parking lot near the trailhead, and note
that you're there to geocache. Polk County's Environmental Lands
Program is receptive to caching. Signing in shows that you
appreciate this. Please be respectful of this property, its
vegetation &amp; wildlife. Please take a trail brochure with you
and stay on marked on trails while navigating to the cache. &lt;br/&gt;

Spotted the probable tree pretty quickly and gladly welcomed the shade.  The cache was lying on the ground, out in the open, so after dropping some geocoins and signing the log we replaced it in the most probable spot and covered it up, safe and sound.

Thanks for bringing us out to this nice spot!

extending from the trailhead located on Denton Avenue to Daniels

a pen.&lt;br/&gt;

You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the first third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The VanFleet Trail is designated as part of Florida’s
Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the first third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;

at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching

&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the first third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs

&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The VanFleet Trail is designated as part of Florida’s
Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the first third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the first third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The VanFleet Trail is designated as part of Florida’s
Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the first third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; When I first started placing caches as part of this project I place
a few on Cabage Palms and used &quot;Florida Style&quot; as the hint. I was
&quot;informed&quot; that true &quot;Florida Style&quot; was Palmetto Palms not Cabage
Palms. So I addopted &quot;Psuedo Florida Style&quot; for Cabage Palms! This
cache is filling in some gaps and is near some &quot;Florida Style&quot;
palms however it is not in them. :) On looking up the Cabage Palm I
found that it IS in the palmetto species as well so technically I
can use &quot;Florida Style&quot; for them too and just tell those that
&quot;informed&quot; me to Google it!!! :) Will probably stick to &quot;Psuedo
Florida Style&quot; though, just for the fun of it. The things we learn
from Geocaching!!!&lt;br/&gt;

caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the first third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The VanFleet Trail is designated as part of Florida’s
Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the first third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

But now it Back and Big and Better!!


Smile they have CCTV in the parking lot and in the shop. The owners of the near by shop know the cache is here. They loved the old Cache so much they ask me why I have not place one here, They said it was fun seen cachers find it. So after hearing that I had to come up with a new one. So, yes the owners if the shop &quot;Ted Smith&quot; know about it and the owners of the land know about it &quot;Ken Rife&quot; So, if SCPD stops to say hello, Just say &quot;Geocaching&quot; and &quot;Ted Smith the owner of the shop&quot; a SCPD him self, knows that it here.
And you if stop by here around 10am to 6pm, You may see my TB pick/up in the parking area here too. so stop by and see me.
In side the cache you find some goodies that the store owner place in the cache. (hat pins, ete....)
Happy Hunting!!</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M geocaching
disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The VanFleet Trail is designated as part of Florida’s
Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the first third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The VanFleet Trail is designated as part of Florida’s
Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the first third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The VanFleet Trail is designated as part of Florida’s
Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the first third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The VanFleet Trail is designated as part of Florida’s
Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the first third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The VanFleet Trail is designated as part of Florida’s
Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the first third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The VanFleet Trail is designated as part of Florida’s
Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the first third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the first third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The VanFleet Trail is designated as part of Florida’s
Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the first third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen, bug spray and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The VanFleet Trail is designated as part of Florida’s
Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the first third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen, bug spray and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Normally my
caches along VanFleet are one of a couple particular styles. I
decided to do this one as a true traditional with a very special
cache container and as a tribute cache to a very sweet dog that has
been a part of our lives for the last 6.5
years.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
On July 5th,
2011 Gracie Lou suffered her second back injury. No one knows what
she did to her back to cause this injury. She had surgery 3 years
before and had fully recovered. After surgery we had been very
careful to keep her from jumping too much. This injury was more
severe. She was taken to the vet who felt that surgery would be
very iffy and recommended we try acupuncture as an alternative. The
vet had treated multiple dogs with good success for similar
injuries. Gracie had two treatments and the day after the second
treatment she seemed to be responding, however the next morning she
became lethargic and declined all day long. That night we came
together as a family and felt it was best to take her to the vet
and let her go to end her suffering. Of all the pets that I have
had over the years she was by far the hardest of any to see
go.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache
will be a tribute to her. Her legs were too short to allow her to
go on too many outings with us but she did love to ride in the Jeep
and did a few caches with us. Hopefully this cache will last as
long as her memories in our hearts will!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The VanFleet Trail is designated as part of Florida’s
Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the second third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen, bug spray and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The coordinates for this cache are not at the posted coordinates.
To find this cache you must find the necessary clues located within
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/bookmarks/view.aspx?guid=1860d671-c9ff-4683-aa22-a61f67010611&quot;&gt;
TECO/VANFleet Trail - Project 365 caches&lt;/a&gt;. The coordinates for
this cache are:&lt;br/&gt;
N TK QW.NDJ W JD XQ.POJ
&lt;br/&gt;
This portion of caches is on the second third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

While there may be room to place some water proof items in this
cache, use your judgement as it is rather small in size.
As always
please be sure to cover it back as you found it and secure the lid
properly. When logging your find please do not give away
information on the cache container or its location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saftey First: This cache is not located near any
metal or electrical parts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parking:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Easy access to the cache area from a nearby community
building.&lt;/p&gt;

5
minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REMINDERS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The top of this cache twists
off. Please do not try to rip apart the cache container or you may
get yourself in a sticky mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are on
public property. The other side of the wall is &lt;em&gt;private
property&lt;/em&gt;. Please don't peak over the wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the second third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen, bug spray and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

BYOP (Bring your own pen!)

This cache was approved by the fire chief of the Reedy Creek Fire Department

Station 2 at the Reedy Creek Improvement District looks more traditional than the other stations.  It houses an engine company and two rescues (E21 and Rescue 21 and 22).  It also has Tanker 21 which is an all wheel drive vehicle often needed for areas not served by fire hydrants.

This station primarily serves the All Star Resorts, Disney's Animal Kingdom, Coronado Springs Resort, ESPN's Wide World of Sports, Blizzard Beach.  Major roads are Buena Vista Drive, Osceola Parkway, Western Way.  Station 2 also covers parts of Interstate 4 and often provides mutual aid to Osceola County.  

This small station stays very busy!

Trivia:  The All Star Resort's cast services building (near the security check point) is half in Orange County and the other half in Osceola County.  Most of the All Star Resort is in Osceola County!

Congratulations to 4geoeddie!  45 minutes after it was published!  Here is the log entry:
&quot;Found it June 11 by 4geoeddie (34 found)&quot;

The cache was placed on June 9 and enabled while I was visiting Worcester, MASS on June 11th at 0840 hrs.

4geoeddie is also the first to find all four &quot;Protecting the Magic&quot; caches at Reedy Creek!  After his 30th find, he continued to find all the ones in this series, bringing him to 34 finds!  Very cool!</groundspeak:long_description>

Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the second third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen, bug spray and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs

at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to

can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

This a cache can be found by anyone that can get to the Animal Kingdom lodge. You do not have to be staying at the lodge, a bus ride from any other Disney location can get you to the lodge. So take a bus if you like to Animal Kingdom Lodge. Then head for the coords! When you find the coords you will be standing in next to something which is one of three in the immediate (10 foot radius) area. The code phrase is what is it you are standing next to and there is one on each side of you.?

This area is the Disney Animal Kingdom Lodge Savannah viewing point and you can learn lots about animals from this point. There are many signs and animals to learn about. Disney has over 200+ animals on the Savannah and many different species. We enjoy staying here as often as we can. 

The coords were averaged over a two day period and should be accurate to within a foot or two. :) </groundspeak:long_description>

Always drive by here and see tour buses parked here. So we decided
a cache was needed. When we were placing the cache, a bus pulled
up. How ironic that was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are
hunting for a 35mm film canister. Please be gentle with the top of
the container. No need to go into the fenced area or woods. Less
traffic after normal business hours. Watch for tour buses and their
drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parking:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Roadside pulloff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Car-Cache-Car:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

2 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wet log?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Please be sure to fully seal the bag as the location get very damp.
If the log is too wet and you have a spare, please feel free to
replace it. Just be sure to send us a direct message so we can
retrieve to old log. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The VanFleet Trail is designated as part of Florida’s
Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the second third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen, bug spray and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The VanFleet Trail is designated as part of Florida’s
Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the second third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen, bug spray and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The VanFleet Trail is designated as part of Florida’s
Statewide System of Greenways and Trails. It runs through the Green
Swamp, the headwaters for some of Florida’s most canoed
rivers, the Withlacoochee, Hillsborough, and Peace. Landscapes
include the natural environments associated with the Green Swamp,
former citrus lands and cattle ranches. With only one curve in its
29.2 miles, you can choose to go slow and view the wildlife or
enjoy it at a brisk pace.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This portion of caches is on the second third of the Van Fleet
trail. You can do it in stages or try to attempt the full trail.
These will be best attempted via bike. Be sure to bring plenty of
water, sunscreen, bug spray and a pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will be looking for hanging camo pill bottles. Inside the cap
of SOME not ALL of the caches will be a letter and number. Be sure
to record these as they will be needed for additional bonus caches
that will be placed along the trail. These are repeated so don't
worry if you miss one. If the log is damp please post a needs
maintenance log as well as your found log to help me know that it
needs attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

placed as part of the CITO event on February 27th, 2010.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Squishy was a pet of the Family years ago. As Squishy got older
he became tired of the changes of the seasons up north and decided
to go south like so many other snow birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon ariving at his Florida home, squishy soon settled in and
began enjoying his retirement. He purchased a small but comfortable
home nestled in what he thought was paradise&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't long after Squishy moved in when a hurricane just
about blew him away. So fearing for his own safety, Squishy sold
his home and moved inland to find a safer place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squishy loved his second home. There were many other creatures
in the area that befriended him. He had an OK view of a pond near
by and was pretty content. That was when he met Sally. Sally made
squishy feel, well, kinda squishy inside and not so alone. He
wanted to spend more time with Sally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the days went by Squishy and Sally became so in Love that
they got married and bought a beautiful house not far from where
they met. Squishy and Sally still live there to this day.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to see either of them, tell them that the
familycachefinders miss them and hope all is well.&lt;/p&gt;

An old friend of mine used to use these for bait. He was always looking around and he called them hoppagrass.

I always thought it was funny to hear a grown man saying &quot;here hoppagrass, where are you?&quot;. Now it is your turn.

Lake Minnehaha.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; You can acces the river with your PWC from the Palatlakaha River
Park located near the end of hull road. Park is open from dawn to
dusk. There is a ramp for boats and parking for your trailers up to
15 feet.
&lt;p&gt;I placed three caches on the river and lake from my kayak. It
took me just over two hours to find Moparots three caches and to
place this one. Distance round trip: From the boat ramp to this one
on Lake Susan, I would guess (because I didnt have my track log on)
about, just about four miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of natual Florida wildlife such as snakes and
alligators. The river runs toward Lake Susan, so coming back will
be up stream, But I didnt notice much of a difference. Bring some
water in hot months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, ziplock baggies can help to protect your GPS, Cell Phone,
Blackberry, and more specifically your &quot;I-Phone&quot; in case of and
over board incident.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing, the FTF prize in this one is a brand spankin'
new, unactivated Geocoin. Good Luck...&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Please do not hunt this one at Night. &lt;b&gt;Daylight Only&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located at my house (see hint for address). The
neighbors are aware of its location and purpose. As long as you are
visiting in daylight you are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be cautious of the landscaping not to crush any plantings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ample parking provided in the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a Seed Cache. Designed with the intent of providing
cache containers to the masses and to promote geocaching in the
S.Lake County area. Feel free to take a cache container and hide it
in your favorite place. Although not a requirement, it would be
nice if you could add (fcf) or (moac) to your cache title so I can
see where the &quot;babies&quot; of MOAC land. There will be new items added
from time to time so check back often. Each container will come
with its own log, ziplock, and if the size permits, a pencil. This
is a must find for any begining geocacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have included additional items we all should carry with us:
Extra Pencils, Logs, and Zip Locks. These items are free for the
taking, just leave some for the next cacher, and if the cache runs
out, don't be afraid to donate to the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the cache there is also a container for dropping off
trackable items. If you wish to drop off trackable items then
please place them in the drop box for cleaning and inspection. I
will move them from the drop box to the share box when finished, or
from the share box to a new cache if not picked up in a reasonable
time frame. This is not meant to be a hotel, but those lost or in
need of a place of rest are always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be the usual Swag in this cache, with certain special
items added at random times, possibly on Holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is such a special hide for us, we have included for
the FTF, a FTF coin, trackable at geocaching.com. There may even be
something extra special waiting for the FTF. You can never
tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Zhybrid and hockeyb0 on the co-FTF. Great to
meet the both of you.&lt;/p&gt;

The Lady's of the house arrived with her car just as I was to open the cache.
I really enjoyed taking the time to have a little chat with her.

Hopefully you'll find the cache more imaginative than my title.  Just could not find inspiration that would not give this one completely away.

You are looking for a micro cache, big enough for about 1 small item.  The cache started with a Geocoin and a tag.  It has a log book and I *even* included a pencil.  I believe the coin is activated, but if not - enjoy your new coin :)

This cache is sort of wheelchair accessible.  You can get there easily in a wheelchair, but you'll need some help (probably) to retrieve and replace the container.  So I rated this a 1.5 for terrain.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;
Below are the proper instructions regarding screaming like a little girl.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
1 ) Definition:&lt;br/&gt;
A &quot;little girl scream&quot; is a loud and sudden vocalization, typified by young females in times of fright. This does not mean that only young females can produce these screams, only that this source is its most common. Anyone, regardless of age or gender, can, and will, produce a &quot;little girl scream&quot; under the right stimuli. Sufficient levels of fear can unman anybody.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
2 ) When to scream:&lt;br/&gt;
 a ) For maximum effect, there are some pretty strict guidelines regarding the proper timing of little girl screams. The perfect little girl scream is one that has no witness. Failing that, you should reserve your little girl screams for those situations when witnesses are minimized, such as when you are away from civilization, and something scares the bejesus out of you. In such a situation, it is best to be vigilant of your surroundings, ensuring that only your closest friends are around, so they can pick on you incessantly, while you retain some measure of plausible deniability.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
3 ) How to scream:&lt;br/&gt;
In simple terms, a little girl scream should come from the heart. It should never feel forced. Your volume should be at its maximum range, and your utter fright, expressed in pitch, should be immediately evident to anyone within a 200' radius. The duration of a little girl scream is not nearly as important as how high it is or how loud. You should never take the time to inhale prior to ripping loose with a little girl scream, because the half second or so that you take to gather a healthy lung full of air will usually be sufficient to reveal that whatever frightened you wasn't nearly as scary as you initially believed. Whatever amount of air you have in your chest at the time of your fright should be instantaneously and forcefully expelled, with your vocal cords compressed as tight as you can get them. Your pitch should be high enough to vibrate glass, if not shatter it all together. Practice makes perfect. A good way to practice is to have your significant other, or one of your parents, confront you suddenly, and repeatedly, with an object that you maintain a phobia about, at unexpected intervals.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One example I have of a little girl scream which I made, was during a hunting trip. I had shot a critter, way out in the middle of a cypress pond. I left my gun at my truck and waded in to recover it, stepping on all manner of submerged stuff, including old, fallen cypress logs. As I was sloughing my way through the black, waist deep water, I felt my foot descend on a log that felt particularly squishy. I raised my foot slightly and 8' of alligator popped up right next to me. &quot;EEEEEKK!!!&quot; Instant little girl scream. Had I waited to actually fill my lungs, I would've realised that the gator was dead. Then there would've been no reason to scream, and my daughter, who was standing on the shore, would have never had the opportunity to learn that her dad was really a wuss.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
By now you may have deduced from the cache page, that one member of our group, (Kleetus), had an occasion to scream like a little girl at ground zero. You'll have to ask him for the details, as he swore me to secrecy.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia tells us that the Civil War engagement commonly referred to as Pickett's Charge was a devastating loss for the Confederacy. On July 3rd, 1863, General Robert E Lee ordered the assault, sending over 12,000 infantry soldiers to take Ziegler's Grove, in the town of Hancock, just south of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Confederate losses exceeded 50%.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Military historians all agree on one simple fact; Lee should have won that battle. He came prepared with a superior battle plan, a superior number of seasoned troops and a stronger supply line. Where all the controversy comes into play is from experts trying to determine why he lost.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Theories abound, but to date, all of them fall short when logic is applied. The only hard data is from the commanders themselves, and they weren't talking. When asked why the Confederacy suffered such a devastating defeat, all General Pickett would say was, &quot;I've always thought the Yankees had something to do with it.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Newly unearthed evidence, submitted to the Museum of Confederate History, by amateur archivist and Civil War historian Professor Kleetus Boudreau, suggests that the answer was in the name. You see, the term &quot;Pickett's Charge&quot; is a blatant misnomer, which has always troubled the experts, as Major General George Pickett was only one of three Confederate generals leading the assault, along with Brigadier Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew, and Major Gen. Isaac R. Trimble. The other issue with the name is that the Confederate troops never charged, they marched... slowly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So. Why call it Pickett's Charge?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Professor Kleetus approached this puzzle with an open mind, uncovering previously unstudied documents, learning the truth regarding both the name of the offensive and why it went so badly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
According to the records uncovered by Professor Kleetus, the evening prior to the battle, General Pickett spent the night wrapping himself in utter debauchery, racking up a huge bill at Madame Carpetbagger's, a local house of ill repute. The next morning, General Pickett attempted to pay for all the hookers and beer with his credit card. In a nasally northeast tone, the Madame told him, &quot;Sir, we don't serve watered down adult libations, we don't retain unpleasant prostitutes and we do not take American Express&quot;. General Pickett spent quite some time acquiring sufficient funds to satisfy his debt, arriving at the battle site quite late, and rather flustered. Because of his lack of focus, things just spiraled down from there, and the Confederate army was routed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
All because Pickett picked the wrong charge card.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(Sigh...)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Good luck and don't get eaten!

describing&lt;br/&gt;
the travels of Clan Riffster, Stray Goose, Kleetus and his&lt;br/&gt;
daughter, Purty-gurly.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A tale of a fateful trip&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
That started at an RV park&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Aboard four tiny ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group had a mix of paddling skills,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
From pro to not so well.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Four paddlers set sail that day&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
For eight hours of pure hell, for eight hours of pure hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water started getting rough,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The plastic boats were tossed,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If not for the batteries in our GPS&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Us idiots would be lost, us idiots would be lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is the tale of the hapless few,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
whose trip took many a mile,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you follow in their paddle strokes,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Expect to earn your smiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cachers who explored this creek,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Had done their very best,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To make sure you'd be miserable,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
During this torturous quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No phone, no snacks, no skeeter spray,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Not a single luxury,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Like most of my ill conceived journeys,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As primitive as can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So head down stream at least one time,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You'll end up sore and weak,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Like four decrepit paddlers,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Down on The Econ Creek.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to locating existing caches, participants in the city's Adventure Camp will also create new caches that other members of the geocaching community can enjoy.

AC001 is the first geocache we created, designed to act as an ongoing time capsule for Adventure Camp 2011. Each week's new campers will hunt for the cache and leave a message or memento for the following week's campers to find.

This cache is open to the public, and we encourage you to sign the log and be respectful to the area you are searching in. Good luck!    </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Mercury is the innermost and smallest planet in the Solar System,
orbiting the Sun once every 87.969 days. The orbit of Mercury has
the highest eccentricity of all the Solar System planets, and it
has the smallest axial tilt. It completes three rotations about the
axis for every two orbits. The perihelion of Mercury's orbit
precesses around the Sun at an excess of 43 arcseconds per century;
a phenomenon that was explained in the 20th century by Albert
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Mercury is bright when
viewed from Earth, ranging from -2.0 to 5.5 in apparent magnitude,
but is not easily seen as its greatest angular separation from the
Sun is only 28.3°. Since Mercury is normally lost in the glare of
the Sun, unless there is a solar eclipse, Mercury can only be
viewed in morning or evening twilight.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Comparatively little is known about Mercury; ground-based
telescopes reveal only an illuminated crescent with limited detail.
The first of two spacecraft to visit the planet was Mariner 10,
which mapped only about 45% of the planet’s surface from 1974
to 1975. The second is the MESSENGER spacecraft, which mapped
another 30% during its flyby of January 14, 2008. MESSENGER will
make one more pass by Mercury in 2009, followed by orbital
insertion in 2011, and will then survey and map the entire
planet.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Mercury is similar in appearance to the Moon: it is heavily
cratered with regions of smooth plains, has no natural satellites
and no substantial atmosphere. However, unlike the moon, it has a
large iron core, which generates a magnetic field about 1% as
strong as that of the Earth. It is an exceptionally dense planet
due to the large relative size of its core. Surface temperatures
range from about 90 to 700 K (-183 °C to 427 °C, -297 °F to 801
°F), with the subsolar point being the hottest and the bottoms of
craters near the poles being the coldest.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Recorded observations of Mercury date back to at least the first
millennium BC. Before the 4th century BC, Greek astronomers
believed the planet to be two separate objects: one visible only at
sunrise, which they called Apollo; the other visible only at
sunset, which they called Hermes. The English name for the planet
comes from the Romans, who named it after the Roman god Mercury,
which they equated with the Greek Hermes. The astronomical symbol
for Mercury is a stylized version of Hermes' caduceus.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
For the record, DON'T jump the fence. It probably looks very very
suspicious to muggles passing by.&lt;br/&gt;

I climbed the wrong tree at first that gave me flashbacks of &quot;monkeying around APK19&quot; [:(]. You ought to check out the recent log there from Jim. Funny stuff. Anyway, I found the cache had trouble reaching it with these short legs. I had to grab a stick. Knocked down the cache, signed in and had a devil of a time trying to get it back where it belonged [}:)] . It is back though, safe and sound. TFTH</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;I drive by this area every day going to and from work. I've
scouted it out via sat photos, and today I decided to go in and
place a cache here. I'm a big fan of non micro caches and thought
this would be the perfect place. It doesn't seem like anybody comes
back here, so muggles shouldn't be an issue while you search. There
may be some wildlife here, I heard something that sounded big in
the woods while I was placing the cache, so keep your eyes
open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not attempt to find this cache from 429 or 441. You won't be
able to get there since there are fences along the highway (plus it
would be a dumb idea anyway to park on the highway). There are a
few slabs that you can pull off the road on for parking along
Marshall Lake Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the FTF takes an FTF picture and puts it in their log I'll
put it on the main cache page.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This hunt will challenge you physically, mentally and spiritually, as you night hike about 4.5 miles, 2.5 miles of which will be pure, old school bushwhacking, through various habitats, dodging venomous snakes, wild hogs, gators and other critters who find humans tasty, solving several physical puzzles along the way. If your skills and luck are great enough, you might actually survive this quest. Pay attention to the D/T ratings, as they are not exaggerated.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
http://www.wherigo.com/cartridge/details.aspx?CGUID=120b2ed3-a700-4019-b478-4d90f7d304e6
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you've read this far down the cache page without running away screaming like a little girl, you may be ready for this hunt... Maybe... Bushwhacking, at the best of times, is a dangerous endeavor, as your vision is limited and all kinds of things are waiting to bite, trip, envenomate, sting, lacerate and poke you. Doing so at night can be deadly. By attempting this cache, you attest that you are doing so of your own free will, and you accept the consequences of your decision, agreeing to hold harmless the cache owner, Seminole County, the state of Florida and Groundspeak. In short, you and/or your estate won't sue when you get injured or killed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You will start your hunt at the Barr St Trailhead for the Lil Big Econ State Forest, on County Rd 426, between Oviedo and Geneva.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since this is a night cache, you will need to bring a good flashlight and a spare. To complete this quest, you will also need a second GPSr, besides the one used for playing the Wherigo cartrige, and a good compass. I also recommend a sturdy hiking staff, snake boots, sturdy jeans, a long sleeve shirt, a hat, bug spray, a cell phone and lots of water. You should also tell a loved one where you are going, so we can send out a search team in the event you don't survive. Because this is a Wherigo cache, you'll also need a device capable of playing the Wherigo cartridge, which can be downloaded at the link near the top of this page. There's no need to spend a buttload of money for a Colorado or Oregon, (though they are pretty darn kewl!), as there is a list of compatible devices here:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=182186
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
How it works:&lt;br/&gt;
As you arrive at the parking coords, you'll notice that the Kiosk Zone is open. Follow your device to the kiosk and you'll be asked to answer a question, based upon what you find there. Get the answer right, and you'll unlock the next zone. Hike way down a trail, bushwhack a bit and you'll find an ammo can. From this point, you'll be bushwhacking. Solve the physical puzzle at this can and you'll get the code needed to unlock the next zone. There are a total of 5 physical puzzle ammo cans which you'll need to find (and solve!) in order to unlock the coords for the final, yet another ammo can. With most Wherigo caches, unlocking the next zone in your quest will make it visible to your device, giving you a direction and distance. That will not be the case here. After you unlock each of the 5 puzzle ammo can zones, you'll need to follow reflective trails that will dwindle away to nothing somewhere deep in the woods. As you reach the end of each reflective trail, the next zone should become visible. At that newly opened zone, your Wherigo device will give you coords to the next ammo can. I highly recommend using a standard GPSr to get you to each ammo can, instead of the dinky little arrow on your Wherigo device.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Fees&lt;br/&gt;
Because this is a State Forest, you must pay a fee to access the property. Daytime hiking costs $2.00 per person, and is payable at any designated entry point, using day use fee envelopes. Being here at night requires a camping permit, which you can obtain at the Division of Forestry Office, during banking hours. 1350 Snow Hill Rd. Geneva 407-971-3500 The cost is $10.00 a night and is good for up to 10 people. Since you absolutely should not attempt this cache solo, you can split the fee with your partners.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Trail maps&lt;br/&gt;
Trail maps are available at the kiosk. They may not be very useful when you are deep in the woods and unable to see landmarks. Groundspeak policy won't let me post a link, but if you e-mail me, I can give you a link to a free website where you can download the trailmap to your GPSr.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This cache was designed to be done at night, however, if someone had a really sharp eye, and could spot reflectors during the day, they could, conceivably do this during daylight hours, but it would be many times more difficult as the reflectors are pretty hard to spot. As long as you enjoy yourself, and don't get hurt, do it at whatever time you like.

Start your bushwhacking here. Follow the trail south till you are kinda parallel with Ammo Can 1, then hit the shrubbery.

PK22BP5 - Barr St Trailhead&lt;br/&gt;
N 28° 41.239 W 081° 09.560&lt;br/&gt;
Don't forget your camping permit! This is not the same as the day use fee which you leave in an envelope at the kiosk.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The only reasonable advice I can give you is to avoid this cache. It can kill you. Seriously. If you ignore this advice, and hunt the cache anyway, this might help: Ammo can one = Tucked into roots. Ammo can two = Base of oak. Ammo can three = four foot up, in palm tree. Ammo can four = seven feet up in oak. Ammo can five = hanging from a young, leaning oak, two foot up. Final = hanging from oak, four foot up.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;You are seeking an ammo can near the Equestrian Trailhead of The Lil Big Econ State Forest. In this cache, as well as the others in this series, you’ll find a section of Angus Riffster’s tombstone. This needs to stay in the cache for reasons that will become obvious once you’ve read the cache guidelines at the bottom of the cache page of &quot;Great Scot! (A Riffster's Tale). If you don’t plan on finding the 5th stage, you can ignore the tombstone pieces. Also, you'll need to give right of way to any mounted muggles whils't hiking on the equestrian trails.
Thanx!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Over time, Clan Riffster developed semipassable skills at woodsmanship, whils't fleeing like little French girls from the mighty McMuggle army. These skills allowed them to evade the army somewhat, however, they could never fully escape it. This apparent paradox can best be explained by the overall blatant ignorance of Clan Riffster, who were oft described by the McMuggles as being &quot;Dumber than a bag of hammers&quot;. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

King Floridus came to realize that his best chance at capturing the elusive Riffsters lay in using their odor against them, and brought in a pack of specially trained hunting rabbits to track them. These were not the cute fluffy bunnies we know today. Oh no! These rabbits were 
vicious killers, hippity hopping through the underbrush with a vengeance, wanting nothing more than to tear their prey to shreds with their razor sharp incisors, or stomp them to a pulp with their powerful rear paws. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The only two drawbacks to using these bunnies was their pack mentality, and the fact that the King's soldiers feared them almost as much as Clan Riffster. The soldiers tended to stay back from the bunnies, which meant they weren't on hand to deal with the Riffsters when the rabbits found them, and, once the rabbits tracked them down, the entire pack would leap upon the slowest Riffster, stripping him or her to a skeleton, before continuing the hunt. This allowed Clan Riffster the time they needed to continue their evasion, whils't attempting to ferment some kind of defensive strategy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The fleeing Riffsters made a startling discovery when one of the Clan, who happened to be carrying a bowl of fresh haggis, was brought down by the bunnie pack. Those bunnies who inadvertently ingested the haggis whils't shredding the Riffster became so violently ill that they would never eat flesh again. Learning from this observation, Clan Riffster gave all of their haggis to their slowest runners, which resulted in all but one of the King's prized hunting bunnies being turned into contemptible vegetarians. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The last fully functioning hunter/killer rabbit was a grizzled veteran of many a clash of arms, and was not about to be deceived by a bunch of haggis toting bipeds. He observed the Clan carefully, trying to ascertain who was the leader of the disorganized, horribly pungent 
rabble fleeing before his wrath. This fluffy warrior noticed that the Clan carried a bolt of silly looking plaid cloth, passing it amongst themselves with reverence as they ran. The long eared death dealer figured that, if he could destroy this cloth, it might cause the Clan to stop long enough for the soldiers to engage them, so he circled around ahead of the Clan, and leapt at the appropriate moment, snatching the cloth from the Riffster currently carrying it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

With a few shakes of his mighty lepine head, the Tartan was shredded to a zillion pieces, which seemed to have the desired effect, in that the Clan stopped in their tracks. What the bunny didn't know was that the first stage in creating the Clan Riffster Tartan involves softening the 
cloth in boiling haggis gravy. His taste buds revolted, his stomach forcefully emptied itself, and he hopped away into the forest in search of carrots, having been shamefully transformed from vicious carnivore to mild mannered herbivore. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The army approached. The final battle commenced....
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Back in November of '06, my brother and I hunted for the infamous Geezer's Little Wekiva Mud Cache and limped away with our tails betwixt our legs. While expanding our hunt, we came across this way kewl spring, and knew beyond a doubt that we had to hide a cache here someday.

As a &quot;Thanx!&quot; to our favorite Geezers, CondoMax and zbeard, I've named this spring after them. You can blame them for all the water, mud &amp; bugs you'll be experiencing during your hunt.

At first glance, this place just looked neat, but after settling down and checking it out, the theme song for &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; started playing in my head. We noticed there were tropical fish living in the spring basin. Then, as we checked out the palm trees around the basin, we noticed several toys placed in &amp; around them, as if they were guarding it. There was even a dream catcher in one tree. The cumulative experience was kinda spooky. We discovered later that the strange items were left by a really strange guy who calls this place home. He looks like he'd be right at home wearing a leather mask and carrying a chain saw. It would behoove you to keep an eye out for him as you enter the woods.

Geezer Springs is a 5th magnitude spring. The main pool of Geezer Springs is enclosed within a 3.5-foot-high concrete, circular wall about 12 feet in diameter. A large sand boil is visible approximately 3 feet to 4 feet below the water's surface, with several more sand boils also visible. Seven mature palm trees surround the concrete pool. The pool discharges out of a rectangular opening in the side of the wall, then flows northwest in the sandy spring run about 550 feet long and 3 feet wide to the Little Wekiva River. Another vent is located on the west bank of the Little Wekiva River, with numerous other small sand boils in the river floodplain on the west side of the river. Discharge from Geezer Springs was measured in 2005 at 0.11 cubic feet per second by St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD). 

Bring some good boots, as this area gets very muddy during the wet season. There is a road widening project going on right now, so it's probably best to avoid hunting this one during banker's hours, unless you like dealing with big, burly construction workers.

According to the Seminole County Property Appraiser, this little chunk of land is owned by Seminole County.

Good luck!

Post Script: Those good folks who have found the original are welcome to log this one as well.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;You are seeking an ammo can in The Lil Big Econ State Forest, Kilbee Unit. In this cache, as well as the others in this series, you’ll find a section of Angus Riffster’s tombstone. This needs to stay in the cache for reasons that will become obvious once you’ve read the cache guidelines at the bottom of the cache page of &quot;Great Scot! (A Riffster's Tale). If you don’t plan on finding the 5th stage, you can ignore the tombstone pieces.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
After their stunning defeat at the hands of Clan McMuggle, Clan Riffster ran away with their proverbial tails tucked betwixt their collective legs. They staggered south, eventually ending up at a winter retreat built by Kilbee McMuggle as a hunting lodge. They licked their wounds, and managed, over time, to convince themselves that they left their home by choice, as noble warriors, conveniently forgetting their cowardly dash from conflict. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They continued their lifestyle of cavorting, eating all of the food stored there, without a care in the world for what the future might bring, leaving their rubbish piled about under the windows of the lodge. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Some months later, Kilbee McMuggle was tasked by King Floridus to supply fresh meat for an upcoming celebration. Kilbee set off for his lodge with an entourage of hunters, and was shocked beyond measure by the presence of Clan Riffster. Kilbee was a proud man, and he was incensed by Clan Riffster's wanton disregard of his hunting lodge. In the ensuing confrontation, Clan Riffster hurled many an insult at Kilbee, who was able to restrain himself, until one Riffster yelled &quot;Your Momma's haggis tastes like hamster dung&quot;! Kilbee's calm demeanor shattered. Nobody insulted his mother's cooking! He dismounted his trusty steed and walked towards the offending Riffster, yelling &quot;That' it! I'm a gonna poke you in the snoot!&quot; Clan Riffster fled this terrible onslaught, running into the forest.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The tale continues.....

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The official family history records that Clan Riffster, enraged by the destruction of their Tartan at the hands of the traitorous Clan McMuggle, drew a hypothetical line in the sand, making their final stand here. Most historians argue against this line of reasoning, stating that Clan Riffster made no such noble stand, saying instead that, as they were fleeing the soldiers and bunnies, they became tired, and decided to take a nap, and were encircled by the McMuggle army. Either way, the battle raged for minutes, and Clan Riffster was practically wiped out. My great, great, great, etc, etc, grandsire, Angus Riffster, was a swaddling babe at the time of the battle, and was hidden in a barrel of Guinness by his father when the battle started. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The soldiers of Clan McMuggle took this barrel with them back to their King, as tribute, however, they left the Clan Riffster family treasure behind, claiming &quot;It's not but a wee bit of toys in a bloody metal box.&quot; One of the King's servants heard belching coming from within the barrel, and opened it up, finding a very drunk baby Angus inside. This servant could not father children due to a rather unfortunate and unique childhood Caber tossing accident, and, thinking that Angus was an answer to his many prayers for children, took him home to his wife, lovingly raising him as their own son. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The servant later learned the truth about Angus' heritage, and how he came to be in a barrel of Guinness, however, he could not find a single survivor from Clan Riffster, so he opted to keep the truth from Angus until he was older. On Angus' 16th birthday, his adopted father broke down and told him the truth, that he was born a Riffster and raised a McMuggle. Angus held no grudge against the man he had always thought of as his Da, however, this revelation created in him a life quest to search for his true history and recover his family treasure. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Angus' quest was doomed to failure, primarily due to his love of Guinness and dislike of perspiration, being rather fearful of anything even remotely resembling work. Angus did however, discover a written history of the final conflict betwixt his adopted family and his biological family, learning that, after the final battle, The King ordered that all references to Clan Riffster be destroyed, so that no trace of their existence could ever be found. He went so far as to order the razing of Clan Riffster graveyards, in the hopes that the Riffster name would eventually fade from history.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a rather covert attempt at courage, the few remaining Riffsters created a runic language to keep their history alive. Angus Riffster died drunk, broke and stinky, after overdosing on haggis, and was laid to rest in an unmarked grave. In honor of his tireless labors dedicated to restoring his families name, some unknown Riffster secretly planted a headstone at Angus' grave. The back of the tombtone was inscribed with the Riffster rune code, detailing the exact coordinates of the final battle between the Riffsters and the McMuggles. The Riffster family treasure can be found at these coordinates. Unfortunately, this tombstone, like all the other Riffster memorials, was eventually shattered by the McMuggles. The four sections of Angus’ tombstone were hidden in the four caches preceeding this one. Find the four sections, copy the runes, (leaving the tombstone sections in the cache for the next player), decrypt the runes, and find the Riffster family treasure!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;In this cache, as well as the others in this series, you’ll find a section of Angus Riffster’s tombstone. This needs to stay in the cache for reasons that will become obvious once you’ve read the cache guidelines at the bottom of the cache page of &quot;Great Scot! (A Riffster's Tale). If you don’t plan on finding the 5th stage, you can ignore the tombstone pieces.

hag•gis
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
1) n. A Scottish dish consisting of a mixture of the minced heart, lungs, and liver of a sheep mixed boiled in the stomach of the slaughtered animal.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(2) adj. Any food that tastes so incredibly awful as to cause your hair to hurt and your teeth to itch, as in, &quot;Good God, Man, That tastes like haggis! Are ya trying to poison me?&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Many months went by without a single Riffster sighting, and Clan McMuggle breathed a little easier, thinking that, just maybe, they were rid of those skulking, smelly vermin. Alas, fate proved to be unkind.... 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One of the most beloved haggis cooks in the land was a sheep farmer by the name of Jessup McMuggle. Jessup raised his sheep on the southeast shore of Loch Jessup, which was named after him by King Floridus, in honor of his many decades of fine haggis cooking. When Clan Riffster fled in terror from the might of Kilbee McMuggle, they traveled west, eventually coming to Loch Jessup. Their diet on this journey consisted mostly of tubers, grubs and berries. Scurvy eventually took root in Clan Riffster as a result of their diet, however it was difficult to diagnose, since toothless, slack jawed and sallow eyed pretty much described their physical condition during normal times.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As they wandered aimlessly along the shore of Loch Jessup they discovered Jessup's sheep farm, gazing in wonder at the only animal dumber than they were. Clan Riffster set up camp a couple leagues away, and began poaching ruthlessly, decimating Jessup's herd, cooking up literally tons of yummy haggis. Clan Riffster initially took great care to hide their activities, not wanting a repeat of their earlier blunder at Kilbee's hunting lodge, and because of their stealth, their activities went unnoticed for quite some time. However, hiding a butchered sheep carcas proved to be more work than your average Riffster was willing to undertake, which finally proved to be their undoing. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Jessup eventually realized something was amiss with his flock, when he started finding mutilated sheep carcasses all over the place, but he assumed it to be the work of some natural predator. The abdomen of each sheep had been ripped open, and the stomachs had been removed. The carcasses also had a pungent odor wafting about them that he couldn't recognize, mainly because he was a reasonably fastidious Scot, bathing once a week whether he needed it or not. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Jessup contacted Kilbee concerning these killings, describing the missing stomachs, and the sickening, lingering odor. Kilbee immediately rushed to his King, proclaiming [b][i]&quot;I know where Clan Riffster went&quot;[/b][/i]! A battalion of the King's finest soldiers were dispatched to rid the land of the Riffster plague, however, they failed to make contact. Clan Riffster heard the hoof beats of the approaching army, and scurried away, leaving only their unwashed stench to belay the fact that they were ever there.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The tale continues......

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Wekiwa Springs is located within the Wekiwa Springs State Park about 4 miles northeast of Apopka.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Wekiwa Springs is a 2nd magnitude spring in a semitropical forest setting at the base of a northeast-sloping, grassy, open-wooded hillside. The springs form the headwater of the Wekiva River, a tributary to the St. Johns River.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Two areas of discharge can be observed as surface boils near the edge in the southeast half of the pool. The strongest boil is over a large irregular-shaped vent about 35 feet long by 5 feet wide in the limestone bottom about 15 feet below the surface. The other boil is above a rock ledge in the extreme southeast edge of the pool. Except for the limestone rock bottom in the southeast part of the pool, the pool bottom is mostly sand. The spring pool is kidney-shaped, about 200 feet long and 100 feet wide, elongated southeast. A sidewalk surrounds the pool and a wooden footbridge crosses the run just below the pool. A 2 to 3-foot high retaining wall encloses the pool and extends a short distance down the run. The clear, bluish-green water flows northeastward in a run 60 feet wide to the Wekiva River.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Discharge at Wekiwa Springs was measured by the U.S. Geological Survey from 1932 to 2002. St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) measured discharge from 1983 to 2005, and currently performs bimonthly discharge measurements. The difference between the minimum and maximum discharges is 62.6 cubic feet per second (cfs) over the period. The maximum measured discharge of 92.0 cfs occurred in October 1960; the minimum discharge of 29.4 cfs occurred in November 1985. The lowest periods of discharge correspond to periods of below normal rainfall in Florida. The mean and median discharges for the period from 1932 to 2005 are 67.1 cfs and 66.8 cfs, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The age of water discharging from Wekiwa Springs was determined by measuring the concentration of tritium, delta carbon-13, and carbon-14 in the spring discharge in April 1995 and tritium and helium-3 in July 1995. Wekiwa Springs had a tritium concentration of 3.0 tritium units, which suggests that the water is less than 42 years old. The tritium/helium-3 age of the water was 17 years. Wekiwa Springs had a delta carbon-13 value of –10.14 parts per thousand and a carbon-14 concentration of 50% modern carbon, which results from the reaction of rainfall with calcite, dolomite, and soil organic matter. The adjusted carbon-14 age of Wekiwa Springs is recent. The three ages indicate that the water discharging from Wekiwa Springs is young.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Wekiva or Wekiwa? The actual spelling of the river’s name has often been disputed – Wekiva or Wekiwa. According to an article in the Orlando Sentinel, Wekiwa was likely the original name used by the Seminoles, but Wekiva came into official use in the late 1800s because of its spelling on maps. Linguist Mary Hass stated in the article that “We” refers to water and “Kiwa” means spring.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My preferred paddle starts at Wekiva Springs State Park, with an entry fee of about $4.50. I drop one vehicle here, then drop another at Kadi's Landing, which has a $3.00 entrance fee. Total paddle distance is about 11 miles. Critters you will likely encounter include alligators, assorted turtles, water birds of all shapes and sizes, and heaps of snakes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Good luck!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Good evening, and welcome to the North Lake Jessup Conservation Area. This cache combines the best aspects of a night cache, a multi-cache, an offset cache and a puzzle cache. The successful completion of this quest will require some specialized equipment, (flashlights, skeeter spray, GPSr with track log, spare everything), hence the inflated difficulty rating, and during the rainy season, areas of the trail can be up to knee deep in water, hence the inflated terrain rating. Personally, I'd call it a 2/3, but the Geocaching rating calculator spit out a 4/5. I'll let y'all be the judge. The night time portion of this quest is about 1.5 miles in length, however, for the less robust, such as myself, it is set up so it can be completed in two jaunts of roughly .7 miles each.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I’ve named this cache after one of my all time favorite toys as a kid, my venerable Etch-O-Sketch. The reason for this name is because, you will be turning your GPSr into an Etch-O-Sketch. As you hike along the reflector trail, the track log function of your GPSr will be drawing lines. If you’ve followed the “trail”, and didn’t succumb to taking shortcuts, these lines will form a picture of two giant numbers, not unlike the Nazca Lines, located in the Pampa region of Peru. You’ll need these numbers to complete the offset portion of the cache. If you’ve ever hiked these woods before, with your GPSr, you should delete your track log to avoid confusion. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

When you leave the parking area, travel through the pedestrian gate, ensuring that it closes behind you. This gate keeps the free range cattle who call this area home, from wandering outside the fence line. Watch your step during this quest, as the cattle have done what they do best, throughout these woods. After closing the gate, follow the trail to your right (south) about .07 miles, then right (west) roughly .14 miles. You should stick to this trail until you are within 20’ of the beginning of the night cache markers, located at N28*44.389, W-081*14.805. The starting marker will be three white reflectors set in a triangle shape. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

From this point, you’ll follow reflectors, as with most night caches. You’ll continue down the “trail”, until you find another tree marked with three white reflectors set in a triangle shape. Affixed to this tree will be a soda bottle preform. Inside this container you’ll find a second set of coordinates. Turn off your tracklog, then proceed to these coordinates. Once at the start of the second number, (also marked by a triangle of reflectors), turn on your tracklog again. At the end of this second phase, you’ll find another soda bottle preform, with instructions detailing how to use the giant numbers drawn on your GPSr to locate the final cache. For those geocachers without a track log function on their GPSr, read the hint on the cache page. At certain points in this quest, your trail will make a sharp turn, making the hunt for the next reflector difficult. At some of these turns, I've placed two reflectors, which will hopefully clue you in that a sharp turn is at hand.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

This cache was placed by permission of the St John’s River Water Management District. A hearty thank you to Jo Anna Baber for her approval. Jo Anna can be reached at (407) 349-4970 or jbaber@sjrwmd.com for any questions concerning the placement of this cache or the use of this conservation area. This conservation area is open 24 hours a day, so your presence out here at night is legal. However, I strongly recommend that you carry a printout of this page to use if you should have to explain your presence to any of the Seminole County Deputies who patrol this area. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I strongly recommend you bring a hiking staff with you to knock down spider webs &amp; move snakes as needed, and bring a buddy. This is not a good place to be injured, on your own. Critters I've encountered whils't setting up this cache include feral cattle, wild hogs, venomous snakes, huge mosquitoes &amp; spiders of all sizes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Good luck and happy caching!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">First I want to say I've been wanted to do a night cache for quite some time (since I've never done one), so as soon as I saw Warren post to see if anyone wanted to go, I started preparing Mr. YB ... as this type cache isn't really his bag, but he supports me in my sport ... thank you honey!

Second, thank you Clan Riffster for this GREAT adventure - As we are plowing through the woods, knowing you had to figure out ALL of these coordinates, tag the trees .... wow - what a cache accomplishment - looking forward to more of these.

Third, with 37 (or was it 39) people that showed up for this great adventure (WOW), this wasn't a cache hunt - it was a Caching Event. I'm thinking the next time someone thinks of a get-together like this, they host it as an event so they can get credit. I know someone thought about this at the beginning of the party, but it has to be posted as an event ... what ... 2 weeks before?

Fourth, Jarrod, Jarrod, Jarrod - why this surprised me I have no idea. I know you are the FTF vacuum, but I didn't equate that to also being the first to find ANY cache. YOU LEFT US!!!! Not that we didn't have enough people (left behind) that didn't know where we were going or what to do - we did. But I guess if I would have thought about it, I would have expected this. However, you did pull through sticking close to us in the final phase.

Fifth - Aerobear - if you have video of me falling on my face (especially only inches from a cow pile), please blur my face .... 

As always, it was a very nice get-together, putting some faces with names, looking forward to the next round! </groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We were a little unsure about stomping around at night at this park, so after an invite, we teamed up with The Kelt and Navigatrix for this nocturnal hunt.  We met up and quickly found the first starting point for part one of our trek.  We followed the reflectors and bushed whacked (or Ceaser weed whacked) our way all around to sketch our first number.  Upon arrival of the first finishing 'X' we spotted a mysterious figure waiting to greet us, it was none other then Mr. Riffster himself.  We were glad to have him as our guide. We all introduced ourselves then headed off to part two.  The second part started out uneventful until about 10 minutes in to the hike.  The Kelt heard something in the woods, it first sounded like a bullfrog, then maybe a Skunk Ape, but no they were some pigs, and they sounded rather grumpy.  We stood still for a few moments as they ran and snorted back and fourth, after a minute, they took off and we continued on our trek. Soon we had the second number sketched out and headed off towards the final location.  Once we reached GZ Navigatrix quickly found the goods, we signed the log and traded some items, and we dropped a Yellow Jeep TB.  We then returned to our cars and went off to dinner.
It was great meeting all of you and we had a blast, see you on the trail soon, and thanks to Clan Riffster for the great night cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">[i]Eugene Gregory was a man who loved God, his family, his career, and the community he served. He served the Geneva community as a full-time deputy sheriff with the Seminole County Sheriff's Office from September 1991 to July 1998. He started with the Sheriff's Office three years prior, volunteering his time as a reserve deputy. Prior to law enforcement, from 1960 to 1964, Gene served our country in the U.S. Marine Corps. While in the Marine Corps he was involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis.

While on and off duty, Gene always wore a Stetson-style cowboy hat which became his trademark. He was nicknamed &quot;Stetson&quot; by the Geneva community. Those who knew Gene knew that behind the rough exterior and image he portrayed, no one had ever been more dedicated, kind or generous. He was a mentor to many, including me.

On July 8, 1998, Gene made the ultimate sacrifice. He was shot and killed while handling a landlord/tenant dispute in Geneva. A lot of the residents in Geneva considered Gene a personal friend. They still suffer from the emotional scars of losing that friend. All those who knew him sorely miss him. He will always be remembered because of what he stood for and the sacrifice he made.[/i]

Park at the North end of N Hart Rd, only a few feet from the posted coordinates. At ground zero, a diligent search will reveal a bison tube, (a small, metal cylinder), covered in camo tape, tied to a tree branch just off the trail. Grab the coordinates from the bison tube, and commence hoofin' down this seldom utilized section of the Flagler Trail. You seek a well camouflaged ammo can. Please re-hide it as well as you found it.

A note of caution: Although vehicular traffic is strictly verboten on this trail, the &quot;locals&quot; feel differently, often getting themselves arrested for treating this as their own personal ATV track. If you hear the oh so irritating sounds of 2 cycle engines racing your way, please get out of their way.

Your total hike will be about a mile and a half, through a pine scrub habitat.

Good luck!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I figured that this one had been found already because it was posted a long time ago.  Nevertheless, we decided to take Cooper (our geo-virgin beagle) on a nice walk on the beach and find the new Riffster cache too.  So we piled into the Subaru at 6:40pm and took the ten mile journey down SR 46 to the shore of Lake Harney.  We arrived to find teenage girls using metal detectors to find stuff in the sand, I thought you had to be over 60 to buy one.  We quickly piled out of the wagon and headed down the beach to find the redirector.  There were muggles breaking the rules by driving large trucks with large tires on the beach, other people launching their airboat, and someone peeing on their large truck's large tire.  As we continued down the beach, we took some pictures of the really flippin' cool Cypress trees and of Cooper too.  At the first GZ we found the redirector after about 5 minutes, copied the coords, and headed off to the final.  We stomped down the beach for a bit and then found final with a little baby cache attached.  Is this baby cache said FTF prize??  We open the big cache and found the empty logbook.  Yeah, FTF at 7:45 pm! [:D] Took a couple of pictures of the now Geo-Beagle at his first FTF, took the prize, and left a rubber duck.  When we got back to the wagon we had to pick up Cooper and put him back into the car, he didn't want to go home, he loves the beach and caching.  Thanks for the fun cache and great prize.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Most of you are familiar with the Judeo Christian references regarding the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. In one religious text, a guy named John remarks on four various colored horses, ridden by strange looking dudes. According to the tale, the white, red, black, and pale-green horses symbolized pestilence, war, famine, and death, respectively. Scholars argue that the four horsemen are to set a divine apocalypse upon the world as harbingers of the Last Judgment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hmmm...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What the scholars don't tell you is that there was a fifth Horseman. This Horseman rode upon a light blue mount. His name was Jeffrey. Jeffrey wasn't to hip on the whole &quot;doom &amp; gloom&quot; philosophy being promoted by his brethren. Jeffrey loved nothing more than taking leisurely strolls through the forests, listening to Jimmy Buffet on his iPod, expressing a &quot;live &amp; let live&quot; value system.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Shortly after this famous sighting, Jeffrey left the group, electing to become a solo performer. Called &quot;The Dude&quot; by his fans and followers, he later adopted the last name of Lebowski, and sometime after that, became the subject of the cult classic film &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Jeffrey was once asked to sum up his core values, to which he proclaimed:
“Life is short and complicated and nobody knows what to do about it. So don’t do anything about it. Just take it easy, man. Stop worrying so much whether you’ll make it into the finals. Kick back with some friends and some oat soda and whether you roll strikes or gutters, do your best to be true to yourself and others – that is to say, abide.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dude! That's some powerful mojo!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Good luck &amp; don't get eaten.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
-Sean

Judging from his great caches, such as [url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?ID=92116]Tiptoeing through the Cow Pies[/url] and [url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=65709073-38c3-497e-bb59-de66be574aed]Bee Head Ranch Time Capsule[/url], and his willingness to tackle any terrain in pursuit of a smiley, it's clear that he is the personification of deep woods, old style Florida caching.
BoonieMan, This can's for you, Brother!

After you pay your $3 entrance fee, you'll drive down a blacktop road to a gate. At this stage you have a choice to make. You can park in the area to the right of the gate and hoof it about 1.5 miles along the roads before entering the woods, or you can obtain the gate code and drive down those same roads. It's not hard to guess which option this ol' fat guy picked. If you drive in, please park in a designated area or risk the wrath of the D.E.P. No, I won't tell you how to get the gate gode. Some things you just gotta do yourself.

A warning note: These woods are used by a handful of very lucky hunters each year, who get the priveledge of hunting for a few days by entering a lottery style drawing. Please respect these guys and stay out of the woods the peak hours of active hunts, specifically, early morning and late afternoon/evening. You can find a list of hunt dates and a property map [url=http://myfwc.com/hunting/wma/2006-07/Northeast/RockSprings2006Letter.pdf]at this website[/url]. Day glow orange is your friend.

Regardless of whether you hike or drive in, you will be then be faced with over half a mile of rather intense bushwhacking to get to ground zero. There are some game trails you can occasionally follow as you wind your way through the brush, but these are few and far between. When I parked, I was 0.66 miles from ground zero, but my track log showed I had hoofed 2.2 miles round trip. The bushwhacking starts off fairly simply, in a reasonably open pine/palmetto flat, and devolves kwickly from that point.

I parked at N28* 46.577 / W081* 27.907. Where you park is entirely up to you. If you survive this hunt, you will have earned this smiley. Bring extra everything. Skeeter spray, batteries, lots of water, energy bars, etc. A hiking staff will come in handy for moving venomous snakes, waving at wild boars and black bears, and for knocking down the many spider webs you will encounter. You should waypoint where you left the road and create a track log if your GPSr is so equipped, so you can find your way out.

Did I mention this is not an easy hunt?

Near ground zero you will discover three small springs which form a stream that wanders west and dumps into Rock Springs Run after about half a mile. Take the time to explore the woods so you can visit all three boils. The ammo can you seek bears the standard Clan Riffster camo, making your quest that much more difficult. The cache is tethered to keep it from floating away when the water level is high. Please re-hide the can, and the tether, as you found it.

Special thanx go to Matt Bledsoe, who gave permission for this hide.

Good luck!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is Clan Riffster's contribution to the anti-micro campaigns being waged by so many other great cachers across Central Florida. It is a multi cache with 4 fairly easy to find stages, which I hope will amuse you throughout your quest. From your car, through all 4 stages, and back to your car should take you about 1 mile, mostly in the shade.

Stage 1 is just a hop, skip &amp; jump away from your car. A diligent search at ground zero should reveal something that doesn't belong, which will give you the coordinates to stage 2.

At Stage 2, you'll need to appease the Spirit of the Woods. Rumor has it, that if you empathize with him, he'll tell you how to find stage 3.

Stage 3 is a Florida native, jealously guarding his patch of real estate. These guys love to creep through the dense grass, ambushing unwary cachers. Make him happy and he'll provide you with the coordinates to the final.

This quest ends with a fairly large ammo can, filled with preloaded Clan Riffster camo'ed decon kits. Find the cache, take a decon kit, and leave some kewl swag to mark the auspicious occasion. Once all the decon its are gone, this swag will be transferred into a regular ammo can, and will represent the wonderful cachers of Central Florida. Feel free to upgrade the swag in your decon kit. I'm on a budget. LOL! If you find yourself swagless, feel free to take a decon kit any way. I've got a bunch of Dollar Store stuff I can throw in.

At this point I have a favor to ask; After you hide your decon kit, post a note here, with a link to your cache page. I think it'd be kewl to hunt them, knowing they were bred from a cache I placed.

Good luck!

Whoo Hoo!!! Hats off to Lady of the Woods, Boonieman, CondoMax and Katie, the intrepid geowonderdog, for their FTF! (thanx for the pen)

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The cache is not at the posted coordinates. Those coords are just a random spot in Mullet Lake. Look at the Additional Waypoints list near the bottom of this page for the starting point, called &quot;The Sign Zone&quot;, which is a cluster of signs near the Mullet Lake Park boat ramp.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
http://www.wherigo.com/cartridge/details.aspx?CGUID=bd60a7df-9e07-4265-9183-fd3f075f4b0d
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Your journey will take you from Mullet Lake Park in Geneva, through Mud Creek, Mud Slough, Hickory Slough, Snake Creek, and Thornhill Lake, ending at Cameron Wight Park in Sanford. These backwater channels parallel fairly close the course of the St John's River. However, the main river is practically bristling with drunken boaters, whilst you may not see a single soul during most of your journey.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Nature abounds back here, which is one of the reasons I love paddling these waters. Otters, deer, rabbits, alligators, snakes, turtles, bald eagles, and osprey can be seen on a fairly regular basis. Another neat aspect is that the average boating populace, which you can often hear zooming about hither and yon in the St John's River, are utterly clueless that these backwaters even exist. Let's keep this our little secret. The biggest exception to this are airboaters. In this area, the stereotype of airboaters being drunken fidiots hell bent on mayhem is rather accurate. Be vigilant, because they will not be, and you'll probably lose any boat to boat collision.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This cache requires some sort of vessel. My preference is a kayak. The channel you'll be going through can get very narrow, and very shallow. If the water is high, you might be able to navigate a small jon boat through it, but considering the replacement cost of propellers these days, I wouldn't risk it. Your call. On a side note, when the river was past flood stage, courtesy of Tropical Storm Fay, I drove a 21' patrol boat through here with no trouble.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The only reason for the 5 terrain, is the need for a boat. If that wasn't considered a piece of &quot;specialized&quot; equipment, I'd call it a 3/3.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
How it works:
This is a Wherigo cache. It was developed for use with a Garmin Colorado or Oregon, and has been succesfully beta tested on both. If you don't have one of these, you can visit the Groundspeak Wherigo forums to see what other devices have been made to work.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
At the web link near the top of the cache page, you'll be able to download the necessary Wherigo cartridge. During your journey, you'll be guided to specific geographic zones. As you enter each zone, you'll trigger a message which will display in your device, in the form of a question. Correctly answering the question will open up the next zone.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Good luck!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I highly recommend doing this cache at night, although that's not a requirement. There are very few things which get your blood going better than parking a 12' kayak on top of a 13' alligator at 2:00am. Talk about an E-Ticket ride! If you do opt to hunt this at night, please be sure you file a float plan with a loved one, and carry all the required gear for night time operation of a paddle craft.

Now sit right back and you’ll hear a tale
A tale of a fateful trip 
That started on Lake Mullet
Upon a tiny ship (…yak)
Upon a tiny ship (…yak)

The mate was a nerdy teacher gal
The skipper he was sore
After a 2-hour drive, for a 4-hour tour
…a 4-hour tour!

The powerboats were zoomin’ by
The tiny ship was tossed
If not for this well-crafted Whereigo
M&amp;M could have been lost
M&amp;M could have been lost.

The ship put-in on the shores of 
Many flats and little islands
With alligators…and herons too
Mr. Owl…and his wife
Egrets, Ospreys and Fishes too
Here on Clan Riffster’s Isles!

You know, until today, never quite realized the creative superpowers inspired by heatstroke!  [:O]  But seriously…we have been looking forward to trying out the Whereigo concept as a paddling cache since you were first putting the cartridge together.   So early this morning, we threw the yak on the Hyundai and began our journey by driving cross-state from Tampa and heading on over to the boat launch.  The park itself was kind of interesting because, by looking at the water marks on all the trees, it looks like there are times when we would be able to paddle in the parking lot itself…the river must get pretty high during storms, that’s for sure.  Then we spent a few minutes reading about manatees, amoeba &amp; bacteria before heading out on the water.  

Although we initially had to battle the current produced by the power boaters around the launch area, the actual Whereigo section of the paddle was pleasantly calm and we were fortunate to be paddling with the current at this point.   The Whereigo cartridge worked perfectly, without any glitches…as expected.  Something strangely comforting &amp; familiar about the style of this particular cartridge!  [;)] Funny story about the Blue Zone…before we arrived at the “spot”, we marveled at the beauty of this little island and said it reminded us of “Gilligan’s Island” , thus making the questioned item slightly ironic! [:)]

After seeing mucho wildlife, including a couple gators, an owl, anhingas, ospreys, ibises, egrets, herons, and plenty of fish, big &amp; small, we arrived at GZ.  While the “skipper” manned the “ship”, the first “mate” (that would be the “nerdy teacher gal”…or maybe “The Professor”) disembarked and hiked on over to GZ.  Loved the final location and found the ammo can well-secured and in good condition, guarded by several little frogs.   Signed the log and then continued to the last stage…and the long paddle back.

It wasn’t until we arrived at the final stage, that we realized that we could have parked a second vehicle here.   But even if we had taken the time to read all the details of the cache page, we didn’t know where Cameron Wight Park was…and since it was just the two of us, we wouldn’t have driven two cars all the way from Tampa anyway.  So  we took a deep breath, drank some water, poured some water over heads and began our 3.0 mile open-sun return to the original put-in. Smiles! Smiles! Smiles!  [:D] [:P] [:(!] [:D]

But we survived to tell the tale…and even enjoyed seeing some of those cool-looking riverside homes during this lively final stretch.  Then went for a well-deserved, guilt-free Whopper Value Meal!

Thanks for a cool Whereigo experience, Riffster!  Really like this concept as an alternative to paddling multicaches…rather than looking for lots of multi stages, it actually got us to really look at and interact with both the natural and man-made features in the area!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Clan Riffster's historical journey starts here, on the west bank of the lovely St John's River, at the northern most end of The Flagler Trail. Proceed on foot from the Trailhead to the cache. While you're here, you'll see the remnants of Castle McMuggle and Fort Riffster, practically side by side.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Make sure you read the directions for completing this cache series at the bottom of this page, before you start your journey. Special thanx go out to The Skulls, whose idea I blatently stole for this series.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Many centuries ago, Clan McMuggle was known as the most powerful of the tribes of Scotland. They travelled far and wide, planting their seed amongst those lasses impressed by such tomfoolery as wealth, fame and power. In a fit of Democrat like remorse over their success, the McMuggle tribal leaders decided to spread their wealth to those less fortunate, sponsoring a rather doltish family of red-headed step children known as Clan Riffster, in a journey to America, as their guests. Upon their arrival, the McMuggles built a fabulous castle of stone and iron on this spot, which stood for many centuries as a testament to their success. The patriarch of Clan McMuggle, Floridus, pronounced himself King of this land, which he inevitably named after himself to soothe his bloated ego.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(Any myths you might have heard regarding Spanish explorers should be discounted as fairy tales meant to slur the Scot's).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As is the case with most red-headed stepchildren, Clan Riffster was becoming a bit of a nuisance, constantly underfoot, mucking about in the plans of their betters, which eventually led to a certain degree of angst between the two families. Floridus McMuggle felt sorry for this 
squalid group of nose picking goat ropers, presenting Clan Riffster with sufficient gold so they could build their own castle, far, far away. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Imperial Magus of Clan McMuggle utilized his great magical powers to create magical metal storage boxes known as Ahmoh Kahns, and see through, pliable pouches called Zee Ploks, which he presented to Clan Riffster as a parting gift, to facilitate storage of travel goods which might otherwise be damaged by seasonal torrents. Unfortunately, Clan Riffster elected their leadership based upon their IQ scores, and mistakenly assumed that, like the great Scottish game of golf, lower must be better, which resulted in some amazingly bad judgment calls on their part. After receiving the gift of gold from King Floridus, Clan Riffster decided to invest in French courage potions, which had about as much chance for financial success as the Rosie O'Donnell diet plan. Obviously, they lost all of their gold in this endeavor, and instead of traveling afar, built a shabby wooden structure, (not even the kindest imagination could think of it as a fort), right next to Castle McMuggle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Clan Riffster was ever a slovenly clan, tossing their detritus out the windows of their &quot;fort&quot;, which upset the delicate sensibilities of Clan McMuggle. Many heated words were exchanged between the two Clans, however, they never came to blows until one fateful day when King Floridus was heard describing the Clan Riffster Tartan as &quot;quite a silly attempt at plaid&quot;. Those familiar with Scottish heritage know that the Tartan, (a plaid cloth pattern unique to each family), is that family's most sacred icon, and insult it at dire risk. Clan Riffster immediately declared war on Clan McMuggle, attacking their castle with ferocity, pummeling it with sticks, small rocks, pomegranites and fruitcakes, creating quite a racket. The one sided battle raged for days, until the McMuggles grew weary of the noise, at which time King Floridus threw a lit match on &quot;Fort&quot; Riffster. The hovel burnt to the ground in minutes, at which time Clan Riffster fled the battlefield. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thus begins the grand history of Clan Riffster.....
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Directions for completing the series:
You can treat #’s 1 through 4 as stand alone caches, trade swag, sign the log, etc., or, you can treat this as the first stage of a five part puzzle. If you have asperations of finding the final cache, &quot;The Last Stand of Clan Riffster&quot;, follow these simple steps:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
1) Locate the following caches in any order you choose: &quot;Great Scot (A Riffster`s Tale)&quot;, &quot;Clan Riffster's Riverside Retreat&quot;, &quot;The Search for Haggis&quot; and &quot;The Tearing of the Tartan&quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
2) Amongst the swag in each cache, you'll find a section of Angus Riffster's tombstone. These tombstone sections are not trade items, and should be left in the cache. One side of the tombstone is inscribed with the standard, sappy &quot;RIP&quot; stuff, whilst the backside is inscribed with mystic runes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
3) Bring a sheet of paper and a # 2 pencil, and practice the time honored art of tombstone rubbings, transfering a likeness of the runes on each tombstone section to your paper.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
4) Combine your four pieces of paper to receate the whole, decrypt the mystic runes, and go find the final stage.[/i]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Good luck!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;OK guys &amp; gals. This is my first attempt at a Wherigo cache, and I'm as nervous as a long tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs. It worked for me, using a Garmin Colorado 400C. Hopefully, it'll work for you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
http://www.wherigo.com/cartridge/details.aspx?CGUID=7c61d069-8376-4687-8eaf-8b8d35e3ea0f
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This quest is a tour of 10 natural, free flowing springs I've located within the forest. At the end of your journey, you'll be guided to an ammo can. You should load the yellow jacket nest coords into your GPSr and pay attention to where it is, since you'll pass very close to it, and being unaware of them could get you very dead.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Riffster Clan has long been fascinated by natural springs. Watching the bountiful water flowing from the heart of the earth, it's easy to see how native peoples from all over the planet viewed them as magical and mystical places. Many theologians argue that the creation principles of our world's most prominent religions stem from older, aboriginal myths based upon free flowing springs. Even if the closest you've ever been to spirituality was in college, kneeling in front of a commode, praying you, (or your partner), weren't pregnant, you should still be able to appreciate the beauty of these locations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
How it works:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is a Wherigo cache, requiring a Garmin Colorado or other comparable equipment. At the link near the top of the page, you'll get a down-loadable &quot;cartridge&quot;, which you'll install into your device. This cartridge is a series of zones. As your device senses that you've entered each zone, it'll display information, telling you where to go next, not unlike a virtual multi cache.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This patch of nature sees very few visitors, so there are still lots of critters about. During my journeys building this cache, I encountered black bears, deer, otters, raccoons alligators and various snakes, to include a couple venomous ones. Because I journeyed mostly in shorts, I also became quite intimate with chiggers and ticks. Long pants, snake boots, insect protection and a pokey stick should be required equipment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The D/T rating was based upon the assumption that you'll be driving to each parking area, which will give you a total combined hike of around 4.5 miles. I know some folks are just crazy enough to actually enjoy hiking, and will park at the entrance, hoofing it in. For those folks, the hike will be 20+ miles.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
How to enter:
As you drive down the main access road, you'll come to a pay station. Grab an envelope, drop in a buck and proceed. You'll need to do this if you drive in, hike in, bike in or horseback in. Ahead of you, you'll see a locked gate. If you call the Division of Forestry, at (352) 360-6675, you can get a free vehicle access permit, including the gate combo. If you do this ahead of time, they'll E-mail it to you. If you aren't into planning, you can call them from the gate, (during banker's hours), and they can fax it to a quaint little sporting goods store in nearby Sorrento for a small fee. You'll need to leave this permit on your dashboard while you are in the forest.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Don't have a Garmin Colorado? No worries! If you head over to the Wherigo forums, you'll find a list of other, much cheaper devices, which can be made to work. Viv got a shiny new Colorado 400C from Santa. Rumor has it that quality imported adult beverages make for great bribery material. As a further plus, each of these 10 springs is listed as a Waymark. How kewl is that?! You get an amazing natural experience, a Wherigo find and 10 Waymark visits, all in one trip!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Good luck!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Isonzo Karst, Llbase, Entomophile and ourselves decided to come over from the west coast and spend the day in the Seminole State Forest running this Wherigo.  An enjoyable day it was.

First full disclosure:  Since we, along with others in our group, own a Wherigo we decided to check the ins and outs of this one before departing.  We ran the whole thing through the emulator program and generated coordinates for all of the springs and the final before departing. Upon arriving at our meeting place in the morning we decided that we would look for the final cache first and the move on to visit some of the springs.

We entered the WMA and checked in at the hunter’s station.  A very helpful man there provided us with some maps of the forest roads.  We then proceeded immediately to the final parking area.  As we were preparing to begin our hike we noticed that some of us had slightly different coordinates from the others.  It appeared that one of us had position “O” different.  Not knowing which was correct we headed to the closest set of coordinates.

Upon our arrival, a few members of our group began examining a tree loaded with ladybugs while IK and I began searching for the cache.  After a brief examination of the area – palmettos, palmettos everywhere – we both figured we had to be at the wrong place, as this just didn’t seem like this could be correct.  We regrouped and headed .25 to the second set of coordinates.

We arrived at the second set and began our search.  The area looked like it could certainly be cache worthy, lots of fallen trees and moisture.  We searched the area extensively before deciding that maybe we had DNF’d the cache at the 1st set of coordinates.  Proceeded to hike .25 back though the palmettos to where we had first started searching…

It was at this point that Llbase decided to open the Wherigo program on his Pocket PC to see what it said.  It showed that we had triggered a zone and gave a nice hint.  Wish we had thought of looking at the Wherigo before!  We quickly located the cache this time.

We then proceeded to spend the rest of the morning and early afternoon searching for some of the various springs since this was the reason we traveled over here after all.  Enjoyed hiking to the sulfur laden springs.  Entomophile was able to pull some sharks teeth out of one of them much to the amazement of our son.  The springs themselves were quite beautiful some of them contained small fish and other wildlife.

We had a nice lunch at the picnic table near the Sharks Tooth spring, courtesy of IK….  and hunted a few other caches along the way. Made sure to check Wherigo to get the correct number at each spring we visited.

We had a really good time today hiking around the forest, finding the springs.  A very memorable cache!  The Wherigo appeared to work correctly at each spring although I would suggest making the zones larger – even with one of us using a Colorado and another using an Oregon we found it difficult to trigger the zones in some spots.   I am curious though as to why you don’t let the Wherigo software navigate you to the different locations.  It would be much less cumbersome than having to key all of the coordinates provided back into the GPSr.  

Thank you so much for all the work that you put into this and for a great day!

Thomas and Friends is a British&lt;br/&gt;children's television series, first broadcast on the ITV network in&lt;br/&gt;September 1984. Until season 7, which premiered in 2003, it was&lt;br/&gt;named Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends. This series was shot on&lt;br/&gt;35mm film. The first 12 seasons were filmed at Shepperton Studios.&lt;br/&gt;It is based on The Railway Series of books by the Reverend W. V.&lt;br/&gt;Awdry. These books deal with the adventures of a group of&lt;br/&gt;anthropomorphised trains and road vehicles who live on the&lt;br/&gt;fictional Island of Sodor. The books were based on stories Awdry&lt;br/&gt;told to entertain his son Christopher during his recovery from&lt;br/&gt;measles. Many of the stories are based on events from Awdry's&lt;br/&gt;personal experience. The show has featured celebrity storytellers&lt;br/&gt;Ringo Starr (1984–1986), Michael Angelis (1991–present)&lt;br/&gt;for the UK, with George Carlin (1991–1995), Alec Baldwin&lt;br/&gt;(1998–2002), Michael Brandon (2003–present), and Pierce&lt;br/&gt;Brosnan for the USA (Guest Narrator). Many businesses have been&lt;br/&gt;eager to cash in on the worldwide popularity of the series.&lt;br/&gt;'Thomas'-themed merchandise has appeared in almost every form&lt;br/&gt;imaginable, from books and magazines, through vast series of&lt;br/&gt;models, to duvet covers, cutlery, soft drinks and even spaghetti&lt;br/&gt;shapes. Heritage railways have also benefited from the series. &quot;Day&lt;br/&gt;out with Thomas&quot; events, in which passengers are given the chance&lt;br/&gt;to ride in full-size coaches pulled by locomotives resembling&lt;br/&gt;Thomas or his friends, provide a considerable source of income, and&lt;br/&gt;attract those who might not otherwise visit the railway. 4&lt;br/&gt;September 2009 was the 25th anniversary of Thomas &amp; Friends, as&lt;br/&gt;the first ever episode &quot;Thomas and Gordon&quot; aired on 4 September&lt;br/&gt;1984, on the British terrestrial channel ITV1. In the 100 Greatest&lt;br/&gt;Kids' TV shows poll conducted by Channel 4 viewers in 2001, the&lt;br/&gt;show was voted at #26.when you solve the puzzle you can click on&lt;br/&gt;the on the site below and check to see if you have solved the&lt;br/&gt;puzzle right and have the right cords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on &lt;br/&gt;Geochecker.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: TF29TAV - THOMAS &amp; FRIENDS&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Back in Junior High, my sister made me read a book which was written in 1947 by Marjory Stoneman Douglas, called &quot;River of Grass&quot;, in which Marjory called for the preservation of the Everglades. If I had to reflect back on my life, and what single event led me to have such passion for Florida swamps, I think that reading this book was it. I highly recommend it.

Years later, she bought me a book called &quot;Seeing the Light&quot;, a photographic biology of Clyde Butcher, which galvanized my love for all things swampy. Clyde has been taking black &amp; white photos of the Everglades longer than some of us have been alive. For those of you that don't know his work, in my oh so humble opinion, he puts Ansel Adams to shame. Do a Google search and see if you don't agree.

Although the ecosystem surrounding this cache is very different from the Everglades, it never fails to bring it to mind, especially at sunset and sunrise. The sights, the sounds and the smells all conspire to make me remember my trips down south of Gator Alley. This cache is my way of sharing those memories with you.

To hunt this cache will require either a boat, a lot of bushwhacking, or a long hike. You pick. If you come by boat, and it's got a shallow draft, you can beach it near N28* 49.704, W081* 13.381, slosh through a bit of shin deep water, and hike less than 1000' to the cache. Otherwise, you gotta park at the designated parking area on Reed Ellis Rd, N28* 49.921 W081* 11.497 and hoof it. From there, you can either, bushwhack just over a mile to the river prairie, (which is much easier if you follow game trails), then follow your arrow another half mile or so to the cache, or, you can follow the fenceline southeast, hugging the treeline as it curves south, till you locate a trail at N28* 48.994 W081* 11.368. Follow this trail southwest to the prairie, then follow your arrow to the cache. This route is just over 3.5 miles, one way. I've done the first two, but I'm too old &amp; fat to attempt the third route.

The St. John's River Water Management District issued me a special permit for the placement of this cache, and they've warned me that should any cacher attempt to shorten their hike to this cache by parking on 415 and hopping the fence, I'll lose my permit. Please don't do it.

For those of you that like hunting Benchmarks, you'll likely pass close to [URL=http://www.geocaching.com/mark/details.aspx?PID=AK6580]AK6580[/URL], perportedly located at N 28° 49.264 W 081° 11.612. Don't know 'bout all that, but I did find a couple white &amp; red posts with Benchmark Waypoint decals on them near N28* 49.136 W081* 12.773. Maybe you could snag a benchmark on your way out here?

FTF prize is a 1958 Belgium Silver 50 Francs coin. Please hide it as well as you found it. As you walk along the prairie, you'll see a string of small white SJRWMD signs, denoting the border for the property. Hunting is legal on the prairie between the signs and the St John's River, so use appropriate care.

The cache is tethered to keep it from floating away during flood season. Please take the time to hide the cache and the tether.

Good luck!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is part five of my simpleton puzzle series, which I’ve created in an ironic salute to local geogeniuses whose puzzles have left me drooling and glassy eyed, staring helplessly at my computer. This particular cache is dedicated to Jackie &amp; Bob, who have seriously injured this poor Riffster’s little brain with puzzles like “Baseball” (GCND7N) and “Olives are good” (GCN1FM). Although we found “Olives”, we can’t take credit for solving the puzzle, and I got no clue how to solve “Baseball”. Just looking at it makes my hair hurt &amp; my teeth itch.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Volusia County’s latest park, Hickory Bluff Preserve, is now open to the public, however, you need to be mindful of construction equipment on days they are working. A front end loader makes way too much racket for the driver to hear subtle noises such as geocachers.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This park is a Herpetologist’s wet dream. The place is chock full of snakes, frogs, toads, turtles lizards, newts, alligators and tortoises. It really is my kinda place. If’n you like things that hiss &amp; slither, come on down!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This quest requires that you locate 4 soda bottle preforms and 1 50 calibre ammo can. Inside each preform is a clue, which you’ll need to find the ammo can. In the first three preforms, you’ll find coordinates to the next one. In my testing of these spots, I observed a great deal of inaccuracy in my GPSr readings, often exceeding 20’. Because of this, I've added hints that are pretty specific. The preforms require only the shortest of bushwhacks. You’re total hike will be just about a mile, round trip, and will keep you on the “blue” trail, until you head to the final, which is fairly close to the parking area. FTF prize is a 1938 Canadian Silver Dollar. The rest of the swag is just Dollar Store toys.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The first preform can be found at:
N28* 49.713 W81* 07.359
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The final cache can be found at:
N 28* GE.OCA W 81* CH.ING
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Good Luck!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A couple decades ago, I had the fortune to marry into the Watson family, whose roots extend far back into the history of Enterprise. Shortly after we wed, Viv, (the brighter half of Clan Riffster), spent a day giving me a tour of the town, including those spots that were not on any map, though they were endearing to them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
One spot was a natural, free flowing spring, with bright green water, which I found particularly intriguing. Viv tells me she and her siblings, Annette, Bruce, Carolyn, Dwayne, and Ernie grew up playing in that spring, and the woods surrounding it. Back then, the only signs of past human activities were a set of concrete steps leading down to the water, and a partial retaining wall.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Many years later, we discovered the game of Geocaching, and I immediately thought of this spring as a place highly deserving of a cache. Fate, however, had other plans. About the time I got into the game, Volusia County purchased the property, throwing a fence up around it. Patience eventually prevailed, and over the years Volusia County turned this property into a lovely park with a playground, a pavilion, shaded walkways and bathrooms.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
In hunting for that perfect location, Viv found a spot that, (unlike a typical Riffster hide), won't require any bushwhacking. Most of your short walk will be on shady, paved paths, with just a brief stroll down a hard packed trail. You could probably nab the cache with both feet on the trail. The Lock &amp; Lock is camo'ed, but if you know what to look for, you should be able to see it from the trail.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Muggles are frequent in this park, so try to make your grab when there aren't any around. Please scatter a few leaves back on the cache to assist in keeping it hidden.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
FTF prize is a small, antique foreign silver coin.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Good luck!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
-Sean &amp; Viv

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(for more Clan Riffster history, visit this linky.) 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
http://www.geocaching.com/bookmarks/view.aspx?guid=7b925439-0bcb-474f-8757-7e0af1194cb5
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It is oft queried, why does Riffster paddle kayaks around all over the place? I mean, I don't exactly fit the profile, ya know? I mean, your average kayaker is slim, trim and looks like they belong on the cover of GQ. I, on the other hand, look more like something you’d find on the cover of National Inquirer. Not many folks are aware of this, but the Riffster Clan was once renowned for their kayak crafting skills. Many a Scottish lass and laddie learned to paddle their way around glen and bog in our boats. What kept us from fame was the competition, not the rumors that our boats leaked like sieves. Yeah, that’s it! The competition! Those vicious leaky boat rumors were spread in a vast left wing conspiracy, simply to discredit us.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My great, great grandpa, Morgus Riffster, (a keen businessman!), decided to find some place where competition wasn't so harsh. He searched the yellow pages for all the lands for thousands of miles around, finally locating a region utterly devoid of kayak builders. He gathered up the Clan, moving them roughly 2800 miles southeast, smack dab in the middle of the Sahara Desert. (sigh) His tombstone reads, “At least there twern't no bloody competition!” 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
After Morgus passed on, his youngest son Renard moved his family to the New World in hopes of renewing his kayak building trade in an area that actually had water. Renard kwickly settled in the DeBary area, purchasing the island where this cache is hidden. Renard, like most Riffsters, wasn't the crispest pickle in the jar, and after several months without a single kayak customer, he figured out the problem. No paddles! (surely it couldn’t be because his shop was way the heck out in the middle of nowhere)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To get to Riffster Island, one must paddle Upchit Creek, a narrow, winding shallow trickle of water, owned by the Upchit family. Bubba and Billie Jo Upchit were famous wood crafters, and Renard contracted with them to supply paddles for his business, thinking that this should cure his financial woes. Sadly, this arrangement dissolved within just a few days, when Renard, (ever a randy Scot), was caught in the Upchit's hayloft, “entertaining” Bubba's wife. In a fit of righteous anger, Bubba beat Renard unconscious, then drug his flaccid form back to the Riffster abode. Bubba loaded up all of the paddles he had crafted for Renard, and burnt them in a spectacular bonfire. When Renard awoke, he realized he was stuck on his island, and over the course of time, that branch of our family tree faded into obscurity.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As you might have guessed, this conflict resulted in the age old redneck expression, “You're up sh*t creek without a paddle”.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You may approach this cache any way you wish. The easiest method I've found is to launch from Gemini Springs, (N28* 51.758 / W81* 18.522), then paddle east to Upchit Creek, (N28* 51.906 / W81* 17.861), and turn south. Battle your way a couple hundred yards, and you'll enter Riffster Pond. Paddle southeast to Riffster Island, and find a place to park your 'yak. I recommend caution as you select your landing, as this pond is practically bristling with gators. Depending on the water height, you may encounter what we refer to as a wall of cabbage, (although it's not a wall, nor is it cabbage). It seems that, whenever the water table rises significantly in this creek, water hyacinths, (eichhornia crassipes), break free from the banks and congeal in certain spots, making for a rather difficult bit of paddling. These walls of cabbage are typically less than 100' wide, so just power through them and continue your paddle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Good luck, and don't get eaten!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

We chose this skate park as our hiding place, because this cache was created for our rugrats to find, and this park is within bike range for us. We'll take the kids out Sunday, 02-13-05, to look for it. Note: We'll make sure they leave the FTF dollar.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Our ongoing quest to translate, colate and codify our family
history has often left us with more questions than answers. This
particular tale is but one example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our long lost relatives, Dùghall Riffster, lived his life
as a simple farmer, (&lt;i&gt;simple being the operative word&lt;/i&gt;),
toiling in the turnip fields to provide food for his family. His
homestead once stood at the posted coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dùghall woke one morning to a curious site in his turnip field.
A strange, giant circular shape had been mashed into his crop. We
believe this is the first documented crop circle incident in
history. Dùghall, like most Riffsters, was not noted for his keen
intelect, and as such, this formation left him more angry than
afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days, several more circles appeared on his
farm, further enraging the imbecilic, bumbling twit. The best
answer Dùghall could come up with to explain these circles, was
that someone with incredibly large, perfectly round feet was
sneaking into his fields at night, to steal his turnips.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Dùghall mustered up what little courage he had, (&lt;i&gt;due largly
in part to having consumed several pints of Guinness&lt;/i&gt;), and
armed himself with his trusty targe and sghian dubh, donned his
Ghillie suit, and hid amongst his crops, hoping to ambush the
turnip thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the tale gets a bit sketchy at this point, so we'll
relate it to you, as it was passed down to us, and you can
interpret it as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dùghall spent many a cold night huddled amongst his turnips with
naught but the contempt of his family to show for his efforts.
Then, one blustery evening, just as he was about to give up, a
brilliant light filled the sky. &quot;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mo Chreach!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, he
exclaimed, throwing down his little wooden shield and dagger.
Dùghall decided that honor and valor were quite over rated, thank
you very much, and began running away, (&lt;i&gt;something Riffsters
excell at&lt;/i&gt;), when the light enveloped him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concious thought ended at that point. Dùghall was found several
days later, reeking of Guinness, with his clothes on backwards,
mumbling incoherently about &quot;&lt;i&gt;Spase Kreetures&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Cling
Ohns&lt;/i&gt;&quot; and something called &quot;&lt;i&gt;Eh-Gnal Proh-Bing&lt;/i&gt;&quot;. Stuffed
into the waistband of his kilt was this note, which I'll post for
your perusal.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In order to find this cache, you'll need to translate the note.
There are two ways to accomplish this task:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search Dùghall's home coordinates for a camo'ed decon kit,
containing a translation of this note. Using this method makes this
cache a fairly simple two stage multi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the information available in this cache page, combined with
the magic of the Internet, and translate the note from the comfort
of your home, similar to a single stage puzzle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please regard the suggested parking, as entry into the preserve
by any other location is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;First off, I should clarify the name of this cache. No, it's not named after a famous Central Florida cacher. (Sorry, Bob) B.O.B. is an acronym for a feature that is included on most of my favorite cache hunts; a Buttload Of Bushwhacking.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Be prepared to do a buttload of bushwhacking as you seek this cache. Memorizing a trail map will help reduce some of your bushwhacking. Printing out a satelite view will help even more.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
To find the final location, you will need to locate 10 metal tags placed throughout the preserve. These tags have been placed in such a way as to highlight the varying types of habitats and microecologies located within the preserve, to include scrub oak, palmetto flats, cypress domes, grass land and ephemeral ponds. Some of these locations are dry as a bone. Some are rather wet. You should come prepared.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
As you locate these tags, you'll notice that each of them bears a letter and a number, and that a proper assembly of the letters will spell out &quot;BSHWACKING&quot; (All that's missing is &quot;U&quot;!... Get it?... OK, that was lame. Sorry!)
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Make a note of each letter/number pair, and after you've found all 10 tags, you can find the final cache at,
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
N28.BSHWA
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
W81.CKING
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The odd placement of decimal points should clue you in that these coords are in Hddd.ddddd format, not the Hddd* mm.mmm format you're used to. You'll need a GPSr capable of accepting data in this format, or you'll need to learn to convert the data.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Please access this preserve via Pell Rd, which runs north from Maytown Rd. Accessing this area from Boy Scout Rd could be very rough, if not impossible, due to deep sugar sand. Volusia County would appreciate as little traffic as possible coming from this direction. Parking can be found off Lopez Rd.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
As you read the hints, please understand that I am not a botanist. If I call something a bay tree, it just means it's not a pine, palm or oak.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Good luck!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Some time back, I had the opportunity to speak with Govenor Jeb Bush, and I proposed the creation of a Bill of Rights for geocachers. After explaining what geocaching was, then explaining what a GPS was, and finally explaining what &quot;rights&quot; were, he seemed amicable to the idea.

The only drawback was, I didn't have a witty acronym for it. Jeb said that, any time you want to push a bill through the Senate, you have to have a witty acronym to go along with it. He cited several examples, such as D.A.R.E., (Drug Abuse Resistance Education), and C.C.A.T., (Citizens Combat Auto Theft). Y'all know Riffster's ain't the brightest bulbs in the chandelier, so if someone could come up with one, it'd sure help. 
Here's what I proposed:

[b]The Geocacher’s Bill Of Rights[/b]

[b][i]The Preamble to Geocacher’s Bill of Rights
Congress of the Holy Church of Signal,
begun and held at the City of Seattle,
in August, Two Thousand.
Here ye, here ye!

RESOLVED by Jeremy, Hydee, Elias and Bryan, of the Holy Church of Signal, in Groundspeak assembled, two thirds of the Lackeys concurring, that the following Articles be proposed to the Reviewers of the several States, as amendments to the Constitution of the Holy Church, all, or any of which Articles, when ratified by three fourths of the said Reviewers, to be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of the said Constitution; viz.[/b][/i]

[b]Amendment I[/b]
[b][i]Groundspeak shall make no law respecting the established Holy Church of Signal, or abridging the free expression of ideas on the forums, regardless of how silly those ideas might be, nor shall Groundspeak infringe upon the right of cachers to assemble, unless pocket caches are present, so long as two weeks notice has been given.[/b][/i]

[b]Amendment II[/b]
[b][i]The right of cachers to arm bears shall not be infringed.[/b][/i]

[b]Amendment III[/b]
[b][i]No Travel Bug shall, in time of peace be quartered in any cache, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.[/b][/i]

[b]Amendment IV[/b]
[b][i]The right of cachers to be secure in their hide-a-keys, film cannisters, cracked tupperware and leaky buckets, against unreasonable seizures, shall not be violated, unless said caches are placed near federal buildings, airports, train tracks, schools or courthouses.[/b][/i]

[b]Amendment V[/b]
[b][i]No cacher shall be held to answer for a guidelines violation, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a “Should Be Archived” log, nor shall a cacher be compelled in any guidelines violation case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, except in cases arising from the Holy Church of Signal being suitably offended.[/b][/i]

[b]Amendment VI[/b]
[b][i]In all guideline violation prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public forum flaming, followed by a trial, by an impartial Reviewer of the State and district wherein the violation shall have been committed.[/b][/i]

[b]Amendment VII[/b]
[b][i]In geoconflicts at common law, where the value of swag shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by lackeys shall be preserved.[/b][/i]

[b]Amendment VIII[/b]
[b][i]Excessive forum banning shall not be required, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted, unless the cacher likes that sort of thing.[/b][/i]

[b]Amendment IX[/b]
[b][i]The enumeration in the Geocaching Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the caching community.[/b][/i]

[b]Amendment X[/b]
[b][i]The geopowers not delegated to Jeremy, Hydee, Elias and Bryan by the Geocaching Constitution, are reserved to the Reviewers respectively, or to the cachers.[/b][/i]

It’s safe to assume the N28* &amp; W081* remain the same. Can you determine the other digits? Solve the puzzle, and the coordinates will lead you to a metal dog tag with the final location. Total hike is about a mile, with only a bare minimum of bushwhacking involved. If you choose to attempt this cache in shorts &amp; sandals, don't whine about your bloody shins. There are lots of thorns!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">It has often been asked at various NEFGA events, &quot;What's up with
the tin foil beanie?&quot; In truth, the correct term is &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;luminum
&lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;oil &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;eflector &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;eanie, or AFDB, as it is
commonly known that tin lacks the necessary deflective capabilities
found in aluminum. The purpose of this cache is to offer
instruction on both sides of the AFDB issue. 
&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Point:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The primary purpose of an AFDB is to prevent psychotronic
manipulation by the New World Order, (Novus Ordo Mundi), the
Illuminati and their NSA/CIA cronies. Our Government has long known
about the deflective properties of aluminum, as evidenced by the
fact that the town of Roswell New Mexico was founded in 1910, the
same year that aluminum foil was patented. Coincidence? Consider
this: The Reynolds company was hastily moved from it's small
factory in Ohio, to Roswell, in 1947, two weeks prior to the
infamous UFO crash. They were directed by Congress in a top secret
meeting, to change from being a generic milling company to a mass
producer of aluminum foil. Coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla have all
written dissertations demonstrating the power of aluminum in
blocking certain wavelengths. These dissertations, (along with
several others from lesser known scientists), have all been
classified top secret, and hidden away in a vault under the
Pentagon. Coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This illustration demonstrates conclusively how an AFDB
operates: 
&lt;br/&gt;
 FIGURE 1: An AFDB-covered brain (A) is shielded by a repulsive
resonance buffer (B), which deflects psychotronic fields (C).
Coherent psychotronic rays (D) are defected at the aluminum surface
(E) and decoherently scattered (F). The resonance buffer
encapsulates the brain (G), providing basal protection against
fields and glancing rays. Seems pretty simple to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those doubting Thomases amongst us, I offer one more piece
of evidence: In 1974, an unidentified Congressman released a Top
Secret document titled TINFOIL-HATS, an acronym for Theory
Integrating Numerous Flying Object Incidents Likely Having
Associations To Slayings, a unified theory that explained the JFK
assassination in terms of alien involvement and a government
coverup. This document was printed in its entirety by the New York
Press, shortly before their entire building mysteriously burnt to
the ground, bankrupting the owners. The Government offered funding
to that paper's only significant competition, the New York Times,
who promptly issued a story refuting the TINFOIL-HATS theory. To
date, the New York Times has refused numerous requests for any and
all supporting documents or sources of information for this so
called rebuttal. Coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Counterpoint:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In 1985, someone claiming to be ex CIA operative Norm Smith wrote a
book titled &quot;The Awful Truth About AFDB's&quot;. Mr Smith's book reveals
that the whole AFDB conspiracy was dreamed up by his office as a
way to track crackpots across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Smith demonstrates that AFDB's give off a very distinct
signature when hit with broadband Doppler radar, such as what is
used to track weather. Mr Smith goes on to say, &quot;By tracking these
returns over time, we can compile an extensive geospatial database
of the movements and activities of conspiracy theorists across the
country. The CIA, FBI, NSA, DOJ, TSA, and various other
three-letter government &quot;security&quot; agencies all have a vested
interest in controlling the burgeoning popularity of conspiracy
theories.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the unlikelihood that our Government would waste
billions of dollars a year on supercomputers just to see what
direction clouds are going, is indicative that Mr Smith's theory is
at the very least, credible. During a rare interview with a, (you
guessed it), New York Times reporter, Mr Smith left the confines of
his Faraday shelter and stated, &quot;The real mission of weather
computers and data collection equipment is to study meme
propagation, so that the government can subvert the process and
spread bogus conspiracy theories that will lead people away from
the sinister truth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sinister truth, you might ask?&lt;br/&gt;
Mr Smith retreated back into his shelter, refusing further
comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;
 I've reported both sides of this issue, so that you, the reader,
can make an informed decision on whether or not to build and wear
your own AFDB. My thoughts on the matter? I'm wearing mine, as I
type this up. Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean THEY
aren't out to get you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;TH18BPQ - Beresford Trailhead&lt;br/&gt;N 28° 59.446 W 081° 20.284&lt;br/&gt;Enter the hike/bike trail here. Close the gate behind you. Thanx!</groundspeak:long_description>

Consider this cache your invitation to try out the &quot;other&quot; side of geocaching. Mark &amp; Peggy of The Jailbirds, as well as Vince &amp; Janet of The Flatouts, this can's for you!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Park at the listed coordinates, then hit the trail, going under the &quot;trestle&quot;, then turn right. Go about half a mile along a well shaded, paved trail, till you reach the dead end. Lock your bike, if you rode in, so it'll be available when you stumble, bleeding and tick laden, from the woodline. Your quest begins at this point. You have what I would consider to be a fairly light, 300' bushwhack to the final, where you'll find an ammo can, tethered to prevent Mother Nature from muggling it. If you survive, and decide you like this kind of hunt, congratulations! You've hopefully evolved to the point where you can't even consider calling a film canister a geocache, and your eyes will be forever open to hunting caches with more than a 1/1 D/T rating. ;-) I have many more bushwhacking type caches that are much more severe than this one. For those of you that already appreciate a good bushwhack, this one will be pretty tame. Sorry guys!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Critters I've encountered in the last two days include black bears, bobcats, gators, various snakes, gobs of spiders, one yellow jacket nest, (a serious hazard if you're allergic), and more ticks than I've seen in years. Come prepared.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Good luck!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;As with most night caches, the cache is not located at the posted coordinates. Those coordinates represent the suggested parking for this cache. Alternate parking is at N29* 00.442, W81* 24.627. This night cache is somewhat unique, in that you'll need to do more than just mindlessly following reflectors through the woods.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

To successfully complete this cache, you'll need a GPSr with a track log feature, and you'll need to be familiar with creating track logs. When you park, proceed on foot to The Twins, at N29* 00.465 / W081* 24.629, which is just a brief stroll away. At those coords, you'll locate three triangular reflectors affixed to a tree. This is your starting point.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Turn on your track log and look roughly northeast for another reflector. Continue following reflectors for about 1.6 miles, until you locate another set of three reflectors. This is your end point. Sounds simple, huh? Ha! If you wanted simple, you wouldn't be way the heck out in the woods, at night. You'd be wandering through 500 acres of exhaust laden, sweltering, Wally World blacktop looking for a film canister in a lamp post, dodging soccer moms in SUV's.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

As you move from reflector to reflector, your track log will be drawing a giant picture, not unlike a [url=http://www.kelt.com/hippo/travels/peru/nazca.html]Geoglyph[/url]. You'll need to decipher the location of the cache from the image you've just drawn. As your picture forms on your GPSr screen, the final location of the cache, a rather large, Clan Riffster camo'ed ammo can, should become [b]Blatantly Obvious[/b]. If you survive the trek to the final tree, and can't figure out your &quot;picture&quot;, you can search that tree for something that should help you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The rules for this hunt are pretty basic:
Arrow pointing straight up = walk straight ahead.
Arrow pointing slightly right or left = turn slightly in that direction.
Two arrows pointing sharply downward = turn sharply in that direction.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The total length of the reflective trail is about 1.6 miles, and almost all of that is bushwhacking. Please come prepared for a vigorous trek through inhospitable territory. Necessary accessories for this hunt should include an extra flashlight, extra batteries, skeeter repellent, snake boots, durable pants, long sleeves, a hat and a stout hiking staff. A change of clothes would be a real good idea, as one section of swamp is nipple deep. You'll need to work out the dynamics for yourself, for changing clothes out in the woods. If you go in a group, you should consider rotating the lead person, so everybody gets to experience the joys of planting a 5&quot; banana spider square in your face. If you scream like a little girl at your first spider facial, don't sweat it too much. If you're still screaming by the fifth spider, you might wanna take up knitting. Bears are prominent in the area, so come prepared. Having a firearm in Ocala, at night, whilst waving flashlights around is generally considered to be a real bad idea. No, I won't bail you out of jail.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The D/T rating of 3/5 came from the geocaching terrain/difficulty generator. The &quot;5&quot; came from the fact that a GPSr with a track log is required. I'd call this a 3/3, myself. Hunting is legal in this section, but not at night. However, that doesn't seem to stop the locals from blasting bambi after hours.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Critters you will encounter include ticks, chiggers, skeeters and deer. Critters you'll probably encounter include black bears, wild hogs, rattlesnakes and water moccasins. Expect to get wet at a few points. Can't have a true Riffster cache without a bit of swamp, can we? The single greatest threat is to your ankles. I've twisted mine twice while building this cache, stumbling through the saw palmetto fields.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Good luck &amp; don't get ate by critters!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Preemptive Evolution Enhancement Probing System
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Thanx to the members of E.G.A.D.S. and Agent StarGazer, many truths have been revealed regarding the presence of alien life forms, and their activities within the Ocala National Forest. The link between extra terrestrial activity and the mineral Boron is now known, as well as the real purpose behind those black Suburbans.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The missing link in the data has always been PEEPS. Those who possess the ability to look past outward appearances have known for years that those fluffy marshmallow treats were harbingers of evil, and as such, they surely must also play a role in the Conspiracy, yet, until now, that role remained hidden. I believe the truth should be known, which is why I have elected to present you with the facts, to do with as you will.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
It is no coincidence that PEEPS first showed up in candy isles in the late '40s. Following the Roswell crash, the alien horde recognized a need for controlled boron extraction, as well as needing a reliable method for targeting test subjects. PEEPS turned out to be the perfect solution for both problems. When the NSA developed PEEPS, they included an ingredient called mellaniatholamine-2. This chemical has but one purpose: increasing boron absorption in humans. Because of its unique molecular structure, mellaniatholamine-2 bonds with boron in lower intestinal tract tissue. The boron is later removed from the test subjects through a probe, inserted into a &quot;sensitive&quot; area.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Human evolution created us to be sugar junkies, and PEEPS, which appear to be the personification of gooey, sugary goodness, are the perfect delivery system for mellaniatholamine-2. As you know, boron has a peculiar harmonic resonance which, when combined with trailer parks, can be detected utilizing off the shelf, consumer grade electronics. The aliens scan the planet's surface, searching for those unfortunate souls who have fallen to the PEEP temptation. With highly elevated boron levels, the victims are easy to locate, and with just a slight twist of the space/time continuum, they are &quot;whooshed&quot; aboard the starships, where the probing begins.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
It is my fervent argument that PEEPS must be held accountable for their role in the Conspiracy. They appeal directly to our tender hearts and taste buds, then betray us, smirking amongst themselves as we are taken away. Our mental suffering and loss of dignity is directly related to their actions, and there must be a reckoning, before all is lost.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Don't be a victim of PEEPS subterfuge!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Post Script: When the data was compiled and evaluated, a numeric anomaly was observed. Although alien abductions occur at a higher rate in trailer parks throughout the south, PEEP consumption appears to be highest in the San Francisco area. E.G.A.D.S. spokesperson Joe Merchant theorized, &quot;I reckon them folks out in San Francisco must really like probing&quot;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Probing System&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends, it is my contention that PEEPS, &lt;i&gt;all PEEPS&lt;/i&gt;, must
die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you choose to blind yourself to the obvious role that
PEEPS play in the targeting of humans by extra terrestrials, you
surely know, deep down inside, that PEEPS are a force of evil.
PEEPS are inherently foul. Though they profess to be naught but
cute marshmallow treats, they are, in fact, the ultimate betrayers,
using our love for sweets against us in their decades old alien
assimilation assistance campaign. Listen not to their lies, for you
will be ever beset by more lies. They deserve neither mercy nor
restraint. Rather, the vitriolic method they used to twist our
trust should be met with extreme prejudice and terminal violence.
Remember, all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that
good men do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fight the good fight with me, me brethren! Take up thy sword,
thy axe, thy laser, thy microwave oven, and help rid the world of
this nefarious menace before it's too late!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zap them!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fry them!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Smores them!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
(A most satisfying solution combining melting, smashing,
masticating and digesting)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boil them!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nuke them!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Impale them with stinky cigarettes!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
(if the impalement doesn't kill them, the second hand smoke
will)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BBQ them!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trick them into killing each other!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
(Tell one PEEP that the other one was talking about his mom)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PEEP, to the last I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab
at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee. I'll chase
the PEEP round perdition's flames before I give it up! And I
wouldst pile upon the PEEPS purple, pink and yellow humps the sum
of all the rage and hate felt by my whole race from Adam down. If
my chest was a cannon, I would shoot my heart at thee. Let us go
forth, my Brothers, with fear and courage and rage to save the
world! Rage! Rage against the PEEPS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post Script: I was able to drive to within 1000' of ground zero,
then hike well tended trails to about 250' away. The cache is
tethered and has leaves scattered over it. Please rehide it as you
found it.&lt;/p&gt;

It is located in the Ocala National Forest.  The cache container is a drab olive colored plastic box.  The box contains a disposable camera (please take your picture) and a variety of other items:  a log book and pen, a topographic map of the area, two bottles of water, a whistle, a bag of girls rings, a tie pin, a game CD, a music CD, an aluminum disk marked &quot;CASTLE CACHE&quot;, a hat, a NGS data sheet and a drawing template.  There is a faint trail and an open grassy area if you approach the cache the easy way, but otherwise you will have to blaze some trail.  You will probably need 4-wheel drive to get near the cache but there is a clay road that a car could drive down if you know which road.  From the main road (FR 573) it would be a 1.5 mile hike one way.  Note that deer-hunting season begins soon and will run till mid January.  Wearing a fluorescent orange vest might be a good idea.  Good luck and we hope you enjoy the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LeicaMan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brad, Beth, Erin and Trevor Minnix&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Viv &amp; I spent half a day driving our 'Yota up &amp; down &amp; around the Jeep trails bordering the Alexander Springs area of the Ocala National Forest. Oddly enough, we discovered that, along with motor vehicles and bicycles, hang gliders are prohibited in that area. [i]Hang gliders[/i]? Hey, it's on the signs. We ain't making this stuff up. Many vehicular challenges later, we found what appeared to be a trailhead of some sorts at N29* 01.966 / W081* 26.089.

(I should tell you that we found a much easier way out than the miles &amp; miles of wandering Jeep trails which led us here)

We parked the Riffster Mobile and set off to see where it went, and discovered a ravine, which led to an unmarked triple boil spring begging for a cache. The water coming from the boils forms a 10' pool, then wanders North to parts unknown. It is cold and inviting, but I was too chicken to drink any.

There is very little bushwhacking required to get to the cache, if you pick the right trails. It's about 1/4 mile from the trailhead. I couldn't tell if the water level changed seasonally, so I tethered the cache with 5' of para-cord. Please re-hide the cache, and the tether, as well as you found it, since muggle sign is fairly abundant. (beer cans in need of CITO) Viv asked me to warn y'all about the HUGE spiders in the area, and we dodged a few piles of bear scat. The sun creeped below the horizon as I hid the cache, and the skeeters immediately started their blood frenzy. Bring lots of DEET!

FTF prize is a 1980 English 50 New Pence coin.

Good luck!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Well it seems as though I have done it again and slipped into something beyond control. Every since I placed the X-File caches in Osceola National Forest strange things have been happening to me. Strange phone calls, black sedans following me and now a meeting with the weirdest individual I have ever met. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Let me tell you a story just so there is a public record in case something happens to me.After finding Operation Hastings by another cacher I was questioned about what I knew about Operation Hastings and The Voices from the Scrub. I explained to these people that they were simply geocaches and they kept asking me about dates and times and if I had any recordings of the voices. I could not convince them there was no great conspiracy here just geocaching.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then on Dec 5, I get a call from a gravelly voiced individual who said to meet him at these coords and he would make it all clear. Not wanting to go alone I called a few close caching friends(Dave and Michelle and 2LuknF8) to go with me to this meet. As we arrived at the meeting point the black suburbans that had followed us all day seemed to mysteriously disappear. We arrived at the trails end and this old grey hair man in a trench coat came out of the woods. He told us a story that I still find hard to believe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He told us of a secret military operation called Operation Hastings and experiments gone horribly wrong. He gave us only the vaguest of details but his final words are burned into my mind.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&quot;the truth is out there for those willing to pay the price to find it&quot;. So Dave and Michelle and Myself have taken the mission to discover the truth. I have left a cache here simply to mark my presence and to remember the strange sightings in the area nearby. If you choose to seek this cache beware their are untold dangers nearby that we will try to bring to light later.

&lt;b&gt;(1) Groundspeak shalt be thy Supreme Deity in all things regarding Tupperware hidden in the shrubbery, and thou shalt have no other cache listing service before them
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(2) Thou shalt not post an image or any likeness of what is in the shrubbery, lest thou spoil the hunt of thy brethren
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(3) Thou shalt not take the name of Signal in vain
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(4) Remember the CITO day and keep it holy
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(5) Honor your Reviewer and your Forum Moderator
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(6) Thou shalt not kill another cacher. (unless they post an SBA on thy cache)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(7) Thou shalt not lust over the stats of others
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(8) Thou shalt not muggle caches, nor shalt thou steal coins or bugs
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(9) Thou shalt not bear false witness in thy cache logs
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(10) Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's ammo can&lt;/b&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Let's say, for whatever reason, you're the first human ever to make
alien contact. Yes, I know, pretty unlikely. Probably isn't going
to be you. That's a given. But it would be a good idea for us to
spare a few minutes and think about it.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Well, for one: Most historians and scientists agree this
would be the most important moment in all of human history! In
fact, it's generally accepted that in generations to come, all of
history would be divided into &quot;Pre-Contact&quot; and &quot;Post-Contact&quot;
eras, instead of the &quot;BC / AD&quot; distinctions we use now. So, to put
it one way, you're going to be the most important person in
history. The day you make contact will live on, through all
cultures and civilizations, for as long as the human race exists.
It will be the defining moment for our entire species. But try not
to think about that. You might get nervous and screw something up.
Just keep a few key points in your head and try to keep your
cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first: Hold your a$$ still!&lt;br/&gt;
The aliens will be quite used to things flailing like crazy and
trying to get away. They'll most likely have picked up a fish or a
bird and watched as it flapped like an idiot until it died. They
know this is what non self-aware organisms do. Holding still is the
first thing you need to do to show them we're worth our weight in
crap. Also, some basic statistics will tell you why you don't need
to panic: Between the insane rate at which technology advances, and
the massive amount of time a species must exist to travel through
interstellar space, the odds that we will be technologically within
5,000 years of the aliens are roughly absolute zero. Think about it
this way: It won't be &quot;lasers vs. machine guns&quot;, it'll be more like
&quot;nuclear weapons vs. sponges&quot;. The fact that you're still alive
will mean they are going to allow us to exist. Fighting them,
Matrix-style, is just not going to happen. Relax and make this
count. Don't panic when you see them. They're going to look weird,
if they have physical bodies at all. They likely won't look like
anything that has ever evolved on Earth. Hold still, be deliberate,
and react cautiously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up: Finding a medium to communicate through.&lt;br/&gt;
They won't speak your language, and won't be able to mess with your
thoughts. They might not communicate through sounds, and may not
even hear the frequencies we talk through. Human language, with its
fickle syntax, won't do. Feel free to talk, but know that this will
just give the aliens a general feel for how we sound. You won't be
able to convey ideas verbally at first. If the aliens seem to
respond to visible light, writing things down is your best bet. You
can tell whether they respond to visible light by checking out
their technology. Is it color-coded in any way? Is it shiny,
polished or decorated with text of some kind? If so, great, that
makes things easy. If not, they most likely respond to other types
of radiation. That's tougher. You'll need to use rocks, or other
three dimensional objects, to communicate. You should probably
bring your own pen. If they provide any kind of writing mechanism,
it won't likely be the familiar cylinder that fits so nicely into
our opposable digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algorithms! Do you speak it?&lt;br/&gt;
So how can you sum up the last 10,000 years of scientific discovery
in a completely universal way? Easy: Math! The aliens won't know
who Pythagoras was, but they'll sure as heck know his theorem. The
right triangle will show our alien visitors, without any doubt,
that humans are scientific-minded. Draw a right triangle. I bet
that'll get quite the reaction out of them. Label the sides as
shown below. They'll probably love that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget your pen, or do the aliens only respond to gamma
radiation? Well then you'll need to make do. Got a dollar bill and
some coinage? Time to get creative. Fold up a bill as shown below
to make a right triangle. Arrange your coins as shown in the last
step to prove your mastery of the basics of geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the aliens will, let's face it, probably be major math
nerds, they may have things they want to show you. You will
probably be hopelessly out of your league. Don't feel bad; so would
Einstein. You might want to let the aliens know that we feel most
comfortable in Base-10 math. If you can write, or make marks in
sand, something like this might suffice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming a mastery of high school mathematics, the
extraterrestrials will now understand that we're a Base-10 kinda
species, and with any luck, they can begin using our familiar
numeral system to talk logic. They might pose questions to you,
ranging from describing Pi, to predicting prime numbers, to
describing lambda calculus. If you don't know, immediately repeat
some kind of obvious &quot;I have no idea&quot; gesture, so they can tell
when you're in way over your head. I would highly suggest you
re-familiarize yourself with basic geometry and algebra now, so you
don't make Earth look dumb by not knowing how to find the diameter
of a freekin' circle if you're the first person they abduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep this stuff in mind: They won't know who Einstein was, but
they'll know about relativity. They won't call it &quot;Newton's Laws&quot;,
but they'll know about the conservation of energy. They won't know
the Mona Lisa, but they'll know hydrogen has one proton. They won't
know our religions, but they'll know Pi is irrational. They won't
know the name &quot;Darwin&quot;, but they'll be familiar with natural
selection. They'll be familiar with binary, but it won't be zeros
and ones. If they send you a message with only two characters,
repeating, that's binary. It does not matter which character is our
&quot;zero&quot; and which is our &quot;one&quot;. A good universal constant to bring
up will be the speed of light, but keep in mind they know what a
&quot;meter&quot; or a &quot;second&quot; is. They'll know mathematical operators, but
they won't know &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;, etc. You'll need to do a few sample
math problems for them to catch on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great job so far! Now for the end game:&lt;br/&gt;
At this point, the aliens will know we're somewhat intelligent. But
let's face it; you've spent a few hours on some kind of alien craft
and you want to get home and probably take a shower. Wrapping this
up will most likely involve two things: Expressing our desire to
learn about them, and acting as their spokesperson for the rest of
the world. Draw a simple picture of our Solar System, as shown.
It'll let the visitors know that we understand astronomy. Make an
orbit around the third dot from the Sun; that way they'll know we
understand our place. That's really, really important. And don't
use arrows to point to things; that probably isn't as intuitive to
aliens as it is to us. Conveying that we have discovered our place
in the Universe is absolutely key. This will show aliens that we're
curious, scientific, and willing to learn more about the
Cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, show some daggum humility:&lt;br/&gt;
To conclude, you're going to need to let the aliens know we've
unearthed our own evolutionary history. Put your personal feelings
aside here: Do not look an alien race in the eyes (eyes?) and tell
them the universe was created just for us. A good number of
scientists believe this might be the &quot;ultimate&quot; cosmic IQ test: The
bar by which all alien races measure self-awareness. Do you
personally believe that the human race, and only the human race,
was crafted by a creator? That's kewl, but suck it up for ten
minutes and draw some kind of evolution chart, showing an increase
in complexity resulting in a human being. Don't fail the cosmic
citizenship test for our entire species, okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, time to get outta there!&lt;br/&gt;
Let's get you back home so you can take your place in history. The
hardest part is over. Now it's time to get back to civilization,
take that shower, and become the most famous human to ever live.
You'll probably be the sole spokesperson for the alien race, so
keep this stuff in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 ) Get dropped off in a major city.&lt;br/&gt;
If you're able, try to direct the extraterrestrials to drop you off
in the nearest major city. This'll be tough, since they won't know
what a mile is, what north or south are, or latitude and longitude.
Pointing with your hands is also not your friend here. Try drawing
out the local landscape, or coastline, as literally as possible.
Tall buildings should be made obvious. They should pick up on
this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 ) Involve the local news.&lt;br/&gt;
Don't &quot;hold out&quot; until you talk to the President, or someone dumb
like that. There are plenty of interested parties (political,
military, intelligence) who will absolutely screw you if they get
the chance. Make sure every reporter gets your picture, every
newspaper knows the visitors are peaceful, and every media outlet
knows you as a normal person who got caught up in an extraordinary
experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 ) Seriously? No pop culture references.&lt;br/&gt;
If you get dropped off in front of a crowd of onlookers, don't make
your first words something like &quot;They're nothing like E.T.&quot;-
Spielberg doesn't deserve that. Keep your first, immortal words
something simple: &quot;They're peaceful&quot;, or &quot;We've made contact&quot;, you
know, something that'll go on a plaque. If you're dropped off in a
foreign country, it doesn't matter. Someone will write down what
you said. Don't start grunting or attempting to speak the bit of
French you learned your freshman year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 ) You'll probably be killed.&lt;br/&gt;
Unfortunate. You'll be the most important human on Earth, and no
matter what you do, you'll be extremely controversial. There are
simply too many subversive parties who will want you dead for
whatever reason, and they'll most likely succeed eventually. There
isn't much you can do about this one. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 ) Reproduce as much as possible.&lt;br/&gt;
Have a bunch of descendants. If the aliens are big into progeny,
they might be designated some kind of ruling race in the future.
&quot;Descendants of (&lt;i&gt;insert your name here&lt;/i&gt;&quot; has a good ring to
it, don't you think? Plus it'll keep your genes alive for a really,
really long time. And that's what it's all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck, and don't muck this up for us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;FN266GT - Alexander Springs Takeout Point&lt;br/&gt;N 29° 02.760 W 081° 30.508&lt;br/&gt;Leave a second vehicle here, at the end of the run.

There used to be a cache located near here called Don Sixto's Cigar Box. When I used to bring new cachers to the ONF I inevitably always brought them here. I think this is one of the nicest unspoiled areas of the forest. Getting here will be the problem. The access road to the cache is quite washed out and rutted and there are some holes on that road that will stick a car or low ground clearance truck. The hike into the cache is about 1/2 mile give or take but is quite a hike with all the pot holes and gulleys. The area stays wet most of the time and can be snake infested as well. The cache is hidden in typical Florida?Georgia style for the area. The title will provide an additonal hint when you are at ground zero. have fun and enjoy.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">OK, so it's not yellow. And technically speaking, it's no longer a road. At least I got the brick part right!

Many years ago, when the water level was high, my Brother in law took me bowhunting to this area. I was fascinated by this short stretch of brick road, rising up out of the swamp water. Once I got into caching, I knew I'd have to share it with y'all. Whilst you're in the area, be sure and check out
[url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=92135f7c-5e7a-47d8-91fd-3d11ac304600]DeLand Duo's Dauntless 2K[/url], which is right across the street.

This is an active wildlife management area, which means you must sign in and out of the property. The closest place to do this is at the Dukes Island Rd kiosk, which can be found at N29* 07.281 / W081* 10.454. Folks hunt these woods fairly heavily, so you might elect to stay out of them during hunting season. Your call.

There are three basic routes you can take to get to this cache. To paraphrase one of my favorite Clint Eastwood movie titles, we'll call these three routes &quot;The Good&quot;, &quot;The Bad&quot; and &quot;The Ugly&quot;.

&quot;The Good&quot; involves a pleasant stroll, (or bike ride), of about 9/10 of a mile, one way. Almost no bushwhacking required, and a fairly solid surface to walk on so you can be stealthy, and hopefully see some of the abundant wildlife in this area. I'll leave it up to you to determine where this route begins. It ain't hard to find. This stretch of &quot;road&quot; is being preserved as a historical site, and driving on it is strictly forbidden.

&quot;The Bad&quot; involves bushwhacking from the aforementioned kiosk roughly 0.64 miles one way, through fairly dense palmetto thickets and pine flats. Expect lots of scratches, ticks &amp; chiggers.

&quot;The Ugly&quot; involves parking on the shoulder of State Rd 92, and bushwhacking only about 0.15 miles one way through some nasty swamp, bristling with venomous snakes and poisonous plants.

You choose. I've been all three ways, and I can assure you, the longer way is better.

When you get close to ground zero, you'll see some old pine logs piled about, covered with wild grape vines. These logs WILL NOT support your weight, if'n you're anywhere near as fat as I am. I learnt this the hard way. Also, mixed amongst the wild grape, I saw some poison ivy, but I managed to avoid it. Please be careful once you leave the yellow(?) brick road! Toto is not there to save you.

As with a lot of my caches, the ammo can is tethered to prevent it from floating away when the water gets high. Please take the time to hide the tether after you replace the cache.

FTF prize is a silver Mexican Un Peso coin.

Good luck!

If you post a blank log, or nothing but some silly ass acronym, as your way of expressing your gratitude to the folks who spent countless hours hiding caches for you to find, folks might get the impression that you cache with a cell phone. Rather than risk such an embarasing prejudgement, consider actually taking the time to post about your experience during the hunt. Cache owners really appreciate the feedback.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the end&lt;br/&gt;
Beautiful friend&lt;br/&gt;
This is the end&lt;br/&gt;
My only friend, the end&lt;br/&gt;
Of our elaborate plans, the end&lt;br/&gt;
Of everything that stands, the end&lt;br/&gt;
No safety or surprise, the end&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; Two years later, and I'm still stuck in this
hell hole. The NEFGA high command promised me they'd send an
extraction team once I completed my mission to sanction Paint
Fiction, but like most politicians, there words didn't match their
deeds. (sigh...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several months ago, tired of waiting for the white robed goons
of the NEFGA Hegemony to keep their promises, I decided to paddle
my way upriver, in the hopes that there may be some semblance of
civilization at the headwaters. The only thing I found on my
journey was a bunch of nuerotic kids and a whacked out photographer
by the name of Joe Merchant. Our conversations were, well, let's
just say they were interesting, to say the least....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joe Merchant:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Sound the siren... There's film cans
over there, there's hide-a-keys over there, and watch out those
dang alligators bite, I'll tell ya. Eh, that's a pretty one. Move
in right in towards me... I´m an American ! Yeah, American
civilian. Hi yank... American, american civilian. It's all right.
And you got the cigarettes, that's what I've been dreaming
of.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Who are you ?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joe Merchant:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Who are you ... ? I'm a
photojournalist. I've covered the micro cache war since 01. I've
been in Palatka, Osceola, Ocala... I´ll tell you one thing,
this kayak is a mess, man.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Who are all these kids?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joe Merchant:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Yeah, well... They think you have come
to take him away. I hope that isn't true.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Take who away ?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joe Merchant:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Him. Serial Finder. These are all his
children, as far as you can see.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Could I, uh, talk to Serial
Finder?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joe Merchant:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Hey, man, you don't talk to the Finder.
You listen to him. The man's enlarged my mind. He's a poet-warrior
in the classic sense. I mean sometimes he'll, uh, well, you'll say
hello to him, right? And he'll just walk right by you, and he won't
even notice you. And suddenly he'll grab you, and he'll throw you
in a corner, and he'll say do you know that 'if' is the middle word
in life? If you can keep your head when all about you are losing
theirs and blaming it on you, if you can trust yourself when all
men doubt you -- I mean I'm no, I can't -- I'm a little man, I'm a
little man, he's, he's a great man. I should have been a pair of
ragged claws scuttling across floors of silent seas -- I mean
--&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; {mutters)&lt;i&gt;&quot;This guy is looney
toons...&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joe Merchant:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Hey, uh, don't go -- don't go without
me, OK? I want to get a picture. He can be terrible, he can be
mean, he can be right. He's fighting the micro war. He's a great
man. I mean... I wish I had words. I can tell you the other day he
wanted to kill me.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Why did he want to kill you ?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joe Merchant:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Because I took his picture. He said if
I take his picture again 'I'm gonna kill you'. And he meant it ! So
you just lay it cool, lay back, dig it... He gets friendly again,
really does. But you don't judge him like an ordinary man. OK, now
watch it. Can you feel the vibe of this place? Let me take a
picture. Hey, hello... hello. Would you hold it for a
minute.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; As I look around, I notice that the whole area
is infested with film cans. Joe must've noticed the scowl which
came across my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joe Merchant:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;The film cans. You're looking at the
film cans. I, uh -- sometimes he goes too far, you know -- he's the
first one to admit it!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;He's gone crazy!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joe Merchant:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Wrong! Wrong! If you could have heard
the man, just two days ago, if you could have heard the man! You
going to call him crazy?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;I just want to talk to him.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joe Merchant:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Well man, he's gone away. He's gone
away. He disappeared into the jungle with his people...&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;I'll wait...&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joe Merchant:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;... he feels comfortable with his
people. He forgets him with his people. He forgets himself...Why?
Why would a nice guy like you wanna mess with a genius? You know
that the man really likes you. He likes you, he really likes you.
He's got something in mind for you. Aren't you curious about that?
I'm curious, I'm very curious. You curious? There's something
happening out there, man. You know something, man, I know something
that you don't know. That's right, jack. The man is clear in his
mind, but his soul is mad . Oh yeah. He's fading, I think. He hates
all this, he hates it! But ... the man's ... uh ... he reads poetry
out loud, alright? ... And a voice! A voice. ... He likes you
because you're still alive. He's got plans for you. Nah, nah, I'm
not going to help you, you're going to help him, man. You're going
to help him. I mean, what are they going to say, man, when he's no
longer hiding film cans, huh? Because he fades, when it fades, man,
when it fades, he fades. What are they going to say about him?
What, are they going to say, he was a kind man, he was a wise man,
he had plans, he had wisdom? Bullcrap, man! Am I going to be the
one, that's going to set them straight? Look at me: wrong!
...You!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Seriously. I just want to talk to the guy.
Nothing more.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joe Merchant:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Do you know what the man is saying? Do
you? This is dialectics. It's very simple dialectics. One through
nine, no maybes, no supposes, no fractions -- you can't travel in
space, you can't go out into space, you know, without, like, you
know, with fractions -- what are you going to land on, one quarter,
three-eighths -- what are you going to do when you go from here to
Venus or something -- that's dialectic physics, OK? Dialectic logic
is there's only love and hate, you either love somebody or you hate
them. This is the way the caching world ends! Look at this mess
we're in, man! Not with a bang, with a whimper. And with a whimper,
I'm splitting, jack!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; That was the last I saw of Joe Merchant. As he
wandered off into the jungle, the children followed, leaving me
alone, once again, with just the jungle to keep me company. The
smell of soggy logs and rusty hide-a-keys permeates the air like
flies over a bloated corpse. How the hell am I supposed to find my
way out of here? Or a better question; Do I want to find my way out
of here? Out there is the world of NEFGA and the Hedgemony. Those
bastards who sent me out here. In here, in the jungle, there's just
me...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this ammo can...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is the end&lt;br/&gt;
Beautiful friend&lt;br/&gt;
This is the end&lt;br/&gt;
My only friend, the end&lt;br/&gt;
It hurts to set you free&lt;br/&gt;
But you'll never follow me&lt;br/&gt;
The end of laughter and soft lies&lt;br/&gt;
The end of nights we tried to die&lt;br/&gt;
This is the end.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Juniper Springs Recreational Area is about 30 miles east of
Ocala. The will be the beginning of your adventure. Short of
bushwacking through miles of dense forest, the only approach to
this one is by canoe or 'yak. Canoes and shuttle service can be
arranged at the park. There is also camping and a large
recreational area at the head of the springs, where you can swim in
the crystal clear spring waters. 
&lt;p&gt;The park calls this a 4 hour trip, it took the dog 5, but dogs
don't hurry. Bring a lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spring run starts shallow ( several inches), lots of twists
and turns. Awesome cypress and hardwood forest and grassy praries.
Saw 2 dear on the trip and a black bear the night before. Lots of
birds and other wildlife. The dog likes it wild. The cashe is
located on the left bank of the creek near the confluence of
another smaller spring run. (You will see many of these smaller
springs flowing in along the way) There is a landing area here. The
cashe is located on the right bank of this smaller spring run. It
is at the base of a large tree covered with a palm leaf, right next
small creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: The left and right bank are not determined just by
standing there and seeing is which is right and left. It is based
on the flow of water which is the right and left. What'd you think
I was gonna do, give this to you on a silver dog-dish?? Now do your
homework and dig it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is an ammo box filled with the same old $1 store crap and
bad cd's I burn.&lt;/p&gt;

Set up my reverse re-haul so my vehicle would be waiting for me at the take out and set off.  Being a weekday I only saw one group of two people on the run today.  It has been many years since I paddled this section.  It is one of my favorite places to paddle in Florida.  I went a little ways past the cache before backtracking and bushwhacking.  It was nice to finally get this one.  Thanks.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This cache has been one our Geocaching Bucket List for quite some time now but it was always a question of “Are we ready for a technical paddle like this?”  Well, regardless of whether we were ready or not, today was the day, thanks to the run/event planned by Yuzawa Kat and Burgi Dad. [:D]

What a beautiful place!  The spring water itself was crystal clear and the scenery was just breathtaking, with some occasional wildlife sightings, which included a multitude of fish, a raccoon and some baby alligators. Upon arriving near Ground Zero, Infinite MPG did the honors and located the cache.  We all signed the log and continued on to our next destination, which was lunchtime at the event sight.  

This was a very challenging paddle for us as it was the first time we paddled in these type of rapidly moving downstream currents, with so many natural obstacles along the way.   However, that’s what makes finding this cache, along with the other one hidden along the run, all the more exciting.  Despite coming face-to-face (neck-to-neck? Shoulder-to-shoulder? etc. etc.)  with some overhanging trees and protruding  logs, we couldn’t help but appreciate the surrounding natural beauty.

For more of our thoughts on this run, check out our logs for   GC1XDTX   and GC982E,which we also “found” today.

So glad it has been up and running for so long…a highly recommended M&amp;M favorite!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;After returning from my mission to sanction
Colonel Scott S. Shimski, I thought the NEFGA Hegemony would let me
fade into obscurity. You know what they say about hope springing
eternal? Yeah, Right. I hid out in an obscure dive in Palatka,
under a sock puppet account, yet still, they found me... They
always do.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ICM:&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Riffster, NEFGA needs
your rather unique skills once again. It seems that one member of
the boat crew that took you up river has fallen under the spell of
the Jungle. Our informants tell us that Paint Fiction returned up
river after he dropped you off in Astor. Intelligence indicates
that he is caching under the radar, placing 'questionable' hides in
population dense areas. There are even indications that he is
hiding ...micros, though we haven't confirmed this yet. Out there
with those muggles it must be tempting to be God. 'Cause there's a
conflict in every human heart between the rational, the irrational,
between good and evil. And good does not always triumph. Sometimes
the dark side overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of
our nature. Every man has got a breaking point. You and I have.
Paint Fiction has reached his. And very obviously, he has gone
insane&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Forgive me if I sound obstinate Sir, but
what exactly is wrong with that? NEFGA can't control the whole
world, you know.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ICM:&lt;/b&gt; &quot;D@mmit Son, they ain't
ammo cans! For God's sake, man, get a grip on yourself! Once an
area gets infected by the disease of tolerance there's no telling
how deprived caching will get! We can't allow our high NEFGA
standards to be compromised by some long haired hippy loving Jesus
freak! You've got to stop him, and stop him fast! Show no mercy,
for he will show you none if you are caught.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;So, what is my objective, Sir?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ICM:&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Proceed upriver 4.2
klicks to these coordinates. You'll find a film canister that Paint
Fiction hid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;A film canister, Sir? In the woods? Are you
certain?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ICM:&lt;/b&gt; &quot;I told you son. He's
fallen, and he wants to take NEFGA down with him. He's out there
operating without any decent restraint. Totally beyond the pale of
any acceptable cacher conduct. You understand Riffster... , that
this operation does not exist, nor will it ever exist.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Once you find the film canister,
Terminate it with extreme prejudice. Replace it with this ammo can.
NEFGA's got an agent inside the GC Continuum. You've met. Once we
get confirmation on the switch, our agent will archive that
shameful micro and publish your cache. We're hoping that having the
rug yanked out from under him will wake him up. If that fails, we
may have to take more decisive action against him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;God bless you, son. America is
counting on you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;Ol' Fat Guy to Dairy King... Ol' Fatguy to
Dairy King... The deed is done, Sir.... Repeat, the deed is
done....&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 
&lt;p&gt;&quot;NEFGA calls me a hero. Why don't I feel like a hero? Paint
fought his way up this d@mn river, hiding what he believed to be a
legitimate cache, but his vision didn't sinc with those white robe
b@st@rds sense of aesthetics. Now his cache is dead. Just so much
perforated plastic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As I sit here, covered in mud, skeeters ticks, chiggers and
shredded micro log bits, I must question my own sanity. NEFGA
dictates what is acceptable in this God forsaken swamp. They set
the standards. We're supposed to follow blindly, like so many d@mn
lemmings. Hopefully, this narration will never be read by the
Hegemony. If it ever becomes public, my own cache stats may be
forfeit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;One day, when the Hegemony falls, I will be able to come out of
the closet and admit to liking caches of every size. Until that day
comes, I must remain hidden, deep in the bowels of NEFGA territory,
terminating film canisters, Altoids tins and Hide-a-Keys, having my
strings pulled by the white robed puppet masters who run this
insane orginization...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Till the end!!!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit to add: FTF prize is a silver Franklin half dollar. There's
an envelope for Turtletoes. Please leave that for her. Good
luck!&lt;/p&gt;

Batteries inside the millhouse were used to store electricity generated by the water wheel.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you visit the millhouse, you can learn of the legend that brought the C.C.C. to this spring, as well as learning gobs of stuff about the spring itself and the run.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This park boasts the only sub-tropical enviroment in the Continental U.S. You will realize what this means as you tour the park. There is an entry fee so this is not a grab and go cache. There are many things to do here to include swimming in the natural spring,nature trails,picnicing and canoeing. For the truly adventurous this is the entry point for the Geocache Da Dog Yaks.

&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Scully, do you believe in Geocaching? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Geocaching? Isn’t that one of those mythical hippy geek cults? Something about a guy from Seattle who stuck an antenna in a frog? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: It’s much more than a cult, Scully. They believe that there are fantastic treasures to be found by entering numeric data into small, hand-held devices, then following a little spinning arrow on the face of the device. The treasures are hidden in what they call “caches”. That in itself is sufficient for speculation, but what really raises eyebrows is the fact that the whole process exists in-house, so to speak. The treasures which they hunt were all hidden by other cult members, in what some scientists have labeled “A giant game of hide &amp; seek”. They communicate their efforts secretly over the internet, using cryptic glyphs which the NSA still has not cracked, and they can only be identified by their code names. Messages such as TFTH, TNLNSL, and FTF can convey volumes of data to the initiates. Scully, this is no crackpot, hodgepodge assembly of computer gaming nerds. During a raid on what was supposed to be the cult’s headquarters, documents were found indicating membership in the hundreds of thousands.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: That’s great, Mulder, but what does that have to do with us? As I recall, the whole Geocaching phenomenon was determined by the CIA to be a hoax, perpetrated by a handful of bored college students. There is not one shred of physical evidence that the cult even exists.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Scully, by now you should know better than to trust anything the government tells you. The CIA called it a hoax because it was in their best interest to do so. Fortunately, not everyone is as naive as you. To this day, there are thousands of otherwise normal people, scouring their local forests for these “caches”. Recently, several people have reported unusual sights and experiences while hunting for caches hidden in the Juniper Springs region of the Ocala National Forest. There have even been reported disappearances, which the local law enforcement agencies are helpless to stop. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: So, you want to rush down to Florida, on company time, just so you can satisfy your overzealous imagination? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: I’m disappointed, Scully. Here’s a perfect opportunity for you to prove me wrong, and you hesitate. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(Mulder hands Scully a bundle of documents)&lt;/i&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: What is this supposed to be? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Some friends of mine believe they have determined a means of finally proving this cult existed. These documents are reputed to be “Cache Printouts”, which the initiates use to determine the locations of the caches they were looking for. As you will notice, all of these caches are in the same general area as the strange activity. That can’t be a coincidence, Scully. There’s got to be a connection. Are you willing to find the truth? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: I’ll go with you, but I have to tell you, I’m far more interested in finding the people who have been reported missing, if for no other reason, then to demonstrate that getting lost in the woods is statistically a result of too much beer drinking, combined with inadequate 4-wheel drive vehicles, and not due to the intervention of black helicopters or UFO’s.. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Great! We leave at dawn. I’ve taken the liberty of hiring a guide. He’s a fairly harmless crackpot by the name of Clan Riffster. He’s one of those who believes in the myth, and often spends his time hunting Tupperware in the woods. We’ll start with this cache, “Barking Moonbat”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Mulder, it’s hot, it’s muggy and the mosquitoes are as large as sparrows. When are you going to realize this whole geocaching myth is a hoax? How many trails are you planning on dragging us down, anyway? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Relax, Scully. It’s not like you had a hot date. The wind is blowing gently through the pines, the birds are singing, what more could you ask for? Besides, Riffster assures me we’re getting close, right, Riffster? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;RIFFSTER&lt;/b&gt;: Huh? What? Were y’all talkin’ to me? Sorry, I was listenin’ to this here Hank Williams Jr tape. “Whiskey Bent &amp; Hell Bound”. Ever heard of it? Naw, never mind. You look like one o’ them sissy boys what listens to Yanni. You was askin’ about that there geocache. It’s gotta be here ‘bouts somewhere. Keep lookin’! 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Riffster, be honest. You don’t really believe in geocaching, do you? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;RIFFSTER&lt;/b&gt;: Uh, yes Ma’am! I know it fer a fact! I seen one when I was knee high to a grasshopper. It was on the back side of Signal Mountain, where I done growed up. I was creepin’ through the woods, tryin’ to poach me a deer for dinner, and there it was, plain as day. A Tupperware container full of broken McToys, bottle tops and used Lotto tickets. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: What makes you think it wasn’t just a plastic box full of junk? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;RIFFSTER&lt;/b&gt;: Uh, no Ma’am! It was real! It said so right on the lid, plain as day! “G, E, O, K, A, S, H”. Besides, it had one o’ them stash notes inside. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: What did the note say? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;RIFFSTER&lt;/b&gt;: Uh, I’m not for sure. I don’t read none to good. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(Mulder pokes around with a stick)&lt;/i&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Found it! Look Scully! Didn’t I tell you? This proves the whole geocaching myth is real! 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: No, Mulder. It only proves you found a metal box in the woods. Wait! What are you doing opening it? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: We need to sign the logbook and trade swag. You’re the forensics specialist here, Scully. Help me sort through this stuff. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Mulder, do you have any idea what kind of microbes can live in that environment? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Relax, Scully. Have a McToy. Let’s go find the next one. I believe “Bear Attack” is closest, right Riffster? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;RIFFSTER&lt;/b&gt;: Huh? What? Oh, uh… Yeah. I reckon.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: What’s the matter, Scully? Afraid your sensible Catholic upbringing might be diminished by a simple search for the truth? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Mulder, we’ve been chasing shadows for hours now. Logic dictates that we resign this obsession of yours and get back to doing the job that the F.B.I. pays us for. Obviously that box you found was just a coincidence. We’ve got real cases waiting for us back at Quantico. There is nothing here. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: If that’s true, then why has that black Suburban been following us around all morning? Don’t you find that just a bit suspicious? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Mulder, these woods are used by outdoorsmen every day. Those guys are probably hunters. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Wrong, Scully. &lt;i&gt;(Mulder passes Scully a spotting scope)&lt;/i&gt; Look at the tires. They look like Goodyear XL Strikeforce radials. Those tires were developed for the NSA back in ’04, and were never released to the public. Look at the suspension. Anyone can tell it’s been beefed up, probably to support the additional weight of armor plating. Do you see the way the light prisms off the windshield? Bullet proof glass does that. And if that’s not enough to convince you of their nefarious purpose, how do you explain the dark window tint? That degree of reflectivity is illegal in Florida, unless you are in a government vehicle. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: If they were sent to interfere with our objective, why are they just sitting there? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: They’re watching us to see how much we know, and what we discover. Mark my words, Scully, we haven’t seen the last of those guys. What do you think, Riffster? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;RIFFSTER&lt;/b&gt;: That there is sure one purdy truck all right. Not near as purdy as you are, Ma’am. No offense. But you ain’t gotta go getting’ outta sorts. I mean, it’s just a Chevy. If’n it was one o’ them Jeeps, I’d be worried. Say, did you bring any beer? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Your inebriation will have to wait. We’re on a mission here. Where’s that damn cache? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Mulder, we’ve been wandering around in circles for the last hour. We’ve checked under every rock, every leaf. There is not a square inch of this area we haven’t checked. If there was anything even remotely larger than a pinhead here, we would’ve found it by now. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: You may be right, Scully. This one may have been “muggled”. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Muggled? What does that mean? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Riffster’s been teaching me some of the geocaching vernacular. A “Muggle” is a person who doesn’t believe in geocaching. Someone like you, Scully. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Great. Another label, invented to foster an exclusionary atmosphere. So tell me Mulder. Are you finally convinced that geocaching is a myth? You’ve got the cache page print out in your hands. You can see we are at the right coordinates. Obviously there is no cache here, which puts a significant dent in your geocaching hypothesis. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Relax, Scully. You’re wound way too tight. The lack of a cache at these coordinates does not disprove the truth. Your “hunters” have followed us here. That in itself is significant. Let’s not give up now, when we have another cache we can search for. The truth is out there, Scully. Riffster, what do you think? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;RIFFSTER&lt;/b&gt;: Yup! It’s a DNF for shore. Dag nab it! 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: DNF…. What does that mean? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: DNF is an acronym, Scully. It means “Did Not Find”. Since we “Did Not Find” this cache, we call it a DNF. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: We? Are you seriously contemplating joining this bunch of belly button lint collecting yahoos, who tromp through insect and snake infested woods in search of some ridiculous fantasy? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Careful, Scully. You might start enjoying yourself. Right, Riffster? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;RIFFSTER&lt;/b&gt;: Huh? What? Oh, uh….. Yeah. I mean, yes Ma’am. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Why don’t we call it quits for now, and go find “SoulBait Springs“? I think it’s the next closest.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Looks like we’ll need to bushwhack from here, Scully. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Bushwhack? You want me to walk through that? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Relax, Scully. It’s only 600’ or so through a swamp. It won’t kill you. Just follow Riffster. He cuts a pretty wide swath. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Don’t you mean he has all the grace of a herd of rampaging bull elephants? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Something like that. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;RIFFSTER&lt;/b&gt;: Here it is! Whoo Hoo!!! Yee Haw!!! I found me one! Hot Dog! 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Scully, that’s two out of three we’ve found. Still think it’s a myth? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Mulder, you’re quickly losing your objectivity. These woods have been used by yokels to dump trash for decades. I have no doubt that we could hike anywhere out here and find various types of containers, even ammo boxes. Just ask your nose picking “guide”. And while your at it, can you tell him to stop drooling while he’s looking at me? He makes me feel like a Thanksgiving turkey. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Look Scully, just because he’s hygienically challenged, and has the IQ of a bag of hammers, doesn’t mean he’s not right about this. Don’t judge him by your urban standards. Sigmund Freud once said that people with an IQ gap of more than 40 points cannot communicate with each other. You just need to lower yourself to his level. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: How’s this, Mulder; “Hey, Paw! You got’s any chawin’ toe-back-kee?” 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Sarcasm does not become you, Scully. Let’s press on to “Apocalypse, When”. It’s just a little ways upstream. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;RIFFSTER&lt;/b&gt;: Is it time for beer yet?

May 11th, 2009, 1202 hours&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: There’s nothing here. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Mulder, we’ve only searched for 30 minutes or so. Why are you so eager to give up on this one? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: This one’s been disabled, Scully.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Disabled? What is that supposed to mean? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Remember “Muggled”? If a cache owner confirms that a cache has been muggled, he can “Disable” it, which officially tells the rest of the initiates that it’s not there. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Let me get this straight. You knew there was nothing here before we bushwhacked all the way out here and spent half an hour checking every palmetto and burnt tree trunk, fighting off mosquitoes, horseflies, deer flees, and God only knows what other parasites? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Relax, Scully. It’s the hunt that counts. Look at it this way, Scully. We’ve had a 50% confirmed success rate. That’s a whole order of magnitude greater than our hunt for Bigfoot. That’s two out of four that were right where the so called fictional cache pages said they’d be. 50% is far more than coincidence, Scully. Can’t you even admit to the possibility that geocaching might be completely legitimate, and the only reason the general population isn’t aware of it is because our Government is obfuscating the reality? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Sure, Mulder. If you say so. Look! Here’s another “cache”. And another, and another, and another. These woods are practically bristling with geocaches. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Those are crumpled beer cans, Scully. There’s a difference. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: What difference, Mulder? You have a scrap of paper that claims we’ll find some kind of container at a given set of coordinates. I’m simply pointing out the fact that you could change those coordinates to anything you like, and still find something there. I think you’re confusing government conspiracies with littering. After four so called “hunts”, you haven’t shown me a single shred of physical evidence to support the geocaching phenomenon. Riffster has fed you a steady diet of smoke and mirrors, and you lap it up, salivating like Pavlov’s dogs at the mere hint of a hidden box in the woods. Proof. That’s all I ask. Is that too much? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: I suggest we head to the next cache on our list, “Paint Fiction’s Apocalypse”. Maybe that’ll convince you. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: I’ll humor you for now, Mulder, but I’m growing weary of chasing shadows. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;RIFFSTER&lt;/b&gt;: Ma’am, this ain’t no myth. I swear upon my Paw Paw’s grave it’s for real. You just gotta believe! 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Thank you for your unasked for opinion, Riffster. Now get your hand off my shoulder before you draw back a nub. You haven’t bathed in days, and you are dripping grease and BBQ sauce. This is a $400 Armani jacket you just stained. And for the love of God, can you please stop picking your nose around me? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;RIFFSTER&lt;/b&gt;: Yes, Ma’am. Sorry, Ma’am. Please don’t kill me lady. My young’uns wouldn’t cotton to me comin’ home dead. I won’t be touchin’ you no more. Shake? (extends hand) 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Oh, the irony. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Scully, quit picking on the boy. You can’t have a battle of wits with someone who’s unarmed, right, Riffster? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;RIFFSTER&lt;/b&gt;: I ain’t got no gun! 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: See what I mean, Scully? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: (Sigh) 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Your “hunters” are back, right on queue. We need to lose them before we start our search. Let’s go!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

May 11th, 2009, 1511 hours&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Stay down! 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: My God, Mulder! What is that? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: In 1947, a great deal of unusual debris was recovered from a ranch near Roswell New Mexico. The Roswell Army Air Field issued a press release stating that a “flying disk” had been discovered. Within hours, a retraction was issued by the Pentagon, claiming instead that is was just a weather balloon. In 1978, Jesse Marcel, one of the people involved in the original debris recovery, expressed his belief that there had been a cover-up of the recovery of an alien craft. Additional witnesses and reports emerged over the following years. They added significant new details, including accounts of a large military operation to recover alien craft and aliens themselves, as many as 11 crash sites, and intimidation of witnesses. In 1989, former mortician Glenn Dennis revealed a detailed account which included alien autopsies carried out at the Roswell base. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In response to these reports, the Secretary of the Air Force released two reports. The first one, released in 1995, concluded that the material reported recovered in 1947 was likely debris from a secret government program called Project Mogul. The second report, released in 1997, addressed the reports of aliens and concluded these reports were likely transformed memories of the recovery of anthropomorphic dummies in programs like Project High Dive, conducted in the 1950s. The psychological effects of time compression and memory contamination explained the discrepancy with the years in question. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
These UFO remains were eventually brought to the Air Force Flight Test Center, Detachment 3, at Groom Lake, an ultra secret military testing site known locally as Area 51.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: OK, Mulder. Even if all that hyperbole was real, those sites are in New Mexico and Nevada. What does that have to do with anything in Florida? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Do you think New Mexico holds patents on UFO crashes? They have happened here, as well. Scully, did you happen to notice that the most prominent structure utilized on the private property surrounding the Ocala National Forest are mobile homes? Studies at Stetson University have shown a direct link between mobile homes and UFO sightings. Some speculate that there is some unknown factor in the unique composition of mobile homes which actually attract UFO’s. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In 1963, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office responded to this location to investigate a reported UFO crash. The initial deputies on scene confirmed over their radios that it was, in fact, a vehicle from outer space. The Air Force sent in troops, and those deputies were removed from duty, never to be heard from again. 12 hours later, this entire area was cordoned off. The Air Force claimed it was a small personal airplane that crashed. Do you think a trained deputy sheriff could mistake a Cessna for a UFO? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now, the Forestry Service claims this is a protected wetland, using endangered plant species as an excuse to keep people out. Look at those formations, Scully. Does that look like an endangered wetland to you? Obviously, the government intends on keeping this area secret, and since geocachers know about it, their entire existence must be made questionable. It’s apparent that whoever hid these caches out here has had enough of the cover up, and has decided to use geocaching as a medium to spread the truth. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;RIFFSTER&lt;/b&gt;: I’m Skeered! I wanna go home! I don’t wanna play no more! 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY/MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: Shut up, Riffster! 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Sorry….. Mulder, this is amazing. We need to make this public. We should take lots of pictures, interview the locals, bring in the media…. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MULDER&lt;/b&gt;: You would be silenced, Scully. Hear that “Whop Whop” sound? That’s not a bunch of natives opening tubes of Pillsbury biscuits. That’s a Blackhawk helicopter. It’s coming our way. We need to get out of here, fast.

&lt;b&gt;F.B.I. DIRECTOR JOE SMITH&lt;/b&gt;: Ladies and gentlemen of the press. It is with much regret, that I must announce the loss of two field agents. Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully were on vacation, camping in the Ocala National Forest in Florida. It appears they became disoriented, and got lost. Without food, water or shelter, they succumbed to the elements, and perished. Funeral services will be tomorrow at 8:00, at Arlington National Cemetery. These will be closed casket affairs at the request of their families. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
On a side note, the F.B.I. is currently seeking a Florida resident by the name of Riffster, who may have had contact with agents Mulder and Scully prior to their deaths. He is reportedly described as an ol’ fat crippled guy, with thinning hair, wearing a smelly hat, driving a green Toyota 4x4. He can often be seen wandering around in the woods with a handheld GPSr, muttering “Found It!”, over and over.

&lt;b&gt;SCULLY&lt;/b&gt;: Relax, Mulder. Shouting won’t get us out of here. Our only hope lies in the fact that they haven’t captured Riffster yet. If he can expose those caches we found, maybe he can generate enough publicity, and they’ll have no choice but to let us go.

&lt;b&gt;President Obama&lt;/b&gt;: My fellow Americans, I’d like to take this time to apprise you of some recent, startling developments. As you know, our great country abounds with myths and legends which have passed from one generation to the next. One of those myths, called “Geocaching”, has just been confirmed by the NSA as a real hobby. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The story came to light when one of the players of the game, known locally as “Clan Riffster” contacted the New York Times with photo documentation of one particular set of geocaches along a creek in the Ocala National Forest, in Florida. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My security specialists have analyzed his photos and they’ve determined that they are not fakes. This leaves us with little choice but to accept the existence of this hobby. Folks, this hobby is as real as Rosie O’Donnell’s waist line. Mark my words ladies and gentlemen, we haven’t seen the last of this game. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now I’d like to introduce FBI Director Joe Smith, who has some related news.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;FBI Director Joe Smith&lt;/b&gt;: Ladies and Gentlemen of the press, it is with a glad heart that I announce our earlier reports regarding the deaths of Agents Scully and Mulder were premature. It appears that they suffered some unknown calamity in the Ocala National Forest, and were found wandering around. Both agents have been diagnosed with amnesia, and have no recollection of their activities since their mysterious disappearance last week. As to whose bodies are buried in their graves, we have no comment. For those of you wondering why there has been a dramatic increase in military troops near Juniper Springs, we have no comment. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Members of the press, the balding obese gentleman to my right is Clan Riffster. He has agreed to answer some questions. Please limit your questions to words of less than four syllables, as he is a dimwit. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Clan Riffster&lt;/b&gt;: Howdy Y’all! How you doin’? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Press dweeb&lt;/b&gt;: Mr Riffster, you’ve cracked open one of the oldest myths of our country’s history. What are your plans now? 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Clan Riffster&lt;/b&gt;: I’m goin’ to Disney World! Whoo Hoo!!! 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Barking Moonbat&quot;.... I love that phrase. It's just so much fun
to say. It just rolls off the tounge...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was long believed that the term &quot;Barking Moonbat&quot; was a
derogatory phrase used by one political party to describe the
other. Thanks to the valiant efforts of Serial Finder and Joe
Merchant, the truth can finally be revealed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Barking Moonbat&quot; is actually a term utilized by the NSA and
their CIA cronies, to label a space alien who has taken human form.
The long term goal of the space aliens is, of course, boron
harvesting from the posteriors of Peep eating humans. To accomplish
this goal, it is imperative that our nation, as a whole, lose its
collective will, and be unable to resist the space alien's efforts
in a unified fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward that end, the aliens kidnapped certain key influential
figures, then zapped them into oblivion, replacing them with one of
their own, which had been bio-genetically altered to resemble the
person they replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid any potentially embarrassing socio-political faux pax,
the space aliens specifically targeted those subjects who were
known for somewhat kooky behavior in the past, in the hopes that
any unusual statements or activity would be largely ignored by the
masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve their goal of human pacification, the space aliens
directed the Barking Moonbats to promote laws and ordinances across
the country, geared toward eliminating our willpower, effectively
nullifying us as a threat. The NFL's &quot;No Taunting&quot; rule,
Presidential term limits and ordinances requiring you to mow your
lawn all directly stem from Barking Moonbats political influence.
Fear not though. These replicants can be detected, if you apply
vigilance to the task. If you believe you have detected a
replicant, confront them in a public place, and yell, &quot;You
Sir/Madam, are a Barking Moonbat&quot;, repeatedly, as loud as you can.
Doing this while media cameras are running can help ensure your
success. Once outed, the space alien Hive Queen will remove the
replicant from service, to avoid further revelation of their
nefarious plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the Barking Moonbat test, and see if you can spot the space
aliens amongst us:&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;“Astor…. I'm still only in
Astor. Every time I think I'm going to wake up back in the jungle.
When I was home after my first tour, it was worse. I'd wake up and
there'd be nothing... I hardly said a word to my wife until I said
yes to a divorce. When I was here I wanted to be there. When I was
there, all I could think of was getting back into the jungle. I've
been here a week now. Waiting for a mission, getting softer. Every
minute I stay in this room I get weaker. Each time I look around
the walls move in a little tighter. Be careful what you wish for. I
wanted a mission, and for my sins NEFGA gave me one. Brought it up
to me like room service. It was a real choice mission, and when it
was over, I'd never want another.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I was going to the worst place in the world, and I
didn't even know it yet. Weeks away and hundreds of miles up a
river, that snaked through the woods like a main circuit cable and
plugged straight into Shimski. It was no accident that I got to be
the caretaker of Promotion’s Director Scott S.
Shimski’s memory, any more than being back in Astor was an
accident. There is no way to tell his story without telling my own.
And if his story is really a confession, then so is
mine.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shimski:&lt;/b&gt; (on tape) &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;“I watched an ammo can
crawl along the edge of a guardrail. That's my dream. That's my
nightmare. Crawling, slithering, along the edge of a guardrail, and
surviving. We must find them. We must log them. Film canister after
film canister, hide-a-key after hide-a-key, Altoids tin after
Altoids tin, M&amp;M tube after M&amp;M tube. And they call me a
numbers ho. What do you call it when the White Robes accuse the
numbers ho’s? They lie.. They lie and we have to be merciful
to those who lie. Those nabobs. I hate them. How I hate
them...&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Riffster:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;“How many numbers ho’s had I
already sanctioned? There was those six that I know about for sure.
Close enough to blow their last breath in my face. But this time it
was a NEFGA’n and an officer. That wasn't supposed to make
any difference to me, but it did. Carp...charging a man with being
a numbers ho in this place was like handing out speeding tickets in
the Indy 500. I took the mission. What the heck else was I gonna
do? But I didn't know what I'd do when I found him.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;I was being ferried up Mormon Creek in a Navy PBR, a type of
plastic patrol boat, pretty common sight on the rivers. They said
it was a good way to pick up information without drawing lot of
attention. That was OK, I needed the air and the time. Only problem
was I wouldn't be alone.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“The crew was mostly just kids, rock and rollers with
one foot in their graves&quot; The machinist, the one they called
PaintFiction, was from New Orleans. He was wrapped too tight for
Ocala, probably wrapped too tight for New Orleans. SoulBait on the
forward 50's was a famous surfer from the beaches south of LA. You
look at him and you wouldn't believe he ever fired a weapon in his
whole life. Loopy was from some South Bronx carphole. Light and
space of Ocala really put the zap on her head. Then there was
Federation, the Chief. It might have been my mission, but it sure
as heck was Chief's boat.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“At first, I thought they handed me the wrong dossier.
I couldn't believe they wanted this man terminated. Third
generation Palatka High School, top of his class. About a thousand
decorations. Etc, etc... I'd heard his voice on the tape and it
really put a hook in me. But I couldn't connect up that voice with
this man. Like they said, he had an impressive career. Maybe too
impressive... I mean perfect. He was being groomed for one of the
top slots of NEFGA. President, V.P., anything... In 2002 he
returned from a tour of advisory command in Ocala and things
started to slip. The report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and George
Bush was restricted. Seems they didn't dig what he had to tell
them. During the next few months he made three requests for
transfer to Urban Micro training in Jacksonville, Florida. And he
was finally accepted. Urban Micro? He was 28 years old. Why the
heck would he do that? 2003 he joined the Special forces, returns
to Ocala. It wasn't just insanity and numbers runs. There was
enough of that to go around for everyone.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Shimski split from the whole friggin’ program.
How did that happen? What did he see here that first tour? 28 years
old. If he joined the Urban Micros, there was no way he'd ever get
above Promotions Director. Shimski knew what he was giving up. The
more I read and began to understand, the more I admired him. His
family and friends couldn't understand it, and they couldn't talk
him out of it. He had to apply three times and he had to put up
with a ton of carp, but when he threatened to resign, they gave it
to him. The next youngest guy in his class was half his age. They
must have thought he was some far-out old man humping it over that
course.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“October 2004 on special assignment, Lake George
province. Shimski staged operation Film Canister with combined
local forces. Raided a major success. He received no official
clearance. He just thought it up and did it. What guts. They were
gonna nail his butt to the floorboards for that, but after the
press got hold of it they promoted him to Promotions Director
instead. Oh man, the bull piled up so fast in Ocala, you needed
wings to stay above it. No wonder Shimski put a weed up command's
butt. The assimilation was being run by a bunch of four-star clowns
who were going to end up giving the whole circus away.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Late summer-autumn 2005: Shimski's cache hunts in the
highlands come under frequent muggle ambush. The camp started
falling apart...November: Shimski orders the assimilation of three
Ocala men and one woman. Two of the men were Land Managers in the
Forestry Division. Cache disappearance activity in his old sector
dropped off to nothing. Guess he must have hit the right four
people. NEFGA tried one last time to bring him back into the fold.
And if he pulled over, it all would have been forgotten. But he
kept going, and he kept winning it his way, and they called me in.
They lost him. He was gone. Nothing but rumors and rambling
intelligence, mostly from captured muggles. The muggles knew his
name by now, and they were scared of him. He and his men were
playing hit and run all the way into Lake Delancy.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“State Rd 19 bridge was the last NEFGA outpost on
Mormon Creek. Beyond that there was only Shimski. He was close. He
was real close. I could not see him yet but I could feel him.&quot; Part
of me was afraid of what I would find and what I would do when I
got there. I knew the risks, or imagined I knew. But the thing I
felt the most, much stronger than fear, was the desire to confront
him.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everything I saw told me that Shimski has gone insane. The
place was full of micros: Film canisters, Altoids tins,
Hide-a-keys, M&amp;M tubes.. If I was still alive, it was because
he wanted me that way. It smelled like slow death in there, peanut
butter, nightmares. This was the end of the river all right. On the
river, I thought that the minute I looked at him, I'd know what to
do, but it didn't happen. I was in there with him for days, not
under guard - I was free - but he knew I wasn't going anywhere. He
knew more about what I was going to do than I did. If the
Illustrious Potentates back in NEFGA could see what I saw, would
they still want me to terminate him? More than ever, probably. And
what would his people back home want if they ever learned just how
far from them he'd really gone? He broke from them and then he
broke from himself. I'd never seen a man so broken up and ripped
apart...&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“They were going to make me a voting member for this
and I wasn't even in their friggin’ GC forums any more.
Everybody wanted me to do it, him most of all. I felt like he was
up there, waiting for me to take the pain away. He just wanted to
go out like a NEFGA’n, standing up, not like some poor,
wasted, rag-arsed renegade. Even the jungle wanted him dead, and
that's who he really took his orders from anyway. &quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“The horror. The horror...&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK14VWH - Suggested parking

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I hope this will be my last log in this saga of Shimski. I picked up this strange man in Salt Springs he would only identify himself as Riffster but I knew what he was there for, we all knew. He had a sanction to carry out a Holy Mission some of us thought. So we took him up Mormon Branch to the Hwy 19 bridge which was far as my boat would go and we let him out. He asked us to continue on with him but we don't leave the boat, we never leave the boat, there are dangers untold out there, Shimski is out there. It has been 12 days and no sign of Riffster I must make a choice soon what to do, &quot;never leave the boat&quot; Soulbait and Paintfiction said we never leave the boat, but where is Riffster and now that reporter has come and gone what was his name yeah Out on Bail. He went in after Riffster to interview the Promotions Director Shimski we warned him not to go. So now he has returned covered with blood and babbling about the heads. Heads everywhere he said. 
So we lay here on the boat knowing I have to make a decision. I know I must but how I can I? My job is to drive the boat but Shimski must be stopped, Riffster made that clear before he left. So we wait to see what happens. When I awoke this morning my decision had been made for me. We know where Riffster is now or leat where his head is. There by the fifties is Riffster’s head with a film container where his tongue should have been, the madness must stop. I tell Paint and Soulbait to saddle up but they are scare we can’t leave the baot Shimski is out there they say. They don’t don’t belong here, none of us belong here but the madness must stop.
So up the river I go with each step the air grows thicker the time cuts through my soul like a knife ever closer to the Promotions Director I can almost feel his breath on my neck asI go ever deeper into the jungle. As I travel I find a burnt out village, Shimski I assume when will the madness end will I have the strength to stop him only time will tell. As turn the next bend I start to see the heads. On stfss, hanging from trees why the heads where will the madness end. Finally I can go no further the heads line both side of the narrow bank so overland I go. Ever deeper and onward more ominous with each passing minute. Finally the heads have cleared and I make my way back to the river and the final position that Riffster reported to us. And there he was. Shimski, The Pormotions Director. His eyes bore into my sould, “ is this what you are seeking he called out to me from the other side of the river”, “ No I screamed not that” He laughingly throws the lock-n-lock container across the river and demands that I open it. There to my horror, was the bloody dog tags of the assassin, Riffster had failed not it was my turn. As I looked up Shimski had crossed the river and was kneeling before me. “do it’” he said “ that’s why you came, that’s why NEFGA sent you, if the could only understand.” As I drew my machete from my pouch he bowed his head as though he were looking for absolution. So I raised my machete and on the downward stroke I hear his final  laugh as I severedhis head. His words still ring in my ears back here in Palatka &quot;there is another, it isn't finished yet.&quot;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">One day Viv &amp; I were travelling through the Ocala National Forest, and we stopped to look at a stream called Mormon Branch, which crosses under Hwy 19 just South of the Juniper Run. We noticed how clear the water was, and figured it must be spring fed. I decided to explore the area, and found several very small boils which feed into the main creek.

The hike in was a fairly intense bushwhack combined with a lot of stream wading. There are absolutely no paths back to the springs. If your idea of Nature is a clump of palmettos in a well manicured, sterile city park, then this cache is not for you.

I've taken the liberty of naming this spring after Soulbait in a fit of revenge over his [url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=d5bcf7e0-5284-4221-b660-1e355b3b584e]Palatka Park Shelter[/url], an incredibly frustrating micro. Jim, this one's for you! It's safe to assume you'll get your feet wet on this hunt. A hiking staff should be mandatory equipment. If you see the bottom of the creek turn from sand to black silt, avoid it. I tried walking across an area like this very near ground zero, and before I could blink, I was sunk up to mid thigh. I probed the muck with my staff, which is about 6' long, and couldn't find the bottom. Be careful!

This particular cache is all about the journey, not the hunt. At ground zero, you'll find a well camo'ed ammo can sitting in plain sight. I figured since the location is so difficult to reach, no one other than geocachers would be crazy enough to go there.

FTF prize is a Pilipinas 2 Piso coin.

Good luck!

Not many people hide caches like this anymore and I felt privelged to be in such great company as my old friend The Boonieman. I can't think of a cahcer I would rather be second to. So this was my second attempt on this one after my first attempt and speaking with the cache owner I realized the erro of my ways on the inital attempt. I took off with Soulbait and entered the creek just off the highway we wade and climbed and bent and stooped and waded some more. Some deep some shallow but close every minute we came till at last we reached the quicksand. Soulbait pushed his 6.5ft hiking stick in till only about 1.5ft was exposed at that point we decided we better hit the woods. We hiked in till we found a small clearing and searched for a short while at ground zero with no luck. On a whim I expanded the search and found Soulbait Springs the caches namesake and there was the cache.
 My hat is off to Clan Riffster not many caches are hid this way anymore great job Sean. Thanks for a fantastic adventure.

Jeeping &amp; hiking in the Ocala National Forest, creating the
&quot;Spiderman Adventure Series&quot;. Surviving the journey to the cache is
half the fun. Unlike most of my hides, this one incorporates no
camo. It's right out in the open. I figure if you make it this far,
you deserve an easy hunt at ground zero. To locate the cache you
must travel upstream from the big hard road. When the stream will
allow you to go no further you will be close. Good luck my friends
and remember beware the spiders.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Allow me to explain...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I left home last night at about 11:00pm, with the intention of scoring a night find on Shimski's [url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=174b215a-4a46-430b-944a-05e157d62af3]A P O C A L Y P S E- E N D[/url] cache. This cache is just outside my PQ zone, so I had to punch in the coords manually before heading out. Simple, huh? HAH!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I got to the parking area at about 1:00am, and fired up my GPSr, noticing something decidedly odd about the map screen. There was a nice neat row of waypoints denoting the other caches along Mormon Creek, and way the heck away from these was Shimski's cache. Now that I'm home, I can see where I fumble fingered the coords. Grrr!!!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
NEFGA has a long standing tradition that when someone meets with a particularly amusing bit of unpleasantness, they hide a cache. Being a well stocked Riffster, I had a couple ammo cans in the back of my truck, ready to go. I set off for what was supposed to be a simple jaunt into the woods, and ended up hoofing 3 miles round trip to find a suitable spot. Your journey should be much shorter.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I've been looking at the ponds in this area on Google Earth, thinking one or more of them might be a spring, but 4:00am is not a good time to investigate geological features. If you want to experience something really kewl, hunt this one at night and shut off all your lights. Listen to the surrounding chorus of frogs, alligators, owls, foxes, deer and other noisy critters.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;If you were a crow, (not of the &quot;T Robot&quot; variety), you could fly exactly 1/2 mile, straight from the posted  parking to the cache. My tracklog showed 1.7 miles round trip, and took me 2.5 hours, which included 4 creek crossings and one quicksand encounter. I reckon I ain't a crow. To reach the posted parking you'll need a 4-wheel drive, as there is a lot of sugar sand and some mud holes to contend with. I'll post an alternate parking area for those driving minivans and such.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Why Black Suburbans? Why indeed...
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
It was long believed that the decision to equip NSA agents, and their CIA cronies, with black Suburbans was nothing more than some administrator's preference. Yeah, that's what [i]they[/i] want you to believe.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The truth might never have come out, save for a chance encounter:
E.G.A.D.S. member Agent StarGazer, (a notorious numbers ho'), recently took a trip to Detroit Michigan to do a cache run. He was sitting in a Starbucks sipping overpriced coffee, when he overheard a conversation between a General Motors executive and an Auto Worker's Union foreman.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The foreman was demanding that GM pay some guy with an 8th grade education, who has been installing lug nuts on cars for the last 20 years, $43.00 an hour. Intrigued, Agent StarGazer focused his considerable attention to the pair, observing that the foreman appeared to be completely serious. Agent StarGazer realized at that moment that the Union foreman must be a Barking Moonbat! http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=6f2ae367-4095-41cc-8ac6-3f591dd3e281
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
He reported his findings to E.G.A.D.S., and found himself nipple deep in a dangerous mission, whose end result was the determination that all of the General Motors Union foremen were, in fact, Barking Moonbats.
 Whoodathunkit?
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
That discovery led Agent StarGazer to dig deeper into the General Motors hierarchy, where he discovered a rather odd history for one of their vehicles. According to Super Double Top Secret in-house memos, the Suburban was developed specifically for an as yet unnamed government agency in 1936. Someone who identified themselves only as &quot;Agent Smith&quot;, (yeah, right), requested a powerful, 4-wheel drive vehicle capable of hauling lots of people and weapon systems. Thus, the Suburban was born. 70 years later, the Suburban remains the vehicle of choice for ultra classified government missions, including protecting the Alien Hive Queen living in the Ocala National Forest.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The name &quot;Suburban&quot; turns out to be proof that the Aliens do have a quirky sense of humor. In their language, the act of probing a human in their, uh, nether regions, is &quot;Soo-Burb 'ahn&quot;. In an attempt to poke fun at the government agents who would be sticking it to the citizens, the Alien Hive Queen selected that word for the newly developed vehicle.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
A bit of trivia regarding the color; It seems the government Suburbans aren't really black at all. They are really a light shade of mauve, (the color of the Hive Queen's home world's sky), but the light bending and dampening fields built into the shells of the Suburbans eliminate all reflected light, making them appear black to our eyes.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
So, the next time you find yourself dashing through 500 acres of sweltering, exhaust laden blacktop in search of a film canister, dodging soccer moms in SUV's, you can thank you government for inventing them.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Good luck!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;As we go about our lives, we meet people from all walks of life, with all sorts of personalities. For the Riffster Clan, that's part of what keeps our short time on this lil' blue marble interesting. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Some folks you meet leave you feeling glad, some leave you feeling sad, while a very rare few leave you feeling blessed. The same is true for the varying locations this game takes us. Some leave you scratching your head, wondering what could possibly be redeeming about ground zero, some spots are absolutely breathtaking, while, (if you share an affinity for natural springs like we do), other locations leave you feeling blessed for having been there.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One of my favorite people, Yuzawa Kat, and the posted coords for this cache, share the latter quality. You will, (certainly), be blessed for having known her, and you will, (hopefully) feel blessed for having visited this spot.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Obviously, the name &quot;Yuzawa Kat Springs&quot; came immediately to mind when I located this offshoot spring which feeds the Juniper Run.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Your best bet, as you paddle down stream, is to park your 'yak near the mouth of Yuzawa Creek coords posted below, and follow the creek back to stage 1. At ground zero, you'll find a 6&quot;x4&quot; white plastic plaque engraved with the final coords, affixed to a downed palm tree. These coords take you to an ammo can nearby. Some items that may prove helpful at Stage 1 are a mirror, a submersable digital camera, a diving mask, or the ability to hold your breath. You won't need to &quot;hunt&quot; for the final, as it is pretty much in plain sight, and it's less than 100' from stage 1. My purpose in bringing you here was to show you the spring, not to make you spend hours grubbing around hunting for a cache.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Don't let the D/T rating scare you. It's just what the calculator spit out, due to your needing some sort of paddle craft to get to it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As this is a kayaking cache, you should expect to get wet... probabluy very wet. ;-) Keeping a change of dry clothes in your boat wouldn't hurt either.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Just sayin'
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Trading your 'yakking sandals for sturdy footwear at the mouth of the creek would probably be a good idea, as there are a few squishy spots along the way. A stout pokey stick would be handy for feeling the bottom as you walk the short distance from the creek mouth to the cache.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As you proceed up Yuzawa Creek, you'll pass CSI Crue Springs at the included waypoint, a smaller offspring boil formed some time after Momma Nature created Yuzawa Kat Springs. Shortly after you hop back in your 'yak, paddling to the take out point, you'll pass JailBird springs on your left, at the included waypoint. If you are into Waymarking, I've listed all three.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
FTF prize is an 1899 silver Canadian dime.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Good luck!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Post script: The most common approach for this cache will be paddling down stream from the Juniper Springs Campground, located on Hgwy 40, a few miles west of Hgwy 19. Entry into the site will cost about $5 a person. Canoe rentals are available, as is a shuttle service. When I make this paddle, I enter the campground, pay the entrance fee, go to the concession stand, pay the shuttle fee of about $6, drop off my boat and drive to the take out point coords. The shuttle picks me up there, bringing me back to my boat. This way, when I finish the 8 mile paddle, and I am sore and smelly, my truck is waiting for me. How you get there is entirely up to you.

Sorry I don't get out much anymore and when I get the opportunity to hide caches like this it really just makes my day. The other day Clan Riffster gave me a really cool ammon can chock full of swag. So I had to hide it in a really nice place to honor him. This is not like the other Ultimate Caches this caches is a little better than 2 miles round trip. No jeep access, so bikes or 4 wheelers either. This is a cache that my old friends RockhopJohn, FlaWolf or The Boonieman would be proud of. You start off in one ecosystem and go through 2 others before arriving at the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note to future cachers please lets keep this in the spirit of the original hide and let's not have 30 micros along the trail. Let's let the beauty of the hike be the prize. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh yeah beware I saw signs of hunters in the area, tree stands, beer cans and shotgun shells so be carful during hunting season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also saw a quite large Black Bear up close and personal about 75 ft was close enough for me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hint will give this one away so only decrypt if you need it.

This one maynot be as easy as it appears or maybe it is. &lt;br/&gt; This cache was hidden using The Federation's new Garmin 60cx. Sateliitle lock is phenomonal and every cache hidden today at at least a 8 ft accuracy so no whingin when you can't find it.&lt;br/&gt;This cache maybe require a bit of a hike depending on how you approach it. There are at least 3 different approaches to the cache on will dbe shorter than the other 2 but not necessarily easier. On may not even be accessible at all during certain times of the year. Anyway you approach I thin you are looking at least a 1/2 mile round trip. Good Luck and enjoy the beaauty of the area. This maybe a nice place to camp if you are through hiking.

That is the large lake you see on the map cache page. Since I keep running into dead ends and not getting any closer left this micro here to mark my passing along the trail Actually I left it for another reason I just wanted to get some of you all and explore the ONF and I was running out of ammo cans. This cache has a significant feature which I am sure you will enjoy on the way out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BEWARE BLACK BEARS HAVE BEEN SPOTTED IN THIS AREA.&lt;br/&gt;I got the privelge of getting up close and personal with one on the way here. As I am coming down the trail a bear is coming up the trail lucky me I am downwind of the bear and see him first, but I would loved to have had a camera. I froze behind a dead tree and the bear walked up to within about 75 feet of me before I got scared and moved. The bear froze, I froze, the bear sniffed the air, I sniffed and smelt something I don't think was the bear. The bear went one way I went the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A question for future cachers: why is it with 1000's of acres in the ONF bears always crap in the middle of the trail? watch your step, you have been warned.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Both Reuters and API reported that, somewhere around the end of
May, 2006, the Geocaching world was infected with a hideous virus.
The ground zero for this infection was reported to be somewhere in
southeast Texas. Details are sketchy, as the New World Order and
their CIA/NSA toadies are attempting to limit the dissemination of
information, in their continuing effort to hide THE TRUTH.
&lt;p&gt;This virus took the form of roughly three hundred cheap, thin,
plastic coffee tubs, containing literally thousands and thousands
of film canisters, which were spewed out into the world, wreaking
havoc on the Purists, whilst giving a feeling of perfect bliss to
the Numbers Ho's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, this virus does not appear to be a natural phenomenon.
Rather, it was allegedly created by an insanely diabolical, (or
would that be diabolically insane?), cacher, who the Government
incidentally still refuses to identify. Rumor has it that, during a
late night session in his Laboratory of Evil, this cacher was
visited by a group of Snoogs, (trans-dimensional beings from the
planet Odious), who spread an insidious tale: According to the
Snoogs, every time a cacher on our plane of existence submits a
lengthy &quot;Found It&quot; log, a log of similar length gets deleted on
their plane of existence. On the planet Odious, Geocaching is far
more than just a recreational activity. In fact, it more closely
resembles a state sanctioned religion, making the loss of logs over
there more of an issue than even the most ardent Human cacher could
possibly imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NEFGA Institute of Science, (Ocala Campus), thinks this may
be due to some quirky aftereffect of trans-dimensional physics, or
possibly something to do with anti-matter, as our planes are
forever linked by a semi stable worm hole. (Officially, the Snoogs
blame this odd effect on their Supreme Deity, The Great Flying
Spaghetti Monster, turning the whole thing into some kind of ugly
religious war. I'll let you decide who to believe.) It is not clear
why this most foul harbinger of caching evil felt so much empathy
for the plight of the Snoogs, but it is reported that he instantly
implemented a terrible plan, (code word &quot;Odious), that he believed
would ultimately lead to the salvation of the Snoogs logs, by
subconsciously causing otherwise innocent cachers to submit six
letter acronyms such as &quot;TNLNSL&quot; as their found it logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.G.A.D.S. members have been working furiously, trying to
establish a definitive link between the Snoogs visit to Texas and
the propagation of film canisters across the globe, however, little
real world data has been discovered. Spokesperson Joe Merchant
reported that, once they positively identify the link, they will
post it here, so the whole world will know THE TRUTH. In a rare
media appearance, Joe stated, &quot;I've got several really nice caches
out there which have been receiving gobs of &quot;TNLNSL&quot; logs. This
virus has got to be stopped, or Geocaching as we know it is
doomed!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent trip to the Osceola National Forest, I came across
one of these O.D.S. caches. I drained off the water inside the
coffee tub and took home a soggy log film canister, which I've
placed in this cache as a log storage device. Since this film
canister has been secured inside a quality container, rather than
being spit out in some banal location, this branch of the virus has
been stopped in its tracks. As such, I've opted to name it &quot;T.D.S.&quot;
(Tedious?), for Two Degrees of Separation&quot;. If you happen across a
seed cache full of woefully inadequate containers, feel free to
follow suit, placing the carpy container inside a good container as
either a log holder or just a souvenir, labeling your new hide
&quot;T.D.S. (insert your caching name)&quot;. Together, we can act as an
antibiotic to this hideous virus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The D/T rating was established by way of our route, paddling
from the privately owned marina at N29* 20.981 / W81* 43.811. There
is a parking fee involved, along with other services which might
help you get to the cache. For info, call them at (352) 685-2255.
An optional launch site would be at Salt Springs State Park, which
is right across the river, but they don't always let folks who are
not camping there use their boat ramp. We landed on the south bank
of the river at N29* 19.293 / W81* 41.397. The total paddling
distance was about 3.5 miles, one way. The current from Salt
Springs is very slow, making the return paddle upstream fairly
pleasant. For the landlubbers out there, you can access this cache
by driving down a few sandy Jeep trails, then making a short hike.
For y'all, I would rate this a fairly easy 2/2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Sean&lt;/p&gt;

Feb 24-26. This cache has been placed in a most pristine area of The Ocala National Forest. Right across the street we had some 40 to 50 cachers come and camp, eat chili, find caches, tell stories and just generally have fun. If you were thanks for making this a most excellent weekend if you missed it we are truly sorry. There were so many cacher/campers who made the journey from all over Florida to be with us that I just can't name them all.&lt;br/&gt;The cache is straightfoprward hidden along a small lake in the palmettos. Have fun and try and join us the next time you see an event sponsored by NEFGA.

So off we ventured to The Ocal National Forest for some much need woods time. Finding a road I had never been down before I found a parking area that said spur trail just what the doctor ordered. The listed coordinates are for the parking area for this cache. Leave on the well marked trail and proceed to the first turn from there you are on your own no more trail it goes back to the road. from here you are open woods caching, not bushwacking since you don't have to tear anything down to get there just no trails to follow. I would suggest you mark your vehicle so you can find your way home. The original contents of the cache are a mix of stuff for young and old nothing spectacular, the trip is the reward. oh yeah parking is located at:&lt;br/&gt;n29 20.842&lt;br/&gt;w081 44.051&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck and Enjoy &lt;br/&gt;The Federation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This cache was placed by a member of the&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Northeast Florida &lt;br/&gt;Geocachers&lt;br/&gt;Association&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 Yes it seems TDJVolks almost slept here but the noise from the 4 wheelers, the flat tire and someone stealing their cb ant. was just too much to overcome. So we hid a cache and off we went in search of bears. And found one just up the road too.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Geocachers are seeking an ammo can in a beautiful area of the Ocala National Forest. Stocked with items to build caches please trade accordingly. 

 While out on the Ultimate Cache adventure with some friends from NEFGA we came upon this beautiful area. I decided it just had to have an ammo can placed here to mark our passing. This cache can be accessed from FR77. FR77 is passable right now with a high clearance vehicle be it a Pick-up, Jeep, or similiar vehicle it is also a nice wide road which can be hiked. Please be forewarned once Hurricane Season arrives this road floods at that point all cache hides will increase by a factor of 2. Also there are holes on this road that will damage or mire your vehicle in water and or mud be forewarned. I highly encourage cachers to not break any applicable trail laws and to have good time with this series of caches. Minor bushwacking maybe needed. After recent burns in this area the vegetation is returning to it's former self. Minor now will be major before long. The hint will narrow this hunt and prohibit vegetation from being unduly damaged. Clean dry clothes, extra boots and socks will be encoraged and waders may be a necessity.

Nothing of great value other than the adventure.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Geocachers are to proceed south on US19 to the Oklawaha River cross the bridge and let the gps take over. You have now entered the Little Lake George Wilderness Area. This is an area that has been totally unexplored by Geocachers previously. So Soulbait and Myself set out on a grand adventure to try and find the river. Well we got as close as we could but the river was not to be found. Yet we discovered a wonderful example of of Old Florida Cypress Hammock. For cachers who are not afraid of a few bugs, snakes, vines and bushwacking then this is the cache for you. Follow the trail at the sign till you decide to do the Hard Way and go through the brush till you reach the cache.&lt;br/&gt;I am sure further exploration of this area is warranted but we didn't have time today. Look for future caches in this area.

 This cache is dedicated to Johnny and Dustin. Outdoor Johnny and Son are 2 fine cachers ion Palatka who have such a great love of nature. It is always a privelge to see Johnny and Dustin and to be able to cache with them. One of my fondest memories of caching with them was a trip we took to the wilds of The JUniper Wilderness. As we were standing in a clearing late that night and we were all staring at the stars I heard Dustin say to his Dad&quot; ...look at all the stars!&quot; I have always remembered that. I have tried to be mindful of when I hide caches that they have some purpose. Johhny and Dustin have recently hid a great set of caches along this seldom used trail. I know as they were hiding their caches they were thinking the same thing I was today. How great it is to be able to share this beautiful area with others. I hope you have fun in this beautiful natural area.

The challenge rests in which side of this trail to take. The coords posted above will place you at a decison point one side of the trail leads to the easy way through the other side leads to broken axles, broken skid plates and a call for a winch or the prefered method of travel. How great. To find this cache you must follow this trail to Rattlesnake Island GCWMWD inside that container you will find the final coords for this cache. You must complete that cache to have earned the right to find this cache merely traversing this trail is not enough you will understand once you have completed the other.Good luck. As usual, dry boots, clothes winches and waders are recommended for this series of caches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: AAWMW7 - Axle Breaker Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

Here is the challenge can you do the same? &lt;br/&gt; Another cache on the Ultimate Caching Series. This cache is easily accesible by walking and can be reteived by most anyone taller than a Hobbit. The challenge to this cache is how close can you drive to it. I drove witin 30 feet without pushing the limits of my jeep too much possibly could have gotten closer with another approach. If you can get closer than my 30 feet post a Pic of your effort in the log and I will allow a second smiley for having very large cajones. If not take your single smiley and be happy. The real challenge lies behind the cache area which is only slightly explored and virgin cache territory. &lt;br/&gt;Good Luck&lt;br/&gt;As usual I will not be responsible for broken or damaged vehicles. Please bring dry boots, winches or waders whichever you prefer.

 This is the first time in 2 years that I have been able to drive this close to this area. The water generally runs 1 to 2 feet deep through here but I found a nice high and dry spot to hide an ammo can. I have placed this can for all my good friends from the NEFGA Jeep Club as well as those cachers who are looking for a nice long hike. For those who are not equipped to drive to this cahe it is also easily done by hiking in from highway 19. It may take a while but still doable. The title really has nothing to do with the cache but that was all I had to stuff it with so deal with it. As is customary for The Ultimate Caching Series bring dry clothes, boots, waders or a winch. If you choose to drive in I am not resposible for any damage to your vehicle but I will gladly pull you out if I can get to you.

There are holes here that will swallow a normal vehicle so come prepared. Winch, waders or dry clothes your option. &lt;br/&gt; In the middle of a small swamp stands a grove of solitary Palm Trees. All around are the remains of countless pine trees who just could not stand the test of time or the conditions of the area. As I was placing the cache I was struck by the amount of water that flows through this area and I was reminded of my good friend Mike of Cache and Keri. Now if you all are not aware Mike is a white robe cacher at heart. No he really is he just dearly loves to hike through water and mud and all other sorts of obstacles. So Mike bought himself a Jeep to be a part of the NEFGA Jeep Club and to get even further into the woods to get to caches he could wade too. Well Mike right now this one is dry but given a few months and this may very well be one of your favorite caches.

Exactly where to find it. The question is are you brave enough to try it. Don't let the name fool you. This is defiently an Ultimate Caching Experince. We drove approx. 1 mile the greenest , muddiest, nastiest water I hink I have ever been in to hide theis cache. There are other along this trail as well. At the hiding of the is cache you could still drive to this cache without a snorkel. If we get much rain you may not be able to. While on the trail we saw many many birds including a rosette spoonbill. This has got to be one of the most challenging caches I have ever hid and possibly one of the hardet you will ever find. Please keep in mind this is Florida what you can't see will hurt or eat you here. While we didn't see anything that could do harm I am sure they are there. As with all The Ultiamte caches be forewarned, bring boots, waders or a winch. I will not be responsible for death, damage or dismemberment.&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck

 This cache is loicated across the street from one of the largest landowners in Northeast Florida. I though it might be nice to let cachers stop by and see what all their tax dollars help pay for. The property owner will go unnamed in this cache page. Oh yeah you may need some special cache retireval tools or skills for this one.

 Another little cache along The Seven Bridges Road. As I hid this cache 3 or 4 cars passed me and all just kind of stared at me as though I was doing something wrong. I guess to the muggle world we really are crazy. I mean who spends all their precious time out hunting, film cans, tupperware containers and such just to put their name on a piece of paper. Well the title says The Greeks don't want no freaks well from the looks I got today it appears the people from Bostwick don't want any either.

 Continuing my Eagles tour down The Seven Bridges Road I found this little area at my turn around point and this place just screamed for a cache. I put an extra hint in the title to help with this one. GPS reception mybe a little iffy here but the hide location should be obvious from the road you just have to locate it. I will also put a useful hint in the decode box but try it without it first.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This Virtual Cache will take you to Castillo de San Marcos National Monument in historic St Augustine, Florida.  You do not need to enter the fort to get the information you need, but this is encouraged anyway.  For the fort's hours and fees please see the NPS link below.

Castillo de San Marcos is a masonry star fort built from 1672-1695 to defend St Augustine, then part of Spanish Florida.  The fort is built with coquina quarried in what is now Anastasia Island State Park.  The fort remained active during the entire time of Spanish control and also while the British controlled Florida (1763-1783) during which time it was called Fort St Mark (the English translation of its Spanish name).

The United States acquired Florida in 1821 and renamed the Castillo to Fort Marion (after &quot;Swamp Fox&quot; Francis Marion).  It remained in service until 1900 and became a National Monument in 1924.

For more about the Castillo:
http://www.nps.gov/casa/
http://staugustine.com/history/castillo-de-san-marcos

The posted coordinates are on the seawall outside the fort.  The seawall is safe to walk on and normally open to the public.  Please use caution as there is no railing!  Enjoy a great view of Mantanzas Bay and St Augustine Inlet, with passing boat traffic and usually a cool breeze off the ocean.  It's also a great view at night.  I did see a sign saying the area is closed between midnight and 6AM.  Please respect all signs, fences, barricades, and other posted regulations such as when the seawall is closed due to repairs or hazardous weather conditions.

At the posted coordinates you will find a benchmark mounted on top of the seawall at Castillo de San Marcos.  This benchmark has a three letter identification number stamped on it and that is the code phrase you must enter to verify your visit.  You are heartily encourage to post photos in your log of your visit to the Castillo, but please do not post any photos of the benchmark itself!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the eighth in the adotpion series of caches by The Federation. This cache has a bit of special memory for The Fed. Just across the street is a haunted house that another infamous cacher lived in as a small boy. Th stories he told me and Paintfiction were scary to say the least. &lt;br/&gt; The Finding Irish were a big part of the early development of caching on the West Side of the river. They have since left active caching and have allowed their caches to be adopted out. In true Number Ho fashion in honor of our Friends The Irish, rather than adopt the caches I am archiving them and relisting them so everyone can log them again. As you find these caches please remember our friends The Finding Irish and their contribution to NEFGA.&lt;br/&gt;From the orignal cache page:&lt;br/&gt;This is your typical film canister micro. Difficulty will be increased because of the tree canopy. We had to rough out an average for the coordinates, so we will give plenty of clues.&lt;br/&gt;We turned down this street on a whim and drew in a breath. I LOVE this street! I just get great joy out of such simply beauty, I guess. The purpose of this cache is to share the beauty with you. &lt;br/&gt;Retrieval of the cache will be difficult for two reasons (on top of the poor sat reception).&lt;br/&gt;1) Muggles--there is a tourist attraction nearby&lt;br/&gt;2) Film canister is in a tight spot &lt;br/&gt;When you locate the cache, it is probably best to remove the lid, remove the log and then remove the rest of the cache. &lt;br/&gt;After you have put the cache back together PLEASE be sure to return it UPSIDE DOWN so the lid is on the under-side. &lt;br/&gt;Hope you enjoy the view.&lt;br/&gt;The Finding Irish &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This cache was placed by a member of the&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Northeast Florida Geocachers Association&lt;/strong&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

  The first in a series of Highway 90 caches brought to you by the federation. This is a really nice park that contains numerous other caches. You could almost fill a day right here. Bring a picnic lunch, your fishing pole, and gps. Have fun and enjoy. Thisis the same park where The Federation celebrated their 500th find.

Snakes are out so be careful.  Turned into a great teaching moment for my little girl.  She got to see the snake and realize her fear was overrated but respect for them is always a must.  So a great find for multiple reasons this great day!  TFTC

A regular cache good for exchanging trackables, etc.  Cache is not at the coordinates given here.  This is the starting point for the first clue.  *** Congratulations to 2Wolfes for first to find. ***

For Stage 1, go to the given coordinates shown above.   At that location there is a rule posted.  You can’t do that here.  “No __________”  . 
Count the number of letters in the missing word and multiply by 100.  Then subtract 363.  Result is used as “A”.  Subtract 175 from “A” to get “B”. 
Go to Stage 2 at :
North 31º 55.A' 
West 081º 18.B'

     At that location there is a rule posted.  You can’t do that here.  “No __________” .
Count the number of letters in the missing word and multiply by 100.  Then subtract 10.  Result is used as “C”.  Subtract 56 from “C” to get “D”.
Go to Stage 3 at:
North 31º 55.C'
West 081º 18.D'

    At that location there is a rule posted.  There’s a lot of things you can’t have here but we are interested in the last critters on the list. “No .......... ______ ...”   Count the number of letters in the missing word and multiply by 100.   Add 211.  Result is used as “E”.  Add 25 to “E” to get “F”.

BSA - Coastal Empire?- Troop 665 Cache 

Just before the turn of the century, the city of Rincon sprang up around the miles and miles of railroad tracks making their way along the eastern seaboard through the sleepy countryside of rural Georgia. It had taken more than 150 years for residents to move beyond the original 1751 Salzburger New Ebenezer settlement along the Savannah River, but once the railroad came to town, a new city and a new era had arrived.
 
Chief Engineer George Wadley named the newly founded city Rincon, which was Spanish for “little spot” or “corner.” Aptly named, Rincon began as just a small area in the county named for Lord Effingham, a former member of the House of Lords in England. Businesses soon began popping up, managed by area natives and created to meet the needs of the railroad workers, followed by houses and various churches. Successful local businesses became the order of the day.
 
Echoing the line-and-grid street system of Savannah, Rincon systematically marched its way along the tracks and settled itself in an organized, orderly fashion. Serenaded by wistful train whistles and lulled to sleep by the steady clackety-clack of train cars on the rails, residents of the “little spot” of Rincon found a place they could call home.
 
Sawmills, cotton gins and turpentine stills dotted the landscape, providing additional means for business opportunities. Early landowners saw potential in the railroad and granted rights of way for its progression. Economic growth and development resulted, and the city of Rincon was incorporated soon after.
 
The first stage of this cache takes you to the original center of town and the site of the old railroad depot. Use the information found on the historical marker to determine the final cache location.
 

AAA= year of Rincon incorporation - 1483
 
BBB= year of marker dedication / number of council members - 173
 
Initial Cache location = N 32 17.AAA W 081 14.BBB
 

The final cache location is where Boy Scout Troop 665 currently conducts meetings. Please be respectful of the property. (No one lives in this building, so feel free to walk around.) Please do not attempt to search for this cache during our regularly scheduled meetings on Monday evenings between 6:30 pm and 9:00 pm.
 

In 1977, Boy Scout Troop 665 became Rincon, Georgia’s first Boy Scout Troop. After more than 33 years and over 69 Eagle Scouts later, Troop 665 is as strong and active as ever. We have camped more than 665 nights, biked more than 32 miles, canoed 183 miles, hiked 824 miles, hiked 183 miles at Philmont, and rafted more than 99 miles. This is our Troop’s first Geocache.
 

The Boy Scouts of Troop 665 have been asked to donate Scout related paraphernalia and collectables to the cache. We encourage anyone with ties to Scouting to continue with the Scouting theme. NO KNIVES!
 

Please be respectful and ONLY take ONE item from this cache and please leave something of equal or better value. This also includes geocoins, trackables, patches, etc. We want everyone who finds this cache to be able take something with them. Thanks for being a good-mannered cacher!
 

We also ask that you when you make comments about this cache, you do NOT mention what type of container it is. Please put the container back exactly where and how you found it.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A Boy Scouts of America cache, located near the entrance to the BSA Black Creek Scout Reservation in Screven County, GA.
 

The Boy Scouts of America, Coastal Empire Council, in southeastern Georgia (Savannah area) has a new camp called the &quot;Camp Black Creek Scout Reservation&quot;. This camp has been open (to Scouts) since late 2009. It is still under construction for the next year or so, but it is improving by leaps and bounds and offers great activiites for Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts. Each year more and more activities are being added as construction is completed.
 This cache is located near the front entrance of the camp. While there are signs saying &quot;no trespassing&quot; that refers to people wanting to enter into the actual campground. This cache is located only about 10 feet from the road and walking more than 20 feet into the property will not be necessary. BSA is aware of this cache being public and it is ok for anyone to come and try to locate this cache.
 
You can park on the side of the road near the cache, please do not block the main entrance into the camp.
 

Enjoy the cache! Please remember to put the lid back on tightly and to put the cache back exactly where you found it please. Thank you.
 
BE PREPARED!

Inside the bison tube is a sealed tube with the coords visible. you shouldn't have to open the small tube. Please put the caches back where you found them.

This multi leads you on a nice little walk through downtown Williston. It's a nice well maintained path. The difficulty is due to muggles and the distance you will walk. The parking coords are safe and won't raise suspicion. Park at Ground Zero at your own risk.
Please BYOP

When you sign this log if you are from opencaching, please put an &quot;OC.com&quot; on your log.  Just so I can tell where to check for logs.  Thanks.

A quick walk in the woods kinda cache.

This is my first cache ver 2.0. You are looking for an ammo can. Inside that ammo can you will find the original cache container. I put it in the ammo can for some waterproofing, and now it can hold trade items. Remember guys it only counts if you sign the log. I included a pen, but you might want to bring one just in case its not working.
The area is a wooded area in a residential area. So going for this during daylight hours is recommended. You don't want to look suspicious, we have a local boy in blue who lives just a few houses down. He is aware of the cache and is a geocacher, but we don't want him to have to be called out for nothing.
The woods are filled with crawlies, bugs, snakes, thorns, and the usual. So dress appropriately. Good luck and happy caching.</groundspeak:long_description>

The owner of the bookstore knows about the cache, so you don't have to worry about him or his employees, but the area is full of muggles at all times of day, so be careful!

You are looking for a VERY SMALL cache container about the size of your pinky from the tip to first knuckle.  It is magnetic.  There is a small scroll to log your visit with no room for anything else, so bring your own pen.</groundspeak:long_description>

You are looking for a green ammo box with a geocaching sticker on it. It is the home of the Yellow Truck travelbug. This is a CITO site as well.

Keep an eye out for muggles. They tend to walk this way from time to time. Also, do not park on the side of the road. Traffic through this alley can be heavy at times. Feel free to park at the VFW or at the parking lot inside Plaza Place Apartments. The manager of the Apartments and the maintenance man know about the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a micro cache that falls in line with the other caches located in the same &quot;area&quot; that I have found. This is one you will want to take the kids on. Once you find it, you will realize that you should have known it would be there!

Remember to use your best stealth as this location is overrun with muggles sometimes.

This small cache is about the size of an key holder. It is located at the home of low prices. 

Use your best stealth when hunting this one as this location can be quite full of muggles at certain times. 

There is only room for a log and small trade items, so BYOP.

You're looking for a large tupperware container. I will occasionally be dropping off pathtags at this cache. The tags are yours to keep, you do not have to move them on. But PLEASE trade fair.

This is a hide-a-key micro placed at one of North Augusta's pocket parks. Bunting Park was renovated in 2004 and features a children's play area and picnic area. This is a cache to bring the whole family on!

BYOP as there is not enough room to hold one in the cache.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;This property is owned and managed by The Nature Conservancy, a
private, not-for-profit, international conservation organization.
The mission of The Nature Conservancy is to preserve the plants,
animals, and natural communities that represent the diversity of
life on Earth by protecting the lands and waters they need to
survive. Visitors to Nature Conservancy preserves in Shady Valley
are asked not to leave the mowed trails and walkways due to
environmental hazards such as poison sumac, hornets' nests,
poisonous snakes, and concealed areas of deep water. Research plots
are also maintained off-trail that must not be disturbed. For more
information about The Nature Conservancy's properties, or to become
a Conservancy member, please contact Charles McQueen, Shady Valley
Preserves Manager, at (423) 739-2441 or cmcqueen@tnc.org.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second of our Shady Valley geologically unique
caches. Wetland habitats have become rare as civilizations have
grown. Where there were wet natural bogs, there are farms, condos
and parking lots. This is the ORCHARD BOG which is being preserved
for future generations. Several wonderful plant species live here.
Among them are: Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon), Cotton Grass
(Eriophorum virginicum) and Nuttall Pondweed (Potamogeton
epihydrus). Take your time and enjoy the trip. In the spring and
fall this is a birdwatchers heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this is an ecologically sensitive area &lt;b&gt;NO BUSHWHACKING
IS NEEDED AND SHOULD NOT BE DONE&lt;/b&gt; . The cache should only be
reached via the trails (mowed paths). There is absolutely no need
to venture into the bog and should never be done. Take the longer
trail behind and to the right of the barn (between the log
fence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no parking lot. Park on the grass to the left of the
stone building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a camo-taped small (2 in. by 5 in.) round
Rubbermaid container. Does hold small trade items but please bring
your own pen. We have never found one bit of trash in the area so
if you do please take it out(CITO). Have a good caching day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 6 other caches within 2.2 miles. They are: GCKG7T
(Schoolyard Springs), GCKCJ0 (Jumping The Low Gap Spring), GCK04B
(Maggie's Meadow Walk), GCK04K (Tyler's 'Appy Trail), GCNR2R (Cave
Run) and GCT347 (All Shot UP). Go for them all.&lt;/p&gt;

geologically unique area. With the retreat of the massive sheet of
ice that once covered covered North America, our area was molded
into most of the conditions that we know it today. One of the rare
exceptions is the Schoolyard Springs. What makes the area unusual
is the sandy, bottomless upwelling of springs. There is a boardwalk
running through the main spring area and a mowed path loop to enjoy
the full 9 acre preserve.

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: On 9/21/05 the missing cache container was replaced and
the location moved a few feet from the original spot. There is a
new log and a cache full of goodies. You can be FTF on the new
container and location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE&lt;/b&gt; On October 13, 2007 we replaced the container with a
ammo box. The log is the same and continues. Thanks to papermanone
&amp; catlover for the heads up regarding the container. There was
no TB in the cache when we exchanged containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;b&gt;Lucifer, the Greatest Fallen Angel&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
The Divine Comedy was written by Dante Alighieri sometime
between 1308 and 1321. The first part of his work is titled 'The
Inferno' and describes Dante's trip with Virgil the poet through
the 9 Circles of Hell. Each circle represents a gradual increase in
wickedness and therefore a gradual increase in punishment.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
The &lt;b&gt;Fifth Circle of Hell&lt;/b&gt; is the swamp-like water of
the river Styx. Here, the wrathful fight each other on the surface
and the sullen or slothful lie gurgling beneath the water. This
circle is guarded by fallen angels. These once good creatures are
now evil and vindictive and want you to stay....forever! Phlegyas,
the angry oarsman reluctantly transports Dante and Virgil across
the Styx in his skiff. The problem with old Phlegyas is the fact
that Dante and Virgil are only visitors and not to be permanent
residents of the area. He, like the fallen angels, wants more
permanent residents.....could that be you?
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 



&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Crossing The River Styx&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
You are brave to seek this cache for it may be your last!
This cache has a little something for everyone if you dare to try.
It is a night cache. It is a letterbox hybrid with tradeables. It
is a two-stage multi.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
First, you must see the trail which, at the beginning, is
well worn and straight up the mountain. Soon the trail is faint and
all light will be gone. You will be in the tunnel of Medusa. It is
pitch black and the only light will be yours and the glowing eyes
of the dead! Be careful because the dead reach out at night. Two
vertical eyes mean you must make a turn. Which way, you may ask?
Find the next eye and you turned in the right direction. Find no
eye, then you may fall directly into the &lt;b&gt;Ninth Circle&lt;/b&gt; never
to return or be heard from again! Find the two glowing horizonal
eyes and you will be at the &lt;b&gt;First Stage&lt;/b&gt;. Here you will find
a secured camo-painted ammo box with the coordinates to the final
stage or the &lt;b&gt;Fifth Circle&lt;/b&gt; of Hell. It is less than .1 mile
from the trail head/parking spot to the final stage but it will be
the most terrifying .1 of a mile you have ever walked!
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 



&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;b&gt;Another Angel Falling&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;You can but it is advised that you not
go after this cache alone!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There are real dangers in the night. Besides Lucifer,
Mother Nature has her own tricks up her sleeve. These tricks can
bite, itch and claw the flesh from your bones! Be careful!

&lt;br/&gt;
 
The final cache container is also a secured, camo-painted
ammo box. Look for the last eye! Inside you will find a stamp and
pad. The stamp is a foot print of the &lt;b&gt;Wolf&lt;/b&gt; which lurks near
the final stage. The Wolf and Fallen Angels guard the &lt;b&gt;Fifth
Circle&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;NOTE: Please leave the stamp and pad in the
cache&lt;/b&gt;. Please sign and use 'your' stamp on the log book. By the
way, old Lucifer has left a lot of nice gifts for trade. He is
always watching so trade up or even. Re hide each cache container
just as you found them.
&lt;br/&gt;

If you make it through the &lt;b&gt;Fifth Circle of Hell&lt;/b&gt; you
may want to try the nearby &lt;b&gt;First and Ninth Circles of Hell

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;On The Path To The
Inferno&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Devine Comedy was written by Dante Alighieri sometime
between 1308 and 1321. The first part of his work is titled 'The
Inferno' and describes Dante's trip with Virgil the poet through
the 9 Circles of Hell. The Circles represent a gradual increase in
wickedness and therefore a gradual increase in punishment. The
&lt;b&gt;First Circle of Hell&lt;/b&gt; is reserved for pagans, etc. who did
not pay fitting homage to their respective deities. The &lt;b&gt;Ninth
Circle of Hell&lt;/b&gt; is the very worst of all. It is reserved for
traitors and those who muggle or destroy caches. The punishments
are horrible and for all eternity. Cain, Ptolomaea, Brutus, Cassius
and of course, Judas are all found here as well as the evil master,
Lucifer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the cache site, you will be in the &lt;b&gt;Ninth Circle&lt;/b&gt; and
you will notice a significant temperature drop. Dante's trip to the
depths of Hell brought him to what he described as a frozen lake
(Cocytus) with Lucifer's 'bat like' wings fanning the waters to
keep it frozen and cold for all eternity. The permanent residents
are all frozen at various depths within the lake. Some sinners are
totally submerged and some frozen up to their necks. The lowest and
final area of the &lt;b&gt;Ninth Circle&lt;/b&gt; is known as Judecca, named
for Judas the Iscariot. All of the sinners who reside here are
completely encapsulated in the ice, distorted to all conceivable
positions. &lt;b&gt;Do not linger here for long for you may not be
allowed to leave.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 


&lt;b&gt;Lucifer, King of Hell in the Ninth
Circle&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the night caches we have placed, &lt;b&gt;The Ninth Circle of
Hell&lt;/b&gt;, this is by far the most difficult. Again, you will need a
strong flashlight with a back up. From parking you will walk past
the &lt;b&gt;Gate to Hell&lt;/b&gt; (yellow bar) and
continue on the wide trail for about a quarter of a mile to the
starting point. At the starting point coordinates listed above, you
will leave the trail (on the right) and follow the glowing eyes of
the dead up the left side of the hill. You will proceed upward for
approximately 130 feet in elevation. At any double, horizontal
'pair' of eyes, you will make a turn. Right or left is up to you.
Find the next eye! You will make one final turn to the left and
proceed downward in the depths of Hell to find the cache. The cache
is marked by a pair of eyes that are vertical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 


&lt;b&gt;The Reaper Leading The
Way&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eyes will lead you out of the Inferno and back to the safety
of your vehicle. Use your flashlight and your GPSr. Remember, you
are in the mountains and they can present dangers, especially in
the dark! There is always the possibility of wildlife encounters
and of course we have rocks, briar's and other tricks of Mother
Nature. Be careful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;You can but it is advised that you
should not go after this cache alone!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;The cache is a camo-painted ammo box full of temptations. Please
trade up or trade even. Remember that &lt;b&gt;Greed&lt;/b&gt; is one of the
seven deadly sins and also remember where you are! Please place the
cache container back the way you found it. Thank you and have a
scary but safe trip into and &lt;b&gt;(hopefully)&lt;/b&gt; out of the &lt;b&gt;Ninth Circle Of
Hell.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Hell&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dante detailed his trip through Hell with the poet Virgil in his
work the 'Devine Comedy'. In the 'Inferno&quot;, Dante describes the
&lt;b&gt;Nine Circles of Hell&lt;/b&gt;. The Circles begin with the
&lt;b&gt;First&lt;/b&gt; and proceed to the &lt;b&gt;Ninth&lt;/b&gt;. Each circle gets
worse as the sins you have committed have gotten worse. According
to Dante, the unbaptised and the virtuous pagans who are not truly
sinful reside in this circle of hell. Their fault is they lacked
faith. They are not punished as such but grieve their separation
from God without hope of reconcilation. This cache represents the
&lt;b&gt;First Circle of Hell&lt;/b&gt; and it is the easiest of our &lt;b&gt;Circles
Of Hell&lt;/b&gt; caches.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Follow The Reaper&lt;/b&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;The above coordinates are the starting point for the cache. The
cache is approximately than 450 +/- feet from where you park. You
will be guided to the cache by the glowing eyes of the dead. Shine
your light approximately 45 degrees (left) and pick up the first
set of eyes and walk carefully uphill to the cache. The cache is
marked by the last single eye. The cache is a secured, camo-painted
ammo box. Please trade up or trade even. &lt;b&gt;Greed&lt;/b&gt; is one of the
seven deadly sins and also remember where you are! There is always
the chance that you may find yourself in one of the deeper
&lt;b&gt;Circles.&lt;/b&gt; Please place the cache container back the way you
found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with anything outdoors, in the mountains and of course, in
the dark you must be very careful! There are briars, rocks and
occasional encounters with wildlife. Proceed with caution and watch
your step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;You can but it is advised that you not
go after this cache alone!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Have a good trip into and &lt;b&gt;(hopefully)&lt;/b&gt; out of the &lt;b&gt;First Circle of
Hell!&lt;/b&gt; After you are successful with the &lt;b&gt;First Circle&lt;/b&gt; and
if you are brave and/or have a death wish, also find the nearby
&lt;b&gt;Fifth and Ninth Circles (Final) of Hell! (GC1CHDV and
GC1A3R4)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now have a nice little hike ahead. It is mostly uphill but
not too steep. Take the time to enjoy this beautiful area. Going to
or from the cache there is a spring coming out of the mountain. I
and many others have had several cool drinks from the spring. For
obvious reasons I cannot guarantee purity but it tastes great. The
cache is a camo painted ammo can filled with a lot of goodies.
Please use stealth and replace everything as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 6 other caches within 1.9 miles. They are: GCK04B

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The original ammo box was destroyed in a forest fire. Thanks
to Papafuz for the alert. On April 29, 2008 the cache was replaced

caches. As always, we are attempting to bring you to some of
Southwest Virginia's most beautiful but little known
waterfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitetop Laurel Creek is joined by the Straight Branch and then
roars (in high water) down the mountain towards Damascus, Virginia.
About 4 miles from Damascus the creek tumbles over serveral rock
shelves and drops some twenty feet. This is the beautiful Whitetop
Laurel Falls. It is not too steep so you may walk to the base of
the falls. Not too steep but sometimes slick so be careful. This
part is not reccomended for small children. The little ones can go
for the cache without worry but not down to the falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, satellite readings were bothersome because of the
terrain so you may need to use the hint. If you have good reception
with accuracy, please post your coordinates for the cache site. The
cache container is a camo-taped 3X6X9 Rubbermaid box. Room for
medium tradeables and TBs.&lt;/p&gt;

Falls, Damascus, VA from Randy Gardner
and Vimeo. 
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE put everything back as you found it. We made it not too
hard to find so don't make it too easy to be muggled. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, you are going on the Creeper Trail. There are more
caches to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; We are planning a special award for completing the
entire series. Nothing drastic but something for your efforts and
to remember what you accomplished. We will watch the logs but let
us know when you have done it!&lt;/p&gt;

aim is for you to have fun caching and to see some of Southwest
Virginia's most beautiful but little known waterfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first name given to Damascus, Virginia was Mock's Mill. It
was named after Henry A. Mock who when traveling with Daniel Boone
in 1821 was so impressed with the beauty of the area he decided to
stay, buy some land. build a cabin and build a grist mill. Mr. Mock
was born in Davie Co., N.C. about 1794. After Henry Mock built his
cabin and mill he spent the rest of his life here. He married three
times and fathered 23 children. (Maybe it's something in the
water)? Henry died on April 18, 1892 in Damascus. The name of the
community was changed to Damascus in 1886 when General John D.
Imboden bought much of the land from the Mocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache and falls are located at the rebuilt mill which now
serves as a restaurant and conference center. The views and fishing
are great and of course there is the wonderful Creeper Trail for
hiking, horse and mountain bike riding and more caching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a camo-taped match container. At times there can be
a lot of muggles so use your best stealthily approaches.
&lt;b&gt;PLEASE&lt;/b&gt; put the cache back exactly where you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy and have a good caching day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; We are planning a special award for completing the
entire series. Nothing drastic but something for your efforts and

Take your kids, take your camera, take your fishing pole and enjoy
the glory of nature. You just might see a deer or a turkey or even
a bear.&lt;/p&gt;

is to bring you to some of the most beautiful waterfalls of
Southwest Virginia. This little waterfall is not a Niagra Falls but
it is still worth seeing. The Falls of Alvarado Road are part of a
thin stream that tumbles for 15 feet over mossy covered rocks and
then goes under the road and on down to the South Fork of the
Holston River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the waterfall is small, in volume, it it is very
photogenic. Bring your camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please replace the cache back to exactly where you found it. We
wanted to place a larger cache container, but as you will see, the
area doesn't lend itself for a big hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care and enjoy some nature's finest work. Have a good
caching day.&lt;/p&gt;

joined by the Feathercamp Branch before it empties into the
Whitetop Laural Creek. There ia a pretty waterfall on the Straight
Branch that you cannot see from the road so you might as well stop
to see and find a cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is a magnetic key case micro because we could not
find a good safe hiding spot for a larger container. We thought you
may want a larger container so we hid the &lt;b&gt;Straight Mountain
Trail Bonus Cache (GCNX4H).&lt;/b&gt; The coordinates to the bonus cache
are found in the cache container. Please enter them into your GPSr
and leave the original numbers in the cache. Since this is a micro
please bring your own pen/pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site is kid friendly but don't let toddlers go too close to
the falls. It is best to stay on the falls side of the guard
rail.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the 17th in our Fallin' For Virginia cache series. We
are continuing to attempt to bring you to some of Southwest
Virginia's most beautiful but little known waterfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historic Parks Mill is a real eighteenth-century,
water-powered, grist mill which is still in operation on the
Fifteen Mile Creek in Washington County, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE OLD MILL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original mill was built around 1780 by Oliver Alexander. It
was used to produce stone-ground corn meal, oat and wheat
flours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parks family purchased the original mill in 1810 and
operated it until it was destroyed by fire during the Civil War. By
1865 they had rebuilt the current three-story mill and ran it until
they sold it to Jasper Brown in 1933. First Brown, and then his
son, Dave operated the mill into the 1980's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current owner, Dave Holcomb, gave permission to place this
cache. The mill still operates by the same time-honored,
water-powered process used now for more than 220 years at the
mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a (3 X 5 x 5) camo-taped Rubbermaid
container. At times there can be a lot of muggles close by. Take a
stroll along the creek to the falls, tour the mill, take pictures,
eat a barbecue meal or some ice cream and find a cache. Have a good
caching day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; We are planning a special award for completing the
entire series. Nothing drastic but something for your efforts and
to remember what you accomplished. We will watch the logs but let
us know when you have done it!&lt;/p&gt;

400 feet from where you should park. It is gently uphill. It is
best to go to the top of the short hill and cut &quot;back&quot; to the
right. Doing this provides the clearest path and keeps bushwacking
to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a camo painted ammo can with a Geocache Sticker.
There a a nice FTF prize related to geocaching along with other
goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a beautiful area so enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

the U S Armed Forces who are from Konnarock, Green Cove and Laurel
Valley Virginia. Sit awhile and reflect.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
Marge and I pass this spot many times going to and from our
Konnarock mountain retreat and we thought it deserved a little more
attention. Come on up to Konnarock. There are several nearby caches
waiting for your hunt! Drive the forrest roads and hike our many
trails and just simply enjoy mother nature at her finest.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
The cache container is a round, 5 inch by 4 inch,
camo-taped loc-n-loc.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
The coordinates were determined with over 250 readings at a
6 foot accuracy level
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;b&gt;There is no need to go into the flowers and surrounding
greenery.&lt;/b&gt; The cache can be easily found from the pavement.
Please put the cache exactly back where you found it. Enjoy and
have a good caching day!</groundspeak:long_description>

Foundation. The Foundation is engaged in an extensive restoration
of the old Mill. The Mill and Mercantile is currently operated by
the non-profit Foundation and is open to the public. 
The original mill was constructed sometime in the early
1790's. It is speculated that the current Mill was built late in
the 1820's. Please refer to the White's Mill web site for a more
detailed history and hours of operation: http://www.whitesmill.org/
We have also presented a brief history from the web site on our
&quot;Down By The Old Mill&quot; (GC12MGQ) cache page. The Mill was placed on
the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It is also on the
Virginia Register of Historic Places.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
The Mill is a wonderful and photogenic place to visit.
There are two caches here and another to be found just a short
drive down Toole's Creek Road. This cache is a camo-taped, 5 X 3 X
2 Lock-n-Lock with room for small tradeables. The cache is a short
.16 mile from the Down By The Old Mill cache. Please place the
cache back exactly where and how you found it. Thanks and be sure
to bring your camera and enjoy.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;About The Mill&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Lewark constructed a water powered mill for Thomas Moffett
in the early 1790's. Located on the current site of White's Mill,
this early operation witnessed the influx of settlers traveling the
&quot;Great Road&quot; through Abingdon and westward. Forest land was cleared
for crop use resulting in an increased need for milling capacity.
So began the history of milling on the headwaters of Toole's Creek
in Washington County, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historical experts speculate that the present mill was built
late in the 1820's. The strongest evidence leading to this
conclusion is the lack of hand made (rose head nails) throughout
the mill. Prior to the invention of machinery to mass produce &quot;cut
nails&quot; all nails were made by the blacksmith which resulted in a
rose pattern on the hammered head; thus a clue that dates the
current building to post circa 1820's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James White was a local merchant who was involved in salt
production (Saltville), lead mining (Austinville) and in iron ore
mining (Brumley Gap). County tax records show an increase in
accessed tax value between 1836 and 1838. Following James White's
death, his son W.Y.C. White continued to operate the mill until the
early 1900's. It was during this period the name White's Mill
originated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Miller purchased the Mill in 1922 and it remained in the
Miller family until 1989. Many of the features around the property
were constructed by Tom Miller. It should be noted that the mill
served as a Post Office and polling place up until the early
1940's. Tom's son Guy operated the mill as a tourist attraction
with trout ponds for 20 years. In addition, Guy Miller continued to
custom grind corn and livestock feed. Following his death in 1989,
the mill was sold to ownership outside the area. After 1989 it
operated on a limited basis until 1999 during which time its upkeep
and condition declined severely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2001 the White's Mill Foundation purchased the mill and
surrounding property. The Foundation is currently engaged in a
large restoration of the mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, many, many changes and renovations have been
made. The four-story, 5,000 square foot timber frame structure is
an historic example of milling and the evolution of milling
equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White's Mill is on both the National and Virginia register
of Historic Places. The mill was listed on the National Register in
1974.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;About The Cache&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a small Rubbermaid camo-taped container. It
measures 8x4x3 inches. Bring your camera, tour the Mill, visit the
Mercantile and find the two Mill caches. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Park on the side of the road and go to the two metal fence
posts. This is private property. The owners have been so kind as to
give us permission for a little geocaching in this wonderful area.
We have promised to do CITO whenever we can so everyone please help
and bring a CITO bag when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an ecologically sensitive area so please be careful with
the surrounding fauna. There are faint paths that you can follow so
there is no need for bushwhacking and/or dangerous rock climbing.
During wet weather, the paths can be a little slick especially when
going down hill. From the road, there is no need to climb down the
steep bank. Look for the fence posts and go from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely a bring your camera cache. Walk down to the
bottom and enjoy both falls. Toole Creek is the big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a camo painted ammo box that is full of
goodies. Please place the cache back as you found it. Good
luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Black bears have been seen in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

cache. We recently had to replace that cache so Marge and I wanted
to double your fun at these close locations. This Falls area is
also a lovely Earthcache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a camo-painted ammo box. If it wasn't for the
highway, we would consider it very kid friendly. Take the little
ones but keep one eye on the cache location and the other on the
road! Sight distance is fairly good but some vehicles move
fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole area is beautiful. This cache is up from and opposite
from the Falls. Generally, the surroundings are clean but sometimes
trash throws out trash! A little CITO wouldn't be a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the first of our Fallin' For Virginia series. We will
attempt to bring you to some of the most beautiful but relatively
unknown waterfalls of Southwest Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logan Creek is a lovely stream that originates up on Walker
Mountain and slowly builds until it joins the North Fork of the
Holston River. Before it empties into the river, there is a
wonderful waterfall that is more than 25 feet in elevation. We
could not find any online reference to the Logan Creek Falls so if
you know about this please note it to your log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring your camera. It's worth adding to your caching
gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the parking area, you are you are less than .10 mile from
the cache. There is a gentle downhill trail in the wooded area on
the right side of the road. Just follow the trail. CAUTION: you do
not have to go to the edge of the rocks over-looking the Falls. The
cache is not placed at the edge of the falls so there is no need to
do serious and/or dangerous rock climbing. This cache is semi-kid
friendly but someone needs to keep them on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a camo-taped 4X3X2 loc-n-loc. Use stealth
and please place the cache back as you found it. This is a well
used area and it is fairly clean but a little CITO wouldn't hurt.
Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;NOTE: On Sept.5, 2008 we replaced and slightly moved the
cache. Please note the new coordinates and new hints. The new
coordinates should be very close with 500 readings at a accuracy of
9 feet.&lt;/b&gt;

Hopefully we are bringing you to some of Southwest Virginia's most
beautiful but unknown waterfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small stream flows down the Chestnut Ridge. After falling for
about 30 feet, the stream then forms a 25 foot high cascade inside
the small ravine. This one is a real beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need to leave the road or to bushwack to find the
cache or to view the Falls. We want you to enjoy, not endanger
yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is very near the cache therefore there is no need for
separate parking coordinates. Parking is a wide spot (pull off) in
the road.The cache container is a small(4X5),round camo-taped
Rubbermaid box. There is room for small tradeables and TBs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your camera, take your kids and enjoy another fine
presentation of Mother Nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please put everything back exactly as you found it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: cache container replaced on April 16, 2008. The cache
was moved slightly. Please see updated hint.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Well we found this spot when we were out looking for new
waterfalls. No, it is not a waterfall but a truly lovely area where
a small creek that flows from Poor Valley empties into the North
Fork of the Holston River. There is plenty room for parking (see
coordinates). This looks like a popular public fishing area so you
may encounter muggles in good weather. Use your best stealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park where indicated and drop down from the bank and walk along
the river. When you see the gnarly tree you are close. The cache is
a 6X4X3 Rubbermaid camo-taped container. There is a log, pen and
small tradeables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very scenic area so bring your camera. Bring a picnic
lunch and if you have a Virginia fishing license, bring your
fishing pole. Enjoy and have a good caching day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK112GK - Parking Spot&lt;br/&gt;N 36° 49.439 W 081° 55.266&lt;br/&gt;The parking area.</groundspeak:long_description>

Virginia's most scenic but little known waterfalls. This cache is
number eighteen. We are running out of falls so this will be the
last in the series. This whole area is beautiful. It has
everything. There is the big falls that stretch across the entire
river. The falls are not particularly high but very wide. You will
also see a small waterfall across the river that empties into the
North Fork. As a bonus you will see a very old but usable swinging
bridge. It is posted but the owner who gave permission will let you
walk the bridge. Topping everything is the mountain across the
river which frames the whole scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry folks, there were very limited hiding places therefore
this one has to be a micro. It is a camo-taped match holder. There
is only room for a log so please bring something to write with.
Also, it is a good one to bring your camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please park at the given parking spot. The cache is just a short
walk up the road from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; We are planning a special award for completing the

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the twelveth cache in our Fallin' For Virginia
waterfall series. We are striving to bring cachers to some of the
lesser known but beautiful waterfalls of Southwest Virginia. This
cache and the following two caches are on the very scenic Tumbling
Creek Road. There are many pull-offs to view, photograph or fish in
the fantistic Tumbling Creek. Most of this stream is a
&quot;fee-to-fish&quot; area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public hunting is allowed in the apropriate season so care
should be taken. Maybe a little blaze orange at the right time of
the year? The topography doesn't lend itself to deer hunting but
caution is still advised during the seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point the Creek narrows to form a canyon of fast moving
water. The falls drop 20 to 30 feet in the Hollows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The falls can easily viewed from the road and the cache requires
&lt;b&gt;NO&lt;/b&gt; bushwacking to find it. There are trails to go down the
mountain to view the Falls closeup but they are steep and sometimes
very slick. This is public land so you may go, but you do so at
your own risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a small (6 X 6 X 2 inches), camo-taped, Rubbermaid
container&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please enjoy these beauties of nature and have a good caching
day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE&lt;/b&gt; There are two other caches ahead on this road. The
Big Falls (GCXBHQ) is only .2 mile up the road and the Little
Tumbling Falls (GCXBJ7) is another .1 mile from there. Also, be
sure to visit the wonderful three Lake caches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SECOND NOTE&lt;/b&gt; This cache as well as Fallin' XIII and
Fallin' XIV may not be available during the Winter months. The road
opens again April 1st. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please rehide exactly as you found the cache. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKXBHG - Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 36° 55.846 W 081° 49.916&lt;br/&gt;Parking spot.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the 13th cache in our Fallin' For Virginia series. Our
goal is to bring you to some of the most beautiful but least known
waterfalls of Southwest Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumbling Creek flows from high on Flattop Mountain and offers
many views of rapids, excellent rock formations and of course
beautiful waterfalls. The Big Falls is the larger of the three
falls we have featured along the road. The Falls are high (20 feet)
and wide. The stream is full of trout and for a small fee, you may
fish this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the cache as well as viewing the Falls can be from the
road so there is no need to bushwack. You may go down the steep
bank for closer viewing of the Falls but it is steep and slick and
you go at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunting is allowed in the area during the appropriate seasons so
you may want to wear Blaze orange accordingly. Topographly, this
area does not lend itself to good hunting but. it is allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above coordinates are for the parking spot. &lt;b&gt;At the
parking spot, take a bearing of 110 degrees and walk East.&lt;/b&gt; We
couldn't receive good satellite readings at the cache hiding spot
so you will probably want to use the hint. Please post cache
coordinates if you are able to recieve accurate readings from your
GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache container is a camo-taped, 6 X 6 X 2 Lock-n-lock
box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please practice CITO, take a bunch of pictures and have a good
caching day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE&lt;/b&gt; There are two other caches on this road. The Twin
Hollows Falls (GCXBHG) is less than .2 mile down the road and the
Little Tumbling Falls (GCXBJ7) is .1 mile up the road. Go a bit
further and there are three more caches around the Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SECOND NOTE&lt;/b&gt; This cache as well as Fallin' XII and Fallin'
XIV may not be available during the Winter months. The road opens
again April 1st. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKXBHQ - Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 36° 55.933 W 081° 49.762&lt;br/&gt;Parking area.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the 14th of our Fallin' For Virginia cache series. As
always, our goal is to bring fellow cachers to some of the lesser
known but very beautiful waterfalls of Southwest Virginia. As you
can probably tell by now, Marge and I LOVE waterfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tumbling Creek flows from high on the Clinch Mountains
through a sometimes narrow gorge to display some of the most
beautiful scenic spots in all of Southwest Virginia. There are many
spots to view or to fish the stream (fee applies to most
areas).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This waterfall is the last we have featured within a short .5
mile of part of the Tumbling Creek Road. Yes, the drive is worth it
to see the wonderful sights and to find three caches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the falls are called &quot;little&quot; they are really not little
and you can drive right up to them. Have a cache, have a dip and
have a picnic. The cache is within a few feet of parking. After
finding the cache, drive up to the fork in the road and go left for
a couple of miles. You will then be in the Clinch Mountain Wildlife
Management Area and at the Laurel bed Lake. Take a lot of photos
and fish if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the topography doesn't lend itself to hunting, it is
allowed so during hunting seasons take care. Maybe some Blaze
orange?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coordinates were difficult to receive due to the narrow
gorge and tree cover so you may need to use the hint. If your GPS
is showing accurate readings, please post the average coordinates
your find for the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a camo-taped match container. Please put the cache
and everything else back as you found it. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please practice CITO, have fun and enjoy the beauty of nature.
P.S. Have a good caching day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE&lt;/b&gt;There are two other caches down (back) the road from
here. First is the Big Falls (GCXBHQ) just .1 back and second is
the Twin Hollows Falls (GCXBHG) at .3 mile back. Plus, there are
three nice Lake caches up the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SECOND NOTE&lt;/b&gt; This cache as well as Fallin' XIII and
Fallin' XIII may not be available during the Winter months. The
road opens again April 1st. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

I hope this makes for a challenging find. The hill is kind of steep, so take care when going up. If you need a path getting up, drive on a tad from the cache area, you will find one. This cache is definately off the beaten path though.

Don't try to rush it, just get to the area, look around, and take it all in.  The day I planted this cache I could hear the nuts falling from the trees.  If you have any problems, shut your eyes, take a deep breath, and then look around.</groundspeak:long_description>

After a nice rain, on a warm summer night, one could catch all the worms you could ever want to fish on. My dad and I don't fish as much as we use to, but we had alot of great times. 
So I create now, in the best steampunk fashion I can, a cache to honor a memory I hold dear to my heart.

I give you, Microflux Georail Stablilizer. A mechanism designed to use the energy of georails to stabilize memories. :)

     When I received thy missive this morning, I could not believe my eyes. I immediately made preparations and set out on my airship upon thy quest.  I have long been a supporter of those who would take the trappings that these barbarians call society and progress and repurpose them in the name of creativity, craftsmanship and adventure.  Despite the haste of my departure and the throngs of the unenlightened that barred our path, the directions you supplied allowed my navigator to find the way easily.  

The search was successful and I aquired the cache of artifacts that you described.  You are modest to call yourself an Artisan, as the workmanship deserves much more praise.  I dare say that a lesser soul would not risk such a fragile work in the face of an uncaring winter.  I pray for good fortune on your craft, which I replaced as carefully as I extracted it.  

I documented the occation in your journal. I took only the arrowhead which seemed a powerful talisman against the misfortunes that may cross my journeys.  For it, you have my thanks. May fortune and inspiration always find you. 

Yours in Science, 
The Spacegamer.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache was placed with permission of St. Albans Parks and Recreation.  The park has many facilities including hiking trails, a swimming pool, an amphitheater and a dog park.  It is home to the Festival of Lights which takes place annually from November 30 through December 27.

The cache container is located just a little off one of the hiking trails through the park.  There should not be any bushwhacking, but you may have to climb a little once you make it to the cache site.  

St. Albans City Park is closed at dark, and some of the trails are closed for seasonal events.  Please pay heed to any posted signs.

Parking is available near the trailhead waypoint.  There is a trailhead on either side of the parking area.  They connect and you can make a circular route through the park.  I recommend the right hand trail.

There is a lot of signal bounce in the area of the cache.  One measurement had the arrow spin around and point in front of me as I walked away.  The posted coordinates took me to the right place coming from either direction on the trail. GPSr units will vary, the hint will provide some guidance once you are in the area.

The cache contains a logbook, writing implement and swag.  There is room for trackables.

Either it is extremelywell hidden, has been removed, or otherwise unfindable, as there are a lot of down trees on these trails now and quite hard to find any significant spot to hide a cache, or be able to walk off the path to find it.  My suggestion would be to relocate it elsewhere that would be a little easier to access.</groundspeak:text>

Slightly up a hill from the parking area. 4x6 Lock &amp; Lock container. Contains various items, mostly ninja-related in some manner. Also has a log, pencils, and a sharpener. Please don't take the sharpener, thanks!

We saw some poisonous plants in the area, please be careful. Could be a harder climb in wet/snowy weather. Should be safe at night, but would be better in the day, since it's at the end of a dead end street.

This has already been found on the &quot;other site&quot;, hoping it will gain new finders on here.</groundspeak:long_description>

The coordinates took me to the turn around spot and the description took me right to the cache less than 30 feet away.  It's a good container with nice swag, and a good size for a hide in town.  I logged this at 7:54 AM for the {*FTF*}.  Took pathtag, left a gaming figure that would get along well with the ones you had in there and a sharpie pen.  Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

SHE HAS BOLDLY GONE WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE!
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks goes out to the
Muskingum Park District, for welcoming Geocaching with open arms.
Please show your appreciation by practicing C.I.T.O. and keeping
this place beautiful for all who come to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Although you'll know where you're going as soon as you get there,
the info provided is as good as having stairs. I planned a big
production for this page, but I simply cannot compete with the
reality of the cache itself. This adventure will test your wits,
and your ability to perform under pressure, but do not
underestimate the risks involved. Don't attempt this one alone. If
you give me advance notice, I can tag along.(and would like to)
Please no spoilers(pics or logs), or group finds. Don't leave your
camera at home for this one, you will regret it.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN25ZXF - Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Final container</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Updates Sept. 11, 2007. We have replaced the container and
hide for this cache. Important.
Make certain as to NOT to try and completely remove the hide
container for the Librarian. It is secured to the ground via cable.
It can only be lifted up approximately 6&quot; to provide enough room to
remove the cache container from the bottom of the hide.

Like all Librarians in the world, this one holds the guidance and
reward we all cacher's seek. He is easy to locate but will require
skill to obtain. It is a high muggle area so stealth and timing are
required to gain the wisdom and riches held within. This cache, by
request, is only available during daylight hours and should be kept
family friendly. If you like, bring a sack lunch and enjoy some
recreation at the nearby Deer Run Park or play a round of putt putt
golf down the street. A great area to take a break and relax after
a long day of caching. The cache itself is not located inside the
library. Certain times of the day and week have less muggles. If he
eludes you take note of those times for a return trip. He is also
not shy when it comes to photos. Don't hesitate to take your
picture with him and post it here. Also, please return the
container as you found it. Special thanks to the Holmes County
Public Library for allowing this cache to be placed on their
property. Congratulations to Blue Bomb for making The Librarian his 900th
find.

decided to put it to some good use. It is clearly marked with the
GC logo. It has two large Ziplock bags that are stocked full of all
types of swag goodness for most ages and is family friendly. In our
caching adventures we've often found travel bugs too large for
ordinary containers. With this cache, quite possibly the LARGEST
CACHE IN HOLMES COUNTY, you'd be hard pressed to find a travel bug
or coin too large for this container. In the event that there is
one out there Kamila will be glad to keep an eye on it. Don't
forget to log your discovery of the high protector of the cache,
Kamila - The Cache Guardian, marked also with the GC logo. She
never leaves and is always present keeping a watchful eye on the
trunk of loot. This is one cache safe to leave any traveler on
their journey. You'll get the twisted sense of humor of this cache
name when you find it. This cache is only available from sunrise to
sunset. If you should find IMBALD and KATULE near the cache don't
hesitate to ring the bell and say hello. We've rated the terrain a
1.5 only because there are gaps in the blacktop in the area.
However, you can drive right up to it. Use the pictures as a guide
to be certain if you have any doubt at all. You can see Kamila or
Baldy - The Cache Guardians from the road 8627 Apt. 1 (CR
292).&lt;br/&gt;

And although we live in the city, we really don't like doing &quot;urban&quot; caches where there are muggles abound.  So this one was testing our muggle fears and once we got up to the vehicle and looked around, we realized this was NO PROBLEM!  

We took a seat on the driveway and had a blast going through the huge container of goodies. Thanks for the really unique, awesome cache.  We really enjoyed this one.

This one counts toward our first cache in Holmes Co. for the Great 88 Challenge!

Times when people loaded up the family sedan for family road trips seeking out various roadside oddities. Enjoy the remembrances you will find around this area. 

Due to obstructions in the cache location the coordinates lead you to within 10' of the actual container. All the hints you need are on this page.

Special thanks to the owners that have given us permission to hide this unusual container at their location. Please do exercise stealth in your attempt to gain access to this cache. This location can be quite busy at times which would reflect the difficulty level given to it. This cache is in fact the real thing and there are many opportunities to blend in obtaining this smile. DO NOT attempt this cache after dark.

It's also a location that holds several unusual sites that we've never seen. Tombstones with hands that are seen shaking each other and others yet pointing skyward. Most of the residents are long past with no recent additions.  Be respectful of this site and practice CITO when possible. Also, be careful on the drive to the cache as it is heavily populated with Amish. Just a headstones up, the cache is not located near any headstones or graves. You are looking for a regular sized, camo Lock N Lock container, hidden in some 'woods'. Re-hide the cache exactly as you found it. No bushwhacking is necessary.

Please note that there is no vehicle access into the cemetary by the archway. Park only on the side road or near the Amish 'phonebooth'.

When working here My duties included mowing the area and trimming. Something that sounds easy until you see the hillsides. Thus the reason for the cache name. Fortunately I never rolled a stone but I did come very close a few times. As a grounds keeper I got to know the residents in this area fairly well. So much so I noticed many famous names in the area. On your way out you might notice the famous Watson and Holmes on the right side of the driveway out, still at work solving the mysteries in this neighborhood. As mentioned is has both residents from the 1800's as well as present day. Please be respectful of the site and practice CITO when needed. Just a headstones up the cache is not located near any headstones. Re-hide the cache exactly as you found it. No bushwhacking is necessary.

You are looking for a 4&quot; round lock &amp; lock container.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located at the site of American Legion Post 551. On
site is a Viet Nam era helicopter and a M3 Light Stuart Tank. The
helicopter saw service in South Viet Nam in 1968-1971 with the 20th
Special Operations Squadron. It was flown to the USAF museum in
April, 1980. The M3 Light Stuart Tank an American lightweight tank
used in World War II. This particular tank's history is unknown
other than it was brought to Holmesville in the 1940's by railcar.
It was painted Red, White and Blue back in 1976 for the
Bicentennial but was changed back to the olive drab color. Having
it repainted is on a to-do list. If you know any Eagle scouts out
there that would like to tackle the job don't hesitate to contact
us. This area is of interest for us due to the aforementioned
equipment, this was placed as a remembrance to all the fighting men
and women of our country. In order to find this cache you will have
to perform a 'red light' violation and reach under the skirt of Old
Ironsides. Be nice, otherwise you might see the old gal 'unhinged'.
It is a small, magnetic, container under the track access skirt
between the center and end of the tank. This is a daylight only
cache. Please DO NOT climb on the tank or open the
helicopter.&lt;br/&gt;

It was quite a beautiful ride and we all enjoyed the fall colors while making our way south. We enjoyed the tank and helicopter here and took many photos of the area. It was pretty cool outside, so we tried to make the grabs in short order so we could get back in the warm car and head on to the next cache. TNLNSL. TFTC!!!</groundspeak:text>

Parking coordinates are listed below. The trailhead is across the road. Once across the road follow the wider trail to the right. The smaller trail probaly has some good fishing spots! This trail is one of Portage County's best kept secrets in my opinion. I have walked this and not come across a single person. Then on the day we placed this cache eight people walked by us. Cache is an ammo can hidden about 60 feet off the trail. Please do not post any spoilers or take any pieces of this cache. Bring your own pen.

Back before this area was settled it was part of the Western Reserve and was called Town 2, Range 9. One of the original settlers was from Brimfield, Massachusetts, and therefore renamed the 25 square mile region Brimfield. The township has suffered several annexations by surrounding cities and now is only about 19 square miles.
 
I am hoping this cache survives the activities that are held in this park. This could be a high muggle area, use caution

In an attempt to place more traditional size caches, here is a small camoed rubbermaid container with room for small items and travel bugs. The cache is located off Holiday Drive in Brimfield Township. There are several businesses back here, but there is plenty of room to pull off near the cache site. While in the area check out the other caches in the township.

Five cachers went on a cache run one day. They found a total of five caches. Each cacher was able to come up with a different find before the others in the group. They also used a different method of travel each time to get to the cache. Using the information provided, determine in what order they found each cache, what method they used to arrive at each cache, and which cacher came up with the find.
1. Mackie30 (who wasn’t the finder on the cache where they drove a car) didn’t find Peninsula Trail or Rainbow Falls. The cache they found fourth (which wasn’t Rainbow Falls) wasn’t found by eng78ine or mackie30.
2. The cacher who found Easter Basket (who was neither Golfer53 nor CassieAK47) didn’t find the fourth cache.
3. The cacher who found Peninsula Trail was the finder on either the cache where they rode bikes or the cache where they hiked. Mackie30 was not the finder of the cache where they rode horses (which was on the cache named Easter Basket).
4. The cache they found fifth (which was neither Town 2, Range 9 nor Rainbow Falls) is not the cache they rode bikes to get to.
5. Golfer53 did not find Peninsula Trail. The first cache was not found by eng78ine nor Golfer53. CassieAK47 did not find the cache where they rode bikes.
6. Eng78ine (who found the cache where they rode 4-wheelers) did not find Palm Road Cache nor Rainbow Falls. They did not drive a car to the cache they found second.
 
If the first cache was found by:
Eng78ine , then A=7
Ronin473, then A=1
Golfer53, the A=6
Mackie30, the A=5
Cassie AK47, then A=4

If the second cache was traveled to by
Car, then B=5
Bike, then B=7
Hiking, then B=4
4-Wheeler, then B=6
Horse, then B=9

If the third cache they found was
Town 2, Range 9, then C=9
Palm Road Cache, then C=4
Peninsula Trail, then C=1
Rainbow Falls, then C=2
Easter Basket, then C=3

If Town 2, Range 9 was found by
Eng78ine, the D=3
Ronin473, then D=1
Golfer53, then D=5
Mackie 30, then D=9
CassieAK47, then D=6

If the cache that they traveled to by horse was
Town 2, Range 9, the E=4
Palm Road Cache, then E=9
Peninsula Trail, then E=1
Rainbow Falls, then E=7
Easter Basket, then E=3

If the cache they traveled to by car was found
First, then F=7
Second, then F=2
Third, then F=6
Fourth, then F=1
Fifth, then F=8</groundspeak:long_description>

Tinha construído uma rota por 5 caches e tinha estado a resolver esta antes de sair de casa pois poderia ser a que estava mais perto do Oceanário, local onde ia deixar a mais pequenota para uma festa de aniversário.

Conclusão: apenas consegui fazer esta, depois de passar a tarde enfiado no centro comercial porque andar à chuva e ao vento não apetecia mesmo nada.

Felizmente que no final da tarde a chuva deu um pouco de tréguas e lá deu para procurar esta.

Hoje foi o nosso dia no Parque das Nações e já que andávamos por lá, claro que fizemos umas caches.

Depois de uma visita ao Pavilhão do Conhecimento e de resolvido o enigma ainda em Braga, hoje tínhamos de a fazer.

Foi interessante a procura e realmente está bem protegida.

This is my very first cache. I have been wanting to do one for a long time. It should be pretty simple to find for a quick cache &amp; dash. 
Parking is available in the development near by.

Your looking for a 35mm film canister. Please replace the cache exactly where you found it. Also make sure it is sealed to prevent it from getting wet.

This cache is also listed on www.geocaching.com. The GC# is GC1J9RF. It was placed on 11/19/2008.</groundspeak:long_description>

A cache, a pole, and a log.

This is a cache for when time is short, or it’s raining so hard you really don’t want to get out of the car.

I’ll add to the set as I find new spots. Happy Caching!

Stopped for this one and mommy and the kids hopped out while daddy was trying to figure out why something on the comp wasn't working right for him!

Guessing someone found it in the rain as it appeared to have been wet at some point.   the kids enjoyed the cemetery as usual.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

A cache, a pole, and a log.

This is a cache for when time is short, or it’s raining so hard you really don’t want to get out of the car.

I’ll add to the set as I find new spots. Happy Caching!

The cache is dedicated to all the Geocachers and Geochums that have helped me reconnect with my daughter. I have learned more about her thru geocaching than I thought possible. And for this you all have my sincere thanks.

I try to go and visit with my Dad every weekend. We enjoy just sitting and talking about what ever happens to come up. Sometimes we talk about the Cleveland Indians or the Cleveland Browns and sometimes we sit and talk about his great-grandchildren. Most times we just sit and talk about what ever happens to come up and watch the people as they go by headed to wherever it is they are going.

Today he asked how the Geocaching was coming along.  After we talked a while I asked him if he knew of a good spot to hide a cache.  Well, he thought awhile and then he thought some more. After about 30 minutes he said, “Hmm, follow me, I think I know where you could hide one, it’s just down the street and over a section”.

As I tagged along wondering where he could be going he stopped and said “This spot here looks like a good spot. I think you should hide it here.” I looked at the spot and the area and said looks good to me.

After that we went back to his place and sat down on the grass and just enjoyed each other’s company. Then he said he had to go for today, and said so long, see ya next weekend. As he left he turned and said, “If any Geocachers feel like stopping by and just sitting and talking their welcome to stop by and visit&quot;. You can find my Dad at 2718, section 31.

The elusive major milestone known as number 1,000.

When we all got hooked on geocaching we all wondered how the heck anyone finds 1,000 caches. We all look at our beginning totals and then at other cachers’ numbers and wonder, how long will it take us. Then before you know, we find that magic cache, number 1,000.

Callmeox started his journey to 1K on August 9th, 2005 when he found his first cache, “GCNCBY - The Lost Nation”. Then on July 22nd, 2007 he found number 1,000, “GCND95 - Don’t Wake ‘em in Wakeman”.

This cache has been placed to honor that milestone. The Geocacher is known to the Geocaching world as callmeox. To his Geochums he is known as Ox.

Congratulations callmeox!
Welcome to the NEOGeocachers 1K Class 11.

are quick, easy finds for lunch hours and days when it is just too
dang hot or yucky out. Hints are dead giveaways, so don't decrypt
unless you're really desperate.&lt;br/&gt;

A cache, a pole, and a log.

This is a cache for when time is short, or it’s raining so hard you really don’t want to get out of the car.

I’ll add to the set as I find new spots. Happy Caching!

Once upon a time this area was filled with homes and people living the American dream. They wanted to own a home and raise their children in a safe and quiet neighborhood.

The people that lived here did all the normal things that most people do. Their children played in their yards, they went to school, they grew up, got married, and raised children of their own. Soon there were generations of children playing in their yards and riding their bikes up and down the streets. There were barbeques going in the back yards and new birth’s and weddings were being celebrated here.

Then one day the city decided to extend the runways of the airport that was located a couple miles away. This expansion caused the airplanes to be so close to the homes when they were landing, that you could see the faces of the passengers and the pilots. The planes were so close that the noise was unbearable. The solution by the city was to buy all the homes and tear them down.

So in the name of progress, the people sold their homes to the city, packed up their belongings and moved away. And they took with them the memories of their life here. Those that have returned from time to time look around and see what once was and wonder what could have been.

Today all that is left are the streets, the empty yards, the driveway aprons, the old fire hydrants and a few trees. And there is something else that remains; the ghosts of times past.

After you find the cache take a moment to face into the wind that always blows here. Stand very, very still. Clear your mind of outside distractions. Listen to the wind that blows across the empty yards as it blows past your ears. As you stand quietly listening to the wind you might just be able to hear the sounds of children playing in the yards. The sounds of people grilling burgers and celebrating a high school graduation, or a wedding. The sounds of the dreams and hopes of families living the American dream.

Happy hunting!

I was out checking my caches and doing scheduled maintenance today. As I was headed home I got the urge to hide another cache.

While I was checking the coordinates it was getting dark and the fireworks started in the distance. The cache area turned out to be a great place to watch the show overhead. 

What a great way to celebrate the 4th of July, hiding a cache and watching fireworks at the same time. Happy hunting!

No room for trades or FTF gift as this is a log-only cache. Enjoy :)

Important note: When you find the cache, the bottom of the 'bison-styled' tube unscrews to reveal the log. Please replace this cache exactly as you find it, it is somewhat fragile, and needs to be replaced properly so the next cacher has the same experience in finding it.

Also, please note, the park hours as listed are from 6am-9pm at all times.

The barracks is located close enough to the Cleveland airport to be convenient and far enough away to allow you to pickup and drop off travel bugs without prying eyes watching you. There are large ziploc bags provided for the travel bugs to help keep them dry during their stay at the barracks. There is also a large ziploc bag provided for regular swap items. 

The closest parking location is at N 41° 25.491 W 081° 50.013. From the parking location you have about a 400-foot walk to the barracks.

As I was placing the cache I looked around and wondered, “Where have all the people gone?”

The streets are still here along with the storm drains, driveway aprons, and fire hydrants that stopped working after the city leveled this neighborhood.

When the city of Cleveland expanded the runways of nearby Cleveland Hopkins Airport the noise from the planes was to loud for the residents of this neighborhood. After many meetings with the residents the city bought all of the homes and leveled the area. The place has a strange feeling to it because there were once people living here.

Depending on how you approach the cache site you will have walked thru someones living room, their garage, their kitchen and perhaps even someone’s bedroom. 

Now all you’ll find is tall grass, a few trees, and the critters that now call this place home.

Happy hunting!

The planes were flying over about every 15 minutes this evening. It was getting dark as I worked at my task.  

As I worked the hair stood up on the back of my neck and the area became very quiet and still. I no longer heard the sound of the planes. The sound of the birds and other critters had also stopped. Then slowly I began to feel as if someone was watching me.

I slowly turned and saw an old woman standing behind me watching what I was doing. She looked to be about 70 years old and had a very peaceful expression on her face.

I said hello, and she asked me what I was doing. As I explained, she smiled and said “It’s so nice to have people coming back to the old neighborhood.” She said that she liked visiting with the new people in the neighborhood. She went on to explain that the house she lives in stands where we were talking.

I commented that there were no homes left here any longer, and she just smiled. She started to talk about the homes and families that live here. She talked of new babies being born, marriages and Christmas trees with presents around the tree. She talked of small children with the wonder of Christmas magic in their eyes. She talked about all the family events that had taken place and were taking place in her home. All the while she was always talking in the present tense, not the past.

We talked for what seemed like several hours. Toward the end I asked her how old she was since she remembered things that I had only read about. She answered that she was 178 years old. I smiled, and told her that she did not look older than 70 or 72. She smiled at me and thanked me.

I turned to finish placing the cache. When I turned back to finish talking to her she was gone. I looked across the empty field and did not see her anywhere. I looked in all the directions she could have gone and she was no where to be seen. 

As I looked for her the sound of the planes and the animals had returned. I realized that what seemed like hours passing by had only been a few minutes. As I walked back to the car thinking about what had happened I wondered, had she been a spirit that still lived here where her house once stood?

I had an odd feeling as I was walking back across the field to the car. I stopped and looked back where I was talking with her and I saw her standing there waving as if to say good-bye. Then she was gone again. It must be the evening twilight playing tricks on mind.

Happy hunting!

I came to the area again to do cache maintenance on the other caches. Today the noise from the planes was really loud. It seems the planes never stop here. The noise today was making my bones shake as they passed overhead. I can see why the people moved away.   

While I was here I decided to hide another cache to help fill out the area. As I looked for a good spot I noticed that it was starting to get very quiet as it got dark. I didn’t think much of it because I was paying more attention to what I was doing than listening to the planes flying overhead.

Off in the distance I thought I heard a group of small children playing hide and seek. I looked in the direction of the sound trying to see the children. Nothing. I figured they were far enough away, and went back to my task of hiding the new cache. It was getting harder to see what I was doing in the growing darkness and I had left my head lamp in the car.

The sound of the children seemed to be getting louder as it got darker. I knew sound carried more at night and passed it off as the sound drifting on the wind. I looked toward the sound, but I was still not able to see the children. They sounded very close. And the really odd thing is I didn‘t hear any planes.

I was almost finished placing the container.  I turned to pick up the log bag from the ground to place it in the container.  I was surprised to see one of the children, a young boy with blond hair wearing an old baseball cap, crouched down hiding from view of his friends that were trying to find him. He looked to be about eight years old. I said hello to him. Nothing. Maybe he didn’t here me? He must of heard me. He’s only two feet away. Again I said hello. Still nothing. I walked in front of him and bent over and looked at his face. I was right in front of him and it seemed as if he was looking right thru me. All the time the only sound he’s making is a soft giggling sound as he laughs at his friends that can’t seem to find him. Man oh man, this is really weird.

I looked in the direction of the sound his friends were making as they ran around searching for him. For a brief moment I could swear I saw five or six children running between houses, garages and around parked cars. That doesn’t make any sense, there’s nothing left here but an empty field. The houses and people have been gone for years. All the while the young boy is still crouched down and laughing softly.

Across the field one of the children called out “olly olly oxen free“. Next thing I know, the young boy stands up and starts to run toward his friends. Then he stops, looks directly at me and straight into my eyes. As he looked at me I felt as if he was looking into my soul.  He smiled at me and said “My name is Bobby, what’s yours?“ I told him my name and he said “Thank you for helping hide me from my friends.”  He turned back and ran toward his friends. As he went he looked back over his shoulder and waved good-bye. As I watched him go I started thinking that all this was just a little odd. As he ran across the field he seemed to vanish. I ran toward the area where he and his friends had been playing and there was nothing. I strained to see them, again nothing.

As the sound of the planes returned I realized that I had been here for two hours. I headed back to the car in the dark trying to make sense of it all. I passed it off as the night air playing tricks on my mind. When I reached the car I had an odd feeling. I turned and looked back toward where the children had been playing, and I thought I heard the sound of children laughing again. 

Then in the distance I heard  “ole ole oxen free.”

We'd DNF'd this one last fall when it was missing. Thanks to SuzyJazz for taking the time to replace it. Had to use my mountain climbing skills to get to it. If I'd have parked on the other side I wouldn't have had that problem. After signing the log we headed down the road for one more before heading for home. Thanks for the cache.

A cache, a pole, and a log.

This is a cache for when time is short, or it’s raining so hard you really don’t want to get out of the car.

I’ll add to the set as I find new spots. Happy Caching!

I was out checking on some of my caches today. With the seasons changing and the snow just around the corner, I wanted to be sure they were ready for the winter. After checking “The River of Alandale” cache I took some time to investigate the surrounding area in the Shire of Neogeo. And as luck would have it, I found a place for a cache.

Happy Hunting!

&lt;p&gt;I was out hunting for caches the other day and
came across a really wonderful monument to the Veterans of the
Armed Forces. I grew up in Cleveland just five miles away from here
and never knew that this wonderful monument was here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Linn founded the Village in 1902. The
Village is a nice quiet place that can make you believe that time
has kind of passed it by and left the Village untouched. When you
drive thru you will come to a place where time stands still and
allows you to sit and reflect. This place is the Village memorial
known as “The Peace Memorial”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memorial sits at the intersection of West
119th and Avenue of Peace. Avenue of Peace was
originally Peelor Avenue before the Village council changed the
name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the wall in the Memorial there is a plaque
that reads “In honor of those that have served in the Armed
Forces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes on to read, “The pursuit of peace and
freedom lies in the soul of all human kind… We honor those who have
given their time – especially those who gave their lives – so that
we all may partake of this glory we call peace.” Here you will find
a larger than life bronze soldier standing on a large block of
stone with the inscription “… Through Knowledge Peace…” You will
also find the flag of our country as well as the flags of all the
branches of our armed forces and a white wall bearing the words
across the top “Peace to Mankind”. On the wall you will find 115
names listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memorial stands as a testament that the
Vietnam War touched all of America, even here in a small Village
known as Linndale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take time to stay awhile and relax from
a day of caching and to step back to a simpler time. There is a
bench in the shade so you can sit and enjoy the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thanks to the Village Mayor who lives
across the street from the memorial for giving her permission and
support for the placement of this cache. The Village Police
Department and the Village Hall were also very supportive in the
placing of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOW IT ALL BEGAN:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday 7th of January 1966. The 1st Battalion
of the 28th Infantry, itself part of the 3rd Brigade of the 1st
Inft Div - &quot;The Big Red One&quot;- was engaged in operation &quot;Crimp&quot;. The
first search and destroy sweep into the VC held area's Northwest of
Saigon. Operation &quot;Crimp&quot; was intended to be a massive strike
against the VC in South Vietnam; in and around the Ho Bo woods just
west of the Iron triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just inside the tree line at the edge of a
rubber plantation, the men of the 28th discovered a large trench -
but no enemy. Where had they gone?  As the operation continued, over
the next couple of days foxholes, trenches, and caves were
discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day the 11th of January the 28th
began to retrace it's foot steps. It had finally dawned on the Batt
Commander LTC Robert Haldane what had happened - they had literally
walked right over the VC! Searches were begun for the tunnel
entrances but nothing much was discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A
SPECIAL BREED OF MAN:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally called &quot;Tunnel Runners&quot; by the 25th
Inft Div, and &quot;Ferrets&quot; by the Australian Army, the term &quot;Tunnel
Rat&quot; soon became their official accepted name. The US Army soon
realized that trying to destroy the tunnels was a short-sighted
policy that wasn't going to work. Moreover this was also a loss as
the underground networks could yield vital intelligence on the VC
in the form of plans and documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chemical officer of the 1st Inft Div, Capt
Herbert Thornton a Southerner, was charged with setting up the
first tunnel team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of man that Thornton sought for his
tunnel team had to be a special breed. He had to have an even
temperament, an inquisitive mind, a lot of common sense (in order
to know what to touch and what not to), and to be exceptionally
brave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Thornton's men were volunteers, most
(not all) were small men of slight build who could squeeze through
the tight trap doors and crawl along the narrow passages with
relative ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With their patch with it's nonsense Latin
motto &quot;&lt;i&gt;Non gratum anus rodentum&quot;&lt;/i&gt; - the tunnel rats
were among the bravest in Vietnam, doing a job that not many others
could, or would care to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonus question for extra credit is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does the Tunnel Rat motto &quot;&lt;i&gt;Non gratum
anus rodentum&quot;&lt;/i&gt; mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email me the answer and claim a second smiley.

It is much smaller than a film can. The cache is located inside the park. There is no need to climb any fences to find this cache. WHEN RETURNING THE CACHE TO IT'S HIDING SPOT PLEASE BE SURE IT IS COMPLETELY SEATED IN IT'S HIDING SPOT. You will need to bring a pen to sign the log.

The very elusive major milestone known as number 5,000.
When we all started this crazy sport/hobby we looked at our 10 or so finds, and we wondered, “How the heck does anyone find 1,000 caches let alone 5,000 caches?” And we think to our selves as our eyes glaze over, “Wow, 5,000 finds. Maybe one day in a time far, far away...” Then before you know it, that magic day arrives.

TeamDotOne
TeamDotOne started geocaching like the rest of us, trying something new to see what it was all about. And like the rest of us they became addicted to the sport of geocaching.

TeamDotOne and I met for the first time at a geocache named North Royaltrollton (GCQJBA) by SherwoodForest. Since that time they have become close friends. Along the way they have help me and many other Geocachers reach major milestones.

They started Geocaching on June 8th, 2006 finding their first cache Mohican Micro (GCP55W) the same day. They went on to find Number 1,000 - Orchard Beach Cemetery (GCPA5A) on August 4th 2007; Number 2,000 - King of the Rockers (GC14DYM) on April 26th 2008; Number 3,000 - Indiana Spirit Quest #428: Too Many Lambs (GCT054) on August 10th 2008; and Number 4,000 - Road to Salvation (GC11ZCF) on February 7th 2009.

On July 23rd 2009 at Midwest Geobash 2009 (GC1HKTM) when they signed the event logbook, they reached number 5,000.
During our friendship I have had the pleasure to cache with them in four states and on many, many long days. I have watched them on 24 hour cache runs where they left the house at 4am and did not return home till 4am the next day. I have watched them caching in sever thunder storms, driving rain storms, clouds of mosquitoes so thick it looked like a cloud of black smoke, and in the snow in the Allegheny Mountains of Pennsylvania. All the while laughing, telling really bad jokes and enjoying good times known only to Geocachers.

During this time we have gone from Geocachers that passed briefly on the trail to good friends that have shared many great memories.
The World Wide Geocaching Community know them as TeamDotOne. To their Geochums they are know as Michael and Maggie. And to a lucky few, they are known as friends.

Congratulations TeamDotOne!

It was a wonderful Saturday afternoon and I said to myself 'self lets go a looking for this cache today.' As I was approaching ground zero I heard some voices and thought to myself I wasn't the only one who had this idea. I peeked over, the edge there was Pantera829 holding on to a tree and Evilchic79 wading in the water. I thought to myself that this will be great now there were two more sets of eyes, for you can never have to many when working on a 5. 

As we searched, we were joined by the lady who lives on the other side of the creek. Very interesting woman. She didn't stay long but it was very eventful while she was there.

Some time had passed and still nothing. Did we want to give up ... maybe ... but did we ... no way. The search went on for over 2 hours for me and 3 the others, and then it happened! It was like seeing a falling star or your first lunar eclipse all you could do was just stare in awe. There it was in all its glory. Ah, the joy of the find. 

Nice to meet some fellow cacheres and as always thanks for the great hide.

We were called this after noon as MrDotOne was laying down about something that was needing to be found in the woods, and we were given the coordinates. So, MrDotOne dragged his butt off the couch and we got ready to go. When we got to the geocache location, there were plenty of muggles, but where the GPS took us, these were of no consequence. This one took us a bit to find, especially with MrDotOne being under the weather. But after some encouraging words from the CO we managed to make the fine grab and sign the log. TNLNSL. TFTC!!!

On another note, we just wanted to thank Geo-Sarge for the wonderful tribute cache and beautiful write-up on the cache page - sneaky sneaky - dont forget that The Merry Pranksters know where you live :) And payback is a b**** :) But again, thank you so much, it was very thoughtful and a wonderful thing to do, we really appreciated the thoughts!!

We are going to drop our 5K coin in here as well and leave it in here - should anyone want to discover it, please dont hesitate to hit us up at any coffee event :)</groundspeak:text>

8/17/08 - I (re)hid the final a &quot;few&quot; feet to a
new hiding spot. If you found it before come find it again and
claim a new smiley!
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This cache was originally placed by sealawyer98 and has been
adopted at his request by Geo-Sarge.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Coordinates for first stage of cache are located next to a parking
area. Once you find final coordinates...go the distance. The area
is a little soggy and muddy. There are ways to the cache that are
less muddy than others. However, less muddy routes are
longer.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Cache is short distance from bike path/jogging trail. Watch out for
bikers, joggers and dog walkers. They can easily spot you at the
cache location.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Walk quietly and keep your eyes open for deer. There are quite a
few that call this area home.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FIT3WM - If you hide it they will come&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">An easy, kid friendly, 2-part multi located at the Westlake
Recreation Center. Coordinates above will take you to a location
where you can find coordinates for cache. This is a small cache
with room for normal size TB's and trades.

This cache was originally placed by sealawyer98 and has been
adopted at his request by Geo-Sarge.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Once you park you will see why this cache is called Up and Over. If
it is snowing, bring your sled. In the summer, you can roll in the
grass all the way down to the bottom. The coordinates at the first
stage are clearly marked. &lt;b&gt;Please do not remove
&lt;u&gt;(or try to remove)&lt;/u&gt; the coordinates.&lt;/b&gt; They are
located at kid eye level and are &lt;b&gt;securely mounted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The area can be a little soggy and muddy. The final cache has been
moved deeper into the trees. Some bushwhacking may be required in
the spring/summer months. &lt;b&gt;Unfortunately, this
new final location may make it a little less kid
friendly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is also a short distance from bike path/jogging trail.
Watch out for bikers, joggers, dog walkers and people playing at
the top of the hill. They can easily spot you at the cache
location. &lt;b&gt;If there are a lot of people around
please use discretion and come back later.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Walk quietly and keep your eyes open for deer and rabbits. There
are quite a few other animals and birds that also call this area
home. While you are at the top of the hill, set your GPS to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=b1333907-290d-4964-a47b-f34971d4f617&quot;&gt;
If you hide it they will come&lt;/a&gt;. You can see the first stage to
this cache from here and it is a short walk to this other easy, kid
friendly, 2-part multi. Kids will also enjoy the super playground
located between these two caches. You can also see other nearby
caches from up here (see below).&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
An easy, kid friendly, 2-part multi located near our favorite
fishin' hole. Coordinates above will take you to a sign where you
can find information you will need to answer the questions below.
This is a small cache with room for small TB's and trades.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;When you approach the final please do not
disturb the nearby bird house. The cache &lt;u&gt;is not&lt;/u&gt; located in
the bird house.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Absolutely no
bushwhacking necessary.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Some amount of stealth is
required when the area is busy.&lt;/b&gt; Watch out for fisherman,
bikers, joggers and dog walkers. Walk quietly and keep your eyes
open for deer. There are quite a few that call this area home. If
you need a hint, ask the doe and two fawns that watched me hide the
cache!&lt;br/&gt;

Happy Mother's Day to Momma-Sarge and to all Moms everywhere!


Welcome back to Momma-Sarge's to hunt for her new cache. This is the fifth year that she has welcomed Geocachers to her home to hunt for the cache in her backyard.

Over the past four years she has welcomed Geocachers from far and wide as well as close to home. And this year is no different. She looks forward to providing a relaxing place for you to take a break from a day of caching and being able to leave with a smiley.

A Geocacher and fellow veteran known as “rnbroberts” found last years cache on April 23rd, 2011. His log describing his visit with Momma-Sarge will give you an idea of why everyone looks forward to the visit. His log is below:

April 23 by rnbroberts (212 found)

First I found Momma Sarge with some round-up... then I talked to her for 20 minutes or more... I had such an enjoyable conversation I kind of lost track of time. She told me about her fall and many other interesting tid bits. It made my day. She's an inspiration to anyone worried about growing old. I was hoping she would give me a hint about the cache to make it easy (I'm glad she didn't though), but no dice. She asked, &quot;so there's still a cache here?&quot; I replied, &quot;you dont' know where it is?&quot; She says, &quot;Oh I know where it is&quot; in a &quot;you'll have to find if for yourself&quot; kind of tone.

Geo-Sarge, thanks for sharing!


What rnbroberts didn't know is that Momma-Sarge celebrated her 90th birthday January 7th of this year. He is correct when he says “She's an inspiration to anyone worried about growing old.” She never stops surprising me each day.

When I tell her she should start to slow down just a little, her answer is always “ Sorry, I don't have time for that!”. Then she asks, “Have you turned the car around for me? I have places to go.” When I turn 90 I only hope I remember the lessons that she is teaching me about what it means to be 90.

Don't be afraid to knock on the door and say hello, Momma-Sarge loves to visit with Geocachers. And remember to let the kids out of the car to stretch their legs, both the two legged kind and the four legged ones as well. As always, you are free to park in the driveway while hunting for her cache.

Happy hunting everyone and enjoy your stay!

Remember everyone, no night caching on this one.

A cache, a pole, and a log.

This is a cache for when time is short, or it’s raining so hard you really don’t want to get out of the car.

I’ll add to the set as I find new spots. Happy Caching!

Please keep your log entries to a minimum. You will need to bring a pen with you to use when signing the log. Please be sure to replace the cache in the exact location where you found it.

I had a different cache in the same general area named “Tucked Away in a Corner”. The kids that play in the park found it and took it. I replaced the cache, and the very next day the replacement was missing. After much thought, I felt it was best to archive the cache.

Making the decision to archive “Tucked Away in a Corner” can only mean one thing. I did not do a good enough job when hiding the cache. Not wanting to be out done by the local kids I have hidden a new, smaller and hopefully harder to find cache. And in high muggle areas, smaller is always better.

The new cache is in a slightly different area, in a different type of container, and is small, very small.

The cache may be harder to hunt, if the ball field is being used. Because of this I have made the difficulty level a little higher than normal. Happy Hunting!

and head home for the evening - when we spotted something that

had to remedy :) You are looking for a magnetic key holder in a
typical urban spot. Please remember to place the log back into the
plastic zip lock baggy, so as to keep it dry for other cachers to
be able to sign.&lt;/p&gt;

This should be a pretty easy grab. I have driven past the cemetary for years and never knew it. I only noticed it was there when traffic was backed up and I was parked next to it. 
The cache is small enough for a log book only. No trade items please. Bring your own writing instrument to sign the log book.

This cache is also cross listed on www.geocaching.com. The GC# is GC1Z7D2. It was placed on 9/27/2009.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache was originally placed by sealawyer98 and has been

&lt;br/&gt;
Please BYOP for log. Room for small trades only. Stealth is
required but please take enough time to re-hide/conceal cache
before you leave. &lt;b&gt;The cache &lt;u&gt;IS NOT&lt;/u&gt; in
the green telephone pedestal (4&quot;x4&quot;x3' green metal box) located
next to the curb.&lt;/b&gt; You also do not need to go beyond the
tree line.&lt;br/&gt;

So why is this cache called BLS? The cache was located next to the
old K-Mart - home of the Blue Light Special. K-Mart has been
replaced but the cache is still there.</groundspeak:long_description>

tribute to the Hiders of Finds. Without them I would not have made
it to my 1,000th find. There is no need to climb any fences to find
the cache. Over time mother nature caused the original hiding spot
to fall apart. New hiding spot is still at the same coordinates.
You’re looking for a container slightly smaller than 35 mm film
canister. Please bring a pen to sign the log.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well the
day has finally arrived. On May 27th 2007 I found my 1,000th cache!
HooRah! This very rewarding and tiring journey has taken me 15
months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work second shift from 11 AM to 8
PM Monday thru Friday. This left me Saturday and Sunday and any
other day I was not at work. I used all my vacation time to hunt
caches. Even when the temperature was 20 degrees below zero I was
out hunting caches. Yep I have it bad. Some might say I’m even a
bit crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found my first cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=48fb8521-f466-4e6d-a679-51837434e9d2&amp;amp;log=y&quot;&gt;
“Not That There’s Anything Wrong With That!” (GCMA0Q)&lt;/a&gt; by Mitch
the Caching K9 on February 25th 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I came across a certain micro cache in the woods. After I
made five trips to find the cache, each an hour or more long and
still not finding it I did what any sane person would do. I took a
day off from work to do nothing but crawl around on my hands and
knees in the woods looking for a cache. As whistlen said “There is
a fine line between mental illness and a hobby!” I guess I must
have it bad, because after 10 hours of searching in 90 degree heat
on my day off I still could not find it. Sigh… The cache is named
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=00410926-f1e0-47ba-8f7f-aedfc1cf26d1&amp;amp;log=y&quot;&gt;
“NyukNyukNyuk” (GCVHXK)&lt;/a&gt; by Geojamie13. Yep, this one drove me
over the edge. And in the end after a total of 20 hours searching
and still coming up empty I needed her help to find it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I spent 12 hours trying to find another mini-micro cache named
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=b2eda5d5-14e9-4eb0-8953-f6e4936fa4b6&amp;amp;log=y&quot;&gt;
“No Clue for You - Suzy’s B-Day Cache”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=b2eda5d5-14e9-4eb0-8953-f6e4936fa4b6&amp;amp;log=y&quot;&gt;
(GCRDNJ)&lt;/a&gt; by Team EskimoZooKeeper. They saw my frustration and
gave me a hint. I even brought my Mom, now known to the caching
world as Momma-Sarge, SuzyJazz named her when she got to meet my
Mom during a cache hunt in my Mom’s back yard. And in the end, I
needed there help to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=77f32903-c2d9-4031-86fb-48efce5650b9&amp;amp;log=y&quot;&gt;
“Hollywood Park”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=77f32903-c2d9-4031-86fb-48efce5650b9&amp;amp;log=y&quot;&gt;
(GCJZQF)&lt;/a&gt; by SerenityNow. I searched for this micro for 10 hours
in the daylight on four different visits. Finally I returned in the
dark, in the rain and with a hint and found it in 20 minutes. For
some odd reason finding this was easier in the dark when I could
not see anything. And yes, this might make me certifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And who could forget my getting hauled into the Brooklyn Ohio
Court system because I chose to ignore a clearly posted off limits
area. All because I didn’t want to get my feet wet crossing a
stream while hunting  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=1472d926-c6e3-4868-a6b1-9b050993e5bb&amp;amp;log=y&quot;&gt;
“Our Way to The Kingdom” (GCR8FG)&lt;/a&gt; by SuzyJazz. I even had to go
out of my way to find the off limits area, which was nowhere near
the cache. Did I mention that at times I’m directionally
challenged? After all, it had the only way across the stream with
out getting my feet wet. When it was all said and done the
Magistrate told me “case dismissed, go home, please don’t ignore
the sign next time. And go out and buy a pair of boots.” Words of
wisdom to cache by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is my 1,000th cache. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=20f2de62-2a0f-4f41-8f84-3a517668f602&amp;amp;log=y&quot;&gt;
“Euclid Library” (GCY9M5)&lt;/a&gt; by Callmeox. The cache is hidden
somewhere on or around a very, very large piece of Army equipment.
Having spent 20 years in the Army this one started to get on my
nerves each time I failed to find the cache. It became a matter of
principle and pride to find this one because of it’s close ties to
my 20 year Army carrier. The forth visit there were 10 to 15 kids
all over the cache area. I made a fifth trip with the mind set that
I would not leave till I found the cache. After 20 minutes not only
did I find the cache, but the cache now has a special memory
attached to it. It is number 1,000!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Ah the memories. These are just a few of the really great moments I
have had during my 15-month journey to finding my 1,000th cache.
There are more memories than I have room to write about on the
cache page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not about the numbers even thought that’s what drives a
Geocacher to go out and hunt for caches. It’s really about the
journey. A friend of mine, Dreamin’Eagle, has a tag line on his
Geochums Forum signature. “Geocaching is a hobby, Geochums is a way
of life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These memories would not have been possible without “The
Hiders”. If they had not taken the time to hide the caches for me
to hunt, none of this would have been possible. They have become
friends and mentors. Thank you one and all. I hope to see you on
the trail!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Growing up and spending time in the neighborhood and at Clark
Field (also known as Tremont Valley Park), this has always been a
quiet place even with its proximity to the steel mills and heavy
industrial companies around the area. At one time, it used to be
over 50 acres of greenspace, but over the years it has now become
roughly 22 acres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The installation of Cleveland's first dog park has brought more
people here, and ball games fill the area during the summer. As we
placed these caches, there were puppies playing in the dog park, a
couple was walking the path with their dog, and some kids were
crawling the grassy area on their ATV's as their dad watched. With
the revitalization efforts going on, the new condos and renovations
of existing houses and buildings, the area is enjoying new life and
plans are made for future improvements and additions to the
park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please keep your searches confined to the park side of the fence
that surrounds Clark Field and remember that none of these caches
can be retrieved from the highway.&lt;/p&gt;

When you reach the cache site please read the plaque. I feel it's important to understand the meaning behind the memorial. 
The following information was provided by Wikipedia:

David Berger National Memorial honors the memory of David Mark Berger, a U.S. citizen who competed for Israel and was one of the eleven Israeli athletes killed in the &quot;Munich massacre&quot; at the 1972 Summer Olympics. Berger was a 28-year-old weightlifter. The memorial is dedicated to his memory and to the memory of the ten other athletes whose lives were taken.

The black steel sculpture, a design of broken Olympic rings, is meant to symbolize the interruption of the Munich games by the tragic events, and the eleven segments on which the rings rest represent each athlete whose life was taken.

Be careful during the summer months. Sometimes bees nest in the area. Use caution.

wondered why there were no caches planted in there yet. Well, we
highly recommend doing this one and its sister cache either in the
daytime or in a group but its located in a rather large and well
used park. Please do not attempt to do this cache from the Freeway
nor Rapid Transit that is nearby :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring your own pen to sign the log. No room for trades or
FTF gift as this is a log-only cache. Enjoy :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(and be careful because someone tried to insist that Lorain Road
is somehow magically a highway -- complete with crosswalks and
parking spots!!)&lt;/p&gt;

Field (also known as Tremont Valley Park), this has always been a

roughly 22 acres.&lt;/p&gt;

crawling the grassy area on their ATV's as their dad watched. With
the revitalization efforts going on, the new condos and renovations
of existing houses and buildings, the area is enjoying new life and

the cache will take you to what is known as St. Colman Parish on W
65th Street. St. Colman was founded in 1880 to serve the growing
Irish immigrant population of Cleveland's West Side. The original
Church was a modest house in Pear Street, which was the site of the
first St. Colman's Mass on July 25, 1880.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As written history has recorded it, the church was built &quot;in
1914, the present church building was begun and completed in 1918
under the second pastor, Msgr. James O'Leary. Msgr. O'Leary
traveled to Italy to buy marble for the interior and had it sent to
Dublin, commissioning sculptors there to carve the Baptismal Font,
Pulpit, and the Communion Rail. The alters, statues and the rest
were done in Italy. It was important to Msgr. O'Leary that some of
the work was done by Irish craftsman since, in the early part of
the 20th century, Irish immigrants like many other immigrants were
looked down upon.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is a medium size pill bottle large enough to hold a log and some small items. Please bring your own pencil or pen to sign the log book. The cache is black and waterproof. 
The following information about the park is from the City of Beachwood website:

Beachwood City Park
Open to all is Beachwood City Park, a passive recreation area located on the east and west ends of the Shaker Boulevard median.

Beachwood City Park West includes 1.6 miles of trails, consisting of 8-foot wide hard surface multi-purpose trails allowing for bicycling, walking, running and skating; 6-foot wide gravel trails for hiking; a sledding hill; two parking areas with 18 parking spaces each and an open-air shelter with room for 40 to 50 people, including a unisex bathroom and a drinking fountain.

A wood staircase provides access from the upper level near the 70-foot slope sledding hill to the lower central area of the park, adjacent to the gravel trails.

Wood boardwalks cross wet areas along the trail, and pedestrian entry points into the park are located at Richmond Road with new minor entry points across from Sulgrave Road on both East and West Shaker Boulevard.

Crosswalks are located at the minor entry points. Landscaping focuses on screening new parking areas from surrounding neighborhoods and beautifying the park entry areas at Richmond Road.

Beachwood City Park East features 1 mile of paved trails, benches and a parking area located on Shaker Blvd (east bound).

This cache is also listed on www.geocaching.com. The GC# is GC19P1F. It was placed on 2/25/2008.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of personal history in this area for MrsDotOne,
with my father's family and my mother's family both having settled
in the area. My grandfather once owned a little corner grocery
store on Professor, now long gone. My grandmother's house where my
siblings and I grew up is still there, changed with history and the
families that moved in after her, but the memories are as strong as
ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lincoln Park, formerly named Pelton Park, is a block of land
originally bought by Mr. John Jennings and Mrs. Thirza Pelton for
the campus of Cleveland University. When the university closed in
1853, the land continued to be used as a park. The name was changed
to Lincoln Park in honor of the Civil War encampment (this area
accommodated over 15,000 soldiers encamped at Camp Cleveland in
Tremont during the Civil War. It overlooks the Cuyahoga River), and
hospital located in the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Park hasn't changed much, but the Tremont area itself is
trying and somewhat succeeding at a revitalization effort. It has
become an eclectic area, combining the old and the new, and has
seen a surge in new housing as well as condos overlooking the
valley. Tremont is home to more churches than any other Cleveland
neighborhood; many of the churches were established in the 1800s
and continue to thrive today. The rich, ethnic heritage and period
architecture of these churches add to the unique history of Tremont
and its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing on the gazebo face south, and across the street from
the pool, you'll see the former Lincoln Park Baths. Now
condominiums, the Lincoln Park Baths opened in 1921. Designed to
emulate Roman baths with their Doric columns and raised fish
murals. The baths were built to serve a community whose housing
lacked modern plumbing. There were separate entrances for men and
women and the patrons paid between a penny and a nickel for the use
of the facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turn northeast and the building on the triangular corner is
Lemko Hall. The Lemkos, immigrants from Lemkovina, a Slavic area of
the Carpathian Mountains, established a social club in 1931, which
moved through various locations in Tremont before purchasing this
location which was a saloon and private residence. Lemko Hall was
the site of the wedding reception in the film, The Deer Hunter, and
in 1987, was converted to commercial space and condominiums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing west you'll see St. Augustine's Catholic Church which was
built from 1865 to 1870 and is an excellent example of Victorian
architecture. The church is now home to St. Augustine Roman
Catholic Church and is known for its Hunger Center and its
community outreach program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more stories and many places to explore. More
information on the historic Tremont area can be found at the
Restore Tremont
site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the park, enjoy the surrounding sites, and hopefully learn
a little tidbit of history about the area!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Your looking for a small lock-n-lock container. The cache
contains a Geo-Sarge Pathtag and a Geocoin that has not been
activated as First to Find prizes. The park is open from dawn to
dusk. Please bring a pen to sign the log.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache is dedicated to the service men, service women, and
veterans of the five branches of the United States Military. The
five branches of the military listed from oldest to youngest are
the US Army, US Navy, US Marine Corps, US Coast Guard and the US
Air Force. The questions below are listed by branch seniority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache is not at the above coordinates. The coordinates
listed are for the parking location.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find this cache you will need to answer six questions. The
first five questions ask the birth dates of the five branches of
the US Military. The sixth question asks the origin of one of the
branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 1 asks: “What is the birth date of the US Army? Below
the question are four dates to chose from, labeled a thru d, and
four possible answers labeled a thru d. If you believe the correct
answer to this question is “A”, substitute the number labeled &quot;A&quot;
for &quot;Q1&quot; in the final coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final Coordinates: N 41° 28.q1q2q3 W 081° 51.q4q5q6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 1 – What is the birth date of the US Army?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. January 2, 1775&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. March 22, 1775&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. June 14, 1775&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. December 30, 1775&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a = 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b = 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c = 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d = 9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 2 – What is the birth date of the US Navy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. February 12, 1775&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. April 5, 1775&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. July 4, 1775&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. October 13, 1775&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a = 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b = 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c = 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d = 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 3 – What is the birth date of the US Marine Corps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. February 15, 1775&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. November 10, 1775&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. January 15, 1776&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. April 29, 1776&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a = 9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b = 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c = 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d = 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 4 – What is the birth date of the US Coast Guard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. February 15, 1914&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. November 10, 1914&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. January 28, 1915&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. April 29, 1916&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a = 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b = 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c = 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d = 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 5 – What is the birth date of the US Air Force?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. September 18, 1947&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. March 10, 1948&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. July 15, 1948&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. October 29, 1948&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a = 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b = 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c = 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d = 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 6 – Which branch of the US Military was formed from the
ranks of the US Army?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. US Navy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. US Marine Corps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. US Coast Guard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. US Air Force&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a = 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b = 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c = 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d = 5&lt;/p&gt;

We managed to come up with the cache today and get out and get ready for the CITO event. Lots of misquitos out here and we were getting eaten alive, so we made out of there pretty quick.

the cache will take you to St. John Cantius Church on College
Avenue in the Tremont area. This Polish community Catholic church
still performs the mass in the native toungue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As written history has recorded it, &quot;from the Church of the
Annunciation, turn left and head three blocks to Professor. Turn
right and head back towards Lincoln Park. You'll pass a nice
assortment of galleries and restaurants on your way. After walking
about four blocks, you'll come to St. John Cantius on the right
hand side of the street. St. John Cantius Catholic Church, built in
1925, is the heart of Tremont's Polish community. Services are held
in Polish, English, and Spanish. The parish is also the site of the
neighborhood's Polish Festival, held each Labor Day weekend.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The elusive major milestone known as number 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we all got hooked on geocaching we all wondered how the
heck anyone finds 1,000 caches. We all look at our beginning totals
and then at other cachers’ numbers and wonder, how long will it
take us. Then before you know, we find that magic cache, number
1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He started his journey to 1K on December 05, 2007 when he found
his first loggable cache, “GCP7CD - Bored” in North Carolina with
his son. Then on April 13, 2009 he found number 1,000, “GC1BK0A -
Fort Hill&quot; in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He has been a good friend and a great competitor when it comes
to FTFs, he has been a real 'hound' and has beaten us a number of
times to the prize - and we've even shared a few FTFs together -
and its always a pleasure to be beaten to an FTF by winslpr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache has been placed to honor that milestone. The
Geocacher known to the Geocaching world as winslpr. To his Geochums
he is known as Paul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Congratulations
winslpr!!&lt;/h2&gt;

Unfortunately I don't remember any of the caches inparticular so I'm doing something I hate to do and hate to see other cachers do...copy and paste logs.  This is a first for us and hopefully we won't have to do it again.

We had a great time and other than the nasty security guard at the armored car place who said people were snooping around the building (I think he was lying because the cache was hidden several hundred yards away) and he was going have to call the police if we didn't tell the other cachers to stop...hey buddy, we were just turning around... things went smoothly for us. We did have a nice police officer question MommyTP and Mrs. uccacher about we were doing but he was good with it once the great-grandmother of the team explained it.

We found 30 of the 35 event caches along with several others during the event and four event caches afterwards. This was one of the several others.

We managed to make pretty easy work of this one. TNLNSL. TFTC!!

to reflect the location, since it is quite close to the road. This
is a relatively simply cache to locate, but the road does get very
busy at certain times. &lt;b&gt;Please use the pull-off that is provided
next to the cache and exercise caution
when exiting your vehicle to make the grab. This cache is not
available from the bridge, so do not attempt it from the bridge.
Please pull your vehicle off the roadway completely at the
designated pull-off.&lt;/b&gt; There is a side street named Trumbull
Avenue that is across from the cache for parking as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like to earn an extra smiley? Would you mind
performing an extra task while visiting this cache? Then by all
means, read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take any pictures while you are at this location, please
feel free to post any of them in another log and claim another
smiley. We would love to see your picture(s) of the Cleveland
skyline in the gallery. So have fun with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK1QD26 - Vista View Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 28.981 W 081° 39.948&lt;br/&gt;South end of bridge pull-off</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;As with most multi-caches, the posted coordinates are not for
the final location, they are for the first stage in the multi. This
is TaterTot's first multi-cache and she really enjoyed visiting all
the little pockets of playgrounds, benches and greenery. This
multi-cache has a slight twist that we hope you'll enjoy. Not only
do we give you the coordinates for each stage, but we even give you
the opportunity to log each stage for a smiley as well. We hope you
enjoy it!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multi-cache will take you around to some of the
lesser-known parks which are commonly referred to as 'pocket parks'
in the Lakewood area. The Lakewood Parks system consists of 15
dedicated parks and approximately 75 acres of “greenspace”. The
parks are categorized as either Community Parks (3 or more acres),
Neighborhood Parks (up to 3 acres), or Pocket Parks (less than 1
acre).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Each stage in this multi will take you to a loggable cache, so
that you can obtain a smiley for each stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Be sure to log each stage on this page in order to claim the
smiley for each Park you have visited in this multi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Additionally, each Park stage will contain a corresponding
number for the location of the final cache coordinates in the
following format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 41° 29.ParkRow,Webb,5&lt;br/&gt;
 W 081° 47.Edwards,Merl-Bunts,5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to find and log a smiley for the final stage, you must
complete all the Parks to collect all four corresponding numbers
and plug into the formula above. You can check your answers
   
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although you may be tempted or overly ambitious, we do not
recommend walking from one stage to the next as these 'pocket
parks' are scattered throughout the city, and are not necessarily
within easy walking distance of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never knew some of these parks even existed, so we're hoping
you'll enjoy discovering these small Pocket Parks as well, and take
a few moments to perhaps sit and relax before venturing off to the
next one! Please be respectful of each of the individual parks'
closing hours, which may or may not be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in the area please be sure to stop by and visit these
other fine pocket parks brought to you by Lakewood City Parks:&lt;/p&gt;

Edgewater Plant but not much is left of the original factory. Most
has been torn down to make way for Battery Park, a nice new housing
development on the city's west side. A portion of the building was
left for nostalgic purposes, which is better than nothing at all.
From the outside, this shell of a building doesn't look like much.
All machinery and fixtures have been completely removed from the
few rooms that remain, even the roof has been removed. What keeps
this building interesting is the huge smokestack and the incredible
basement that is full of small corridors and passages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historic Eveready Powerhouse, which is located on the
Battery Park premises, with its landmark smokestack, is currently
being renovated and converted into a new 5,000+/- square foot
restaurant, 2,200+/- square foot market/deli and 2,400+/- square
foot community meeting place and fitness center.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, December 29, 2009, the Plain Dealer runs the story
about the Broadway/Rockefeller Bridge to be Demolished. The PD
announced that the Rockefeller Bridge, closed since 2003, is slated
by RTA to be demolished. This bridge was constructed in 1929 as
part of the Cleveland Union Terminal (Terminal Tower) construction
project in the '20s and '30s as the Broadway Bridge. The
recently-replaced Adelbert Bridge beside CWRU was another old
C.U.T. concrete bridge that time has overtaken.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

namesake of this cache. The sign said, &quot;Biblical Proof of UFOs&quot;
Parking and so the cache was born. Now, we cant comment on the

'special' parking spot for someone who takes that rather seriously,

the cache will take you to Friendship Baptist Church on E 55th St
and Central Ave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As written history has recorded it, Tifereth Israel, also known
as the Temple, was established on 26 May 1850 and is Cleveland's
second-oldest existing Jewish congregation. Several members of
Anshe Chesed left that congregation in a dispute over religious
ritual and founded Tifereth Israel. Lehman and Schmitt was a
Cleveland architectural firm that designed many important public
and institutional buildings between 1884-1935. Lehman &amp; Schmitt
designed 2 large synagogues, Tifereth Israel in 1894 (later
Friendship Baptist Church) and the Euclid Ave. Temple (Anshe
Chesed) in 1912 (later Liberty Hill Baptist Church). The
congregation built a new facility on Ansel Road and East 105th
Street in 1924.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former Temple was sold and then used for the Friendship
Baptist Church congregation. There is not a lot of history
available when the building changed hands and the Friendship
Baptist Church took over the location.&lt;/p&gt;

Avenue. The church was originally started in 1915 in a remodeled
two-story apartment building. It wasn't until 1939 that the church
acquired the St. Anthony Church where it now resides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As written history has recorded it, St. Anthony's, the
first Italian parish in Ohio, was founded in 1886 to care for the
five or six hundred Italians living in Cleveland. The beginning of
the century saw an ever increasing Italian population attending St.
Anthony, and by 1903, the need for a new church had become
imperative. In September 1938, the parishes of St. Anthony and St.
Bridge were merged and It was later decided to abandon St.
Anthony's Church, and that building now houses St.
Maron's (Syrian) Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Here is a little history of the current site. The location of
the cache will take you to Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church on 30th
St and Euclid Avenue. This is actually the second oldest Lutheran
Church Missouri Synod (LCMS) in Ohio and was originally built and
dedicated on York Street in 1848. Due to the growing membership the
church eventually moved in 1856 from its simple and humble
beginnings. The original church was of simple design consisting of
a gabled roof and chimney in the back, not even a steeple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As written history has recorded it, &quot;with the vast numbers of
immigrants that came to America from Europe in those years, the
expanding membership made it necessary for a move in 1856 to
Bolivar &amp; Erie (now East 9th street). At this time a separate
school building was built for the dedication to Lutheran education,
and the church on York Street was moved to the newly purchased lot.
It was not until 1867 when a new church was dedicated which was
built on another lot in the same area of Bolivar &amp; Erie. Zion
made national history in America when it had a candle-lighted
Christmas tree, complete with ornaments, set up inside a public
house of worship. It was in 1851, and the tradition Reverend Henry
C. Schwan brought from Germany soon became widely accepted
throughout America. The present Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church
building located on Prospect Avenue &amp; East 30th street was
dedicated on May 3, 1903. The current sanctuary has a seating
capacity of about 1200. Zion Evangelical Lutheran Church was
designated an historic landmark in 1974, added to the National
Register of Historic Places in 1984.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

the cache will take you to Trinity Cathedral on Euclid and E 22nd
Street in what is known as the quadrangle neighborhood. The church
was built in 1901 and added to the National Register of Historic
Places in 1973. In 1890, Trinity Church was offered to Bishop
William A. Leonard as a cathedral to be maintained by the parish.
At the same time, a new building site was sought in a more central
but less commercial section of the city. Plans were begun for a
building at Euclid Avenue and East 22nd Street, with Charles F.
Schweinfurth of Cleveland as the architect. His plan eventually
evolved into the present English perpendicular Gothic structure,
begun in 1901 and consecrated September 24, 1907.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the Cathedral sits in the downtown quadrangle
neighborhood. The congregation is committed to the vision of the
cathedral as a center of worship, art, fine music, social service
and justice ministries and public gatherings for the diocese an the
entire urban area, as well as for our own congregation.&lt;/p&gt;

about 1891 and designed by architect, Sydney Badgley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although he designed single-family residences, apartment
buildings, libraries, and commercial structures he was mainly
recognized as a church architect. In Cleveland he was a member of
the Chamber of Commerce and the Civil Engineer's Club. He was a
firm believer in the union of Canada and the United States. In
Cleveland he designed numerous churches including St. Timothy
Missionary Baptist Church - 7101 Carnegie Avenue (1891), Pilgrim
Congregational Church (1893), Scranton Avenue Baptist Church
(1893), and St. John's Presbyterian Church on Murray Hill Road
(1893). He was also the architect of the Georgian Revival style
Jones Home for Children (1902) - 3518 W. 25th Street. From 1903 to
1913 he formed a partnership with William H. Nicklas. His buildings
are found throughout the United States and Canada. In 1907 he
visited Athens, Naples, Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan, Geneva,
Cologne, Berlin, Paris and the British Isles. While he was abroad
he made a special study of Old World Cathedrals. He was a member of
the Methodist Church. He died at his home at Springbrook Farm in
Willoughby in 1917 and was buried in Victoria Cemetery in St.
Catharines, Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;

Avenue. In 1835, construction was started for the &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt;
First Methodist Church building at the corner of St. Clair Avenue
and Wood Street (East 3rd). By the late 1860’s, the St. Clair
church building was deteriorating and the church decided to sell
the property and purchase a lot on the corner of Euclid and Erie
(East 9th) for the sum of $10,500. That lot today is part of the
Cleveland’s Gateway area near Jacob’s Field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As written history has recorded it, the church was built for &quot;At
the turn of the 20th century, Cleveland was the sixth largest city
in the nation and the subsequent growth of First Church allowed for
the church to buy its current lot on the corner of Sterling (East
30th) and Euclid Avenues for $52,500. In 1903, a prominent
Cleveland architect, J. Milton Dyer, was selected to design the new
church. Dyer is also well known for designing City Hall, the U.S.
Coast Guard Station at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, the
Cleveland Athletic Club, the Health Museum and the Warrensville
Workhouse. Construction of the church began in October, 1903, and
was completed 18 months later at a cost of $309,593. Today its
estimated value exceeds nine million dollars.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Catholic Church on Euclid Avenue. The church was dedicated in about
1916 and later demolished in 1975 except for the 130 foot-high bell
tower left on the site that can be seen today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As written history has recorded it, the church was built for &quot;an
upper-middle-class parish with many Irish communicants, St. Agnes
was noted for its modernized romanesque-style architecture.
Designed by architect John T. Comes, the oblong church was built of
Bedford stone with a facade featuring three round carved arches
with deeply recessed doors in the entryway and a large rose window
above. Faced with extensive repairs and a dwindling congregation,
in a controversial decision the diocese had the church demolished
in Nov. 1975. Many artifacts from St. Agnes were incorporated into
the decor of the Greenhouse Restaurant on Adelbert and Murray Hill
roads.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Although the tower is very interesting, I wasn't thrilled with the location of the hiding spot.  Seemed like a bit of a tough neighborhood to me.  I would have felt more comfortable searching in the plaza across the way.  Luckily Mrs. uccacher was along because once she got out of the Jeep and joined the search, she managed to make pretty quick work of this one and get us back on our way. TNLNSL.

corner of Euclid Avenue and E 40th Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As written history has recorded it, the church was built in the
midst of &quot;Millionaires' Row&quot; as it rose from its foundation in 1875
in East Cleveland. As Cleveland's population grew and moved
eastward, so did the congregation of St. Paul, who later moved to a
new and larger place of worship in Cleveland Heights in 1928. The
church was later put up for sale in 1930 and a new monastery was
built and St. Paul's was rededicated once again in 1931. St. Paul's
is a fine example of Victorian English Country Gothic architecture
following the popular asymmetrical style of the day. The sandstone
exterior boasts an octagonal tower supported by four minaret-type
buttresses. Two carved porticos protect the west and north
entrances with a separate chapel on the easter side. Inside, the
mahogany beamed ceiling rises above the nave and is supported by a
series of columns and Gothic arches decorated in gold leaf and
period colors.&lt;/p&gt;

A little background, from the Cleveland Agora website
&lt;p&gt; Henry LoConti Sr. opened the first Agora
on February 27, 1966 near the campus of Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland. His concept of promoting live
entertainment for young adults was an instant success, and
audiences outgrew both the building and the neighborhood almost
immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following year, a new Agora opened its doors adjacent to the
Cleveland State University campus. Henry never imagined that the
club would evolve into a major force in the international concert
scene and become the premiere Ohio concert venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years that followed, the Agora (which at one point
encompassed a chain of thirteen clubs nationwide), played a major
role in developing the music and entertainment industry in
Cleveland and the nation by booking thousands of local, national
and international groups to perform on Agora stages. The concept of
showcasing new and well-established artists confirmed the club's
leadership within the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agora booked its first national act, the Buckinghams, in
1968. For many years &quot;Sundays at the Agora&quot; showcased local
original music groups and popular regional bands, which kept the
club filled to capacity. The Pack, later known as Grand Funk
Railroad, The Outlaws, ZZ Top, Rainbow Canyon , James Gang, Glass
Harp, Foghat and The Rasberries all achieved national and
international prominence after getting their &quot;big break&quot; playing
the Cleveland Agora stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1968, the Cleveland Agora built the first in-house recording
studio, Agency Recording, to produce records, live broadcasts and
radio programs in stereo. Many of the Monday night concerts that
were recorded became live album releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1970, the Columbus Agora opened up across from the Ohio State
University . That year the Agora teamed up with WNCI-FM radio to
produce the first Agora live broadcast featuring Ted Nugent. Not
long after, the show was moved to WMMS, establishing what would
later be dubbed the WMMS – AGORA marriage by Radio Magazine.
In addition to the Agora radio network broadcasts, ABC's &quot;King
Biscuit Flower Hour&quot; also ran the Agora's live radio shows
nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 70's, The Agora expanded into a chain of 1000
seat clubs with outlets in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Tampa, Greater
Miami, Hartford and New Haven, Connecticut, and Akron, Painesville,
Toledo and Youngstown, Ohio. Agora Promotions put on an annual
series of outdoor music festivals for over 25 years at Legend
Valley (later known as Buckeye Lake Music Center ) near Columbus
that would draw as many as 55,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1975, the Agora started another radio program, titled the
&quot;New World of Jazz&quot;. This show was aired on over 50 stations in the
U.S. , Europe, South America, Asia and Australia .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agora could be experienced via television sets on Channel 8
in Cleveland in 1978. “Onstage at the Agora” featured
live concerts before MTV gave music lovers their visual fix. This
show would eventually air worldwide through syndication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fire at The Cleveland Agora on 24 th Street in late 1984
spurred the move to the current location at 5000 Euclid Ave the
following year. The Agora officially re-opened their doors in late
1985 and has been going strong ever since.

God on Euclid Avenue. The church was dedicated in about 1890 and
designed by architect, Sydney Badgley. And has been designated as a
Cleveland Landmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although he designed single-family residences, apartment
buildings, libraries, and commercial structures he was mainly
recognized as a church architect. In Cleveland he was a member of
the Chamber of Commerce and the Civil Engineer's Club. He was a
firm believer in the union of Canada and the United States. In
Cleveland he designed numerous churches including St. Timothy
Missionary Baptist Church - 7101 Carnegie Avenue (1891), Pilgrim
Congregational Church (1893), Scranton Avenue Baptist Church
(1893), and St. John's Presbyterian Church on Murray Hill Road
(1893). He was also the architect of the Georgian Revival style
Jones Home for Children (1902) - 3518 W. 25th Street. From 1903 to
1913 he formed a partnership with William H. Nicklas. His buildings
are found throughout the United States and Canada. In 1907 he
visited Athens, Naples, Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan, Geneva,
Cologne, Berlin, Paris and the British Isles. While he was abroad
he made a special study of Old World Cathedrals. He was a member of
the Methodist Church. He died at his home at Springbrook Farm in
Willoughby in 1917 and was buried in Victoria Cemetery in St.
Catharines, Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;

I drive through University Circle from time to time. Ever since the city complete the construction here I thought of placing some caches in the area. This cache will take you in the middle of things on Euclid Ave. 
This is not a hard cache to grab but you will need to use extra stealth on this one because the buses are always going by and drivers on both sides of you can see as well.

Please use caution while doing this cache. Use the crosswalk and always keep and eye out for traffic. Keep the kids and pets at home while you seek this one.

I love to come to Little Italy. This place has so much history and great food. I have been wanting to place a cache here for a while. I had a few extra minutes to stop buy and drop one off. Should be a pretty easy find. Please do not remove the cache from it's location. Only remove the cap on the cache. This way others can enjoy finding it in the same spot it was placed. Happy hunting.

The Captian was able to escape from Rockwood Prison in the dark of night. He had Navigatin' Shakira Hawkins help him when she was able to escape not long ago. 
He has chosen to lay low for now in a park. In the meantime the captain will enjoy the baseball gamesbeing played here. When the dust settles he will make his way to the buried treasure that is nearby.

When you visit the captain please his location a secret. Please replace it exactly where you found it. Watch out for muggles. He doesn't want to return to Rockwood.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The William G. Mather is
a retired 618 feet long, 62 feet wide Great Lakes freighter located
at the Great Lakes Science
Center. The Mather was built in 1925 and served as the flagship
for the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company - now Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.
The Great Lakes Science Center and the Mather are located between
Cleveland Browns Stadium and the the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. A
visit to the Mather is well worth the trip.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The following background on the Mather comes from
the William G.
Mather website:
&lt;p&gt;The Mather was built in Detroit by the Great
Lakes Engineering Works, River Rouge, Michigan in 1925 served as
Cleveland Cliff's flagship until the Edward B. Green (now the Kaye
E. Barker of the Interlake Steamship Company fleet) was built in
1952. The Mather remained an active part of the Cliffs's fleet
until the end of the 1980 navigation season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1985, Cleveland-Cliffs sold its two remaining
operating steamers to Rouge Steel Company, and gradually sold off
its idle vessels until only the Mather remained. In December, 1987,
the Steamship William G Mather was donated to The Great Lakes
Historical Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Society began preparations for the Mather's
new career as a museum ship. After she was brought to Cleveland in
October of 1988 and funding acquired from local foundations,
corporations, and individuals, restoration began. In October 1990,
she was moved to her berth at the East Ninth Street Pier on
Cleveland's North Coast Harbor, and work continued. On September
24, 2005 the Mather was moved to a new location just north of the
Great Lakes Science Center at Dock 32.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some old photos of the Mather at the
William G.
Mather Photo Gallery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waterfront area provides some great views of
the city's skyline and Lake Erie. There are some great photo
opportunities here. Please upload a photo or two.You can also watch
aircraft land and take off from nearby Burke Lakefront Airport. In
addition to the Science Center, Brown's Staduim and Rock Hall you
can walk to nearby Voinovich Bicentennial Park – home to a
local cruise line, skate board park, and site of a number of
festivals and events throughout the year. Out of town visitors can
skip the traffic by taking the RTA Waterfront Line from Tower City
and get off at the North Coast Station (Rock Hall).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I thought it would be interesting to see where the finders of this
cache reside. &lt;i&gt;Please include the state or
country where you live in your log so I can add it to the map
below.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

We parked in the nearby lot and walked to this one and the other nearby cache.  The wind was a little chilly but I won't complain because it could have been a lot worse.  Like the last three weekends we've been out caching for example.  Very impressive ship that seemed to be making a lot of noise.  I don't know if it was the ice melting around it, or water running nearby.  Mrs. uccacher came up with the well hidden container right away.  It was easy to search here since there was no one else around.  Rehid it as found and headed off for the other cache.  Thanks for the hide.</groundspeak:text>

This cache is located near the final resting place of Charles F. Brush. Brush High School in South Euclid was named after him. 
Charles Francis Brush was an American pioneer in the commercial development of electricity. His inventive genius ranked with an elite group of electric pioneers including Thomas A. Edison. Brush designed and developed an electric arc lighting system that was adopted throughout the United States and abroad during the 1880's. The arc light preceded Edison's incandescent light bulb in commercial use and was suited to applications where a bright light was needed, such as street lights and lighting in commercial and public buildings. A key element in Brush's arc lighting system was his dynamo (electric generator). The dynamo was the workhorse of the Central (power) Station, a concept developed independently by Brush and Edison, which eventually grew into the electric power generating industry.

I thought I saw the cache right away but looked around the area for a while waiting on a few muggles could clear out, turned out my first instincts were correct.  Nice spot for hide!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another fun find on a cache run to Cleveland on a sunny winter day.  We walked about 1.25 miles to grab this one and the Mathers cache and had a great time.  There is a lot to see here....or least there would have been if we hadn't been on a caching mission.  Does anyone actually park here?  $8.00 seems a little steep.  Then again, I don't like it when I have to pay a quarter.  The town I live in has no parking meters.  There was an attendant but as we walked through the &quot;gate&quot; he was walking toward the Science Center.  We passed him near there on our way back to the Jeep.  There were a few people here but not as many as I would have expected.  Spotted the cache pretty quickly and Tprints made the retrieval.  He gave me one of the several logs to sign and it seemed fine to me.  Thanks for placing the caches here so that we had a reason to come and visit.</groundspeak:text>

We were out running around doing a 'tour' of Cleveland with Team Guisinger, Bartholic, and Creekstompers after the GCE Swing for the Seats event in nearby Independence, and took a nice walk down to the lake and along the docks. We had quite an enjoyable time and grabbing a cache just was the icing on the cake. TNLNSL. TFTC!!!</groundspeak:text>

While I was out placing some caches I decided to grab some lunch and found a nice spot to hide this one. It should be a pretty easy park and grab. While your here grab some lunch nearby. 
15 years ago there used to be signs here stating that if your caught eating in your car you could get a ticket.

This should be an easy cache~n~dash. I was on my way home from dinner when I passing through Cleveland Heights. I saw a nice spot for a cache. 
Be careful of the patrons. This is a busy place on most days. Please replace the cache exactly where you found it. This will lower the chances it will get muggled.

Navigatin' Shakira Hawkins has escaped from Rock Wood State Prison. She was held captive for a while. She was able to use her navigation skills to slip out in the middle of the night by taking a horse from the stable and rode off into the darkness. Navigatin' Shakira Hawkins is now spending her time laying low so she doesn't have to return to Rock Wood. When you visit her please keep her location a secret so others will not know.

There is plenty of off street parking. Enjoy the walk next to the creek. There is a lot of deer and other wildlife nearby.

The cache is big enough to hold travel bugs and other small items. Though this is not a difficult cache to find the terrain can be a little rough at times when it's slippery. This is a nice cache-n-dash if your on a lunch break or just passing by.

The cache is a 35mm film canister hidden in this small park. I drive past it everyday and thought it could use a cache. During the summer many kids have a great time playing soccer on these fields. 
I remember back in 1991 when I was in high school I launced a model rocket 50 feet from where the cache is. It was a school project. The rocket took off but the wind took it away and I was not able to recover it. If you are into model rocketry it was a Estes Comanche 3. It was 41 inches tall and could fly over a half mile high. That was a cool toy I had back then.

As a side note my brother Terry built a Estes SR-71 blackbird. He tried to launch it at Mayfield High School and it blew up on the launch pad. He spent a week building it and it really looked good but in an instant it was in a thousand pieces.

From&lt;br/&gt;the parking lot you will head to N41 37.855 W081 24.113 and find a&lt;br/&gt;stairway. Go down the stairs after taking note of the sign at the&lt;br/&gt;top and follow your GPS from there. We suggest walking along the&lt;br/&gt;rocks down to the cliff, and along the cliff until just past the&lt;br/&gt;drain pipe to cross. &lt;b&gt;DO NOT attempt this geocache by cutting&lt;br/&gt;through the nursery east of the river. YOU WILL BE TRESPASSING in&lt;br/&gt;this area and robbing yourself of a nice walk.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're approaching our one year anniversary of geocaching. To&lt;br/&gt;commemerate this occasion, we're placing a cache where it all&lt;br/&gt;started. A little early, but who cares. ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were walking down along the river here sometime in late&lt;br/&gt;summer when I mentioned something called a geocache that I thought&lt;br/&gt;was in the area. I had heard of geocaching a year or so before, but&lt;br/&gt;never actually found one. Candace was interested, and two weeks&lt;br/&gt;later we had a GPS unit and found our first cache at Willoughby&lt;br/&gt;Revisited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see the current water level, you can check out &lt;br/&gt;This Website. We placed the cache when the stage was at 4ft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do not attempt this cache if the stage rises above 4 feet or&lt;br/&gt;during heavy rains!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recommend walking up the river a bit before crossing. You&lt;br/&gt;will find a wider more shallow area to cross this way. The water&lt;br/&gt;only went up to our knees at the deepest point, and during dry&lt;br/&gt;periods can only be mid-shin high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This area is popular for fishermen and other riverwalkers.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, you are seeking an ammo can.

We decided to head out and grab a few caches before heading home from the event. After a nice little hike to the pipe, we took our shoes off and prepared for the rest of the walk, LOL. Once in the final area we managed to make pretty quick work of this one and be on our way. On the way back, one of our team took a fall, but we think he hurt his pride more than anything else, and he managed to make it through the rest of the day. This one has been on our list of ToDo caches for so long, and its good to be able to have gotten this one done and off our list. A nice hike and a nice cache to boot!! TNLNSL.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When driving to this cache it will be easiest to park in the Mentor Civic Center parking lot on Munson Rd. Once parked enter the bike path near the basketball court. Most of this short hike will be along a paved bike trail that runs though the woods. You will want to turn off the path immediately after you get past the bridge that has a small stream below it.

If you are not from the area and would like a small walk after finding the cache continue along the bike trail and make a right when you get to Munson Rd. This will loop you back to your car if you parked in the Civic Center parking lot. If you are lucky you might see one of the deer that frequent the area.</groundspeak:long_description>

So after a pretty busy weekend, we decided to wrap up the long weekend by caching with some good friends, D-n-F and Geo-Sarge. We decided to grab some along the east side of our caching zone, which we have been reluctant to do lately, so the cache volume have been building up. And what a day to be out and about, lots to choose from, lots of walkers and park caching to have some fun. We made pretty quick work of this one and got back on the way. TNLNSL.

Of course they didn't but luckily there was a cache hidden here.  This type of hide is great for crappy weather like it was today.  Signed the log and headed back to Erie County to spend our money on a better camera at a more expensive store.  Thanks for the cche.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Rondeau Provincial Park is a nice area to visit, and offers canoe
rentals and a good sample of Carolinian forest. Since Rondeau is a
provincial park, this cache has been placed a couple kilometers
from the park. You can locate this geocache, then enjoy the beach
or continue down the road (head west) to the Provincial Park.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
One of the nice things about this place is the night sky - there is
not much light pollution here. Before hiding this cache, we laid
down on the beach for an hour or so and enjoyed the view. It was
fun to try and find the GPS Satellites by looking at the
constellation on our GPSr screen, and then training our eyes on the
night sky.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If caching during the daylight hours is more to your style, the
area does offer a nifty little beach where you can absorb the sun
or go for a swim - but there is no lifeguard here and Lake Erie
isn't the cleanest body of water around.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will have to access the cache from the beach. It will be more
difficult in the winter months when the stairs are icy. Please
don't try to approach this from the top, instead head to the stairs
at N 42° 22.281 / W081° 49.475 and walk along the beach. You should
be able to park on the shoulder of the road near the stairs. Don't
try to park in the private campground across the street
(Wildwood).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is a tupperware container and originally contained a
logbook, a bike repair kit, some cool figurines that appear
different depending on which way you look at them and a few other
odds and ends. As usual, there is a Tim Horton's gift certificate
for the First-to-Find. The bad news is that the nearest Tim
Horton's is some distance away -- in Ridgetown (N42° 26.902/W081°
52.465).
&lt;br/&gt;

The club was okay with the position but don't want to cause them issues either with their neighbour.</groundspeak:text>

Pictures of walking the line are very welcome but not required in order to claim this cache.

Safest and easiest place to park is at the Pottersburg Dog Park.

Nano so logbook extraction will require tweezers, also bring your own pen.

This could be a high muggle area so stealth is required. Lots of trails to explore in this area.

Please ensure when replacing the cache you do so the way you found it so as to not give away its location.

The coordinates were taken over two days at different times of the day with a four point averaging using my Garmin GPSMAP 62s.

Congratulations on FTF to Lifeguard1.
Congratulations on STF to globe23.

About 45 minutes she made the find and I was able to check on this cache to ensure it was still present, weathering nicely and waiting for discovery.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Dead Drops is an anonymous, offline, peer to peer file-sharing network in public space. Anyone can access a Dead Drop and everyone may install a Dead Drop in their neighborhood/city. A Dead Drop must be public accessible. A Dead Drop inside closed buildings or private places with limited or temporary access is not a Dead Drop. A real Dead Drop mounts as  read and writeable mass storage drive without any custom software. Dead Drops don’t need to be synced or connected to each other. Each Dead Drop is singular in its existence. A very beautiful Dead Drop shows only the metal sheath enclosed type-A USB plug and is cemented into walls.You would hardly notice it. Dead Drops don’t need any cables or wireless technology. Your knees on the ground or a dirty jacket on the wall is what it takes share files offline. A Dead Drop is a naked piece of passively powered Universal Serial Bus technology embedded into the city, the only true public space. In an era of growing clouds and fancy new devices without access to local files we need to rethink the freedom and distribution of data. The Dead Drops movement is on its way for change!

YOU WILL NEED A USB CABLE TO CONNECT A LAPTOP, TO LOG THIS A S A FIND YOU MUST CONNECT IT TO A COMPUTER AND ADD YOUR NAME IN THE TEXT FILE ON THE DRIVE. FEEL FREE TO DROP OTHER FILES ALSO.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Cache Spew ('spyü) series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
It is obvious that most cachers prefer the quick caches, whether
they be drivebys or perhaps only a 100m hike. If you like these
quick and easy caches, then you'll love this series. There are so
many caches out there now that you can pick and choose which caches
you want to find and just pass these caches by if they do not
appeal to you. But most people like them, so please respect their
decision to find these. Please bring your own pen\pencil to sign
the log. If you would like to Spew a Cache too and be part of this
series just place your cache, let me know and I will assign the
next sequential number in this series to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly...HAVE FUN!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOUNCY BUNNY is from
Ontario, CANADA. She is a RABBIT who even visited QUEBEC once. She
has many FRIENDS. Sometimes she likes to stay home, BUT THAT
doesn’t last long as she is always hoping to go out and hide
her next GEOCACHE. Kitty CAT who she HAD known for a long time is
her friend, as well as DUFUS DOG. You never know WHERE she is going
to hide a stash next.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bouncy Bunny Takes a Vacation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of the stress of designing new, interesting and unique
puzzles, Bouncy Bunny really needed a rest. She needed to get away
from the hustle and bustle of geocaching and find a place where she
could be by herself and just take some time off. She wanted to find
a place that was quiet, had some nice scenery and was set back in
nature. She considered heading off to Europe, as she had never been
there before. In fact she hasn’t ever been outside of
Ontario, well except for those few days where she got lost and
accidentally wound up in Quebec. She was so lost in Quebec and
didn’t speak the language at all. She thought everyone in
Quebec spoke English just like the rest of Canada, but she was very
wrong. Even the other rabbits in Quebec ignored her, as they looked
down on the English speaking bunnies. So as soon as she figured out
where she was, she hopped onto a box car and left Quebec as fast as
she could to return to her home in the Greater Toronto Area where
she knew that others would respect her more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now how could a rabbit find her way to getting to Europe? She
heard that the Black Forest (Schwarzwald) in South Eastern Germany
was very nice. Yes she definitely wanted to visit that area. Well
she was in luck, she had gotten a call from her old childhood
friends Kitty Cat and Dufus Dog. Guess who were heading to Europe
with their masters? However, Bouncy Bunny was a rabbit and she knew
she could never get onto a plane on her own. Her friends wanted to
help her, so they came up with a great idea. They made her a cat
costume. She looked just like a cat in it…well maybe a
strange looking cat. Meow she said, or at least tried to when they
were being checked in at the airport, but it fooled them enough and
she got onto the plane. Once in Europe, she stashed her costume,
said bye to her friends, and headed off on her own for a few weeks,
until they had to return back home to Canada. She had better not
miss the plane. It was a long ways off to the Black Forest where
she wanted to go. But she was a rabbit and could travel quite a
distance with her powerful hind legs. Boy what a crazy place
Germany was. Bouncy Bunny did not feel safe at all when she had to
cross the many winding roads and even worse, the autobahn where
cars drove like crazy, especially all those Mercedes, BMWs and
Audis. She had a couple close calls with death, but luckily made it
to her destination. She felt rather lost in the forest and was
getting a bit thirsty. She found a nice refreshing spring where she
cooled off and knew this was the place where she would spend the
next couple of weeks until she had to meet her friends back at the
airport. This was a nice place and even the people in the area all
seemed very nice. No one bothered her as she nibbled at the plants
around “her” little pool of water. It was like it was
her own little paradise. The perfect place she needed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing she was curious about was that she was in such a
remote area, but yet every day it was always different people that
came to her nice little pool of water. Some of them even fed her
some veggies. She liked the carrots the best of course. Eventually
she figured out that this was a natural spring coming out of the
ground. She followed this spring for many kilometers until it
reached the Donau (Danube) river and then realized that she had
discovered the source of the Donau and named her little pool of
water the Donauquelle. A couple more days at her Donauquelle and
then back to the airport she went where she met up with her friends
again, dressed back up in her cat costume and headed back home to
Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving home however, she was very tired, probably due to
the long plane flight and all the hundreds of kms she traveled by
foot. She felt like she needed another vacation, to recover from
her vacation. Of course, even while on vacation, she still came up
with many new and wonderful ideas for puzzles, but she just has to
find some new places to hide her future stashes now. I’m sure
she will find them.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Located on top of Silver Peak in Killarney Provincial Park, it
is the 3rd highest mountain in Ontario (with an elevation of 539
meters) with awesome panoramic views that extend all the way to
Georgian Bay.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; From Bell Lake access point you are looking at about an hour canoe
paddle and then about another 2 hour hike, with the last 1-1.5 km
being up a steep and sometimes slippery trail to the top. During
this last portion of the hike you will be walking past the several
waterfalls. You can also hike in along the entire trail, but it is
about 20km to hike each way, starting at George Lake access point.
I also recommend that you get a map of the lakes and trails so you
can find your way, as it is not always obvious were the access
points may be or which trail to take. Silver Peak is made up of
mostly white quartz. The hike up to Silver Peak is not recommended
for children under 8 or for those that do not have good physical
endurance.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please make sure you put the cache back exactly where you found
it and make sure it is entirely covered. It is within a few meters
of the peak. Take the time to enjoy the view and walk the mountain
tops. Don't forget your camera!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be a very high traffic area, so please be discrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is hidden UNDER the large boulder at the very peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the hiding spot should be obvious, if you can't find it
and suspect the cache is missing, feel free to save me a trip and
put a replacement there under the large boulder...thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">14:35 This was one of the target caches for the Killarney trip.  We had heavy rain very early in the morning and were worried that we'd get more of the same going to the cache.  Fortunately by the time we put the canoes in the water it let up.  We had fun paddling in the mist to the take out point, or what we thought was the take out point.  After crossing a stream over a log jam we realized we weren't in the right spot and didn't want to add a kilometer or two of hiking through dense bush.  We got back to the canoes and made a short paddle to the correct take out point.

The first part of the hike was fairly easy with only a few muddy spots.  Once we got the the trail that heads to the peak things go a little more challenging.  The steep trail with slippery rocks made for a difficult ascent.  Getting to the top was a nice accomplishment but we didn't get the view we were hoping for.  We had lunch up on the peak and started heading back when the wind picked up and the temperature dropped a bit.

I'll have to come back in a few years and see if I can catch a better view.</groundspeak:text>

This ones for you!

As your heading North on 144 you will see a logging road on your left just before you are parallel to the cache. Take this road and stay to your left. It will fork again later on but stay to your left. You should be able to make the drive in two wheel drive but if you have an ATV why not use it!
In the cache there are three un-activated geocoins that you may activate and send on their way or just keep them as part of a collection.
The cache is hidden well and would not be surprised if it is already grown into place. 
I used 3 different units and the co-ords. Got me within 4m each time.
Please make sure to wear a lot of orange during Hunting season.

My hopes in placing this one is to get Alphabet up to this beauty of an area on a caching adventure.
There is camping a few km up the road in a Provincial park if needed.

THE ALPHABET CHALLENGE
If SXRXNRR does get up to do this cache as well as my other one that is a few hundred meters away, ( The Ham-sters cache) and can prove he has done them within 30 days of this being listed via photos, I’ll buy him a case of his favorite reasonably priced Ale!

The others thought the snow would make this a DNF but I wasn't going to give up that easy.</groundspeak:text>

After the Maple Mountain event last year, we were nightcaching along #144, and had driven into this cache in the dark, but somehow had forgotten to log it online....
