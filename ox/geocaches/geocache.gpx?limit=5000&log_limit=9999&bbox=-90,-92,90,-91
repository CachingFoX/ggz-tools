It is recommended for children age 2-12 years of age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a very simple cache for the young children to locate. It is a large locked toolbox chained to the tree. The coordinates go to the keys (there are two in the same container) one unlocks the chain on the tree and the other opens the box. Feel free to sit at the table and sort through the contents. These contents range from books to baby toys and a Mr. Potatohead set to action figures and cars to mini barbies and a cabbage patch kid. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there is a trackable, and there is, please trade equally (trackable for a trackable).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our daughters enjoy geocaching, but really love it when they find a GREAT cache. They want every kid to be able to find a GREAT cache worthy to talk about. Here is that cache for every kid. Young or old enjoy this cache, but remember have fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our daughters will be maintaining this box with our help. Feel free to let us know what you think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have my permission to enter my yard. It is in our own front yard so please no one before 6 AM after 9 PM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would like for any cacher to know that this cache is wheelchair-accessible and I am adding this attribute to my cache description to show this cache is truly a Level 1 terrain.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The date is 1811.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    The beginning of the flood of settlers with
the opening of the “Southwest Trail” also known as the Military
Road.  It was started with the French in 1765 to link the
French settlements together.  Many pioneers traveled this
route including Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett,   and
others.  The historical route is mostly paralleled with
Highway 167. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    1811 is also the date of one of the most
powerful earthquakes to hit the United States, the New Madrid
earthquake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    Roads are the precursors of civilization, and
nothing is more interesting to the student of local history than
the effect they have had on the settlement and development of the
country. This is particularly true of Northeast Arkansas. Most of
the early roads had their beginnings in Indian trails. The Indians
were a roving people who moved from one part of the country to
another in quest of the best hunting grounds or on missions of war.
In their travels they followed certain favorable routes and thus
made trails by marching single file. These trails were also
sometimes used by wild animals, such as deer, bears, and buffaloes.
So in time, these trails became quite clear, even worn in places·
The routes of the trails were along the most favorable terrain,
which was along the ridges between the streams and over the lower
parts of the ridges they had to cross. They kept back from the
lower courses of the larger streams in order to have better
crossings on them, which they had to wade, swim or cross on the
trunks of fallen trees. In the lowlands, the trails were located on
the higher ground to avoid the sloughs and slashes. Of course all
the trails were more or less for dry weather use· Over these trails
the Indians made long journeys marching single file, and by them
built their campfires at night, or maybe located their villages.
When the white settlers came, they found the Indian trails the best
routes of travel, and they made them into wagon road by cutting out
underbrush and removing the logs.&lt;br /&gt;
    The road which was most important to Northeast
Arkansas was the road commonly called the Military road. It was
first opened into Arkansas soon after 1803, by Hix's Ferry across
Current River, aptly called the &quot;Northern Gateway to Arkansas&quot;, at
the northeast corner of what is now Randolph county. The route of
the road was an old Indian trail, called by the whites the
Southwest Trail. It extended southwest from the Illinois country to
Texas and Mexico. It was trod by many moccasined foot before white
men ever saw it. Through Arkansas it ran along the foothills of the
Ozarks and Ouachita Mountains, far enough up the streams which run
down from the highlands to give good crossings on the streams and
the ridges between them. The route would be suitable for a modern
highway. In fact, highway No. 67 parallels it clear through the
state. The old trail was first converted into a wagon road from
Ste. Genevieve and Potosi, Missouri, and on into Arkansas about
1803. William Hix is said to have opened his ferry across Current
river at that time, and immigrants began to come in, a trickle at
first and then a rushing stream to the region soon to become the
big county of Lawrence, first in Missouri territory and a little
later in Arkansas territory. The road was extended through the
state about 1810. The territory now in Randolph, Lawrence, Sharp
and Independence counties being a fair country and closest to the
route got most of the immigrants for awhile, but soon the stream
overflowed into other parts of the state.&lt;br /&gt;
Not much of it now remains, but it was very important for the first
fifty or seventy-five years after its opening. It passed through
this county by way of Maynard and Jackson, then in Lawrence county,
crossed Spring River at or near the Miller ford, went by Denton and
Lynn, crossed Strawberry river about a mile and a half below the
Lynn-Strawberry bridge, and a short distance west of Saffell to its
crossing on White River not far from Newark.&lt;br /&gt;

Thus, to this day, the lovely waters of Camp Mihaska’s Blue Spring flow endlessly just as true love lives on eternally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Cache is part of a project to teach leaders the &quot;art&quot; and FUN of GeoCaching and is also a part of Outdoor Ventures.

I sent out an invite on facebook and the free list. SWASeeker, Atomic Goats Breath, and for part of the day How-D went with. It was a good crew and we were able to knock out a lot of cache in the greater Troy, MO area. At the end of the day, we all had a different total find count, some of us had already found various area caches. Thanks Ed for all the caches! We had a lot of fun walking around the farm and picking up caches. it was a nice break from the P&amp;Gs, TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

I sent out an invite on facebook and the free list. SWASeeker, Atomic Goats Breath, and for part of the day How-D went with. It was a good crew and we were able to knock out a lot of cache in the greater Troy, MO area. At the end of the day, we all had a different total find count, some of us had already found various area caches. Thanks Ed for all the caches! We had a lot of fun walking around the farm and picking up caches. it was a nice break from the P&amp;Gs, TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

While I was here I decided that this was a great location for a cache. This is a must do cache for anyone that wants to get away from the park and grabs. If you choose to kayak out to the island it is a wonderful adventure in itself. Thanks for visiting my cache, enjoy the adventure.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is located along the Salt River and Crooked Creek on
Army Corps of Engineer property. Permission for the cache has been
granted by Allen Mehrer.&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This cache will take you to an area called &quot;The Narrows.&quot; This is
the result of 2 awesome water forces, Crooked Creek on one side and
the Salt River on the other putting pressure on a hill side that
has, over time, eaten away at the limestone to force a once large
hill into a narrow strip of land high above both river and creek.
The views from up here are spectacular as is the hike along the
way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will encounter a nice waterfall along the way and some really
neat wildlife. There is some heavy bushwhacking in the summer time
but not too bad after leaf off. If you follow the boundaries going
in to the old road along the ridge, it makes it easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here is the route I took along the way....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I parked at N39 34.915 - W091 56.383. Do not block the gate! There
is also parking on the other side of the creek as well. Enter in
the gate next to the parking coords I gave you. If you park on the
other side of the creek, you MUST cross the bridge and start at the
coords I parked at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There is one area by the waterfall where you have a steep descent
and ascent to the other side. DO NOT CROSS ONTO PRIVATE PROPERTY!
In the waypoints, I have detailed the boundary of that
descent/ascent. It is not too difficult but not recommended for
small children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The cache itself is a large pill container with a log. It can hold
small trinkets but do not leave travel bugs or coins unless you
want them to sit here for an extended period of time. Because of
the high terrain rating, I doubt that too many visitors will be
here during any given year. Please keep it tied to the log and
replace as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Make sure you visit the nearby Earthcache on top of the Narrows. It
is an awesome view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;BM1KZ58 - Benchmark&lt;br /&gt;N 39° 35.041 W 091° 55.874&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BN1KZ58 - Boundary Marker before Descent / Ascent&lt;br /&gt;N 39° 35.234 W 091° 55.701&lt;br /&gt;This is the boundary marker where you will plan your descent and ascent into the creek below. You have to cross to the other side but don't miss the waterfall!&lt;br /&gt;O21KZ58 - Turn down old road&lt;br /&gt;N 39° 35.226 W 091° 55.541&lt;br /&gt;Turn down the old road and enjoy the views!&lt;br /&gt;PK1KZ58 - GC1KZ58 Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 39° 34.915 W 091° 56.383&lt;br /&gt;Where I parked and where you should enter the property&lt;br /&gt;S11KZ58 - 1st Uphill&lt;br /&gt;N 39° 35.012 W 091° 56.138&lt;br /&gt;1st Uphill Encounter&lt;br /&gt;SP1KZ58 - Spur to Trail&lt;br /&gt;N 39° 35.035 W 091° 56.019&lt;br /&gt;Spur that will take you to the are you need to cross.&lt;br /&gt;WF1KZ58 - Waterfall&lt;br /&gt;N 39° 35.210 W 091° 55.670&lt;br /&gt;A nice waterfall.

If we would have parked in the parking spot to the North, we would have saved time and walking through the swamp! We signed the log and moved onto the nearby earthcache.

This was also my 500th career find and the first 4.5 terrain cache that I have ever found. I still think that some of the 4.5 are harder then allot of the 5 that require a boat... I got a little lost on my way up, and I wound up going up the slope that faces the creek, it was allot steeper then the route you have on your map. Snapped a few photos at the top and then logged the earth cache. This made for a very enjoyable day after a bunch of park and grabs around the lake. Thank you for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 1838 over 850 Potawatomi Indian people were rounded
up and marched at gunpoint from their Indiana homeland. Many walked
the 660 mile distance, which took two months. More than 40 died,
mostly children, of typhoid fever and the stress of the forced
removal. Their young priest, Rev. Benjamin M. Petit, S.J., also
became ill on the trail and died at the Jesuit seminary in St Louis
on February 10, 1839.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A third Trail of Death Commemorative Caravan traveled the route of
the Trail of Death beginning September 21, 1998 at the Fulton
County Historical Society museum four miles north of Rochester,
Indiana on U.S. 31. Participants crossed Indiana, Illinois,
Missouri and arrived at Osawatomie, Kansas, where the Trail of
Death ended, on September 30. The Caravan visited most of the Trail
of Death campsites. Many of the historical markers erected in 1997
and 1998 were dedicated as the Caravan passed. The group also
visited Mound City and St. Marys, Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Trail of Death has been declared a Regional Historic Trail
through the efforts of the group that made the 1993 Commemorative
Caravan. The required legislation was passed with the help of the
four state historical societies and the state legislatures through
which the trail passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a marker commemorating this historic event. However, this
marker is taken from a journal and it took 4 of us, more than 3
days, to try and figure out what they were saying. Finally, some
internet research made it clear. I have included the text below.
However, read the plaque first and see if it make sense to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Only read this &lt;b&gt;AFTER&lt;/b&gt; you read the plaque!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Saturday 13th Oct. [Traveled 17 miles from See’s Creek to Old
Clinton, Missouri.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This morning as we were about to leave our encampment, a number of
the Indians headed by the chief Ash-kum came up to Headquarters and
requested an interview with the Conductor and Gen. Morgan. Ask-kum
arose and in a short talk informed the Conductor that the Indians
were unwilling that Gen. Morgan whom they had been taught to
recognize as principal in the emigration should leave them. They
felt, he continued, that Gen. Morgan was near to them as a
protector - he had made them pledges upon which they depended, and
the fulfillment of which induced them in part to consent to their
emigration. The Indians also requested thro’ Ask-kum liberty to
travel less and remain longer in camp. Judge Polke answered. He
informed that Gen. Morgan had voluntarily offered his resignation,
and that he [Polke] had been appointed to conduct them to their new
homes, with the consent of Gen. M. etc. etc. Gen. Morgan also
responded and returned his thanks to the Indians for the interest
which they manifested in his welfare. The chief I-o-weh dissented
in strong terms from the sentiments expressed by Ash-kum. He stated
that these men (alluding to Ash-kum and his associates) were not
chiefs - that they were not entitled to respect as such. He wished
that Judge Polke should conduct them to their new homes, and Gen.
Morgan should return [to Indiana]. He was contented with the
officers remaining with the emigration. The emigration left at 9
o’clock. Gen Morgan having previously departed. The day was very
windy and the dust exceedingly afflicting. At 3 o’clock we arrived
in camp at Clinton, a distance of 17 miles from See's Creek.
Tomorrow we shall stay in camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(Amaziah Morgan was mentioned in Polke's letters as a heavy
drinker. Apparently he had lied to the Indians and said he was in
charge, and made promises to them that he had not the power to
keep.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sunday, 14th Oct. [North Fork of the Salt River at Old Clinton,
Missouri.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Today according to a promise made the chiefs a few days ago, we
remained in camp. The Indians attended service during the day, and
seemed quite to enjoy themselves. In the evening the chiefs
Ash-kum, I-o-weh and others, along with a number of the Indians,
assembled at Head Quarters, and shook hands for a talk. They came,
I-o-weh said, to demand the dismissal or suspension of Dr.
Jerolaman, the physician for the emigration, whom they had ceased
to like, and did not wish him longer to accompany the emigration.
Judge Polke answered and informed them that their request was one
of so much importance and so unusual in emigrations, that he hoped
he might be allowed time not only to decide himself but to counsel
with his officers. The Indians then retired, with the understanding
that an answer would be given them tomorrow evening.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It has picnic areas, pavilions, parking and a cool looking pump house. Cache is located by the pump house. There is parking close by but the terrain might be a little difficult for strollers or wheelchairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[B]There is no need to mess with anything at the Pump House![/B]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be looking for a container slightly smaller than a 35mm film can.

In the area for MOGA 2009 this weekend. After taking a trip to the nearest Walmart; CribbageWitch and I decided to try for some quicker caches to start with since we had not brought along warm enough cloths for the weather as it was trying to be...cold! 

This one was a must since we came by before to find it and had a DNF.  Turns out it must have been Laughing at us since it apparently was there all along.  Finally CribbageWitch took another look from a different angle and it waved a big Hello to her.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Inscription-South Side of Monument&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Consecrated A.D. 1867 by Sisters of the Good Samaritan in duty, affection, and reverence to the memory of the soldiers of Adams county, who gave their lives that the nation might live.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;The Soldiers Monument was dedicated on October 31,1867. On that day a half-mile long procession made its way from the court house to the cemetery. General John Tillson, a Civil War veteran, was the parade marshall. He and his aides were followed by the Quincy Band, by numerous other uniformed veterans and dignitaries, by carriages bearing ladies of the Needle Pickets and Sisters of the Good Samaritan, and by the ordinary citizens of Quincy and Adams County. &quot;These grand old woods,&quot; according to the Quincy Herald,&quot; never were thronged by as vast a crowd having a more noble object, and never will again.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Needle Pickets and Sisters of the Good Samaritan were organizations which, during the War, provided for the needs of the soldiers' families at home, tended to sick and injured soldiers who were hospitalized locally, and sent nurses to a number of battlefields. When the War ended, the Sisters of the Good Samaritan had a balance in their treasury of several thousand dollars, part of which was used for the relief of needy families of soldiers. The remainder was spent to erect the Soldiers Monument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designed and sculpted by Cornelius G. Volk, a local artist of national renown, the monument is located on the highest point of the cemetery. It is comprised of a thirty-foot shaft of white Vermont marble on a Joliet stone base and is topped by an American eagle, wings partially spread as if poised for flight to the south or east.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volk is buried in Block 10, Lot 41, of Woodland beneath a small, simple stone. His wife, Martha Barlow Volk, a cousin of Stephen A. Douglas, lies beside him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located close to The Soldiers Monument, so you will walk past it. The cache itself is located outside the cemetery on the side of the hill. Spend some time checking out Woodland Cemetery, there and so many wonderful headstones here to see. I spent over a hour here looking myself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be respectful when you visit. There is no caching after sunset.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Easily accessible - a quick park and grab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please respect the property and the cache is not in the flowers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is being planted to help celebrate the 100th anniversary of the William Salter’s death. Also to remember those who traveled the Underground Railroad did it without the help of our GPSr. We hope that those who hunt this today and in the future can enjoy and celebrate some of the rich heritage SE Iowa has to offer.&lt;br/&gt;William Salter (1821-1910) was an American Congregational minister, public orator, social activist and historian.&lt;br/&gt;Graduating from Andover in 1843, Salter and his companions — the so-called &quot;Iowa Band&quot; — went west to Iowa when it was only a territory to organize congregations, build churches and battle sin in all its infinite varieties. They were the single most distinguished Protestant group of their time, and Salter, through the years, emerged superior to them all, according to biographer Philip Jordan.&lt;br/&gt;Salter began his ministry in Jackson County, preaching in the Maquoketa area. In 1846 he became the second pastor of First Congregational Church in Burlington, Iowa, and remained senior minister of this congregation for more than 60 years until his death in 1910.&lt;br/&gt;According to Jordan, &quot;Salter played a dominant role in transforming the slovenly community, where filth filled the alleys, pigs wallowed in streets and cows grazed on the public square, into a prosperous and cultivated 20th-century Burlington.&quot; He was instrumental in establishing a public library and getting a library building built. He served as president of the school board. He was a trustee of the State University of Iowa (now the University of Iowa), which awarded him an honorary doctorate.&lt;br/&gt;Prior to the Civil War, Salter not only allied himself with anti-slavery societies, but also operated an Underground Railroad station to aid slaves fleeing to freedom. Runaways found sanctuary at his South Hill home and in a hidden room beneath his church. During the war, Salter visited Union troops as far south as Atlanta.&lt;br/&gt;Social Gospel theologian George Herron served briefly with Salter as associate minister in 1892 and 1893, before taking a position as professor of Applied Christianity at Grinnell College.[1]&lt;br/&gt;A Burlington grade school was named after him, and the Congregational student center at the University of Iowa bears his name. Grinnell College, heir to the academic institution founded by the Iowa Band, reveres the memory of Salter. His portrait hangs in the Des Moines County Heritage Center, and a portion of his library is housed at the Burlington Public Library with a number of his published works.</groundspeak:long_description>

I'm here in Burlington on business for a couple of days, and obviously, I've got to go out and find at least one cache, preferably two - one here in Iowa and another in Illinois.  I mean, it's right there! [:)]

So I went prowling around Burlington and West Burlington. One had no obvious parking. With two others, I was right on top of GZ, but too dense to find it.  This one, though...all the stars aligned correctly for my first Iowan cache.  Now I'm a Hawkeye!  LOL

The coordinates took me right to the general area, and it was just one space over from where I thought it would be.  Opening the container yielded some wet contents, but the log was sealed away well. Checking it for being waterproof might be a good idea if anyone's leaving paper objects in there.  I dropped off the travel bug my wife got in New Jersey, but took nothing in return.  I signed the log with as much stealth as possible and re-hid it.

Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

What’s that noise? Horrid sound! We inspected the car, found nothing wrong, cautiously continued on our way and parked just outside the gate. I immediately spotted the likely location and laughed. Not exactly what I was expecting but so darn clever and creative! We wondered how you found this and concluded you must know the property owners. This just isn’t something one is very likely to stumble across. It’s these unexpected locations that make caching fun! Oh, and the noise? We must have kicked up a rock. The noise is gone and we still find no damage to the car. </groundspeak:text>

They established their own woolen mills, furniture factory, meat processing plants, and other industries which provided the villiages with essential necessitiesof life.  Each member contributed some particular skill, which was learned, and passed on in apprenticeship fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The excellence of Amana products soon attracted the attention of the outside world. To this day the Amana Colonies enjoy a reputation for supurb workmanship.  Today, new traditions blend with the old 20th century efficiency with time honored craftsmanship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The Amana Colonies are a pleasant place to visit year round.  The original Amana Meat Shops, Woolen Mills, and Furniture Factory sell products still made in the old world way.  The Museum of Amana History provides a fascinationg look into Amana's history and culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      Special events are held in the Amanas throughout the year.  Maifest celebrates the coming of spring.  In July and early August the famed Lotus Lily of the Amana Lily Lake is in full bloom.  In October many visitors come &lt;br/&gt;to join in the festivities of the anual &quot;Oktoberfest.&quot;  A prelude to Christmas during the holiday season offers a sampling of Christmastime in the Amanas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If you have time there is lots to do in the local area so feel free to explore.

So we decided if we were going to get 5 more caches to reach 1000 finds for 2009, we better grab the day and run with it. This was the first of the 5. Yep! We made it. As we pulled in and parked. I looked up and said, ‘Don’t tell me it’s that (insert unfavorable item here)’. Ron said the GPS says 7 feet ‘that way’. Argh! You won’t believe this, but we walked right past the cache. Yeah – I know – sigh! A few minutes later I said, ‘Oh my gosh! It’s right there!’ Had it been a snake…….you know the rest of that story! We took nothing, left a ‘My Little Pony’ w/comb and a Ziplock bag of wildlife stickers, noticed a couple of travel bugs waiting ‘to travel’, signed the log book and replaced the box as found. Don’t make this one difficult folks, ‘cause it isn’t. *sigh* Next? ‘What Would Alice Chew?’ </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Historic Iowa City&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The land on which Iowa City is located was a wilderness when it was&lt;br/&gt;selected and surveyed for the capital of the Territory of Iowa. The&lt;br/&gt;corner stone of the new capitol building was laid by Governor Luca&lt;br/&gt;on July 4, 1840. The Legislative Assembly met first in a frame&lt;br/&gt;building in 1841: the following year it moved into the new stone&lt;br/&gt;capitol'' now one of Iowa's most prized historic shrines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iowa City served as capital for sixteen exciting years.. Here five&lt;br/&gt;sessions of the legislative Assembly and six sessions of the&lt;br/&gt;General Assembly met to enact Iowa laws. Here the Territorial and&lt;br/&gt;State Supreme Courts met to pass on these laws. Here held three&lt;br/&gt;Constitutional Conventions were held '' in 1844, 1846, and in&lt;br/&gt;1857.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The State University was established by law at Iowa City in 1847&lt;br/&gt;but the first classes did not open until 1855. The State Historical&lt;br/&gt;Society of Iowa was established by law at Iowa City in 1857. The&lt;br/&gt;Constitution of 1857 moved the capital to Des Moines, leaving the&lt;br/&gt;University and Historical Society in Iowa City.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mormon Handcart Trail -1856&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1856, some 1300 Mormon converts from Europe, many of them wards&lt;br/&gt;of the Perpetual Emigration Fund Company, reached the railroad &quot;End&lt;br/&gt;-of-Track&quot; in Iowa City. Their money exhausted, Brigham Young&lt;br/&gt;declared: &quot;Let them come on foot, with hand-carts or wheel-barrows:&lt;br/&gt;let them gird up their loins, and walk through and nothing shall&lt;br/&gt;hinder them.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mormons encamped at what is now Coralville while awaiting the&lt;br/&gt;completion of their handcarts. The first company of Mormons set out&lt;br/&gt;bravely from Coralville on June 7, pushing or pulling their carts&lt;br/&gt;through Homestead, Marengo, Newton, Des Moines, Adel, and historic&lt;br/&gt;Dalmanutha. It joined the Mormon Trail of 1846 at Lewis and crossed&lt;br/&gt;the Missouri River north of Council Bluffs. The Mormon Bridge at&lt;br/&gt;North Omaha stands as a symbol to their trek across Iowa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, two other companies followed close on the heels of the&lt;br/&gt;first Handcart expedition, all three reaching Salt Lake City safely&lt;br/&gt;before cold weather set in. The fourth and fifth Handcart companies&lt;br/&gt;suffered untold hardships and death before they reached their Zion&lt;br/&gt;in present day Utah.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To locate the cache at the posted cords is a large plaque you just&lt;br/&gt;need to answer two questions from the text on that plaque This is a&lt;br/&gt;quick two stage cache:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What year was the Iowa City area surveyed for the capital?

Since then, I've felt a bit like Wile E. Coyote, trying to come up with some overly-elaborate plan in order to make the grab. The ACME catalog sure wasn't much help either. When RonTon offered the use of a piece of Special Equipment last weekend, after the GC CITO Event, I was really bummed. Not only was I not going to be able attend the event, but I would also miss an opportunity to finally end my 10,000 days of brooding over this one. Had another commitment that day. When RonTon offered to yet again help out the earth-bound out, I knew the days until getting that Smiley were finally numbered, less than another 10,000. Almost couldn’t get the ladder set-up fast before making the climb. TFTOC!</groundspeak:text>

This was the first cache placed on the Grant Wood Trail, which is now completely full now.  Here is the original description: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easily accessible from the Grant Wood Trail east of Marion, this cache hunt provides a pleasant walk from multiple starting points. Please write your experience in the log book, other that signing and dating it only. That's what it's for.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old Milwaukee railroad tracks that passed through Marion have been removed east of town and the Grant Wood Trail has been established. This excellent hiking trail currently provides 5.3 miles of gravel and dirt walkways and is presently being expanded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trailhead parking is at N42° 01.671, W091° 32.944 if you would like to bike or hike about 1.8 miles to the cache. There is another parking area off Oxley Road as well. If you prefer a shorter .25 mile hike, you can access the trail from a public gravel road in between.&lt;br/&gt;My first cache has no real theme so anything in trade is welcome. The container is an ammo box. Happy caching! </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;Websites containing information and images have started appearing across the net. A lot of these are too distorted to know what they are, but at the clearer ones we have learned about a frighting path our society is headed on. From what we have gathered these sites exist in the year 2020 or what that government calls Year Zero. It seams they have reset what year after a horrifying event. It is not clear yet what this event is. The government seems to have taken control over everything and knows no bounds. They have control over everything and even spying on their own citizens. A new government agency has also been created called, the U.S. Bureau of Morality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A large pharmaceutical conglomerate with extensive government ties, Cedocore is the creator of a number of drugs, including Parepin which is administered on a national scale in the tap water. They are also, covertly, the sole manufacturer of Opal, distributing it illicitly. While studying the Judson Ogram Correctional Facility. Examination of profiles at Judson Ogram indicates that anti-psychotic substances are needlessly used on inmates, displaying no signs of elevated excitement, self harm or psychotic tendencies. Speculation would suggest that this is to make inmates so docile that they are willing to accept the mistreatment that goes on inside the facility - indeed, the staff page suggests that inmates are used as guinea pigs for the pharmaceutical company Cedocore, leading to the discovery that Cedocore's &quot;Xerimax&quot; product causes renal damage and pulmonary edema.&lt;br/&gt;We have figured out that two faction's have risen up and they are responsible for creating &quot;quantum netting&quot;, which is the cause of us beening able to see these websites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have also discovered some very graphic sites that shows a tracking device that is implanted in every persons left wrist. These sights show how to remove such devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trying to help these rebels, we have created a few websites and encoding clues for 16 drop locations. We are planting items that might be useful to them. Some will be very difficult to find, and some will be easy. Pay close attention to ratings, and attributes. These will help you along. Hopefully none of these sites, will be infiltrated. We may be able to help prevent Year Zero. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is located near the highest point of Sioux Mountain.    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siouxlookout.com/legend2000.html&quot;&gt;Legend of&lt;br/&gt;   Sioux Lookout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container is a Star Frit Lock and Lock 2.6 litre, air and water tight container. It has an official looking sticker on the outside. The cache contains a Buzz Lightyear figurine with a travel bug attached. He hopes to travel to outerspace one day! I hope he will have lots of great adventures! Other items are a waterproof logbook, 2 pens, 2 pencils with a sharpener, compass keychain, hat/lapel pin, lucky fishing lure, small screwdriver, and a laminated note explaining what geocaching is all about! Zeke left a toy in case whoever finds the cache has a dog too!&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The easiest way to approach the cache is the same way the Sioux Warriors did. You can boat to the base of the mountain, and then climb to the top from there. Another way to get to the cache is an old access road from the vicinity of Pelican Falls School. The road is very rough and steep in spots with at least one deep washout. You can drive as far as you dare and then walk from there. This could be a very long walk. I have seen vehicles drive to the very top though. This would definitely require the use of four wheel drive and a skilled driver.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The cache is at the base of a rocky overhang behind a small tree. It is hidden beneath some rocks.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>
