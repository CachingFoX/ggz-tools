            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is our families first cache. It is recommended for children age 2-12 years of age.

It is a very simple cache for the young children to locate. It is a large locked toolbox chained to the tree. The coordinates go to the keys (there are two in the same container) one unlocks the chain on the tree and the other opens the box. Feel free to sit at the table and sort through the contents. These contents range from books to baby toys and a Mr. Potatohead set to action figures and cars to mini barbies and a cabbage patch kid. 

If there is a trackable, and there is, please trade equally (trackable for a trackable).


Our daughters enjoy geocaching, but really love it when they find a GREAT cache. They want every kid to be able to find a GREAT cache worthy to talk about. Here is that cache for every kid. Young or old enjoy this cache, but remember have fun.


Our daughters will be maintaining this box with our help. Feel free to let us know what you think.

You have my permission to enter my yard. It is in our own front yard so please no one before 6 AM after 9 PM.

I would like for any cacher to know that this cache is wheelchair-accessible and I am adding this attribute to my cache description to show this cache is truly a Level 1 terrain.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The date is 1811.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    The beginning of the flood of settlers with
the opening of the “Southwest Trail” also known as the Military
Road.  It was started with the French in 1765 to link the
French settlements together.  Many pioneers traveled this
route including Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett,   and
others.  The historical route is mostly paralleled with
Highway 167. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    1811 is also the date of one of the most
powerful earthquakes to hit the United States, the New Madrid
earthquake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    Roads are the precursors of civilization, and
nothing is more interesting to the student of local history than
the effect they have had on the settlement and development of the
country. This is particularly true of Northeast Arkansas. Most of
the early roads had their beginnings in Indian trails. The Indians
were a roving people who moved from one part of the country to
another in quest of the best hunting grounds or on missions of war.
In their travels they followed certain favorable routes and thus
made trails by marching single file. These trails were also
sometimes used by wild animals, such as deer, bears, and buffaloes.
So in time, these trails became quite clear, even worn in places·
The routes of the trails were along the most favorable terrain,
which was along the ridges between the streams and over the lower
parts of the ridges they had to cross. They kept back from the
lower courses of the larger streams in order to have better
crossings on them, which they had to wade, swim or cross on the
trunks of fallen trees. In the lowlands, the trails were located on
the higher ground to avoid the sloughs and slashes. Of course all
the trails were more or less for dry weather use· Over these trails
the Indians made long journeys marching single file, and by them
built their campfires at night, or maybe located their villages.
When the white settlers came, they found the Indian trails the best
routes of travel, and they made them into wagon road by cutting out
underbrush and removing the logs.&lt;br/&gt;
    The road which was most important to Northeast
Arkansas was the road commonly called the Military road. It was
first opened into Arkansas soon after 1803, by Hix's Ferry across
Current River, aptly called the &quot;Northern Gateway to Arkansas&quot;, at
the northeast corner of what is now Randolph county. The route of
the road was an old Indian trail, called by the whites the
Southwest Trail. It extended southwest from the Illinois country to
Texas and Mexico. It was trod by many moccasined foot before white
men ever saw it. Through Arkansas it ran along the foothills of the
Ozarks and Ouachita Mountains, far enough up the streams which run
down from the highlands to give good crossings on the streams and
the ridges between them. The route would be suitable for a modern
highway. In fact, highway No. 67 parallels it clear through the
state. The old trail was first converted into a wagon road from
Ste. Genevieve and Potosi, Missouri, and on into Arkansas about
1803. William Hix is said to have opened his ferry across Current
river at that time, and immigrants began to come in, a trickle at
first and then a rushing stream to the region soon to become the
big county of Lawrence, first in Missouri territory and a little
later in Arkansas territory. The road was extended through the
state about 1810. The territory now in Randolph, Lawrence, Sharp
and Independence counties being a fair country and closest to the
route got most of the immigrants for awhile, but soon the stream
overflowed into other parts of the state.&lt;br/&gt;
Not much of it now remains, but it was very important for the first
fifty or seventy-five years after its opening. It passed through
this county by way of Maynard and Jackson, then in Lawrence county,
crossed Spring River at or near the Miller ford, went by Denton and
Lynn, crossed Strawberry river about a mile and a half below the
Lynn-Strawberry bridge, and a short distance west of Saffell to its
crossing on White River not far from Newark.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

I have been watching this aera for quite some time and decided today was the day to place a cache here.

If you look on google maps you will see that this is Gist Ranch Conservation Area, this area has abundant wildlife and various different terrain levels there is but one thing... there are no designated trails here, however;  there are several old logging roads that will get you around the ranch pretty well. From the parking coords this cache is 1.25 miles via an old logging road and some tracking through the woods. 
Myself Shaede, and T-REX (my 21 month old grandson) placed this cache and this is a bit of a hike but my grandson walked over 3/4 of this before he decided he wanted to ride me piggy-back.

The location is a nice spot to relax before heading back and my grandson really enjoyed a bit of rock throwing before we left.

&quot;Consecrated A.D. 1867 by Sisters of the Good Samaritan in duty, affection, and reverence to the memory of the soldiers of Adams county, who gave their lives that the nation might live.&quot; 
The Soldiers Monument was dedicated on October 31,1867. On that day a half-mile long procession made its way from the court house to the cemetery. General John Tillson, a Civil War veteran, was the parade marshall. He and his aides were followed by the Quincy Band, by numerous other uniformed veterans and dignitaries, by carriages bearing ladies of the Needle Pickets and Sisters of the Good Samaritan, and by the ordinary citizens of Quincy and Adams County. &quot;These grand old woods,&quot; according to the Quincy Herald,&quot; never were thronged by as vast a crowd having a more noble object, and never will again.&quot;

The Needle Pickets and Sisters of the Good Samaritan were organizations which, during the War, provided for the needs of the soldiers' families at home, tended to sick and injured soldiers who were hospitalized locally, and sent nurses to a number of battlefields. When the War ended, the Sisters of the Good Samaritan had a balance in their treasury of several thousand dollars, part of which was used for the relief of needy families of soldiers. The remainder was spent to erect the Soldiers Monument.

Designed and sculpted by Cornelius G. Volk, a local artist of national renown, the monument is located on the highest point of the cemetery. It is comprised of a thirty-foot shaft of white Vermont marble on a Joliet stone base and is topped by an American eagle, wings partially spread as if poised for flight to the south or east.

Volk is buried in Block 10, Lot 41, of Woodland beneath a small, simple stone. His wife, Martha Barlow Volk, a cousin of Stephen A. Douglas, lies beside him.

The cache is located close to The Soldiers Monument, so you will walk past it. The cache itself is located outside the cemetery on the side of the hill. Spend some time checking out Woodland Cemetery, there and so many wonderful headstones here to see. I spent over a hour here looking myself.

Be respectful when you visit. There is no caching after sunset.

The land on which Iowa City is located was a wilderness when it was
selected and surveyed for the capital of the Territory of Iowa. The
corner stone of the new capitol building was laid by Governor Luca
on July 4, 1840. The Legislative Assembly met first in a frame
building in 1841: the following year it moved into the new stone
capitol'' now one of Iowa's most prized historic shrines.

Iowa City served as capital for sixteen exciting years.. Here five
sessions of the legislative Assembly and six sessions of the
General Assembly met to enact Iowa laws. Here the Territorial and
State Supreme Courts met to pass on these laws. Here held three
Constitutional Conventions were held '' in 1844, 1846, and in
1857.

The State University was established by law at Iowa City in 1847
but the first classes did not open until 1855. The State Historical
Society of Iowa was established by law at Iowa City in 1857. The
Constitution of 1857 moved the capital to Des Moines, leaving the
University and Historical Society in Iowa City.

Mormon Handcart Trail -1856

In 1856, some 1300 Mormon converts from Europe, many of them wards
of the Perpetual Emigration Fund Company, reached the railroad &quot;End
-of-Track&quot; in Iowa City. Their money exhausted, Brigham Young
declared: &quot;Let them come on foot, with hand-carts or wheel-barrows:
let them gird up their loins, and walk through and nothing shall
hinder them.&quot;

The Mormons encamped at what is now Coralville while awaiting the
completion of their handcarts. The first company of Mormons set out
bravely from Coralville on June 7, pushing or pulling their carts
through Homestead, Marengo, Newton, Des Moines, Adel, and historic
Dalmanutha. It joined the Mormon Trail of 1846 at Lewis and crossed
the Missouri River north of Council Bluffs. The Mormon Bridge at
North Omaha stands as a symbol to their trek across Iowa.

Meanwhile, two other companies followed close on the heels of the
first Handcart expedition, all three reaching Salt Lake City safely
before cold weather set in. The fourth and fifth Handcart companies
suffered untold hardships and death before they reached their Zion
in present day Utah.

To locate the cache at the posted cords is a large plaque you just
need to answer two questions from the text on that plaque This is a
quick two stage cache:

What year was the Iowa City area surveyed for the capital? Let this
be ABCD

How many Mormon's where is the first company? Let this be EFG

Listen to the tales and romanticize,
How we'd follow the path of the hero.
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun.
How we rise to the height of our halo.

Listen to the tales as we all rationalize
Our way into the arms of the savior,
Feigning all the trials and the tribulations;
None of us have actually been there.
Not like you.

Ignorant siblings in the congregation
Gather around spewing sympathy,
Spare me.
None of them can even hold a candle up to you.
Blinded by choice, these hypocrites won't see.
But, enough about the collective Judas.
Who could deny you were the one who
Illuminated your little piece of the divine?

And this little light of mine, a gift you passed on to me;
I'm gonna let it shine to guide you safely on your way,
Your way home ...

Oh, what are they going to do when the lights go down
Without you to guide them all to Zion?
What are they going to do when the rivers overrun
Other than tremble incessantly?

High is the way, but all eyes are upon the ground.
You were the light and the way they'll only read about.
I only pray, Heaven knows when to lift you out.
Ten thousand days in the fire is long enough;
You're going home.

You're the only one who can hold your head up high,
Shake your fists at the gates saying:
&quot;I've come home now!
Fetch me the spirit, the son, and the father.
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended.
It's time now!
My time now!
Give me my, give me my wings!&quot;

You are the light and way that they will only read about.

Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance,
(With the) burden of proof tossed upon the believers.
You were my witness, my eyes, my evidence,
Judith Marie, unconditional one.

Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescents.
Difficult to see you in this light.
Please forgive this bold suggestion, but
Should you see your Maker's face tonight,
Look Him in the eye, look Him in the eye, and tell Him:
&quot;I never lived a lie, never took a life, but surely saved one.
Hallelujah, it's time for you to bring me home.&quot;

Lyrics by:

Maynard James Keenen

This cache is dedicated to my grandmother who is in the nearing the final stages of Alzheimer's. A very sad and tragic way to end.....

When I placed this all I could think of was her yelling at me &quot;What are you doing? You're going to break your neck.&quot; And this song reminds me so much of her. She is already missed by her grandkids.</groundspeak:long_description>

Since then, I've felt a bit like Wile E. Coyote, trying to come up with some overly-elaborate plan in order to make the grab. The ACME catalog sure wasn't much help either. When RonTon offered the use of a piece of Special Equipment last weekend, after the GC CITO Event, I was really bummed. Not only was I not going to be able attend the event, but I would also miss an opportunity to finally end my 10,000 days of brooding over this one. Had another commitment that day. When RonTon offered to yet again help out the earth-bound out, I knew the days until getting that Smiley were finally numbered, less than another 10,000. Almost couldn’t get the ladder set-up fast before making the climb. TFTOC!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a cache that I had adopted when a friend of mine retired from geocaching.  I've been keeping it going ever since.  This was the first cache placed on the Grant Wood Trail, which is now completely full now.  Here is the original description: 

Easily accessible from the Grant Wood Trail east of Marion, this cache hunt provides a pleasant walk from multiple starting points. Please write your experience in the log book, other that signing and dating it only. That's what it's for.

The old Milwaukee railroad tracks that passed through Marion have been removed east of town and the Grant Wood Trail has been established. This excellent hiking trail currently provides 5.3 miles of gravel and dirt walkways and is presently being expanded.

The trailhead parking is at N42° 01.671, W091° 32.944 if you would like to bike or hike about 1.8 miles to the cache. There is another parking area off Oxley Road as well. If you prefer a shorter .25 mile hike, you can access the trail from a public gravel road in between.
My first cache has no real theme so anything in trade is welcome. The container is an ammo box. Happy caching! </groundspeak:long_description>

Websites containing information and images have started appearing across the net. A lot of these are too distorted to know what they are, but at the clearer ones we have learned about a frighting path our society is headed on. From what we have gathered these sites exist in the year 2020 or what that government calls Year Zero. It seams they have reset what year after a horrifying event. It is not clear yet what this event is. The government seems to have taken control over everything and knows no bounds. They have control over everything and even spying on their own citizens. A new government agency has also been created called, the U.S. Bureau of Morality.

A large pharmaceutical conglomerate with extensive government ties, Cedocore is the creator of a number of drugs, including Parepin which is administered on a national scale in the tap water. They are also, covertly, the sole manufacturer of Opal, distributing it illicitly. While studying the Judson Ogram Correctional Facility. Examination of profiles at Judson Ogram indicates that anti-psychotic substances are needlessly used on inmates, displaying no signs of elevated excitement, self harm or psychotic tendencies. Speculation would suggest that this is to make inmates so docile that they are willing to accept the mistreatment that goes on inside the facility - indeed, the staff page suggests that inmates are used as guinea pigs for the pharmaceutical company Cedocore, leading to the discovery that Cedocore's &quot;Xerimax&quot; product causes renal damage and pulmonary edema.
We have figured out that two faction's have risen up and they are responsible for creating &quot;quantum netting&quot;, which is the cause of us beening able to see these websites.

We have also discovered some very graphic sites that shows a tracking device that is implanted in every persons left wrist. These sights show how to remove such devices.

Trying to help these rebels, we have created a few websites and encoding clues for 16 drop locations. We are planting items that might be useful to them. Some will be very difficult to find, and some will be easy. Pay close attention to ratings, and attributes. These will help you along. Hopefully none of these sites, will be infiltrated. We may be able to help prevent Year Zero. </groundspeak:long_description>

   Sioux Lookout&lt;/a&gt;

 

The container is a Star Frit Lock and Lock 2.6 litre, air and water tight container. It has an official looking sticker on the outside. The cache contains a Buzz Lightyear figurine with a travel bug attached. He hopes to travel to outerspace one day! I hope he will have lots of great adventures! Other items are a waterproof logbook, 2 pens, 2 pencils with a sharpener, compass keychain, hat/lapel pin, lucky fishing lure, small screwdriver, and a laminated note explaining what geocaching is all about! Zeke left a toy in case whoever finds the cache has a dog too!
 
The easiest way to approach the cache is the same way the Sioux Warriors did. You can boat to the base of the mountain, and then climb to the top from there. Another way to get to the cache is an old access road from the vicinity of Pelican Falls School. The road is very rough and steep in spots with at least one deep washout. You can drive as far as you dare and then walk from there. This could be a very long walk. I have seen vehicles drive to the very top though. This would definitely require the use of four wheel drive and a skilled driver.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The cache is at the base of a rocky overhang behind a small tree. It is hidden beneath some rocks.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>
