while that description was accurate in 2003, I guess with the newer
standard I will now say it is closer to a small) NOTE: Handicapped
persons using walkers should be able to access this cache, but
wheelchairs probably will not be able to reach it. &lt;br/&gt; This cache is located at the display beside the museum. Due to the
roof over the display, the coordinates may be slightly off. You
will need to be on the east side of the display. Replace everything
just as you found it. A pen has been provided for you, but please
return it.&lt;br/&gt;
DO NOT climb on the display.&lt;br/&gt;
DO NOT crawl under the display.&lt;br/&gt;
You can reach the cache from the side of the display.&lt;br/&gt;
DO NOT leave any items in the container with the log sheet.&lt;br/&gt;

The McComb City Railroad Depot Museum is reached through the
waiting room of the depot. It is open from 1 to 4 PM on Thursday
&amp; Friday from April thru September.&lt;br/&gt;

IC 2542 is a 4-8-2 Mountain type steam engine built in 1942 and
rebuilt in 1951 at the Illinois Central shops in Paducah. In the
early 1960's she was again shopped in McComb. After being shopped,
she was declared surplus and placed on exhibit in Edgewood Park
north of McComb. On June 21, 2000 she was moved to this location.
Her specifications include 30x30 inch cylinders, 70 inch drivers,
250 pounds of pressure, 83,500 pounds of tractive effort with
280,500 pounds of weight on the drivers, total engine weight is
409,500 pounds. The tender weighs 225,500 pounds and holds 24 tons
of coal and 11,000 gallons of water.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
IC 51000 was built in the McComb shops in September 1946 and is an
experimental aluminum reefer of 40 tons. It was the only one ever
built. The car was ordered scrapped, but the McComb Shops employees
hid the car and preserved it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
IC 9384 was built in Centralia by IC in 1972 with wide vision
cupola, extended porches and riveted body. After the Gulf, Mobile
and Ohio merger, it was numbered ICG 199384.&lt;br/&gt;

 The Tunica Trace was an early 1800's trail beginning at Tunica
Landing on the Mississippi River in Louisiana and running
northeastward into western Alabama. It crossed the Bogue Chitto
Road about a half mile west of this cache. While the Tunica Trace
is still used as a public road in places, this segment has been

use OLD TWIN LAKES ROAD. Get on Old Twin Lakes Road at the
intersection of Highway 61 and Highway 465. The coordinates of this
intersection are listed below as a Trailhead waypoint. Do not
attempt to reach this cache directly from Hwy 465. The land and
farm roads between the two are private property and
posted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1888 the Louisville, New Orleans and Texas Railroad built a
drawbridge over the Yazoo River at this location. The drawspan was
271 feet long. In 1944 the drawbridge was replace with a swing
bridge. The swing span is 288 feet long. Including the wood and
steel approach spans, the total length of the bridge is 1155 feet
long. In the mid 1980's this portion of the railroad was abandoned
and the span was left in the open position so tugboats could pass.
At some point after that, part of the steel approaches on the east
side were removed. I could not find out if they were scrapped or if
the railroad moved the spans to another location. I suspect they
were reused since only two sections were removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are seeking an unlisted type container containing a small
zip lock bag with a log sheet. The cache is NOT on the ground.
Please be careful not to damage the zip lock or the log sheet will
get wet. Since this is a public boat launch, expect plenty of
muggles. If the Mississippi River is above 43 feet on the Vicksburg
gauge, this cache may not be accessible. You can park within 20
feet of the cache,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;TH2RKK0 - access road&lt;br/&gt;N 32° 30.046 W 090° 48.678&lt;br/&gt;Old Twin Lakes Road access point</groundspeak:long_description>

If you have seen the film adaptation by Peter Jackson you have seen what an Ent might look like. Treebeard is the Ent featured most in the story and led the Ents into battle against Saruman for destroying the forest to build his army of Orcs. Are Ents real? Most rational people would say “of course Ents are not real” but think about this; have you ever been in the woods by yourself and you would swear that you saw a tree move out of the corner of your eye? I’ve heard tales about “tree-walkers” that move around the woods on moonless nights……at any rate if Ents are real I hope they don’t mistake me for an Orc! Enjoy the cache guys! </groundspeak:long_description>

I think I was near it, but the woodland insects started to feast upon our flesh.  After the first few ticks that started to latch on us, we decided to call it quits.  Also there is to much litter in the area that also adds to the confusion.  A better hint or at least some kind of marker on the actual tree might make it a little bit more fun. </groundspeak:text>

Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to find a cache at the predetermined coordinates. Find this cache and you will be rewarded with a strong sense of accomplishment as this cache was intended to have a difficulty rating higher than the average PNG. Covert movement would be advised and best done in plain site with camera in hand.

I bet this guy has seen countless stars go zooming past as he has stood his tireless vigil. Once a monument of grandeur now stands in memorial of a Rock-N-Roll Ghost Town. 
As you are approaching the cache site there is an old drive north of it that you can park at. This is along a busy highway so I wouldn’t recommend bringing children but if you do PLEASE keep an eye (and hand!) on them. Like in most of our listings we suggest that you bring a camera as camo for the muggles but this one really does make for a great photo opportunity!

The cache is a smaller lok-n-lok that will hold a few trackables that need to visit Tennessee or Mississippi and small swag items. Have fun!

Note: This sign has an electrical service near by but never attempt to tamper with any electrical device! The cache is not there.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A commonly held belief in real estate, and many other endeavors, is that finding the proper location is vital for success. What defines a proper location changes with each person, as the definition is dependant on an individual's hierarchy of criteria. Caching is no different.

Some people rank ease of access high on their list of priorities. Others consider proximity to other caches important. Some value peace and solitude. Still others rank a scenic view as highly important.

While this cache is close, as the crow flies, to two interstates, it is not quickly accessible from either. Proximity to other caches? Nope, not this hide. The next closest hide is nearly two miles East of here and is in a different state. Peace and solitude? Sort of. Despite being in the potential sight of hundreds, if not thousands, of people you will most likely be alone while hunting this cache. A scenic view though is something you will have.

Now that I have rambled for a couple of paragraphs let me share some specifics about this cache. First, and this is important, you cannot get here from I-40. Can't do it. Don't even try. Instead take exit 1 from I-55. Then go South a short distance to the service road heading east. Be anti-Horace Greeley and go East. The next important thing to know is that you will end up driving down a dirt road. Do not fret as it is well maintained and in good shape. Unless it is flooded.

Did I mention high water? Hmmm. Not yet? Well I suppose now is as good a time as any to tell you. Most of the year this area is dry and can be safely accessed. There are times of the year however that this area contains a lot of water. It doesn't rise fast though so if the road is dry you are safe in hunting this cache. As a general rule of thumb look at the Mississippi river, if it is out of its banks do not hunt this cache.

You will be looking for a magnetic matchstick holder on a signpost. It is a short distance from the road. Very short. Mere feet. The reason for the terrain rating is the thickness of the growth between the road and the signpost. As with all caches please replace the container as well or better than you found it. Also, due to the previously mentioned high water, please place the container as high on the post as you can.

Oh, and lest you miss the best part of this cache hunt, take a look to the East. It is, after all, all about location, location, location.

This geocache is a plastic container spray painted brown. It is hidden a short way off of hiking trail in Craighead Forest Park. In the cache, you will find a logbook and pen along with some swag to trade. Do not get discouraged if the first thing you find is not what you think you're looking for. 
Please do not remove/tamper with the “NOT FOR TRADE” items in the cache. Also remember to put cache components back the way you found them for other cachers to enjoy. If the cache needs maintenance or you have trouble locating the cache, please feel free to contact us so we may be of assistance.

We have placed a munzee game piece in the cache for the munzee players out there. Do not remove this as it is an official game piece. Thank you and happy caching

This location is such a place.  I visited here many times growing up and I'm sure there are many stories that the walls could tell such as first dates, a special gift, etc. etc.  Now, things are changing.  There is a new place to go, new stories to make, more people to meet and in the background there is this place, with an uncertain future and the custodian of tales growing old.

This micro contains only a log so you will need a writing instrument.  There is no need to disturb any landscaping.

You should scout it out and decide if you can attempt it without risking the cache.  Tying your shoe, petting an animal, etc are some tricks to use at the cache site.  If you have a favorite stealth technique post it here!

Here are a few to get you started thinking:

Use a bible cover with a hollowed out book.  Place your GPS in the cavity and read and walk!

Take a measuring tape and pretend to measure stuff.

Take a baby stroller with a canopy and put the GPS in the canopy.  Push and follow the GPS!

Fold up a newspaper and put the GPS in it.

Take a camera and tripod and use the GPS like a light meter.

Carry a trash bag and pick up trash while following the GPS.

Carry a clipboard, a pencil behind your ear and &quot;talk&quot; on your GPS.

Thank you to Smokey Bear's friends. This geocache is a take only. The contents can change over time. Please fill out the log and take only one item per person. So please don't leave anything but your entry in the log. I have permission to have this cache here, from the District Ranger of the Poplar Bluff Ranger Station, of the Mark Twain National Forest (visit link)
Remember only YOU can prevent Wildfires and this is a thank you for your work on preventing wildfires. If you're here during office hours please come up to the office and pick up some information on the forest. We have information on plants and animals and much more. Don't forget to tell them the Geocache brought you here!
If the cache is empty or needs attention please let us know. The web site link above, will take you to information on the Forest.
Also visit (visit link) Smokey's site, you can get color sheets and much more.

After reading other descriptions and meeting a geocacher I wanted to add more information. So this is a place to get official Smokey Bear items. The first item is a Smokey Bear pin, it's a tie tack style Smokey with wings. When these are gone I will add more items, which could be erasers, pencils, pencil sharpeners, buttons, etc. If I need to I will find a new container for the items.

So depending on what is available and when an item runs out it could be anything Smokey. If you want the comic book which is still in print you will have to ask at the office when it's open.

Happy Hunting.</groundspeak:long_description>

you are done. Amidon is a beautiful place, and the view from the
cache is nice. Don't bring any glass, $250.00 fine per bottle. The
whole trail is about 1 mile, you will pass within about 125 ' of
the cache if you stay on the trail.

This cache is near the top of the hill over the Castor River.
Follow the path to the Shut-ins, then on down the marked path
towards the cache. Stay on the path until you are near the cache.
As you are standing looking out over the valley, and taking in the
fantastic view, you will see a drop off of about 8 feet. As you
stand near this drop off, you will see a pile of rocks on top of a
short stump down below. The cache is within 30' of this pile of
rocks. This cache has been moved again and is reloggable again for
all finders who found it before the L Franks. At this time it is a
large plastic jar hidden in the rocks.

After a nice hike into the Shut-Ins, we got down to the business of finding the cache.  Found the stump and the rocks after a few false starts.  Also found a wasp nest somewhere in the vicinity -- I think it was in a dead tree close by, standing up by itself.  Found the cache; it was well hidden and in good shape.
  
Chalkdusty give her new anti-snake/walking stick its baptism of fire leaving the cache site -- a black rat snake was stretched out across the path as we were making our way back to the car.  Mr. Snake was hurried along (gently) and again all was well.  (I tried to convince Chalkdusty that he was a pretty cute snake, all things considered, but she wasn't having anything to do with that...)

Hawn State Park. It is a camouflaged ammo box under a rock, reached
through a crevice. This cache is approximatly .70 miles from the
parking lot.

This cache is the one I hid for the Midwest Invitational Geocaching
Competition. I moved it to this spot to leave for a while, so
everybody can find it. It is a &quot;new&quot; cache. The nearby tree had a
tag and a punch hidden on it. Enjoy the view from up here, and the
rest of your stay at this great park. Taking the ski lift up to the
cache will result in log deletion!!

This should be an easy find once you view it from the right, or is
that the wrong side. Cache is a short walk off the path through the
grass. Please, let's try not to develop a social trail to GZ. I
come down to this park often to go for a run, and I figured this
would be an interesting place to hide a cache. This is a HIGH
muggle area, so turn your stealth mode up to full power. Please
observe the park curfew.

I had found that cache four years ago on 12/20/2006, it was my very first cache find. I went to check on it and was surprised to see that it had been archive, so I figured I would place a new cache in that general location. The cache is a lock-n-lock with a water proof log and a few trade items. Please place the cache back where you found it and make sure it’s covered up/hidden well. Terrain rating is high for a reason, don’t attempt this cache when the ground is icy/muddy and this might not be the best cache for pets, children and people who are afraid of heights. 
		
  	NOTICE: Please be respectful of the posted park hours. If you enter the park after hours you are trespassing. If you are stopped you can be ticketed or arrested and will put the future of geocaching in the parks in jeopardy. 
		
  	Special permission to hide caches in St. Louis County parks is NOT needed as long as the Groundspeak rules are followed. &quot;Blanket Permission&quot; has been worked out in advance with the park service. DO NOT CALL THE PARK as they cannot handle the calls. The Groundspeak cache reviewer does need to know exactly how and where the caches are hidden and what type of containers are used. The geocaching liaisons will notify the park service of new caches. Remember NO AMMO BOXES or PVC PIPE caches.

If you squint your eyes, blur your vision and allow your imagination to run wild you might just be able to envision a Roman Temple was once built near here.

No, really, I decided to name this cache Roman Temples? because it is *near* the former location of the final of RGS’s “The Roman” cache. Actually it’s about a quarter mile from where that cache once was…but I thought I would continue with the theme.

This cache is a small Tupperware type container hidden about 100 feet up a very steep hill. The hill has at least a 45º angle to it and can be very slippery. This hide is also a little different from the other two.

Make no mistake – this can be evil, nasty, curse-me-every-foot-of-the-way-as-you-tumble-a**-over-tea-kettle-down-the-hill type terrain. That is why I rated it four and one half stars! It is NOT SUPPOSED to be easy! So use extra caution here.</groundspeak:long_description>

However, the distance to the cache from the suggested parking is a bit over 1/2 mile as the crow (or is that Crowe?) flies so the actual distance, depending upon how you approach the cache, will be more. And, if you approach the cache from below, you may have to go about 350 feet up a very steep hill to reach the cache site.

Oh, and by the way, look out for dragons.

This is a beautiful area, and nice to walk after you get up the
hill. From the parking lot to the main cache is about a half of a
mile. There is a trail for most of the way. There are also two
secret bonus caches hidden out here, all you need to do is find the
coordinates for them. The coordinates are not coded, just well
hidden. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Strider&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

spot to place a cache. It isn't there, but near. You can get to
this cache on the River Scene Trail, from the top or bottom,
without any real bushwhacking. It is a short diversion on the way
to Blue Ribbon cache.

I didn't make it very plain where I hid it, don't look where you
might. You can reach it from the steps.

Got to see a Blue Runner snake about 4 feet long on the way to this one from the previous cache on the trail.  
Didnt find any bottle, but a small king snake was sitting about 6 foot away from the cache pointing to it instead. 
Cache was in great condition.  Thanks for hide and bringing us to this area.

So I was out today doing some cache maintenance with Strider and when I finished with the last one I had this preform cache container left over. So I sez to Strider &quot;Ya wanna wander on down the trail a bit and see if we can find a place to stash this thingy?&quot; And he sez &quot;Sure, why not?&quot; So we wander on down the trail a piece and when we reach .10 mile from the last cache we start lookin' around. We look at this and we look at that and eventually we find this other thing. &quot;This looks like a likely spot&quot; sez I. &quot;Yeah. Pretty obvious tho&quot; sez he. &quot;Well, I'm gonna put it here anyway. Maybe I'll hide something much more devious this winter once all the greenery dies down. Meanwhile, this'll do.&quot; sez I. So I stashed the preform right there. Y'all come out now &amp; find it. </groundspeak:long_description>

This is a cache dedicated to little boys everywhere. It will start off being stocked with goodies that little boys might like to have. I hope that traded items will follow that theme.

The cache is located about 50 feet off a walking/biking/skating path in Valley Park. From the recommended parking – N 38° 33.232, W 090° 27.881 - you can walk/bike/skate .2 miles to Simpson Park, .9 miles to Greentree Park and/or .9 miles to Meramec Landing Park. Or you could just go off the path and look for this cache. Off-trail the terrain can get a little rough and overgrown and, as it is very close to the river, could be prone to flooding if the river gets too high. People under 5'4&quot; tall will need a &quot;step stool&quot; to reach the cache. I have placed one near by but I don't expect that one to last very long...</groundspeak:long_description>

Met up with Quailman2 as they were returning from this one.   After talking a bit, we all headed back so we could make the find and we could continue the conversation without loosing the little daylight left.   They joined us on another (abandoned hunt nearby due to time of day, and another search a little ways away.  They then agreed to join us for the &quot;Very Merry Unbirthday&quot;  TFTC.


Out with Cribbagewitch. On such a great caching day for Feb. We just had to do some caching. Thystle's &quot;Very Merry Unbirthday&quot; gathering was this evening so We decided to head towards that for our target area. and Found many Great hides along the day.

This park doesn't lend its self to much more than a micro but I thought that something should be placed here anyway. You will need to exercise stealth when recovering the cache or it probably will not last very long. If there are Muggles present you may want to try this one another day. There is plenty of parking. In fact, you can probably park within ten feet of the cache. Please obey the posted park hours when hunting this cache. Oh, and bring your own writing instrument as there is not one in the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

has been sitting in Emmenegger park for months, so I moved it here
for everyone to find. Dorkus was the FTF there, who will get it
first here?

From the parking coordinates, just follow the trail, it isn't a
direct route, but will get you there with the least amount of ups
&amp; downs. There are several benches along the way too. It is a
pretty area, and no one has placed a cache up here yet.

The coordinates listed above are NOT the correct ones needed to find this cache. You will need to do a little research before you will have the correct coordinates.

Jane Geocacher was invited to a potluck and she decided to bring two items - a fruit salad and a tossed vegetable salad. So, armed with her shopping list, she headed out to her local grocery store. This is her list:

    Bananas (6)

Back home, as she added her fruits &amp; veggies up into their respective salads, she realized that with only a little adjustment she had the coordinates for the potluck she had been invited to. So she SUBTRACTED 28 from the tossed vegetable salad getting the number ABCDE (checksum = 13) and SUBTRACTED 45 from the fruit salad getting the number FGHIJ (checksum = 25). Thus, she ended up with N 38° AB.CDE, W 090° FG.HIJ.

From where I parked you will have a .31-or so-mile hike to the general area of the cache. Half of the hike will be paved though it will be steep &amp; twisty at times. After the paving runs out, the path becomes packed dirt that at times - especially after rain - will be quite muddy. There will be a 150 foot or so bushwhack to reach the final. How difficult this will be depends on how you approach it. There is closer parking that could cut the walk in half if you can find it.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Quinette Cemetery is listed as the oldest African American cemetery west of the Mississippi River. It is believed that 125-150 people are buried here, mostly in unmarked graves. In the late 1980's this cemetery was given to the city of Kirkwood after many years of neglect. Since then many improvements have been made and a very nice memorial to the 5 known veterans who are buried here. Please take your time to look around this quiet wooded area, and read the plaques at the gate that tell the history of this place.

This park is at 12120 Old Big Bend Blvd.

This being a cemetery, no night caching and any logs indicating this was found at night will be deleted!</groundspeak:long_description>

I took a walk around the park looking for places where I could hide a cache. (sometimes it's not easy to find a good spot in these city parks.)

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a little multi-step micro that will take you on a short tour of a neighborhood very close to the one I grew up in.

Once upon a time there was a little girl who grew up in Webster Groves. Every other week or so, the girl would walk to the Library. Her path would take her through Webster Park, a neighborhood with twisting, winding roads lined with big houses – lots of interesting architecture. The streets are dotted with “islands” of grassy park-like areas. On her journey to the Library, the girl would walk across one of these “islands”. This “island” had the Very Best Climbing Tree Ever growing on it and the girl would often linger in its high branches on her way to or from the Library. Sadly, the tree is no longer there.

One summer, the day before summer vacation, the girl was riding her bike home from the store. She was racing her little brother and he was ahead of her so she decided to cut across another one of the “islands” to catch up. Unfortunately, there was a head-sized rock in her path that she did not see. The girl struck the rock with her front tire, lost control of her bike and crashed headlong into the street busting open her chin and elbow. This naturally precipitated a trip to the Emergency Room for a nice set of stitches (...just what her mother wanted to do the day before vacation...). Of course this meant that she could not go swimming for the entire vacation. Fortunately, the rock is now gone and they have built curbs around the “islands” so you can’t ride across them any more.

Later, when she was in High School, the girl would cross the “Big Island” as she walked the mile to the school. The “Big Island” is a large park-like “island” with mature trees sprinkled across it. The local people held annual Pig Roasts and Block Parties on it.

Your tour will take you to these three “islands” but not necessarily in the order presented. And, as you have no way of knowing which “island” had the Best Climbing Tree Ever on it or which “island” the girl crashed her bike on, you will have to follow my directions to find the final.

The above coordinates will take you your first “island” where you will find a plaque with two dates on it.

1. Add those two dates together and you will get a four-digit number: ABCD (for example: 1745 + 1854 = 3599).

2.Take AB and multiply by 3 then subtract 12 (example: 35 x 3 – 12 = 093). Add this number to the above North coordinate (example: N 35° 38.806 + 093 = N 35° 38.899).

3.Take CD and multiply by 2 then add 12 (example: 99 x 2 + 12 = 210). Subtract this number from the above West coordinate (example: W 090° 20.943 – 210 = W 090° 20.733).

These new coordinates will take you to the second “island” where you will receive instructions that will take you to the third “island and the final.

Enjoy the tour and remember: everything you are looking for is on the “islands”. Final is a blue M&amp;Ms container with a log and a small pencil. Total distance traveled will be under a half a mile and you can do it all in a motor vehicle, by bicycle or on foot .</groundspeak:long_description>

I run past this park all the time and I am surprised that it only had the one cache (until now). I've been looking for a place to hide this cache for awhile now, it's not easy to hide something larger then a micro in a city park. It will be nice to have a place close to home that I can drop of Tbs and coins. Please note the posted park curfew.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You are looking for a .50 caliber ammo box. This cache is a Fire Prevention cache. Since I work for this department I wanted to place something nearby that was educational as well as some goodies for the kids. I plan to keep this cache stocked with different types of fire preventional items. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located on the property of the Fairview Fire Department, and was placed with the approval of Fire Chief Bryan Doyle. You have been granted permision to access this cache by the fire department. Also, there is a police station nearby and they have been advised of this cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please park in the parking lot only, near the rear hydrant, not on the grass. It is not adviseable to try this cache after dark. There are some houses nearby, and with the police department close, it wouldn't be a good idea, so please be respectful of the time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If it is between the hours of 8AM - 4PM Monday - Friday, come on in and see us. Make sure to let us know you found the geocache. If we aren't busy we could even give the kids a look around in the station and trucks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to sgriffin618 for being the FTF!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache well maintained by the good folks of the Fairview Heights Fire Protection District. .50 Cal Ammo can well marked with large Fairview Heights Fire stickers on the two large sides. Easy to get turned around in the scrub and head off in the wrong direction into a dead end. If you think you are going the wrong way (getting trapped by overwhelming thickets), you probably are. Approach from the side facing the rear of the firehouse to ensure that you are on public property. Good luck!</groundspeak:text>

Another park on my typical running route. This park had a cache awhile ago, but it looks like the hiding spot is gone, I came by today determined to find a spot where I could hide this cache. I think I found the worst stinking spot in the park to hide a cache. Please note the posted park curfew.</groundspeak:long_description>

there is a home-made tag at the posted coordinates. The tag has
some handwritten coordinates that will take you to the final cache
location.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;This is a two-part cache, with the
coordinates for the final hidden at the posted coordinates. The tag
the coordinates are on is not attached to anything, and nothing
needs to be disassembled to find the tag.&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This was a simple cache placed
as an after breakfast treat on Saturday Sept. 20, 2003. I thought
it would be a nice spot for a bug drop, but the first waypoint was
way tougher than I expected. So enjoy the search for the first
waypoint, and sign the log at the final location to claim the
smiley.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

this a harder one, but the only thing hard in here is the
bushwhacking, and I didn't want to do that to everyone. But since I
walked all over the place, I decided to leave this out here. I have
another spot nearby I might be able to stick one in too.

There is a large log blocking the trail near the cache, bee
careful, there is a nest of them in there. The trail goes on for a
way, but I wasn't able to figure out the park boundry, and it is
just thick honeysuckle all through this area. I did an hour of
heavy bushwhacking through here, no good stumps or hollow trees.
Maybe I'll be sticking a really irritating one out here later.
Where I did hide the cache, there are several good places, I bet
you will get it within the first 5 you look in.

NOTICE: Please be respectful of the posted park hours. If you enter
the park after hours you are trespassing. If you are stopped you
can be ticketed or arrested and will put the future of geocaching
in the parks in

Special permission to hide caches in St. Louis County parks is NOT
needed as long as the Groundspeak rules are followed. &quot;Blanket
Permission&quot; has been worked out in advance with the park service.
DO NOT CALL THE PARK as they cannot handle the calls. The
Groundspeak cache reviewer does need to know exactly how and where
the caches are hidden and what type of containers are used. The
geocaching liaisons will notify the park service of new caches.
Remember NO AMMO BOXES or PVC PIPE
caches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Note to cache owner: might keep an eye on this one over the next few weeks.  1/2 the park was closed off and non-excessible apparently due to storm clean up in progress.  Since this large tree was on the path they may close off access to this area still to come. Think cache is safe and currently in good condition. </groundspeak:text>

You're looking for a slightly modified preform-type container. Shouldn't be hard to find. Bring your own writing instrument. If you've found Whitfield you'll know where to look.

The big dead tree is totally stripped of bark and all we found were scraps of paper, one from the top of the log page with Open Geocaching typed on it. We didn't find any parts of any container, just bits of white paper. We took a film canister and placed part of your log sheet in it, and a new log scroll too, which we signed.

We spent many weekends on the playground laying on the merry-go-round looking at the sky and dreaming about the lives we would live as adults.   So funny because now I think a lot about what life was like as a kid.  This will be a great find for the whole family, there is a wonderful paved walking trail, multiple playgrounds, pavilions, and ball fields.  Have a great time finding this cache, you’ll get a chance to experience my childhood. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Mike likes to hike. I have decided to add a few more hiking caches&lt;br/&gt;to the area. These caches are designed for you to get away from the&lt;br/&gt;car and enjoy a nice hike in one of our many beautiful parks. The&lt;br/&gt;point of these caches is the journey to the cache, not the cache&lt;br/&gt;itself. They aren't meant to be hard to find but they give you that&lt;br/&gt;extra reward while on the trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located along Governor Bates Trail in Faust Park. The&lt;br/&gt;trail is listed as 1.1 miles long and has two trailheads. The cache&lt;br/&gt;is located approximately halfway. You can make this a two mile hike&lt;br/&gt;if you wish. You are looking for a sandwich sized Lock N Lock&lt;br/&gt;container that is a short distance from the trail. It is fairly&lt;br/&gt;easy to get to the cache but a big climb back to your car when you&lt;br/&gt;are done!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTICE:&lt;br/&gt;Please be respectful of the posted park hours. If you enter the&lt;br/&gt;park after hours you are trespassing. If you are stopped you can be&lt;br/&gt;ticketed or arrested and will put the future of geocaching in the&lt;br/&gt;parks in jeopardy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special permission to hide caches in St. Louis County&lt;br/&gt;parks is NOT needed as long as the Groundspeak rules are followed.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Blanket Permission&quot; has been worked out in advance with the park&lt;br/&gt;service. DO NOT CALL THE PARK as they cannot handle the calls. The&lt;br/&gt;Groundspeak cache reviewer does need to know exactly how and where&lt;br/&gt;the caches are hidden and what type of containers are used. The&lt;br/&gt;geocaching liaisons will notify the park service of new caches.&lt;br/&gt;Remember NO AMMO BOXES or PVC PIPE&lt;br/&gt;caches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I was surprised to see so few caches in the North part of town. So&lt;br/&gt;I placed this one in O'Fallon park, a short walk into the woods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you probably know, this area is somewhat depressed, so I&lt;br/&gt;wouldn't suggest caching past dusk. That said, it is a cool&lt;br/&gt;neighborhood with a lot of neat stores and food joints nearby and&lt;br/&gt;is not particularly dangerous, just use your head. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's some info on O'Fallon park: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It had been a part of a vast 600-acre land holding of Colonel John&lt;br/&gt;O'Fallon, who came to St. Louis after being severely wounded at the&lt;br/&gt;Battle of Tippecanoe in the War of 1812. He was an assistant to his&lt;br/&gt;uncle William Clark, the &quot;Clark&quot; of the Lewis and Clark Expedition,&lt;br/&gt;then indian agent for St. Louis. O'Fallon made money rapidly buying&lt;br/&gt;and selling supplies to the army. Giving it away liberally, he&lt;br/&gt;became noted as a great philanthropist. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He retained the 160-acre area of the present O'Fallon Park as his&lt;br/&gt;estate and subdivided and sold the rest of his tract, which reached&lt;br/&gt;down to the Mississippi River. Atop the highest hill in his estate,&lt;br/&gt;O'Fallon built a huge four-story mansion of about 50 rooms with a&lt;br/&gt;tall columned front portico. He named his estate Athlone, after the&lt;br/&gt;Irish birthplace of his father. It is said that many Indian&lt;br/&gt;artifacts were unearthed during the excavation for the mansion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten years after O'Fallon's death in 1865, his heirs sold the estate&lt;br/&gt;to the city. In 1875, the mansion was damaged by fire and remained&lt;br/&gt;in a ruinous condition until 1893, when it was finally razed. Until&lt;br/&gt;the late 1880s, O'Fallon Park remained in a rather primitive state,&lt;br/&gt;but was used principally as driving park and picnic grounds. During&lt;br/&gt;the 1890s, a music stand and a park shelter with an observation&lt;br/&gt;tower was constructed and in 1896 the lake was completed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1904, an island was placed in the lake and retaining walls were&lt;br/&gt;erected around its perimeter. Boating became popular after the&lt;br/&gt;erection of the boathouse in 1908. Electric lighting came to the&lt;br/&gt;park in 1914 and three years later its area was enlarged by the&lt;br/&gt;addition of an 8 1/2-acre tract donated by the Catholic&lt;br/&gt;Archdiocese. Overall area of O'Fallon Park was reduced to about 127&lt;br/&gt;acres by the acquisition of right-of-way for Interstate Highway 70&lt;br/&gt;in 1954.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a 3-part multi-cache in the Weldon Springs Conservation Area. The first two are film canisters that have only coordinates of the next way point.&lt;br/&gt;The first two WPs are on the east side of Highway 94. Both are at least a .1 mile bushwhack off the Hamburg Trail.&lt;br/&gt;On the way to WP1 you will see a series of sign that say &quot;Restricted Area&quot;. These signs are for the area on the left side of the road away from the cache. It is OK to leave the road on the right side to find WP1.&lt;br/&gt;The final WP is a 6&quot; X 6&quot; Lock &amp; Lock container on the west side of Highway 94 and is off the Lost Valley Trail.&lt;br/&gt;If you do this complete cache by hiking the trail system it will be about a 6.5 mile trip from WP1 and back. You can do the first two WPs and the drive up to the parking lot near the Final WP. &lt;br/&gt;Once you leave the hard path to star the bushwack the ground can be pretty soft and muddy if it has rained recently. If you are doing this cache on bike it may be a good idea to leave your bike on the road and hike in on foot.&lt;br/&gt;This cache was places only after receiving a permit from John Vogel of the Missouri Department of Conservation. &lt;br/&gt;Be aware that hunting is allowed in this area during certain time of the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN1PBJD - GC1PBJD Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Final WP to Weldon Springs Area Multi&lt;br/&gt;PK1PBJD - GC1PBJD Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 38° 42.140 W 090° 42.645&lt;br/&gt;This is the best place to park to pick up WP1 &amp; WP2&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S21PBJD - GC1PBJD Stage 2&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;WP2 for Weldon Springs Area Multi Cache</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This should be a fairly easy cache along the trail around Mallard&lt;br/&gt;Lake in Creve Coeur County Park. Tolleybrew used to have a cache&lt;br/&gt;close to this one with a similar name but he archived it when he&lt;br/&gt;left town. I figured I would put another one up in it's place but&lt;br/&gt;had to move it because another cache had been placed too close to&lt;br/&gt;his original hiding place. If you start at the Lake House the trip&lt;br/&gt;to the cache is about 1 mile for a 2 mile round trip. The container&lt;br/&gt;is a small plastic jar that can hold a few trade items. There is a&lt;br/&gt;small flash light in the cache as a gift for the FTF on this cache.&lt;br/&gt;There is also a FTF geocoin in the cache that is on a mission.&lt;br/&gt;Whoever takes the FTF coins should see the coin's page before&lt;br/&gt;moving the coin.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTICE: Please be&lt;br/&gt;respectful of the posted park hours. If you enter the park after&lt;br/&gt;hours you are trespassing. If you are stopped you can be ticketed&lt;br/&gt;or arrested and will put the future of geocaching in the parks in&lt;br/&gt;jeopardy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special permission to&lt;br/&gt;hide caches in St. Louis County parks is NOT needed as long as the&lt;br/&gt;Groundspeak rules are followed. &quot;Blanket Permission&quot; has been&lt;br/&gt;worked out in advance with the park service.

I remembered after I got to the cache site that the cache page said something about a steep hill and then I remembered the hellatious rain last night and thought it might not be a good idea but I went on after the cache anyway. I slipped down the hill to the cache but coming back up was a real experience. If I had had my hiking boot on it wouldn't have been too bad, but I was wearing tennis shoes with a fairly smooth bottom and it was a real chore climbing up that muddy hill. I wouldn't recommend this cache after a downpour. thanks for placing this cache.

It can be wet and muddy depending on the seasons.  This cache is not accessible by wheelchair.  It is kid friendly.  It is next to a park entrance so traffic can be heavy at times.  A special thanks to Lt. Lee Smith with St Peters Park Rangers for granting permission.

You are looking for a small round black container just about twice the size of a 35mm film canister.  There is a log only so bring you own writing stick.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is in Laurel Park in St Peters. It can be a quick grab with some parking close. It is about 15 to 20 feet off the paved path. It can be wet and maybe muddy depending on the seasons.  This cache is not accessible by wheelchair, but kid friendly. A special thanks to Lt. Lee Smith with St Peters Park Rangers for granting permission.

You are looking for a small round black container just about twice the size of a 35mm film canister. There is a log only so bring you own writing stick.  Please leave cache and area as you found it, thanks.

Congrats to: Keike and Navy LT for FTF Honors </groundspeak:long_description>

The coordinates for the final on this cache are N38 47.4X5 W90 35.96X. At the above coordinates there is a sign in the ground at the tree. There is a two digit number on the face of the sign. Use the first digit in place of the X in the North coordinate. Use the second digit in place of the X in the West coordinate.

To help identify this tree: St. Peters City Centre; slow-growing, medium-sized tree; nuts are contained in leatherlike spiny husks containing a mahogany-colored seed; people have carried this tree’s seeds in their pockets for good luck and to prevent rheumatism, but these seeds are actually toxic to humans and livestock.

She sat in the Van While I walked down to locate.  At first I thought about stopping on the road long enough to search, but quickly gave that up since there was always a car coming from behind me and I would have time and they couldnt get around me.  I eventually gave in and parked the van down aways and walked it. Kept waiting for someone to stop and ask if I needed assistance but no one did.  Found cache Quickly when I reached ground zero and sat on a post nearby to sign and wait for a chance to replace when no one was passing by.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">It is extremely important to read all the description for this cache before attempting it.

On 12/22/08 I moved this cache and made it part of my Calhoun County Series.  So many people have indicated it is their all time favorite cache and done it as a milestone cache, I did not want to shut it down.  Since it has been moved about .2 miles, if you found it in the old location, you can log it again at this location. 

You should hike about .2 miles more after the cache until the trail ends.  The trail is real good to there and you get more great view.

Calhoun County is nice anytime, but particularly nice in the fall and winter. It is a very rural area with lots of spectacular scenery and wildlife.   I have had a series up here before, but I am shutting all but Titus Hollow and  Swan Lake down.  Of all my caches, the one people tell me their all time favorite most often is Titus Hollow.  So I am just moving Titus Hollow Cache a little ways.  If you logged it at its old location, you can log it again at its new location.  Swan Lake is a virtual and I am changing what you need to log the cache-so if you did it before, you can log it again. None of the caches should be hard to find-but I can assure you each and everyone of them is at a neat location.  There are sometimes flooding issues and sometime when the river is up, you may not be able to get some of the caches.  But all caches are designed to survive a flood.  Sometimes in the winter the ferries get closed due to ice.  But you can always get to the caches by crossing the river in Hardin.  My Free Garmin topo, trail, POI , maps at:
http://webpages.charter.net/jbensman/Maps.htm cover the area all the caches are in and have stuff on them that will help you.

This is a really special place.   But it has a terrain rating of 4, so you really need to read on to understand what you are getting into as there are dangers.  Many small children have done this without a problem, but you need to be careful.

Park around N39 03.040 W90 40.442.  The road continues, but it can be a muddy mess.  You do not want to experience what hikerbob did on August 26, 2001.   In the summer, there is a field of stinging nettle you have to get through, so have long pants.  Stay in the bottoms until about N39 02.887 W90 40.534 where there is a good location to climb about 40 feet up to the base of the bluff.  After that point it can be extremely difficult to get up to the base of the bluff.  From that point on, just follow the base of the bluff.

I cannot stress how beautiful this area is. It is one of the most beautiful places in the St. Louis area. But very few people know about this. You will be hiking below the base of 100 to 150 foot bluffs. On the other side of the trail is backwater lakes and then the Mississippi.

Most of the 1.5 mile round trip is along a “trail” well maybe you can call it a trail.  It is mostly a path about 1 to five foot wide.  But in some places it can be tricky and dangerous if you are not careful.  If you are afraid of heights, do not attempt this cache.  Most of the way you will be at the base of a bluff with a 50 - 100 foot extremely steep drop down into the river.

You should wear boots or good sandals.  I wear boots in the winter and Teva sandals the rest of the year.  A walking stick is also extremely helpful.  In the winter, there can be ice on the trail that you need to get around and a walking stick makes this much easier.

This is not an easy walk in the woods.  You have to be careful and take your time.  Many small kids have done it with no problem.  But I have been there with adults who were terrified and had to turn back.  Most people will not have any problems.  So I do not want to scare you off one of the neatest places in the area.  I just want you to be careful!

If you can get down a 200 foot cliff, you may be able to reach the cache from the CCS-Wilson Cemetery Cache. To do this cache, you have to hike from the parking areas in Titus Hollow. Furthermore, if you come from Wilson, you will miss the spectacular hike.  And while you may be able to get down from Wilson, you may not be able to get back up.

Most of this journey will be next to the bluff or under an overhang.  So unless you have a high sensitivity receiver that works well in tree cover, you will likely lose your signal while getting to the cache.  Even with a high sensitivity received, there will be accuracy problems with signal bounce.  I got the best coordinates I could, but they could be off.  So I will give you a description you should be able to find without a GPS.

You will be going through an area with a fairly wide path and you will see where a hunk of rocks fell off the cliff and formed a pile about 7 feet tall.  There is a space of about 5 feet between the pile and bluff.  On top of this pile of rocks is a hackberry tree.  You can tell a hackberry by its warty bark.  At the beginning of the pile next to the bluff there is a rock with a space under it.  The cache is under it with some rocks concealing it.  It is about 2/10ths of a mile before the trail ends.  I forgot to take my camera.  So if someone with a camera can take a picture of the spot, please email it to me and I will post it as a spoiler.

Had this one hidden for awhile, was going to make this a mystery cache but got too busy to think of clues. So, hope you enjoy the hide anyway. You can park within 4 feet of cach and use your car to hide from muggles. There shouldn't be many on this side of lot, but use your stealth mode anyway! [:)}</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache has room for log and small swag and tiny trackables. Bring your own writing utensil. Container can be difficult to open for kids sometimes if it has been sealed awhile. You just have to give it a bit of a squeeze. Close to busy road, use stealth due to muggleability factor.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Oquawka Cemetery is located in Oquawka, Il. It is a old river town along the Mississippi River. The town is in the spot that in the days of 1827 a Dr. Isaac Galland staked his claim to this sandy shoreline. Later it was sold to the father of S. S. Phelps who bought the claim for his son and paid $400.00 for it. Oquawka sloly became the town that it is now. I'm not sure when the cemetery started but it was sometime around the late 1820s. It is a large cemetery for this small town which leads me to believe it started when it did. There is many different styles of headstones here so take your time and find a interesting one. There are many civil war veterans buried here too. As before, be respectful while you are here. Thanks for visiting.</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache Container is a Nano; it contains only a log.

I placed this cache with my father-in-law.

My wife and I and her parents get together in this area about 2 - 3 times a year, since it is the mid-point between our homes.

you will then see the true beauty of this area. 100 foot high
bluffs, overlooks that you just don't find in Iowa. It's cool to
see this area in all four seasons. This area is jointly controlled
by Jones county and Dubuque county since it lands right on the
border of the two countys.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This cache I'm thinking will be a difficult one. Do to the lay out
of the area if you try to take the shortest way to each stage you
will be playing billy goat. But it you follow the nice wide mowed
trails, you will pretty much triple the distance you are hiking.
How you want to get there is completely up to you. I do recommend
taking some water as this area is really deceiving until you get
back in the canyon areas. I suggest you take a 30 foot length of
rope. It just may come in handy, but it's not required. If you have
vertigo problems this cache is not for you, you will be seeing some
steep bluff's. I wouldn't suggest small children do this one. But
other than that enjoy your visit.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Also in the lid of the final container you will find a clue for the
H.A.C. -Eagle Scout cache. This along with 10 other clues will get
you the starting location. I have set up a bookmark for finding
them on geocaching.com easily. &lt;b&gt;Please write your experience in
the log book instead of just signing and dating it&lt;/b&gt; Happy
caching!!!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Also I may be adjusting the ratings on this cache as I get input
from finders.</groundspeak:long_description>

Was at Whitewater Canyon a couple months to finish the &quot;Iowa's 12 Pack Challenge&quot; and the &quot;Eastern Iowa EarthCache Bingo&quot; challenge caches, but knew that I wouldn't have time that day to search for this one. Nope, definitely wouldn't have. Need about 2 hours or so, to make through the obstacle course. Tough to get a good fix at Stage 1. Ran an 5 minute/100% confidence fix after I found it here: N 42° 17.772 W 90° 54.847 . The rest of the stages were straight forward enough that I didn't need to check their numbers. Great hides in great places. Really liked the trek to and the location of the final. Almost like &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;. TNLNSL. Thanks for the awesome Open Cache!</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;h1&gt;The Walker House
Cache&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Adjacent to this cache location is the Walker House, built in 1836
as an upscale inn providing fine dining and a pub.  It was
built onto a pre-existing miner's former stone house.  This
inn has been remodled several times but has closed with each
venture.  On 1 November 1842 a man named William Caffee was
executed by a public hanging in front of the Walker House for the
murder of Samuel Southwick at Gratiot's Grove in February
1842.  It is said that Willaim lost his head during the
hanging.  It is believed that William haunts the Walker House
in a grey suit, headless, holding his head....&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Caffee's
Story&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 23, 1842 William Caffee attended a housewarming
party at Captain Fortunatus Berry's house in Gratiot's Grove,
Wisconsin.  After spending much time at the bar room he missed
his name being called to dance.  When he showed up to dance he
was informed that he had missed his chance.  Outraged he
grabbed the dance list shoved it in his pocket and stormed out of
Captain Berry's residence.  Sam Southwick pursued him picking
up a stick motioning it at Caffee to stop.  Caffee yelled
&quot;Stand back or I will kill you!&quot;  With that Caffee shot Samuel
Southwick in the chest.   Witnesses proclaimed 
Caffee then yelled, &quot;That's what you get for fooling with
me!&quot;  then he took off running.  He was sentenced to
death on September 24, 1842.  On November 1, 1842 reports of
three to four thousand people arrived to witness the
execution.  Caffee was led from the jail in a grey suit. 
He walked up to the wagon and seated himself on the coffin, a death
march was struck up and the procession moved forward to the place
of execution.  It is said that Caffee beated upon the coffin
to the beat of the death march.....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A great location hidden in the prairie of Iowa County, west of Dodgeville, Wisconsin.

This cache is located at the Iowa County Recreation &amp; Prairie Restoration site.  This used to be referred to the &quot;Pond by the County Farm&quot;.  It is located west of the Bloomfield Healthcare and Rehabilitation Center on County CH.  There is a road leading to parking on the left hand side of the road.  Unfortunately, the road is not on Google maps, but if you click “satellite” view you will see it on there.  At the entrance you will see the sign reading &quot;Iowa County Recreation &amp; Prairie Restoration” Entrance located at N 42° 57.603 W 090° 13.868

This is a beautiful spot and it's accessibility has greatly changed over the past decade.  I used to go here when I was young with my dad to go fishing in the pond.  Later as a Boy Scout I performed many service projects at this location.  One of them was installing Bluebird houses that are still along the fence line today.

You are looking for a waterproof case with camo tape.  There is a log book, a pen, and some small items.  You will not need to go walk or disturb any of the prairie, the trail will lead you to it.

Cache container is a camouflaged peanut butter jar with plenty of room for most small travelers.

Cache should be easy enough to find. There should be no need to go near the tie-out area or outdoor pens looking for this cache.

For your safety and that of the animals staying here, do not approach any animals that may be outside in the tie-out areas.

The volunteers and staff here should be aware of the cache and its location. Don't hesitate to tell them you are just there for the geocache if you are asked what you are up to.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is not at the above listed coordinates -- These coordinates can be used for parking, however. In order to locate the cache you must go for a short stroll through the UW-Marshfield/Wood County Arboretum.

The UW-Marshfield/Wood County Arboretum is a nice wooded stretch of land that has a pleasant series of trails running through it. In order to find this cache, you will need to assemble the proper coordinates. To do this you will need to visit five marker posts located along the Arboretum's trails. Each marker displays a number you will need to use to create the coordinates to the cache. The coordinates for each of these markers are provided as downloadable waypoints for your caching convenience.

Each marker is identified by an associated letter in this cache description.

Once you have the number off a marker, you can begin plugging them into the following equation to get the final coordinate solution:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;N44° 39.[A][B+C]
&lt;br/&gt;W90° 12.[C][D+E]
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Marker Waypoints:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint A: N 44° 39.788 W 090° 12.390
&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint B: N 44° 39.915 W 090° 12.444
&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint C: N 44° 39.846 W 090° 12.320

&lt;br/&gt;
This cipher text is a book cipher, but you won't need a book to solve it. Rather, at the provided coordinates is a large commemorative plaque that will be the key to solving the cipher text provided below. The portions of the cipher text that need to be decrypted consists of a paired number set (separated by a forward-slash). The first number represents the horizontal word rows on the plaque. The second number represents the position of the word in that row. All punctuation in the key text is ignored.
&lt;br/&gt;
Once you have the words identified, you'll have to decide how to use them to fully crack the cipher and get the coordinates you need. Don't worry, though, it shouldn't be too tough.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
[begin cipher]
&lt;br/&gt;+44° 8/3; 3/2; point 6/1; 11/6; 13/1;
