            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Ent. An Ent is a mythical being that resembles a tree. While Ents may resemble trees they are not trees. Ents are tree-herders or a sheppard of a sort. They watch after trees of the forest that they live in. If you have read the series The Lord of Rings by J.R.R. Tolken you have heard of an Ent. If you have seen the film adaptation by Peter Jackson you have seen what an Ent might look like. Treebeard is the Ent featured most in the story and led the Ents into battle against Saruman for destroying the forest to build his army of Orcs. Are Ents real? Most rational people would say “of course Ents are not real” but think about this; have you ever been in the woods by yourself and you would swear that you saw a tree move out of the corner of your eye? I’ve heard tales about “tree-walkers” that move around the woods on moonless nights……at any rate if Ents are real I hope they don’t mistake me for an Orc!

I think I was near it, but the woodland insects started to feast upon our flesh.  After the first few ticks that started to latch on us, we decided to call it quits.  Also there is to much litter in the area that also adds to the confusion.  A better hint or at least some kind of marker on the actual tree might make it a little bit more fun. </groundspeak:text>

Its lifelong mission: to explore strange new environs, to seek out new caches and new swag, to boldly go where no cacher has gone before. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to find a cache at the predetermined coordinates. Find this cache and you will be rewarded with a strong sense of accomplishment as this cache was intended to have a difficulty rating higher than the average PNG. Covert movement would be advised and best done in plain site with camera in hand. As always place cache back exactly as you found it and above all else, you are ordered to have fun while completing this mission. Do you accept this mission?</groundspeak:long_description>

I decided to make this as hard as possible and do it with a fireworks tent set up next to it on the day before 4th of July. I thought I did pretty well at not being seen, but as I was leaving, someone from the fireworks tent came over and asked if I was looking for the geocache. He told me a bunch of people had been looking for it. He knew a little about geocaching, and we talked for a few minutes. Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

Once a monument of grandeur now stands in memorial of a Rock-N-Roll Ghost Town. &lt;br/&gt;As you are approaching the cache site there is an old drive north of it that you can park at. This is along a busy highway so I wouldn’t recommend bringing children but if you do PLEASE keep an eye (and hand!) on them. Like in most of our listings we suggest that you bring a camera as camo for the muggles but this one really does make for a great photo opportunity!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a smaller lok-n-lok that will hold a few trackables that need to visit Tennessee or Mississippi and small swag items. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This sign has an electrical service near by but never attempt to tamper with any electrical device!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A commonly held belief in real estate, and many other endeavors, is that finding the proper location is vital for success. What defines a proper location changes with each person, as the definition is dependant on an individual's hierarchy of criteria. Caching is no different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some people rank ease of access high on their list of priorities. Others consider proximity to other caches important. Some value peace and solitude. Still others rank a scenic view as highly important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this cache is close, as the crow flies, to two interstates, it is not quickly accessible from either. Proximity to other caches? Nope, not this hide. The next closest hide is nearly two miles East of here and is in a different state. Peace and solitude? Sort of. Despite being in the potential sight of hundreds, if not thousands, of people you will most likely be alone while hunting this cache. A scenic view though is something you will have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now that I have rambled for a couple of paragraphs let me share some specifics about this cache. First, and this is important, you cannot get here from I-40. Can't do it. Don't even try. Instead take exit 1 from I-55. Then go South a short distance to the service road heading east. Be anti-Horace Greeley and go East. The next important thing to know is that you will end up driving down a dirt road. Do not fret as it is well maintained and in good shape. Unless it is flooded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did I mention high water? Hmmm. Not yet? Well I suppose now is as good a time as any to tell you. Most of the year this area is dry and can be safely accessed. There are times of the year however that this area contains a lot of water. It doesn't rise fast though so if the road is dry you are safe in hunting this cache. As a general rule of thumb look at the Mississippi river, if it is out of its banks do not hunt this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be looking for a magnetic matchstick holder on a signpost. It is a short distance from the road. Very short. Mere feet. The reason for the terrain rating is the thickness of the growth between the road and the signpost. As with all caches please replace the container as well or better than you found it. Also, due to the previously mentioned high water, please place the container as high on the post as you can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, and lest you miss the best part of this cache hunt, take a look to the East. It is, after all, all about location, location, location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We hope you enjoy finding the others as well as hunting for this tupperware container. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This geocache is a plastic container spray painted brown. It is hidden a short way off of hiking trail in Craighead Forest Park. In the cache, you will find a logbook and pen along with some swag to trade. Do not get discouraged if the first thing you find is not what you think you're looking for. &lt;br/&gt;Please do not remove/tamper with the “NOT FOR TRADE” items in the cache. Also remember to put cache components back the way you found them for other cachers to enjoy. If the cache needs maintenance or you have trouble locating the cache, please feel free to contact us so we may be of assistance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have placed a munzee game piece in the cache for the munzee players out there. Do not remove this as it is an official game piece. Thank you and happy caching&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

1st in this state.  We arrived here today from Paris Tennessee.  Although we are tired,I still had to log a lot of caches from yesterday and we were hungry since it was about supper time and we hadnt eaten since breakfast; we had to make a short cache run to a couple nearby ones just to say we cached some today.

Found quickly since we have seen many simular hides over the past few months.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

This location is such a place.  I visited here many times growing up and I'm sure there are many stories that the walls could tell such as first dates, a special gift, etc. etc.  Now, things are changing.  There is a new place to go, new stories to make, more people to meet and in the background there is this place, with an uncertain future and the custodian of tales growing old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This micro contains only a log so you will need a writing instrument.  There is no need to disturb any landscaping. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

1st in this state. We arrived here today from Paris Tennessee. Although we are tired,I still had to log a lot of caches from yesterday and we were hungry since it was about supper time and we hadnt eaten since breakfast; we had to make a short cache run to a couple nearby ones just to say we cached some today.

Found quickly,  Got the Caching bug out of our minds enough, now i have to get back and complete logging and get some rest so tomorrow we can CACHE ON DUDE&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

If you have a favorite stealth technique post it here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are a few to get you started thinking:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use a bible cover with a hollowed out book.  Place your GPS in the cavity and read and walk!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a measuring tape and pretend to measure stuff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a baby stroller with a canopy and put the GPS in the canopy.

You can Park your car along the circle out of the driveway that goes up to the office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you to Smokey Bear's friends. This geocache is a take only. The contents can change over time. Please fill out the log and take only one item per person. So please don't leave anything but your entry in the log. I have permission to have this cache here, from the District Ranger of the Poplar Bluff Ranger Station, of the Mark Twain National Forest (visit link)&lt;br/&gt;Remember only YOU can prevent Wildfires and this is a thank you for your work on preventing wildfires. If you're here during office hours please come up to the office and pick up some information on the forest. We have information on plants and animals and much more. Don't forget to tell them the Geocache brought you here!&lt;br/&gt;If the cache is empty or needs attention please let us know. The web site link above, will take you to information on the Forest.&lt;br/&gt;Also visit (visit link) Smokey's site, you can get color sheets and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After reading other descriptions and meeting a geocacher I wanted to add more information. So this is a place to get official Smokey Bear items. The first item is a Smokey Bear pin, it's a tie tack style Smokey with wings. When these are gone I will add more items, which could be erasers, pencils, pencil sharpeners, buttons, etc. If I need to I will find a new container for the items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So depending on what is available and when an item runs out it could be anything Smokey. If you want the comic book which is still in print you will have to ask at the office when it's open.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Hunting.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is a cut across just beyond here through the center so you can make a U turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you miss the side road go past take the next left and make a U turn then you will be inline for the side road,  There is parking at the turn of the side road. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This part of the Mark Twain National Forest was called the Clark National Forest up to the 70's.  To my surprise the back side of the current sign has Clark routed into it.  The employee of the National Forest are and have always been thrifty people.  We try not to waste anything.  This is not the first time I have seen a sign reused on the back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Administrative consolidation of the Mark Twain and Clark National Forests in Missouri occurred in 1953. Headquarters of the Mark Twain in Springfield, MO were moved to Rolla, MO and merged with the headquarters of the Clark. In announcing the reorganization of the administrative units in Missouri, Regional Forester Price pointed out that &quot;it is one of several being made to permit the Forest Service to operate within terms of the current budget and still provide customary degree of service at the District Ranger level&quot;. &quot; from http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/about/history/   I have met a few who knew the forest as Clark.  I'll try to add a little more when I lean the year the name was changed.  By the way the main office or Supervisor office is still in Rolla MO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container is bigger than a sandwich box but not much bigger.  There is a picture of the original contents.  Including a travel bug we pick up the other day.  Enjoy and please re-hide the cache when your done,   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is on part of the National Forest so it's in the wild woods.  I don't expect any problems with small animals but use caution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF goes to Satchamo 44, and thanks for adding the picture.</groundspeak:long_description>

I'm to the right of my old location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Missouri State Highway 172 goes past me.  People like to stop and park and take a ride on their horses or walk the trail. This is an trail head parking area for the Ozark Trail a National scenic trail.  So the parking lot is gravel but there are mud holes with water in them most the year.  I'm on the way to other geocaches at Lake Wappappello State Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need to know I moved, I did not like the poison Ivy.  Information is above me, and it shines in the dark.  I can hold very small items.  I started with (in my new location in my new container) a butterfly pin and two sets of wings.  After you find me you need to BYOP if you have a short pencil you could leave one with me.   After you sign, roll me back up and place me back where you found me.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you are at the cache location you are on part of the Mark Twain National Forest http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/marktwain/ (this is a link to the forest web site for more information)  .

Pavilion will be available soon for events, electric at some campsites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Mark Twain National Forest web site:&lt;br/&gt;Located adjacent to the Black River, Markham Springs Recreation Area gets its name from the former owner, M. J. Markham, who acquired the property in 1901 and operated a lumber mill at the site until the 1930s.  This recreation area consists of a small (12-site) modern campground with single and double campsites that have electric hook-ups, primitive camping loops in a wooded setting near the Black River; a day use area with a 2-acre, 20 foot deep mill pond that dates back to the 1800s, several picnic sites, open fields; river access for boating, fishing and float tubes and canoes; and short hiking trails that provide views of the river, the pond, the springs and the uplands.  Six springs pour almost 5 million gallons of water a day into the pond, and the bubble spring, a smaller outlet of Markham Spring outside of the pond area that has air with it, rises in soft sand forming the unique “air bubbles”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look around it's a nice place and say hello to the Campground host.  They are from the area and would love to talk to you.&lt;br/&gt;           &lt;br/&gt;FTF goes to Naked1, one of three FTF's found today his &quot;trifecta&quot;.</groundspeak:long_description>

These four short hiking trails total about 4 miles, and provide varying levels of difficulty or challenge. They range from the easy, flat 0.2 mile Bubble Springs Trail to the 1.5 mile Eagle Bluff Trail, which is narrower and has pitches with &amp;gt;25% slopes. These trails provide views of the Black River, the historic house, mill pond and wheelhouse located at Markham Springs, and an abundance of wildflowers. There are no amenities available along the trail, but drinking water, vault toilets, picnic and camping facilities are available within the Markham Springs Recreation Area.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have Fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF to Naked1, &quot;trifecta&quot; for the area of FTFs, I knew if he had the time he would get these.</groundspeak:long_description>

Joshua (Josiah) Barton &amp; Jean (Jane) DuBart. Sarah Barton married the Rev. William Murphy, Sr. between his first wife's death of 1761 and the year 1767 in Halifax County, Virginia. William [Sr.] and Sarah were the parents of Tabitha Murphy Gentry, David Murphy, Sarah Murphy Evans, Dubart Murphy, Richard Murphy, Isaac Murphy and Jessie Murphy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rev. William Murphy, Sr. had acquired a land grant from the Spaniards in 1798 in the Louisiana Territory. In 1799 en route to Tenessee he died in Kentucky while retrieving his family to relocate what would become the Murphy Settlement. Sarah Barton Murphy was determined to follow her late husbands's wishes and with the help of her sons and step-son, she took all her belongings on a flat-bottom boat, went down the Holston River to the Ohio River and up the Mississippi to arrive in Ste. Genevieve along the river in 1802. Her sons David &amp; Richard &amp; stepson William had already set up the settlement arriving in 1800. See her story as the founder of the first Sunday School west of the Mississippi on the St. Francois County web-page at The Sarah Barton Murphy Story (Link above) From the www.findagrave.com web site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She is listed in several other sites.&lt;br/&gt;The local DAR chapter bares her name with honor.  This part of the forest is just a little reminder of an important woman of the area.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF goes to 60CGarsee !!!!!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have permission to place this cache on the Mark Twain National Forest.</groundspeak:long_description>

you are done. Amidon is a beautiful place, and the view from the
cache is nice. Don't bring any glass, $250.00 fine per bottle. The
whole trail is about 1 mile, you will pass within about 125 ' of
the cache if you stay on the trail.

This cache is near the top of the hill over the Castor River.
Follow the path to the Shut-ins, then on down the marked path
towards the cache. Stay on the path until you are near the cache.
As you are standing looking out over the valley, and taking in the
fantastic view, you will see a drop off of about 8 feet. As you
stand near this drop off, you will see a pile of rocks on top of a
short stump down below. The cache is within 30' of this pile of
rocks. This cache has been moved again and is reloggable again for
all finders who found it before the L Franks. At this time it is a
large plastic jar hidden in the rocks.

After a nice hike into the Shut-Ins, we got down to the business of finding the cache.  Found the stump and the rocks after a few false starts.  Also found a wasp nest somewhere in the vicinity -- I think it was in a dead tree close by, standing up by itself.  Found the cache; it was well hidden and in good shape.
  
Chalkdusty give her new anti-snake/walking stick its baptism of fire leaving the cache site -- a black rat snake was stretched out across the path as we were making our way back to the car.  Mr. Snake was hurried along (gently) and again all was well.  (I tried to convince Chalkdusty that he was a pretty cute snake, all things considered, but she wasn't having anything to do with that...)

Hawn State Park. It is a camouflaged ammo box under a rock, reached
through a crevice. This cache is approximatly .70 miles from the
parking lot.

This cache is the one I hid for the Midwest Invitational Geocaching
Competition. I moved it to this spot to leave for a while, so
everybody can find it. It is a &quot;new&quot; cache. The nearby tree had a
tag and a punch hidden on it. Enjoy the view from up here, and the
rest of your stay at this great park. Taking the ski lift up to the
cache will result in log deletion!!

all of you tag picker-uppers, or hikers who just gotta get a cache

After you cross the second walking bridge over the creek, head off
to the left. The cache is up on a hill, only a short climb up,
under the lowest overhang. It is not up in the bluff.

This should be an easy find once you view it from the right, or is
that the wrong side. Cache is a short walk off the path through the
grass. Please, let's try not to develop a social trail to GZ. I
come down to this park often to go for a run, and I figured this
would be an interesting place to hide a cache. This is a HIGH
muggle area, so turn your stealth mode up to full power. Please
observe the park curfew.  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;






 
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTICE: Please be
respectful of the posted park hours. If you enter the park after
hours you are trespassing. If you are stopped you can be ticketed
or arrested and will put the future of geocaching in the parks in
jeopardy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a replacement/commemorative cache for GCHEGB (MO’s Above it All). I had found that cache four years ago on 12/20/2006, it was my very first cache find. I went to check on it and was surprised to see that it had been archive, so I figured I would place a new cache in that general location. The cache is a lock-n-lock with a water proof log and a few trade items. Please place the cache back where you found it and make sure it’s covered up/hidden well. Terrain rating is high for a reason, don’t attempt this cache when the ground is icy/muddy and this might not be the best cache for pets, children and people who are afraid of heights. &lt;br/&gt;		&lt;br/&gt;  	NOTICE: Please be respectful of the posted park hours. If you enter the park after hours you are trespassing. If you are stopped you can be ticketed or arrested and will put the future of geocaching in the parks in jeopardy. &lt;br/&gt;		&lt;br/&gt;  	Special permission to hide caches in St. Louis County parks is NOT needed as long as the Groundspeak rules are followed. &quot;Blanket Permission&quot; has been worked out in advance with the park service. DO NOT CALL THE PARK as they cannot handle the calls. The Groundspeak cache reviewer does need to know exactly how and where the caches are hidden and what type of containers are used. The geocaching liaisons will notify the park service of new caches. Remember NO AMMO BOXES or PVC PIPE caches.&lt;br/&gt;	</groundspeak:long_description>

With each cache the terrain rating will get progressively more difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you squint your eyes, blur your vision and allow your imagination to run wild you might just be able to envision a Roman Temple was once built near here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, really, I decided to name this cache Roman Temples? because it is *near* the former location of the final of RGS’s “The Roman” cache. Actually it’s about a quarter mile from where that cache once was…but I thought I would continue with the theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a small Tupperware type container hidden about 100 feet up a very steep hill. The hill has at least a 45º angle to it and can be very slippery. This hide is also a little different from the other two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make no mistake – this can be evil, nasty, curse-me-every-foot-of-the-way-as-you-tumble-a**-over-tea-kettle-down-the-hill type terrain. That is why I rated it four and one half stars! It is NOT SUPPOSED to be easy! So use extra caution here.</groundspeak:long_description>

All you have to do is get there and find it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the distance to the cache from the suggested parking is a bit over 1/2 mile as the crow (or is that Crowe?) flies so the actual distance, depending upon how you approach the cache, will be more. And, if you approach the cache from below, you may have to go about 350 feet up a very steep hill to reach the cache site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, and by the way, look out for dragons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suggested parking at Lat: 38.31.817 Long: 90.43.051&lt;br/&gt;While you're out here don't forget to find Strider's Mercy!!! ! and the two clever bonus caches associated with it.&lt;br/&gt;Permits &amp; permission to place this cache issued by the Missouri Department of Conservation.</groundspeak:long_description>

Got to see a Blue Runner snake about 4 feet long on the way to this one from the previous cache on the trail.  
Didnt find any bottle, but a small king snake was sitting about 6 foot away from the cache pointing to it instead. 
Cache was in great condition.  Thanks for hide and bringing us to this area.  

PS.  MISQUITOS WERE IN SWARMS TODAY IN THE PARK!.

So I sez to Strider &quot;Ya wanna wander on down the trail a bit and see if we can find a place to stash this thingy?&quot; And he sez &quot;Sure, why not?&quot; So we wander on down the trail a piece and when we reach .10 mile from the last cache we start lookin' around. We look at this and we look at that and eventually we find this other thing. &quot;This looks like a likely spot&quot; sez I. &quot;Yeah. Pretty obvious tho&quot; sez he. &quot;Well, I'm gonna put it here anyway. Maybe I'll hide something much more devious this winter once all the greenery dies down. Meanwhile, this'll do.&quot; sez I. So I stashed the preform right there. Y'all come out now &amp; find it. </groundspeak:long_description>

It will start off being stocked with goodies that little boys might like to have. I hope that traded items will follow that theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located about 50 feet off a walking/biking/skating path in Valley Park. From the recommended parking – N 38° 33.232, W 090° 27.881 - you can walk/bike/skate .2 miles to Simpson Park, .9 miles to Greentree Park and/or .9 miles to Meramec Landing Park. Or you could just go off the path and look for this cache. Off-trail the terrain can get a little rough and overgrown and, as it is very close to the river, could be prone to flooding if the river gets too high. People under 5'4&quot; tall will need a &quot;step stool&quot; to reach the cache. I have placed one near by but I don't expect that one to last very long...</groundspeak:long_description>

Met up with Quailman2 as they were returning from this one.   After talking a bit, we all headed back so we could make the find and we could continue the conversation without loosing the little daylight left.   They joined us on another (abandoned hunt nearby due to time of day, and another search a little ways away.  They then agreed to join us for the &quot;Very Merry Unbirthday&quot;  TFTC.


Out with Cribbagewitch. On such a great caching day for Feb. We just had to do some caching. Thystle's &quot;Very Merry Unbirthday&quot; gathering was this evening so We decided to head towards that for our target area. and Found many Great hides along the day.

You will need to exercise stealth when recovering the cache or it probably will not last very long. If there are Muggles present you may want to try this one another day. There is plenty of parking. In fact, you can probably park within ten feet of the cache. Please obey the posted park hours when hunting this cache. Oh, and bring your own writing instrument as there is not one in the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

has been sitting in Emmenegger park for months, so I moved it here
for everyone to find. Dorkus was the FTF there, who will get it
first here?

From the parking coordinates, just follow the trail, it isn't a
direct route, but will get you there with the least amount of ups
&amp; downs. There are several benches along the way too. It is a
pretty area, and no one has placed a cache up here yet.

Out with Cribbagewitch. On such a great caching day for Feb. We just had to do some caching. Thystle's &quot;Very Merry Unbirthday&quot; gathering was this evening so We decided to head towards that for our target area. and Found many Great hides along the day.

You will need to do a little research before you will have the correct coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jane Geocacher was invited to a potluck and she decided to bring two items - a fruit salad and a tossed vegetable salad. So, armed with her shopping list, she headed out to her local grocery store. This is her list:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Bananas (6)&lt;br/&gt;    Boston Lettuce (15)&lt;br/&gt;    Bunch of Carrots (17)&lt;br/&gt;    Cameo Apples (14)&lt;br/&gt;    Cantaloupe (9)&lt;br/&gt;    Cherry Tomatoes (26)&lt;br/&gt;    Mangos (Red) (10)&lt;br/&gt;    Pineapple (Large) (13)&lt;br/&gt;    Radicchio (22)&lt;br/&gt;    Red Bell Pepper (26)&lt;br/&gt;    Red Grapes (9)&lt;br/&gt;    Red Leaf Lettuce (16)&lt;br/&gt;    Watercress (18)&lt;br/&gt;    Watermelon (Seedless) (9)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back home, as she added her fruits &amp; veggies up into their respective salads, she realized that with only a little adjustment she had the coordinates for the potluck she had been invited to. So she SUBTRACTED 28 from the tossed vegetable salad getting the number ABCDE (checksum = 13) and SUBTRACTED 45 from the fruit salad getting the number FGHIJ (checksum = 25). Thus, she ended up with N 38° AB.CDE, W 090° FG.HIJ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From where I parked you will have a .31-or so-mile hike to the general area of the cache. Half of the hike will be paved though it will be steep &amp; twisty at times. After the paving runs out, the path becomes packed dirt that at times - especially after rain - will be quite muddy. There will be a 150 foot or so bushwhack to reach the final. How difficult this will be depends on how you approach it. There is closer parking that could cut the walk in half if you can find it.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is believed that 125-150 people are buried here, mostly in unmarked graves. In the late 1980's this cemetery was given to the city of Kirkwood after many years of neglect. Since then many improvements have been made and a very nice memorial to the 5 known veterans who are buried here. Please take your time to look around this quiet wooded area, and read the plaques at the gate that tell the history of this place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This park is at 12120 Old Big Bend Blvd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This being a cemetery, no night caching and any logs indicating this was found at night will be deleted!</groundspeak:long_description>

He was standing out front with a pair of binoculars looking right at me. I decided to come back and look for the final some other time. Hopefully you will be able to find this cache with out too much trouble. Please note the posted park curfew.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a little multi-step micro that will take you on a short tour of a neighborhood very close to the one I grew up in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once upon a time there was a little girl who grew up in Webster Groves. Every other week or so, the girl would walk to the Library. Her path would take her through Webster Park, a neighborhood with twisting, winding roads lined with big houses – lots of interesting architecture. The streets are dotted with “islands” of grassy park-like areas. On her journey to the Library, the girl would walk across one of these “islands”. This “island” had the Very Best Climbing Tree Ever growing on it and the girl would often linger in its high branches on her way to or from the Library. Sadly, the tree is no longer there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One summer, the day before summer vacation, the girl was riding her bike home from the store. She was racing her little brother and he was ahead of her so she decided to cut across another one of the “islands” to catch up. Unfortunately, there was a head-sized rock in her path that she did not see. The girl struck the rock with her front tire, lost control of her bike and crashed headlong into the street busting open her chin and elbow. This naturally precipitated a trip to the Emergency Room for a nice set of stitches (...just what her mother wanted to do the day before vacation...). Of course this meant that she could not go swimming for the entire vacation. Fortunately, the rock is now gone and they have built curbs around the “islands” so you can’t ride across them any more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later, when she was in High School, the girl would cross the “Big Island” as she walked the mile to the school. The “Big Island” is a large park-like “island” with mature trees sprinkled across it. The local people held annual Pig Roasts and Block Parties on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your tour will take you to these three “islands” but not necessarily in the order presented. And, as you have no way of knowing which “island” had the Best Climbing Tree Ever on it or which “island” the girl crashed her bike on, you will have to follow my directions to find the final.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The above coordinates will take you your first “island” where you will find a plaque with two dates on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Add those two dates together and you will get a four-digit number: ABCD (for example: 1745 + 1854 = 3599).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.Take AB and multiply by 3 then subtract 12 (example: 35 x 3 – 12 = 093). Add this number to the above North coordinate (example: N 35° 38.806 + 093 = N 35° 38.899).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.Take CD and multiply by 2 then add 12 (example: 99 x 2 + 12 = 210). Subtract this number from the above West coordinate (example: W 090° 20.943 – 210 = W 090° 20.733).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These new coordinates will take you to the second “island” where you will receive instructions that will take you to the third “island and the final.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the tour and remember: everything you are looking for is on the “islands”. Final is a blue M&amp;Ms container with a log and a small pencil. Total distance traveled will be under a half a mile and you can do it all in a motor vehicle, by bicycle or on foot .</groundspeak:long_description>

I've been looking for a place to hide this cache for awhile now, it's not easy to hide something larger then a micro in a city park. It will be nice to have a place close to home that I can drop of Tbs and coins. Please note the posted park curfew.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You are looking for a .50 caliber ammo box. This cache is a Fire Prevention cache. Since I work for this department I wanted to place something nearby that was educational as well as some goodies for the kids. I plan to keep this cache stocked with different types of fire preventional items. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache is located on the property of the Fairview Fire Department, and was placed with the approval of Fire Chief Bryan Doyle. You have been granted permision to access this cache by the fire department. Also, there is a police station nearby and they have been advised of this cache. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please park in the parking lot only, near the rear hydrant, not on the grass. It is not adviseable to try this cache after dark. There are some houses nearby, and with the police department close, it wouldn't be a good idea, so please be respectful of the time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is between the hours of 8AM - 4PM Monday - Friday, come on in and see us. Make sure to let us know you found the geocache. If we aren't busy we could even give the kids a look around in the station and trucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations to sgriffin618 for being the FTF!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache well maintained by the good folks of the Fairview Heights Fire Protection District. .50 Cal Ammo can well marked with large Fairview Heights Fire stickers on the two large sides. Easy to get turned around in the scrub and head off in the wrong direction into a dead end. If you think you are going the wrong way (getting trapped by overwhelming thickets), you probably are. Approach from the side facing the rear of the firehouse to ensure that you are on public property. Good luck!</groundspeak:text>

there is a home-made tag at the posted coordinates. The tag has
some handwritten coordinates that will take you to the final cache
location.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;This is a two-part cache, with the
coordinates for the final hidden at the posted coordinates. The tag
the coordinates are on is not attached to anything, and nothing
needs to be disassembled to find the tag.&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This was a simple cache placed
as an after breakfast treat on Saturday Sept. 20, 2003. I thought
it would be a nice spot for a bug drop, but the first waypoint was
way tougher than I expected. So enjoy the search for the first
waypoint, and sign the log at the final location to claim the
smiley.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

this a harder one, but the only thing hard in here is the
bushwhacking, and I didn't want to do that to everyone. But since I
walked all over the place, I decided to leave this out here. I have
another spot nearby I might be able to stick one in too.

There is a large log blocking the trail near the cache, bee
careful, there is a nest of them in there. The trail goes on for a
way, but I wasn't able to figure out the park boundry, and it is
just thick honeysuckle all through this area. I did an hour of
heavy bushwhacking through here, no good stumps or hollow trees.
Maybe I'll be sticking a really irritating one out here later.
Where I did hide the cache, there are several good places, I bet
you will get it within the first 5 you look in.

Note to cache owner: might keep an eye on this one over the next few weeks.  1/2 the park was closed off and non-excessible apparently due to storm clean up in progress.  Since this large tree was on the path they may close off access to this area still to come. Think cache is safe and currently in good condition. </groundspeak:text>

&lt;h2&gt;Brawny Bear Clan's Country Roads Series&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome to the Country Roads of St. Charles County. There are so
many neat areas worth pointing out that are somewhat
historical,educational and scenic. This series will take you to
some of these locations or close enough to be pointed out. Some
just take you down some great roads that follow a creek or farm
field. Not too many people get out to these parts of St. Charles
County so we wanted to give you an opportunity to take a drive and
see what this part of the county has to offer. A couple of caches
will take you into Warren county just slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most of these caches are park and grabs but, please note that
there are chiggers, ticks and poison ivy in various areas. Use
caution retrieving the cache. Make sure you place everything back
just as you found it so the next person can have as much fun
hunting as you did.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although almost all caches are placed along the SCC ROW (Saint
Charles County - Right of Way) and none are placed on private
property, please use caution when retrieving the caches as creeks
will rise and roads could become impassible. Use common sense
during high water and heavy rains. Make sure you watch for traffic.
These are mostly dirt and gravel roads but you still have to watch
for cars and trucks and farm equipment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is placed along the SCC ROW (Look for the sign).&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We were Successfull on both goals.  If Figured correctly we matched our best day today.   I really enjoyed this CRS series.  Some great views, some great backroad travels.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome to the Country Roads of St. Charles County. There are so
many neat areas worth pointing out that are somewhat historical,
educational and scenic. This series will take you to some of these
locations or close enough to be pointed out. Some just take you
down some great roads that follow a creek or farm field. Not too
many people get out to these parts of St. Charles County so we
wanted to give you an opportunity to take a drive and see what this
part of the county has to offer. A couple of caches will take you
into Warren county just slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Most of these caches are park and grabs but, please note that there
are chiggers, ticks and poison ivy in various areas. Use caution
retrieving the cache. Make sure you place everything back just as
you found it so the next person can have as much fun hunting as you
did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Although almost all caches are placed along the SCC ROW (Saint
Charles County - Right of Way) and none are placed on private
property, please use caution when retrieving the caches as creeks
will rise and roads could become impassible. Use common sense
during high water and heavy rains. Make sure you watch for traffic.
These are mostly dirt and gravel roads but you still have to watch
for cars and trucks and farm equipment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is placed close to the Beer Farm. The Beer farm is
known as the Daniel Boone Stables and offers horseback lessons,
boarding and care for equines. The cache is not located on their
property but off the road in a SCC ROW. Cache is in an old stump.
This is where I use to keep my trailers and have also hunted out
here a few times. As you look at the fences, I helped run a few of
them too.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was on a cache repair mission today with Crowesfeat30 &amp; we went looking for this cache. The big dead tree is totally stripped of bark and all we found were scraps of paper, one from the top of the log page with Open Geocaching typed on it. We didn't find any parts of any container, just bits of white paper. We took a film canister and placed part of your log sheet in it, and a new log scroll too, which we signed. Thanks Tsunami~ sorry to be the bearer of bad news.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome to the Country Roads of St. Charles County. There are so
many neat areas worth pointing out that are somewhat
historical,educational and scenic. This series will take you to
some of these locations or close enough to be pointed out. Some
just take you down some great roads that follow a creek or farm
field. Not too many people get out to these parts of St. Charles
County so we wanted to give you an opportunity to take a drive and
see what this part of the county has to offer. A couple of caches
will take you into Warren county just slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most of these caches are park and grabs but, please note that
there are chiggers, ticks and poison ivy in various areas. Use
caution retrieving the cache. Make sure you place everything back
just as you found it so the next person can have as much fun
hunting as you did.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although almost all caches are placed along the SCC ROW (Saint
Charles County - Right of Way) and none are placed on private
property, please use caution when retrieving the caches as creeks

during high water and heavy rains. Make sure you watch for traffic.
These are mostly dirt and gravel roads but you still have to watch
for cars and trucks and farm equipment!&lt;/p&gt;

Today, CribbageWitch and I decided to go after the BBC's CRS series.  But first we should clean up the BBC's STS series. We were Successfull on both goals.  If Figured correctly we matched our best day today.   I really enjoyed this CRS series.  Some great views, some great backroad travels.  Thanks for the fun Series.</groundspeak:text>

There is heavy brush in the area, so bushwhacking will be required to reach the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oak Knoll is a huge, beautiful park, but I noticed there was only one cache in the entirety of the park, which seemed a shame, so we took a little adventure until we found what seemed like the perfect spot. The cache is a small clear container, containing small trade items and a log, but you'll need to bring a pen or pencil to sign said log. Best of luck to all of you. :D   </groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome to the Country Roads of St. Charles County. There are so
many neat areas worth pointing out that are somewhat
historical,educational and scenic. This series will take you to
some of these locations or close enough to be pointed out. Some
just take you down some great roads that follow a creek or farm
field. Not too many people get out to these parts of St. Charles
County so we wanted to give you an opportunity to take a drive and
see what this part of the county has to offer. A couple of caches
will take you into Warren county just slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most of these caches are park and grabs but, please note that
there are chiggers, ticks and poison ivy in various areas. Use
caution retrieving the cache. Make sure you place everything back
just as you found it so the next person can have as much fun
hunting as you did.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although almost all caches are placed along the SCC ROW (Saint
Charles County - Right of Way) and none are placed on private
property, please use caution when retrieving the caches as creeks
will rise and roads could become impassible. Use common sense
during high water and heavy rains. Make sure you watch for traffic.
These are mostly dirt and gravel roads but you still have to watch
for cars and trucks and farm equipment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is placed along the SCC ROW (Look for the sign).&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

He apparently heard us coming so was walking back to his vehicle when We pulled up beside him and joined him in the hunt.  The tree cover here was playing a little with our GPSrs but, I finally got mine to settle long enough to come up with this one.  TFTC.

Today, CribbageWitch and I decided to go after the BBC's CRS series.  But first we should clean up the BBC's STS series. We were Successfull on both goals.  If Figured correctly we matched our best day today.   I really enjoyed this CRS series.  Some great views, some great backroad travels.  Thanks for the fun Series.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache is located near Historical Marker commemorating route of 1904 Olympic Marathon held in St. Louis, Missouri. This race was dubbed “Marathon from Hell” for many reasons. This cache is not. Cache is a peanut butter jar, big enough for tradable items.  I have ‘seeded’ cache with Olympic pins.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone familiar with St. Louis and its summers knows August can be brutally hot and humid, not good conditions for an endurance race. The route, at that time, was not paved and the horse and carriage clearing the route, along with officials and trainers, in automobiles, left the runners in the dust and exhaust.  The route was 25 miles and consisted of seven steep hills. There was only one water stop, halfway through the route. Of the 36 entrants, only 32 actually competed, of these 32 athletes, only 18 finished the marathon.&lt;br/&gt;The first runner to cross the finish line was celebrated wildly, Alice Roosevelt, the president’s daughter, was about to hand him the gold medal, when he confessed that he had actually quit the race, caught a ride with his trainer. When his trainer’s car broke down, he trotted the remaining route, to the finish line, so he could retrieve his clothing.  The official winner, T. J. Hicks, had help along the route, his trainer provided strychnine and brandy to keep him going. He was supported to the finish line and collapsed before he could receive his medal. &lt;br/&gt;This was the first time Africans Athletes were allowed to compete in an Olympic venue. These two runners were actually part of an exhibit from the nearby World’s Fair. They finished the race in ninth and 12th place. It is speculated that the ninth place finisher may have done better had he not been chased a mile off course by a dog.  &lt;br/&gt;The story about the Cuban, Felix Carvajal,(bib #3, see photo below) is extremely interesting and funny. After quitting his job, he begged and raced street folk to earn enough money to get to St. Louis. On his way, he lost all his money, in a New Orleans crap game, so he had to hitchhike his way to the Games. He arrived just before the marathon began. He ran the marathon in his street pants, long sleeve shirt and shoes. Moments before the race was to begin, a fellow athlete cut his pants to the knee.  Apparently he was quite jovial along the route and had no trouble, until spied an apple orchard and got hungry.  The apples were bad which caused him to get ill and lay down.  After recovering, Felix returned to the race and finished in fourth place.&lt;br/&gt;I had a lot of fun researching and learning about the 1904 Olympic Marathon. I hope you enjoy this cache and area. Please respect the neighbors-&lt;br/&gt;Thanks and Happy Caching &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF honors go to Da Fab Four, congratulation!&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We spent many weekends on the playground laying on the merry-go-round looking at the sky and dreaming about the lives we would live as adults.   So funny because now I think a lot about what life was like as a kid.  This will be a great find for the whole family, there is a wonderful paved walking trail, multiple playgrounds, pavilions, and ball fields.  Have a great time finding this cache, you’ll get a chance to experience my childhood. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Mike likes to hike. I have decided to add a few more hiking caches&lt;br /&gt;to the area. These caches are designed for you to get away from the&lt;br /&gt;car and enjoy a nice hike in one of our many beautiful parks. The&lt;br /&gt;point of these caches is the journey to the cache, not the cache&lt;br /&gt;itself. They aren't meant to be hard to find but they give you that&lt;br /&gt;extra reward while on the trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache is located along Governor Bates Trail in Faust Park. The&lt;br /&gt;trail is listed as 1.1 miles long and has two trailheads. The cache&lt;br /&gt;is located approximately halfway. You can make this a two mile hike&lt;br /&gt;if you wish. You are looking for a sandwich sized Lock N Lock&lt;br /&gt;container that is a short distance from the trail. It is fairly&lt;br /&gt;easy to get to the cache but a big climb back to your car when you&lt;br /&gt;are done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTICE:&lt;br /&gt;Please be respectful of the posted park hours. If you enter the&lt;br /&gt;park after hours you are trespassing. If you are stopped you can be&lt;br /&gt;ticketed or arrested and will put the future of geocaching in the&lt;br /&gt;parks in jeopardy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special permission to hide caches in St. Louis County&lt;br /&gt;parks is NOT needed as long as the Groundspeak rules are followed.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Blanket Permission&quot; has been worked out in advance with the park&lt;br /&gt;service. DO NOT CALL THE PARK as they cannot handle the calls. The&lt;br /&gt;Groundspeak cache reviewer does need to know exactly how and where&lt;br /&gt;the caches are hidden and what type of containers are used. The&lt;br /&gt;geocaching liaisons will notify the park service of new caches.&lt;br /&gt;Remember NO AMMO BOXES or PVC PIPE&lt;br /&gt;caches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

   Alien!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE PROCESSING - T O P S E C R E T&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we have learned that an alien craft has crashed somewhere
in the Weldon Spring Area. We are unable to confirm the exact
location and must send a team to the site to verify and recover.
This mission will be held in strict confidence and will remain top
secret only to those with the highest clearance levels. To ensure
that confidentiality is maintained, we can only verify the
following facts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Verizon Radar Site at N38 46.569 / W090 46.217 confirmed
the landing at 149 degrees true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The NOAA Radar Site at N38 41.933 / W090 41.008 confirmed the
landing at 250 degrees true&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distances were not known at this time but the NOAA Site had a
better visual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinpoint the landing and investigate!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE! Operation Cornhusk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller, Maxwell and Smith have arrived at the location and
recovered the space craft. However, there was no life forms on
board. The search and recovery party reported that it must be some
sort of probe. Tracks led from the craft and appeared to head into
the woods. A search of the area discovered that a strange gizmo was
left and it seemed to be something of importance. The team couldn't
get a fix on the location with their equipment but they did report
it was located 1499 feet from where they found the space craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
Shortly before we lost transmission with the team, they also
mentioned the tracks headed into the woods at a bearing of 184.5
degrees true.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Mission&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to recover that box and find the missing team. Do not
take this lightly. It is very dangerous out there. Please take all
necessary precautions to recover this box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTES:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking was at N38 42.336 / W090 42.229 or to make it a long
hike, park at Lewis and Clark Trailhead N38 41.420 / W090 43.468.
The first parking will be about 3 miles RT to the final and the
L&amp;C Trailhead will be about 8 miles RT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take the shorter way to the cache, you will follow old
roads and bushwhack very little. However, you will pass through
some tick areas. If you take the longer route, the trail will bring
you close to the cache but you will still need to bushwhack a short
distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EVERYTHING CAN BE DONE ON YOUR GPS. YOU WILL USE PROJECTION,
ROUTING and MAPPING Functions!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN198D2 - GC198D2 Final Cowboy Up, Mr. Alien!&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;This is the final location!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;h2&gt;Brawny Bear Clan's Country Roads Series&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome to the Country Roads of St. Charles County. There are so
many neat areas worth pointing out that are somewhat
historical,educational and scenic. This series will take you to
some of these locations or close enough to be pointed out. Some
just take you down some great roads that follow a creek or farm
field. Not too many people get out to these parts of St. Charles
County so we wanted to give you an opportunity to take a drive and
see what this part of the county has to offer. A couple of caches
will take you into Warren county just slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most of these caches are park and grabs but, please note that
there are chiggers, ticks and poison ivy in various areas. Use
caution retrieving the cache. Make sure you place everything back
just as you found it so the next person can have as much fun
hunting as you did.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although almost all caches are placed along the SCC ROW (Saint
Charles County - Right of Way) and none are placed on private
property, please use caution when retrieving the caches as creeks
will rise and roads could become impassible. Use common sense
during high water and heavy rains. Make sure you watch for traffic.
These are mostly dirt and gravel roads but you still have to watch
for cars and trucks and farm equipment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is placed along the SCC ROW (Look for the sign).&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I was surprised to see so few caches in the North part of town. So&lt;br /&gt;I placed this one in O'Fallon park, a short walk into the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you probably know, this area is somewhat depressed, so I&lt;br /&gt;wouldn't suggest caching past dusk. That said, it is a cool&lt;br /&gt;neighborhood with a lot of neat stores and food joints nearby and&lt;br /&gt;is not particularly dangerous, just use your head. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's some info on O'Fallon park: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had been a part of a vast 600-acre land holding of Colonel John&lt;br /&gt;O'Fallon, who came to St. Louis after being severely wounded at the&lt;br /&gt;Battle of Tippecanoe in the War of 1812. He was an assistant to his&lt;br /&gt;uncle William Clark, the &quot;Clark&quot; of the Lewis and Clark Expedition,&lt;br /&gt;then indian agent for St. Louis. O'Fallon made money rapidly buying&lt;br /&gt;and selling supplies to the army. Giving it away liberally, he&lt;br /&gt;became noted as a great philanthropist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He retained the 160-acre area of the present O'Fallon Park as his&lt;br /&gt;estate and subdivided and sold the rest of his tract, which reached&lt;br /&gt;down to the Mississippi River. Atop the highest hill in his estate,&lt;br /&gt;O'Fallon built a huge four-story mansion of about 50 rooms with a&lt;br /&gt;tall columned front portico. He named his estate Athlone, after the&lt;br /&gt;Irish birthplace of his father. It is said that many Indian&lt;br /&gt;artifacts were unearthed during the excavation for the mansion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten years after O'Fallon's death in 1865, his heirs sold the estate&lt;br /&gt;to the city. In 1875, the mansion was damaged by fire and remained&lt;br /&gt;in a ruinous condition until 1893, when it was finally razed. Until&lt;br /&gt;the late 1880s, O'Fallon Park remained in a rather primitive state,&lt;br /&gt;but was used principally as driving park and picnic grounds. During&lt;br /&gt;the 1890s, a music stand and a park shelter with an observation&lt;br /&gt;tower was constructed and in 1896 the lake was completed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1904, an island was placed in the lake and retaining walls were&lt;br /&gt;erected around its perimeter. Boating became popular after the&lt;br /&gt;erection of the boathouse in 1908. Electric lighting came to the&lt;br /&gt;park in 1914 and three years later its area was enlarged by the&lt;br /&gt;addition of an 8 1/2-acre tract donated by the Catholic&lt;br /&gt;Archdiocese. Overall area of O'Fallon Park was reduced to about 127&lt;br /&gt;acres by the acquisition of right-of-way for Interstate Highway 70&lt;br /&gt;in 1954.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Favorite Tree&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you might remember my favorite tree. Now, without figuring out math or a mystery, the cache is waiting. There are a couple of ways to get to this cache. The Lewis and Clark trail is probably the best way unless you know Weldon Spring Conservation Area. The cache is a regular size ammo box. Make sure you hide it back as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tree was long protected by me because I didn't want anyone to destroy it. This is a large sycamore tree and has an interesting feature. I have read books here and eaten lunch here as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the loop of the Clark trail (4.5 miles) or continue on the Lewis trail (8 Miles). Thanks to John Vogel from Busch for his support of Geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunting is allowed in the area. Here are the dates:&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Signs of Life are found all around this area. A neat place to check
out.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache was placed because as I was studying a satellite view
of the area, I noticed a neat place where you could see the roads
coming in and out of this location. It was really cool to see where
the buildings were and where the roads intersect. There is all
sorts of signs that this was once a working community. The cache
location has a fire plug, or hydrant as some call it, surrounded by
wooden posts. It was as if they didn't want anyone driving over
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is in a small container that holds a pen and a log
book. Small trinkets will fit in here but not much else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please make sure you snap the lid back on tightly. Hide as you
found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking can be found at N38 41.016 - W090 44.012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the road down the hill and climb the other side. The
cache is about 3 miles round trip. Mostly level except the
beginning and the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't done Happykraut's Another Tank, This would be a
good time to do it. You can bushwhack from this cache right to it
and save some mileage. Another Tank is GCMNYK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to John Vogel, MDC, for supporting our hobby!&lt;/p&gt;

There is a small pull-off&lt;br /&gt;area to park near the cache. The cache is large enough for some&lt;br /&gt;small trade items or trackables.

If you enter the park after&lt;br /&gt;hours you are trespassing. If you are stopped you can be ticketed&lt;br /&gt;or arrested and will put the future of geocaching in the parks in&lt;br /&gt;jeopardy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special permission to&lt;br /&gt;hide caches in St. Louis County parks is NOT needed as long as the&lt;br /&gt;Groundspeak rules are followed. &quot;Blanket Permission&quot; has been&lt;br /&gt;worked out in advance with the park service. DO NOT CALL THE PARK&lt;br /&gt;as they cannot handle the calls. The Groundspeak cache reviewer&lt;br /&gt;does need to know exactly how and where the caches are hidden and&lt;br /&gt;what type of containers are used. The geocaching liaisons will&lt;br /&gt;notify the park service of new caches. Remember NO AMMO BOXES or&lt;br /&gt;PVC PIPE caches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a little ways off the Hamburg trail in the Weldon Spring Conservation Area. The terrain is flat but has stickers and poison ivy. The difficulty is based upon the type of hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[B][RED]BRING YOUR OWN PENCIL![/RED][/B]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area has a ton of birds in all different shapes and sizes. While I was hiding the cache, I saw: Mockingbirds, Cardinals, Finch, Sparrows, Swallows, Hawks, Cranes and a few chickadee. Lots of birds here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is very dense so you want to take care and make sure you wear some long pants. I was out there in shorts and got a few scrapes from the locust trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a large pill bottle that is 3 times the size of a 35mm film can. There are no trade items. [B]Do not leave anything in the cache nor take anything from it.[/b] Make sure you put everything back just as you found it. Otherwise, it won't be as fun for the next person.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I know that caches like this exist. this is nothing new or unique. Just have fun with it and do not destroy it. If it gets ragged or you cannot place it back, please indicate in your log so I can fix it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy It!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a 3-part multi-cache in the Weldon Springs Conservation Area. The first two are film canisters that have only coordinates of the next way point.&lt;br /&gt;The first two WPs are on the east side of Highway 94. Both are at least a .1 mile bushwhack off the Hamburg Trail.&lt;br /&gt;On the way to WP1 you will see a series of sign that say &quot;Restricted Area&quot;. These signs are for the area on the left side of the road away from the cache. It is OK to leave the road on the right side to find WP1.&lt;br /&gt;The final WP is a 6&quot; X 6&quot; Lock &amp; Lock container on the west side of Highway 94 and is off the Lost Valley Trail.&lt;br /&gt;If you do this complete cache by hiking the trail system it will be about a 6.5 mile trip from WP1 and back. You can do the first two WPs and the drive up to the parking lot near the Final WP. &lt;br /&gt;Once you leave the hard path to star the bushwack the ground can be pretty soft and muddy if it has rained recently. If you are doing this cache on bike it may be a good idea to leave your bike on the road and hike in on foot.&lt;br /&gt;This cache was places only after receiving a permit from John Vogel of the Missouri Department of Conservation. &lt;br /&gt;Be aware that hunting is allowed in this area during certain time of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: FN1PBJD - GC1PBJD Final&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Final WP to Weldon Springs Area Multi&lt;br /&gt;PK1PBJD - GC1PBJD Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 38° 42.140 W 090° 42.645&lt;br /&gt;This is the best place to park to pick up WP1 &amp; WP2&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: S21PBJD - GC1PBJD Stage 2&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;WP2 for Weldon Springs Area Multi Cache</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This should be a fairly easy cache along the trail around Mallard&lt;br /&gt;Lake in Creve Coeur County Park. Tolleybrew used to have a cache&lt;br /&gt;close to this one with a similar name but he archived it when he&lt;br /&gt;left town. I figured I would put another one up in it's place but&lt;br /&gt;had to move it because another cache had been placed too close to&lt;br /&gt;his original hiding place. If you start at the Lake House the trip&lt;br /&gt;to the cache is about 1 mile for a 2 mile round trip. The container&lt;br /&gt;is a small plastic jar that can hold a few trade items. There is a&lt;br /&gt;small flash light in the cache as a gift for the FTF on this cache.&lt;br /&gt;There is also a FTF geocoin in the cache that is on a mission.&lt;br /&gt;Whoever takes the FTF coins should see the coin's page before&lt;br /&gt;moving the coin.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTICE: Please be&lt;br /&gt;respectful of the posted park hours. If you enter the park after&lt;br /&gt;hours you are trespassing. If you are stopped you can be ticketed&lt;br /&gt;or arrested and will put the future of geocaching in the parks in&lt;br /&gt;jeopardy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special permission to&lt;br /&gt;hide caches in St. Louis County parks is NOT needed as long as the&lt;br /&gt;Groundspeak rules are followed. &quot;Blanket Permission&quot; has been&lt;br /&gt;worked out in advance with the park service. DO NOT CALL THE PARK&lt;br /&gt;as they cannot handle the calls. The Groundspeak cache reviewer&lt;br /&gt;does need to know exactly how and where the caches are hidden and&lt;br /&gt;what type of containers are used. The geocaching liaisons will&lt;br /&gt;notify the park service of new caches. Remember NO AMMO BOXES or&lt;br /&gt;PVC PIPE caches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a clear lockable plastic container that is about the size&lt;br /&gt;of a shoebox. Inside the box is a logbook, pencil, and several&lt;br /&gt;items to start off this cache. Among them are a dog leash, dog&lt;br /&gt;collar, dog's soft camoflage toy, trading cards for boys and girls,&lt;br /&gt;few small disney figurines, mardi gras beads, bracelet, small&lt;br /&gt;(pocket) screwdriver. I have spent a lot of time in this park&lt;br /&gt;before I was into Geocaching, and I really wanted to place a cache&lt;br /&gt;in a well hidden spot. In the fall there is a beautiful view of the&lt;br /&gt;lake before you decend the hill to the cache. Please respect the&lt;br /&gt;rules of St. Louis County Parks Department. Park closes 1/2 hour&lt;br /&gt;after sunset. Good Luck and Happy Geocaching! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTICE: Please be&lt;br /&gt;respectful of the posted park hours. If you enter the park after&lt;br /&gt;hours you are trespassing. If you are stopped you can be ticketed&lt;br /&gt;or arrested and will put the future of geocaching in the parks in&lt;br /&gt;jeopardy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special permission to&lt;br /&gt;hide caches in St. Louis County parks is NOT needed as long as the&lt;br /&gt;Groundspeak rules are followed. &quot;Blanket Permission&quot; has been&lt;br /&gt;worked out in advance with the park service. DO NOT CALL THE PARK&lt;br /&gt;as they cannot handle the calls. The Groundspeak cache reviewer&lt;br /&gt;does need to know exactly how and where the caches are hidden and&lt;br /&gt;what type of containers are used. The geocaching liaisons will&lt;br /&gt;notify the park service of new caches. Remember NO AMMO BOXES or&lt;br /&gt;PVC PIPE caches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I decided to stop by and grab this cache today while I was out doing some cache maintenance. I remembered after I got to the cache site that the cache page said something about a steep hill and then I remembered the hellatious rain last night and thought it might not be a good idea but I went on after the cache anyway. I slipped down the hill to the cache but coming back up was a real experience. If I had had my hiking boot on it wouldn't have been too bad, but I was wearing tennis shoes with a fairly smooth bottom and it was a real chore climbing up that muddy hill. I wouldn't recommend this cache after a downpour. thanks for placing this cache.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; BWAT hates Ticks, Chiggers, Bushwhacking, Muddy Areas in the Summer
so we decided that some easy caches are in order. None of the
things BWAT hates in the Summer can be found around these. If you
don't like the quick park and grabs, these aren't for you. Almost
all the caches will be placed in areas where you really don't need
to be too discrete. This is a quick park and grab so be quick about
it. Bring your pencil / pen. You are looking for a micro.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is place at the end of the road that leads to Progress
West. Although the trail has not made it here, a couple of great
eateries have. One day, the Progress West walking trail will meet
up a short distance from here and eventually connect to the walking
trails in Winghaven. This will allow foot and bike access to Busch
Wildlife, Dardenne Prairie Greenway and the Katy trail systems.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Last one for tonight.  This is a great park.  Plenty of room for additional caches.  Nicely hidden cache.  Had to avoid the baby bunny on the way to and from this one.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; BWAT hates Ticks, Chiggers, Bushwhacking, Muddy Areas in the Summer so we decided that some easy caches are in order. None of the things BWAT hates in the Summer can be found around these. If you don't like the quick park and grabs, these aren't for you. Almost all the caches will be placed in areas where you really don't need to be too discrete. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache is placed on private property with permission. Please limit your hunting to 5AM - 11PM. On Sundays, you might run into quite a few people. However, the cache is placed where you can look for it and not worry about muggles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is not located inside the building that it is close to. You are looking for a smaller camo'ed tube container. Please place it back as you found it and bring your own pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

She sat in the Van While I walked down to locate.  At first I thought about stopping on the road long enough to search, but quickly gave that up since there was always a car coming from behind me and I would have time and they couldnt get around me.  I eventually gave in and parked the van down aways and walked it. Kept waiting for someone to stop and ask if I needed assistance but no one did.  Found cache Quickly when I reached ground zero and sat on a post nearby to sign and wait for a chance to replace when no one was passing by.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

Seeker will need some stealth as this place does attract and even seek muggles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've driven by here many times, &amp; thought here's a great spot for a cache. Upon seeking permission to place I discovered that they have a great coffee shop in the basement, with free WiFi and great coffee.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although not an endorsement, you can &quot;kill 2 birds with one stone&quot;. Bring your canned goods, dry food, toilet paper, and laundry soap by for a donation that can be used in their community food pantry and homeless shelter at the same time. Dropping off goods might offer cover for your visit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a magnetic nano, so bring your on pen or pencil.&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">It is extremely important to read all the description for this cache before attempting it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On 12/22/08 I moved this cache and made it part of my Calhoun County Series.  So many people have indicated it is their all time favorite cache and done it as a milestone cache, I did not want to shut it down.  Since it has been moved about .2 miles, if you found it in the old location, you can log it again at this location. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You should hike about .2 miles more after the cache until the trail ends.  The trail is real good to there and you get more great view.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calhoun County is nice anytime, but particularly nice in the fall and winter. It is a very rural area with lots of spectacular scenery and wildlife.   I have had a series up here before, but I am shutting all but Titus Hollow and  Swan Lake down.  Of all my caches, the one people tell me their all time favorite most often is Titus Hollow.  So I am just moving Titus Hollow Cache a little ways.  If you logged it at its old location, you can log it again at its new location.  Swan Lake is a virtual and I am changing what you need to log the cache-so if you did it before, you can log it again. None of the caches should be hard to find-but I can assure you each and everyone of them is at a neat location.  There are sometimes flooding issues and sometime when the river is up, you may not be able to get some of the caches.  But all caches are designed to survive a flood.  Sometimes in the winter the ferries get closed due to ice.  But you can always get to the caches by crossing the river in Hardin.  My Free Garmin topo, trail, POI , maps at:&lt;br/&gt;http://webpages.charter.net/jbensman/Maps.htm cover the area all the caches are in and have stuff on them that will help you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a really special place.   But it has a terrain rating of 4, so you really need to read on to understand what you are getting into as there are dangers.  Many small children have done this without a problem, but you need to be careful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park around N39 03.040 W90 40.442.  The road continues, but it can be a muddy mess.  You do not want to experience what hikerbob did on August 26, 2001.   In the summer, there is a field of stinging nettle you have to get through, so have long pants.  Stay in the bottoms until about N39 02.887 W90 40.534 where there is a good location to climb about 40 feet up to the base of the bluff.  After that point it can be extremely difficult to get up to the base of the bluff.  From that point on, just follow the base of the bluff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I cannot stress how beautiful this area is. It is one of the most beautiful places in the St. Louis area. But very few people know about this. You will be hiking below the base of 100 to 150 foot bluffs. On the other side of the trail is backwater lakes and then the Mississippi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the 1.5 mile round trip is along a “trail” well maybe you can call it a trail.  It is mostly a path about 1 to five foot wide.  But in some places it can be tricky and dangerous if you are not careful.  If you are afraid of heights, do not attempt this cache.  Most of the way you will be at the base of a bluff with a 50 - 100 foot extremely steep drop down into the river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You should wear boots or good sandals.  I wear boots in the winter and Teva sandals the rest of the year.  A walking stick is also extremely helpful.  In the winter, there can be ice on the trail that you need to get around and a walking stick makes this much easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not an easy walk in the woods.  You have to be careful and take your time.  Many small kids have done it with no problem.  But I have been there with adults who were terrified and had to turn back.  Most people will not have any problems.  So I do not want to scare you off one of the neatest places in the area.  I just want you to be careful!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you can get down a 200 foot cliff, you may be able to reach the cache from the CCS-Wilson Cemetery Cache. To do this cache, you have to hike from the parking areas in Titus Hollow. Furthermore, if you come from Wilson, you will miss the spectacular hike.  And while you may be able to get down from Wilson, you may not be able to get back up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of this journey will be next to the bluff or under an overhang.  So unless you have a high sensitivity receiver that works well in tree cover, you will likely lose your signal while getting to the cache.  Even with a high sensitivity received, there will be accuracy problems with signal bounce.  I got the best coordinates I could, but they could be off.  So I will give you a description you should be able to find without a GPS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be going through an area with a fairly wide path and you will see where a hunk of rocks fell off the cliff and formed a pile about 7 feet tall.  There is a space of about 5 feet between the pile and bluff.  On top of this pile of rocks is a hackberry tree.  You can tell a hackberry by its warty bark.  At the beginning of the pile next to the bluff there is a rock with a space under it.  The cache is under it with some rocks concealing it.  It is about 2/10ths of a mile before the trail ends.  I forgot to take my camera.  So if someone with a camera can take a picture of the spot, please email it to me and I will post it as a spoiler.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK17D1 - Titus Hollow Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 03.040 W 090° 40.442&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TH17D1 - Climb up to the trail here&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 02.887 W 090° 40.534&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the &quot;Great Flood of 1993&quot;, due to emerging ground water and the rising Illinois River, many homes in the Havana area were rendered unlivable by flooding. In that flood, I was living nearby, and I remember my friends and I riding our bikes through the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sand Lake continues to resurge from time to time during seasons of high precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, at the time this cache was published the lake has disappeared. I was going to wait for the water to come back up, but we're in the middle of a significant drought. I hope some day soon this cache becomes more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a micro cache. Please bring along your own pen or pencil.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apparently, when I was younger, my dad would take us fishing back here. I don't remember that, but then again, it's not the only thing forgotten about this place. Back then, you could get to the Spoon River on this road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we placed this cache, the road was dry, and my parents' minivan only scraped once getting back there. If you drive a low clearance vehicle, or if it's rained recently, be careful.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When I was a teenager, I used to detassle in the fields here.  I think you'll readily see why that's not possible any longer.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Oquawka Cemetery is located in Oquawka, Il. It is a old river town along the Mississippi River. The town is in the spot that in the days of 1827 a Dr. Isaac Galland staked his claim to this sandy shoreline. Later it was sold to the father of S. S. Phelps who bought the claim for his son and paid $400.00 for it. Oquawka sloly became the town that it is now. I'm not sure when the cemetery started but it was sometime around the late 1820s. It is a large cemetery for this small town which leads me to believe it started when it did. There is many different styles of headstones here so take your time and find a interesting one. There are many civil war veterans buried here too. As before, be respectful while you are here. Thanks for visiting.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://peoriaareacachers.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is my first Quad Cities hide - fortunately my parents live very close to the cache, and so props go to dad for helping me out with maintenance!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a micro container; should be a quick P&amp;G for the experienced cacher.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Use caution and stealth when retrieving as traffic on the nearby road is busy most mornings and afternoons. Shouldn't be a problem if you try not to call much attention to yourself. Parking is available near the cache most times of the year.</groundspeak:long_description>

stages. This cache is located in a kind of hidden area called White
Water Canyon. Once you get to the parking area you still have no
idea what's to come. You will have about 7 tenth's of a mile and
you will then see the true beauty of this area. 100 foot high
bluffs, overlooks that you just don't find in Iowa. It's cool to
see this area in all four seasons. This area is jointly controlled
by Jones county and Dubuque county since it lands right on the
border of the two countys.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache I'm thinking will be a difficult one. Do to the lay out
of the area if you try to take the shortest way to each stage you
will be playing billy goat. But it you follow the nice wide mowed
trails, you will pretty much triple the distance you are hiking.
How you want to get there is completely up to you. I do recommend
taking some water as this area is really deceiving until you get
back in the canyon areas. I suggest you take a 30 foot length of
rope. It just may come in handy, but it's not required. If you have
vertigo problems this cache is not for you, you will be seeing some
steep bluff's. I wouldn't suggest small children do this one. But
other than that enjoy your visit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also in the lid of the final container you will find a clue for the
H.A.C. -Eagle Scout cache. This along with 10 other clues will get
you the starting location. I have set up a bookmark for finding
them on geocaching.com easily. &lt;b&gt;Please write your experience in
the log book instead of just signing and dating it&lt;/b&gt; Happy
caching!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also I may be adjusting the ratings on this cache as I get input
from finders.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow, just a couple of the H.A.C.rank caches left for me to find and it seems like I'm saving some of the best for last. Was at Whitewater Canyon a couple months to finish the &quot;Iowa's 12 Pack Challenge&quot; and the &quot;Eastern Iowa EarthCache Bingo&quot; challenge caches, but knew that I wouldn't have time that day to search for this one. Nope, definitely wouldn't have. Need about 2 hours or so, to make through the obstacle course. Tough to get a good fix at Stage 1. Ran an 5 minute/100% confidence fix after I found it here: N 42° 17.772 W 90° 54.847 . The rest of the stages were straight forward enough that I didn't need to check their numbers. Great hides in great places. Really liked the trek to and the location of the final. Almost like &quot;Land of the Lost&quot;. TNLNSL. Thanks for the awesome Open Cache!</groundspeak:text>

lock and lock container with a pen and log book. I have left a
pathtag for the first to find!
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h1&gt;The Walker House
Cache&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Adjacent to this cache location is the Walker House, built in 1836
as an upscale inn providing fine dining and a pub.  It was
built onto a pre-existing miner's former stone house.  This
inn has been remodled several times but has closed with each
venture.  On 1 November 1842 a man named William Caffee was
executed by a public hanging in front of the Walker House for the
murder of Samuel Southwick at Gratiot's Grove in February
1842.  It is said that Willaim lost his head during the
hanging.  It is believed that William haunts the Walker House
in a grey suit, headless, holding his head....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Caffee's
Story&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 23, 1842 William Caffee attended a housewarming
party at Captain Fortunatus Berry's house in Gratiot's Grove,
Wisconsin.  After spending much time at the bar room he missed
his name being called to dance.  When he showed up to dance he
was informed that he had missed his chance.  Outraged he
grabbed the dance list shoved it in his pocket and stormed out of
Captain Berry's residence.  Sam Southwick pursued him picking
up a stick motioning it at Caffee to stop.  Caffee yelled
&quot;Stand back or I will kill you!&quot;  With that Caffee shot Samuel
Southwick in the chest.   Witnesses proclaimed 
Caffee then yelled, &quot;That's what you get for fooling with
me!&quot;  then he took off running.  He was sentenced to
death on September 24, 1842.  On November 1, 1842 reports of
three to four thousand people arrived to witness the
execution.  Caffee was led from the jail in a grey suit. 
He walked up to the wagon and seated himself on the coffin, a death
march was struck up and the procession moved forward to the place
of execution.  It is said that Caffee beated upon the coffin
to the beat of the death march.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Second FTF of the morning in Mineral Point, a pleasant surprise that these hadn't been found. Cool area here, enjoyed a bit of a walk on the nearby path with the geo-puggles before heading back towards Madison. I was a little surprised by the hide here, hope it doesn't get muggled. Thanks for the tag, glad to have it in my collection! TFTC!

I had planned to run out this way when these published, but it was late and then I had to work all day yesterday so this morning I loaded up the geo-puggles and made a run out. Nice morning to be out doing some caching, and an FTF is always a bonus. Had the area all to myself this morning and was able to make a quick grab before heading to The Walker House. TFTCs!

This used to be referred to the &quot;Pond by the County Farm&quot;.  It is located west of the Bloomfield Healthcare and Rehabilitation Center on County CH.  There is a road leading to parking on the left hand side of the road.  Unfortunately, the road is not on Google maps, but if you click “satellite” view you will see it on there.  At the entrance you will see the sign reading &quot;Iowa County Recreation &amp; Prairie Restoration” Entrance located at N 42° 57.603 W 090° 13.868&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a beautiful spot and it's accessibility has greatly changed over the past decade.  I used to go here when I was young with my dad to go fishing in the pond.  Later as a Boy Scout I performed many service projects at this location.  One of them was installing Bluebird houses that are still along the fence line today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a waterproof case with camo tape.  There is a log book, a pen, and some small items.  You will not need to go walk or disturb any of the prairie, the trail will lead you to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to j&amp;k&amp;kids on FTF!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

The location of the cache should not interfere with any goings on in the park.  But please use stealth so non-geocachers do not move the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a nano cache.  Bring your own pen!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to kungfuhippie with the FTF!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Out from Madison for an afternoon of WSQ caches with the geo-monkeys, I saw that these hadn't been found yet so we swung by and grabbed 2 FTFs. Even though the weather wasn't perfect we managed a quick find and on to the next! TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

This was my first stop of the morning while running out west of Madison after the new caches. I had wanted to come out when it published, but it was dark and yesterday I worked until 7 so I was a bit surprised to see it still sitting unfound. Rolled up and started searching, but couldn't come up with anything. I couldn't remember if I had the updated coords or not so I headed to MP resolving myself to a DNF here. After finding the 2 other new caches, I was able to get cell service and confirm the coordinates I had so I stopped on the way back to Madison and ended up with my 3rd FTF of the day. Thanks for all the caches!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is not at the above listed coordinates -- These coordinates can be used for parking, however. In order to locate the cache you must go for a short stroll through the UW-Marshfield/Wood County Arboretum.

The UW-Marshfield/Wood County Arboretum is a nice wooded stretch of land that has a pleasant series of trails running through it. In order to find this cache, you will need to assemble the proper coordinates. To do this you will need to visit five marker posts located along the Arboretum's trails. Each marker displays a number you will need to use to create the coordinates to the cache. The coordinates for each of these markers are provided as downloadable waypoints for your caching convenience.

Each marker is identified by an associated letter in this cache description.

Once you have the number off a marker, you can begin plugging them into the following equation to get the final coordinate solution:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;N44° 39.[A][B+C]
&lt;br /&gt;W90° 12.[C][D+E]
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Marker Waypoints:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Waypoint A: N 44° 39.788 W 090° 12.390
&lt;br /&gt;Waypoint B: N 44° 39.915 W 090° 12.444
&lt;br /&gt;Waypoint C: N 44° 39.846 W 090° 12.320

That had to be before the nice snow we had.
I saw ski and snowshoe tracks near the way-points.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a puzzle cache. The physical cache is not at the above listed coordinates, but you will need to visit this spot. In order to locate the cache you must decipher the true coordinates using a simple cipher. Good luck.
&lt;br /&gt;
This cipher text is a book cipher, but you won't need a book to solve it. Rather, at the provided coordinates is a large commemorative plaque that will be the key to solving the cipher text provided below. The portions of the cipher text that need to be decrypted consists of a paired number set (separated by a forward-slash). The first number represents the horizontal word rows on the plaque. The second number represents the position of the word in that row. All punctuation in the key text is ignored.
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have the words identified, you'll have to decide how to use them to fully crack the cipher and get the coordinates you need. Don't worry, though, it shouldn't be too tough.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[begin cipher]
&lt;br /&gt;+44° 8/3; 3/2; point 6/1; 11/6; 13/1;
&lt;br /&gt;-90° 10/6; 5/2; point 7/4; 1/1; 9/1
