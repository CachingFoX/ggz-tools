            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Part of a series of caches dedicated to the LA Lakers big men, both past and present.

Another cache for the El Paso geocachers and those simply passing through.

Derek Fisher is one of the most &quot;clutch&quot; players currently in the Lakers lineup, and I named this one after him because, while only 6'8&quot; tall, he plays really big and has sealed some pretty big games with his phenomenal 3-point jumper.
&quot;One of Fisher's finest playoff moments came in Game 5 (May 13, 2004) of the 2004 Western Conference semi-finals between the Lakers and the defending champion San Antonio Spurs. The series was tied 2–2, and Game 5 was a closely contested affair. With 11 seconds remaining, Kobe Bryant hit a jump shot to put the Lakers up 72–71. Tim Duncan then made an 18-foot shot in double coverage despite falling away from the basket to give the Spurs a 73–72 lead with 0.4 seconds on the clock.

To devise strategies, three consecutive time-outs were called: the first by the Lakers, the second by San Antonio to set up the defense, and the last by the Lakers to re-set up the offense. When the game resumed, Gary Payton in-bounded the ball to Fisher, who managed to catch, turn, and shoot the game-winning basket all in 0.4 seconds. Fisher sprinted off the court, as he later admitted he was uncertain he beat the buzzer and wanted to exit before the play could be reviewed. The Spurs immediately filed a dispute regarding the shot and after reviewing video footage of the play, the referees concluded that the ball had indeed left Fisher's hands before the clock expired. The &quot;0.4&quot; shot counted and the Lakers won.&quot; (from wikipedia)

He's done that so many times, but it's his off-court life that impresses me the most. So, a cache here for you in his honor!

Figured a new container idea, and so far it's been loved by the folks who've found #1-3 up in Albuquerque. I plan on placing a few dozen of these, so more to look forward to as I get them prepped and placed. Not a hard to find cache, a PnG for sure, but are you sure you aren't being watched by the very bored clerks inside? Plus, it's on a pretty busy street, so you have that challenge as well to contend with. No room for swag, and you'll need your own writing device.
Happy hunting! The 2008 Cab Sav was delicious, if you can find it! </groundspeak:long_description>

back to back is a bad-xss fact a claim that remains in tact! -RHCP &quot;Magic Johnson&quot;

So, being a Laker Fan (and tall) I figured I'd place one in honor of Pau Gasol, one of the best Power-Forward/Centers to come from Europe. Awesome to see him almost Triple-Double a few nights back in Game 6's blowout over the Celtics. Also awesome to have the Lakers do it Back to Back 09-10!

The Cache is at those gps listings, but I'm not sure how many of those looking will find it. For one thing it's not a low-down-dirty-shame like my previous caches that favored all sizes, and a quick-trip to the hardware store might be in order so you have some steps.

It's definitely a micro, so no room for swag or writing utensils, so bring your own for the log. I'm not super-vet with placing caches, so you may think my ratings are off. Remember though, this series is about the L.A. Lakers Big Men. As far as the micros go, I'll be soon placing bigger stuff, as I love to trade booty!

Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

NOT THE ORIGINAL CONTAINER, but if you follow the series you might find one! Not a difficult hide, just incredible muggle traffic so super-stealthy-geo skills are needed! Coordinates are off a little (on purpose), so those aforementioned geo-skills are of prime importance!

As stated above in the short-description, you'd be unseen when the local businesses are closed (early morning/late night) as it's a very-busy car access point with a lot of traffic. Safe parking is available nearby. Not much room for trade/swag or a pencil, so be sure to have a writing tool to get your log-on!

NEW CONTAINER: Being that the original container was left out of it's original place (and was worse for wear), I decided to crank-up the difficulty a little bit for those on the hunt.

PLEASE PLACE IT BACK LIKE YOU FOUND IT, that is, if you find it! There is a lot of foot-traffic mixed in with the muggles-in-cars so hide it like you found it please!

So if you've played this series already, you are probably familiar with the way these get placed/found. Stealth skills are needed, but maybe not as much as other locations (BTV #1,#2,#3,and #4).

The Muscat Canneli is a great lighter dessert-wine, worth picking up if you'd like to try a NM Wine that earned an 88 rating!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As a part of a series of the L.A. Lakers big men, A tribute to #31 of the Lakers, &quot;Superman&quot; Kurt Rambis

I'm a big-guy, often asked if I play bball, so it's natural that a cache in this series honoring the big-men of the Lakers be up where us big-guys can get to it. The shorter folks on this particular cache-hunt (or hunting the series) may want to bring a chair, step-stool, or develop some climbing skills so they can RISE UP for the challenge. Totally park-n-grab, but finding it might be the challenge.

As per the Cache Title:

During his playing days, Rambis was a favorite among the Lakers fans because of his status as an over-achieving underdog and ultimate team-player. Known for his defensive and rebounding skills, Rambis also was an efficient clean-up man on offense, with his field goal percentage reaching 59.5% at the peak of his career. He was remembered in both Santa Clara and Los Angeles for his all-out effort and willingness to do the &quot;dirty work&quot; that many players do not embrace. Rambis usually wore a thick moustache and thick-rimmed black glasses, prompting Lakers announcer Chick Hearn to nickname him &quot;Superman&quot; (in reference to the character's alter ego, Clark Kent). He finally retired with the Lakers in 1995 after 14 years in the NBA. After 7 seasons as assistant-coach with the Lakers, he serves as the head coach the Minnesota Timberwolves.  

Please place it back exactly where you found it! Bring a pen/pencil to sign the log, and there is a little room for trade-swag. 

Best to get it in the evenings or weekends as not to arouse muggle interest.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Third of a series, with a new container idea. Not a difficult hide, just incredible muggle traffic so super-stealthy-geo skills are needed! Coordinates are off a little (on purpose), use your noodle and you'll surely find it!

Don't forget your tweezers as these logs will be hard to access without them. If you're legal and into wine, the 2004&amp;2005 Cabernet Sauvignon was worth finding and pairing with a nice cut of meat. You'll see what I mean when you find the cache!

As stated above in the short-description, you'd be unseen when the local businesses (really late or really early) are closed as it's a very-busy car access point with a lot of traffic, Safe parking is available really-close nearby. No room for trade/swag or a pencil, so be sure to pack a pen/pencil with your tweezers! Please put log back in just like you found it!

Look on Google Erath to see what I am talking about. Aside from that, access could not be simpler. One last note: the cache is magnetic. Don’t go pulling random things too hard. also note that because of the small size, you need to bring your own pencil. some also tell me that a &quot;tool&quot; is needed.

Just East of this cache location is a historic picnic-place in my family. We try to get up here with some Boston Market at least 2 or 3 times a summer to get into cooler weather and away from the crowds/rif-raf down in the city. A Great place to bring the kids, mine loved stomping around in the creek-bed getting all filthy, climbing trees, hunting insects, you name it (they're kids!).
Cache location, as you'll see on the approach, is near the source of a pleasant little stream that weaves it's way through the picnic area. It's not within the barbed-wire, so don't believe your GPSR if it says it is... just really close!

Changed the difficulty based on trouble people have had finding it. Hopefully you'll be the FTF!

Cache is permanently attached to it's &quot;container&quot; so please do not try to remove it - top unscrews easily. Not sure but good guess is that ATVs might be an issue at times so be aware. Nice view of a deep arroyo.
As some finders have very wisely advised - do not approach from the west. A couple turns off Southern will get you right there.</groundspeak:long_description>

A 4x4 is recommended or you may choose to hike the 2 miles (one way) with an elevation gain of roughly 400ft. Ascend the road up from the Hoosier Pass summit and take the sharp right-hand turn which will lead you along the east side of the ridge. If driving, we recommend parking at Crystal Lake near the abandoned mine shaft at N 39 22.535, W 106 04.738, then hiking the rest of the way to the cache. Your experience will be more pleasant if you hike along the 4x4 trail until very near the cache.

Safety Note: The cache is not in a mine, so we strongly suggest staying out of the shafts.

Found it! Or did you? Did you sign the log? You didn't? Then you didn't find it! In order to log this cache as found you MUST sign the log. No sign, NO FIND! :) 

Put cache together in my office so container(s) hold office related swag like paper clips, pens, and scotch tape but there is no theme. HOWEVER, please do not place &quot;paper&quot; items in container(s) so they won't be confused as being the log!

GO!

This is an easy to find cache which contains a cache note, cache log book, pencil, pen and an assortment of trade items. Please park at the posted parking co-ordinates as the trail into the canoe launch is only suited for &quot;high clearance&quot; vehicles.  A trail hike of approximately 200 meters will be required. The launch site also has very limited parking and turn-around space. There is approximately 30 meters of &quot;bush whacking&quot; from the canoe launch to the cache site. Suitable hiking boots and clothing is recommended.

This is an easy to find cache which contains a cache note, cache log book, pencil, pen and an assortment of trade items.  This road can be very busy at times, therefore stealth and deception should be employed.  If you carry a CITO bag your actions should go un-noticed.  As always, re-hide well so that it is not visible to muggles.

You are searching for an orange 1.5 liter Marine Safety Kit Canister with a weather-proof screw top lid.   It contains a Cache note, cache log, cache pencil and pen, various
trade items suitable for canoeing/hiking.

The location is near a great view of the Paradise Beach area which is located south of Saskatoon.   The cache site is located across the river from the Paradise Beach parking lot (N51 58.510 W106 47.285) and can be accessed by canoe , boat or the use of a dingy/life raft.  

The South Saskatchewan river is a favourite of canoe enthusiasts and many people complete day trips on the river from Paradise beach to Saskatoon or from other launch sites further up-river. Hopefully some of these are geocachers as well.

The Paradise Beach parking lot and sandbar area are administrated by the Meewasin Valley River Authority.  Please read and comply with  all posted signs regarding parking regulations and recommended river usage.  This is for your information and
safety.  It is not recommended to try swim across the river due to the fast current and under tows.  Crossing the river ice in winter by foot or snow machine is highly dangerous due to the current and fluctuating water levels.  As a result this cache site is primarily a summer cache. 

The area is also near a small un-named lake (Paradise Lake?) which is fed by the river if the river level is high.  There is a lot of wildlife in the area (beavers, deer, moose) which will add to your caching experience.  The lake entrance is not readily visible but is the best landing place for your canoe journey.

Your journey will require approximately a 100 meter portage from the parking lot and a short 500 meter paddle to cross the river.  The cache is located above the high water mark on the river bank.  Good luck and enjoy the cache.  Remember CITO (cache in – trash out).  Leave nothing behind.  Not even your footprints in the sand.

You are searching for a green buffalo tube which is well hidden at the Paradise Beach conservation site on the South Saskatchewan River, South of Saskatoon.

This is a challenging hide which contains a log roll only.  Bring your own writing stick.  This area has a high muggle population, especially on summer weekends. Stealth will be required.  Please park at the posted parking co-ordinates and comply with all posted parking restrictions. Do not park along the road!  These rules are strictly enforced in this area.  The parking site is only available from dawn to dusk.  The Paradise Beach area is always in need of CITO.  Trash barrels are available on site.

Canoes can be launched from this site, and the waters edge landing/launch area is approximately 50 meters from the parking lot.  This varies considerably with the river
water level.

The cache contains a cache note, log book and selection of trade items. This cache is only accessible by boat or canoe and should not be searched for in the winter months when the river is frozen.
 

You may park and launch from the posted co-ordinates (canoe launching only). Alternatively you may make this a stop if doing day canoe trips from launching points further up-stream. You may also canoe or boat from the boat launch in Saskatoon however the trip is up-stream against the current which varies throughout the summer season. If you park at the recommended parking it is a 150 meter portage to the river, a short 300 meter paddle to the Southern tip of the island and a pleasant 450 meter hike to the cache along the inner high water river channel.
 
Please replace the cache exactly as found securely so that it doesn't fall out of the host. Also make sure that the lid is closed completely.
 
As with all water/river activities please wear a life jacket and be sure your craft is equipped with the appropriate safety equipment.

 
Good luck in your adventure.. FTF prize is an un-activated Travel Bug tag..

Fall house cleaning is under way and he has received orders that his button collection must go so he decided to hide a cache to contain his prized button collection and share it with his geocaching friends and fellow button collectors.

You are searching for a large peanut butter container which has been painted brown. It is hidden 5 meters from a lower hiking trail in the Chief Whitecap off-leash dog park South of Saskatoon. It is a moderate 2.5 Km hike from the posted parking co-ordinates.

GZ is located near a “Dog-gone” good beach on the river. Your cache dog will love this area. The trails are frequently used so stealth will be required. It may be prudent to retrieve the cache and take it to the beach area to sign the log and admire Beaver Dude’s button collection. Return the cache stealthily and make sure the lid is nice and tight. Replace it in it’s hiding spot and conceal it well.

The cache also contains a few other small trade items. There is a clearly marked “FTF” prize in the log book baggy.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was a fun and interesting find. I decided to go searching for this one, so I threw the bike into the van (I am glad to have it back), and headed out. It was starting to get pretty dark already, but I had the light on the bike, so I was OK. I met up with a couple of friendly dogs, and some less friendly ones as well. One of the less friendly ones grabbed my pant leg as I biked past. Grrrr.

Once at GZ I could not see a tree for the bush. Hmmm. Thats one of the problems with going out in the dark - you can't see much. My big flashlight was dead, so I only had the bike headlight. Good but not great. So I did eventually find the cache, and signed the log and made off with the prize. No dogs encountered on the way back to the van.

Drove back into town, and stopped at Home Depot to pick up some supplies for the never-ending renovations. For some reason, shopping always takes a lot longer than I expect. Must be all the searching that I do. Got out to the van and pulled away - and the van gave up the ghost.

Now I was stuck on a small side street somewhere, and out of gas (I hope). I started to push towards the Co-op that was a block away (lucky break), when a Friendly Manitoban pulls over and helps push. Then someone else jumps out of their truck and also help push. Great! We get to the pump, and the guy puts in about a litre and the pump stops. Full. Yeah - right. So he tries again and again, but the pump and the van do not agree about things. I guess the pump goes too fast and the gas can't get into the tank quick enough for it. Eventually he puts in 56 litres - pretty good since the van should only take about 50!

I was glad that the bus decided to run out of fuel only a block from the gas station - instead of way out in the countryside! </groundspeak:text>

The cache contains a cache note, log book and selection of trade items. This cache is only accessible by boat or canoe and should not be searched for in the winter months when the river is frozen.

You may park and launch from the posted co-ordinates (canoe launching only). Alternatively you may make this a stop if doing day canoe trips from launching points further up-stream. You may also canoe or boat from the boat launch in Saskatoon however the trip is up-stream against the current which varies throughout the summer season.


As with all water/river activities please wear a life jacket and be sure your craft is equipped with the appropriate safety equipment. 


Good luck in your adventure.. FTF prize is an un-activated Travel Bug tag..

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You are looking for an 800ml Lock-n-Lock container which contains a cache note, log book, pen, pencil and a selection of trade items.  It is near a great view of Dog Island (now called Yorath Island) which is located in the South Saskatchewan River south of Saskatoon.  The cache site is a short hike along an established path approximately 100 meters from the posted
parking.

Your adventure begins at the posted parking point which is a safe roadside turn out.  Please use it as the roadway has considerable traffic.  Hike down the steep path that leads towards the river.  Follow the path upriver (west) until you reach a small stream that empties into the river.  A short hike up the stream (north) will lead you to the cache site.  The stream is fed by one of the many springs that originate along the river bank.  It is a secluded location and should be free of muggles.

Enjoy the cache and re-hide exactly as you found it.  As there is a cache just up the road dedicated to &quot;cats&quot;  you may consider this cache a &quot;dog&quot; theme.  You may add small dog related trade items.  Just remember no chew bones etc. as they may attract other animals.  Remember to bring along a trash bag to practice CITO

Be kind to nature and she will be kind to you and others.

Congratulations:....bennykidd for a speedy &quot;FTF&quot;....

Dedicated to all dedicated geocachers who spend hours searching local spruce trees for cache containers hidden by other dedicated (sadistic) geocachers.  

Is it a spruce tree or not a spruce tree?  Is it high or is it low?  Does it have a magnetic personality?  To cache or not?  So many questions for a cacher to ponder.  Ponder it well.  Enjoy the hunt.

Good luck.. Yellow M&amp;M thinks you may need it.  He has recorded the co-ordinates twice on different days and checked the results against &quot;Google Earth&quot;.  Please replace just as you found it,  nice and secure..

They enjoyed it so much that they had to hide a cache of their own at the campsite. When we left we of course removed the cache and I promised to re-hide it so that they could find it the next time they were visiting Saskatoon.  Remember to give your GPS time to settle down in this location and you will make the find easily..

The following Curse is optional, if you choose to do so please follow the guidelines below:
 
This is a Cursed cache for the FTFers in Saskatoon! If you are the FTF for a cache in this series, you are cursed with the desire to place another &quot;Saskatoon Cursed FTF&quot; cache, therefore, extending the series.
 

The following guidelines are suggested only:
 1. FTF'er should place the next cache in the series (Saskatoon Cursed FTF #2) within 30 Days! Otherwise the curse will prevent you from EVER getting another FTF again!!!.....mwahahaha.
 2. You can only be a FTF for this series once. This is to give others a chance to be a FTF'er.
 3. Cache must be a traditional cache.
 4. Caches should be placed within the Saskatoon area! |
 
Lets see how far the series will go.........

Congrats to the following on the FTF'S

This is an easy park-n-grab located approximately 300 meters off Provincial highway #12. It is located on what one was the main road/trail leading to the Petrofka ferry. In the summer when the trail is dry you may drive to witin 10 meters of GZ. If the trail is wet or drifted with heavy snow you would be best to park on the approach just off the highway. It is only a short 300 meter hike from there.


Good luck, we hope you enjoy the cache..

You are searching for a small lock-n-lock that contains the cache log,cache note and a selection of small trade items. Do a small item trade or drop off your personal signature item to mark your visit.

The Big Spruce Trail is classed as a &quot;Back-country Trail&quot; (not for novice skiers). It is a moderate challenge with gentle rolling hills through a big spruce forest. Once you have logged this cache continue to follow the Big Spruce trail to the next cache located near &quot;Spruce Junction&quot;. Remember the Big Spruce trail is a one-way directional trail. Please comply with the recommended directions. You should continue
the trail to Spruce Junction then back to the South parking lot via the Willow View Trail. So you may as well complete the next five caches.

The Saskatoon Nordic Ski Club (http://saskatoonnordicski.ca/) operate groomed Public cross-country ski trails in the area. Please do not snowmobile, walk, or snowshoe on the groomed ski trails. The course to complete the Southern -Eb's Trails Ski Adventure Series will require approximately 11 Kms of skiing. 

NOTE: The ski trails skill level requirements are rated as:Experienced level skiers. Ski at your own risk. Trails are not patrolled. Ski in a group. Advise others where you are going and when you plan to return. Safety First ! Please do not operate motorized vehicles past the recommended parking lot as your vehicles exhaust system may cause forest fires due to the amount of dry grass on the trails.

Summer Hiking: Completing this cache by summer hiking requires good hiking shoes &amp; clothing. Carry water and trail snacks. Mosquito repellant will be an asset. If the gate to the parking area is closed please ensure it remains closed as there may be livestock in the area.

Good luck, please ski/hike with a friend and have a safe adventure. You can check the trail snow conditions on the &quot;Ski Hot-line&quot; @ (306-343-0191) before heading out on your trip (use the Nordic Ski Club link above). Take your camera and share some photo's with your fellow geo-cachers.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is an easy find located located near the mid-point of &quot;The Bog Trail&quot; in the Northern portion of Eb's Trails. Approximately 2.0 Kilometers from the Eb's Trails - North parking lot (N 52° 56.865 W 106° 02.587).
 
You are searching for a small plastic peanut butter jar which contains the cache log, cache note and a selection of small trade items. Do a small item trade or drop off your personal signature item to mark your visit.
 
From the posted parking co-ordinates (N 52° 56.865 W 106° 02.587) ski/hike the Jorgens Trail Westerly until you come to the junction of the Bog Trail. Follow the Bog Trail Westerly until you arrive at ground zero. The cache is located 0.5 meters off the trail on the North side. No Bushwhacking is required. Please re-hide well so it is not visible from the trail (Summer and Winter). It is an easy find and could even be done without removing your skis.
 
Once you have logged this cache continue to follow the Bog Trail to the junction of Jorgens Trail then North to the junction of the Porcupine trail, following this cross connection trail back to the parking lot. Of course there is a cache on the Porcupine trail as well.. This route will take you over some gentle rolling terrain and is an excellent ski for the novice skier.
 
The Saskatoon Nordic Ski Club operate groomed public cross-country ski trails in the area. Please do not snowmobile, walk, or snowshoe on the groomed ski trails.
 
NOTE:  Ski at your own risk. Trails are not patrolled. Ski in a group. Advise others where you are going and when you plan to return. Safety First!! 
 
Summer Hiking: Completion of this cache by summer hiking requires good hiking shoes &amp; clothing. Carry water and trail snacks. Mosquito repellant will be an asset. If the gate to the parking area is closed please ensure it remains closed as there may be livestock in the area.
 
Please park your vehicle at the posted parking lot (N 52° 56.865 W 106° 02.587). Ski (Winter) or Hike (Summer) the trails only. Do not operate motor vehicles of any type on the trails....

Good luck, please ski/hike with a friend and have a safe adventure. You can check the trail snow conditions on the &quot;Ski Hot-line&quot; @ (306-343-0191) before heading out on your trip (use the Nordic Ski Club link above). Take your camera and share some photo's with your fellow geo-cachers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;co-ordinates
!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Saskatoon branch office of
CSIS has contacted Inspector La Pep to enlist his assistance in
solving a diabolical plot to introduce a computer virus into the
Cities traffic control system. When activated this virus will turn
every traffic light in the city permanently &lt;strong&gt;RED&lt;/strong&gt; . This will result in mass panic and
confusion. Geocachers will not be able to get to their local TH to
enjoy a hot cup of coffee and find caches which have been hidden at
these locations by the famous &quot;Benny Kidd&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must assist the inspector to
break this evil computer virus. Inspector La Pep has obtained a
copy of the virus code and stored it on a memory stick it's
contents are listed below. The inspector's effort so far has
determined that the code contains the GPS co-ordinates of a box
which is well hidden in a secret location North of Saskatoon.
Inside the box is a log book which you must sign to verify that you
have broken the virus code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Cache Location
Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final cache is located in a Public Ski Trail
area (Eb's Trails) in the Nesbit Provincial Forest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In winter only the use of skis are allowed on
the Ski trails. No hiking, snowshoes or skidoo's.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In summer, hike only. No quads or ATV's. If the
gate to the parking lot is closed please ensure it remains closed
if you access the parking area. Livestock may be present in the
area during the summer months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember to pack a lunch, water and other items
you may require on your trip. This is a back-country hike/ski and
of course the home of a variety of wildlife including
Bears.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Your adventure begins at the posted coordinates for the Eb's Trails North parking lot (N 52° 56.865 W 106° 02.587). From there you will Ski or Hike approximately 2.75 kilometers over various trails until you arrive at Stage one (the posted cache coordinates). At stage one you must find the coordinates for the final stage. You may need all your keen observation skills to find the coordinates but they are there in plain text. No puzzles to solve or codes to decipher. Stage one is a medium sized plastic peanut butter jar painted brown.
 
The final stage contains the logbook which you must sign to complete your adventure. There is a small selection of trade items as well as a clearly marked &quot;FTF&quot; prize. Please do not share details of your find so that other cachers may enjoy the challenge as well.
The adventure has been designed so that it may be found in one trip, however the difficulty rating is 4.5 so a &quot;DNF&quot; is quite possible.  Do not dispair.. Simply post a &quot;DNF&quot; and send an email to the cache owner describing stage one and the attempt you made and the Inspector will provide you with an additional hint. You may then chose to return and make the find (the higer terrain rating reflects the possibility of two physical trips to complete the adventure). Please do not remove or change the surroundings at stage one and leave the cache exactly as found so it is possible for the next cacher to make the attempt.
 
The Saskatoon Nordic Ski Club operate groomed public cross-country ski trails in the area. Please do not snowmobile, walk, or snowshoe on the groomed ski trails.
 
NOTE: Ski/Hike at your own risk. Trails are not patrolled. Ski/Hike in a group. Advise others where you are going and when you plan to return. Safety First!!
 
Summer Hiking: Completion of this cache by summer hiking requires good hiking shoes &amp; clothing. Carry water and trail snacks. Mosquito repellent will be an asset. If the gate to the parking area is closed please ensure it remains closed as there may be livestock in the area.
 
Please park your vehicle at the posted parking lot (N 52° 56.865 W 106° 02.587).. Ski (Winter) or Hike (Summer) the trails only. Do not operate motor vehicles of any type on the trails....

Good luck, please ski/hike with a friend and have a safe adventure. You can check the trail snow conditions on the &quot;Ski Hot-line&quot; @ (306-343-0191) before heading out on your trip (use the Nordic Ski Club link above). Take your camera and share some photo's with your fellow geo-cachers.

You may download a GPX track file for this adventure and others from &quot;Beaver Dude's Adventure Page&quot; @ http://hirkw1.sasktelwebsite.net/


Good Luck..

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final cache is located in the Nisbet
Provincial forest in a public ski trail area (Eb's Trails) It is a
30 cal. ammo box which has been equipped with a Winter trace line
to make it Winter findable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cache is located approximately 10+ Km
(6+ miles) round trip, from the posted parking lot. For a
downloadable GPS track (GPX format) please visit
&lt;a href=&quot;http://hirkw1.sasktelwebsite.net/&quot;&gt;Beaver Dude's Adventure Page&lt;/a&gt;
. More information on these trails are
also available on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saskatoonnordicski.ca/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saskatoonnordicski.ca/&quot;&gt;Nordic Ski Clubs WEB page&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cache contains a log book, a small selection
of trade items, and cache completion tags. It is recommended that
you do not leave travel items in this cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In winter only the use of skis are allowed on the
Ski trails. No hiking, snowshoes or skidoo's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summer park at the recommended parking lot,
hike only. No quads or ATV's allowed on the trails, obey the signs
posted. If the gate to the parking lot is closed please ensure it
remains closed if you access the parking area. Livestock may be
present in the area during the summer months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to pack a lunch, water and other items
you may require on your trip. This is a back-country hike/ski and
of course the home of a variety of wildlife including
Bears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
