Few meters from the monument lies the cache, can be easily reached by foot.
Also consider visiting this not too far away cache: Yemenite Jewry Forest GC1D25R.

About the Scroll
The Scroll of Fire is one of the most beautiful sculptures in Israel.
It is an imposing work rich in detail and history – it tells the story of the rebirth of the nation from the Holocaust up to the Six Day War. The sculpture commands a spectacular view of its surroundings
(very recommended reading: gemsinisrael.com)

The Martyrs forest
The Martyrs Forest is comprised of six million trees – truly, a living memorial. Four and half million pine trees represent the adults who perished in the Holocaust while a million and (one) half cypress trees account for the children who perished.

Directions
The Martyrs Forest is located on Route 395. From Beit Jamal take Route 38 north, toward Beit Shemesh. At Shimshon Junction take Route 395 east. Be on the lookout for a sign leading to the Martyrs Forest and the Scroll of Fire monument (not far from Moshav Kissalon Ramat Raziel).</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finger of Og&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A colossal monolithic column (12m long) was discovered here in
1871. This place was a quarry in ancient times. The column broke
while it was being quarried and was left in site, still embedded in
the natural rock. Based on its size it is supposed that the column
was destined for the colonnades of the 2nd Temple. Similar columns
have been discovered in Mahne Yehuda neighborhood, but those are
hidden by the urban buildings. A Jerusalem legend tells this is a
finger bone of the biblical giant Og. This legend is the base for
the popular column name &quot;Finger of Og&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Russian Compound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The area is one of the oldest districts in central Jerusalem. It
was built by family of the Russian Tsar in 1860. It is including a
large Russian Orthodox church and several former pilgrim hostels
which are used today as government buildings and for the Museum of
Underground Prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the cache&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
At time of hiding, it was the smallest cache in Israel (please
correct me if I wrong), only 2cc. The cache location is marked by
the GX
logo, about 1cm size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don't need to go down into the column location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The column is in front of a police station. The cache place is
not seen from the police station. Don't try to search in front of
the police station.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cache location is marked by the GX logo. You can see easily
this mark while walking in regular public path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The area is regularly visited by tourists, so the police
station is not a problem, as long as you behave like a normal
tourists and not like a crazy geocacher. You can see the GX logo
while walking normally, in a place hidden from the entrance to the
police station.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
