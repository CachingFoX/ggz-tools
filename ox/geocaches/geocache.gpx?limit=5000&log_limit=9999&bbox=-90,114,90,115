            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Mount Stenhouse is the tallest mountain in Lamma (353 metres above sea-level), situated between Sok Kwu Wan and Sham Wan. Unusually shaped rocks can be found all over this mountain, but a grueling hike is necessary to access these.
The surrounding geology is unique to Hong Kong, with vestiges of intense volcanic activity abundant.
Huge, provocatively shaped, granite boulders and tables can be seen which are rich in quartz, feldspar and biotite. Cooling cracks and fissures give the boulders unique appearances, sometimes with comical outlines. The rock formations originated 140 million years ago during the Jurassic Period.
From the summit there are spectacular views of both industrial Hong Kong (boring) and natural Hong Kong (sweet). </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>There are many trails to the summit but go to the cache Tung O Pagoda and you'll be &quot;half way there&quot; :-)</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

- The Hong Kong Museum of Art, founded in 1962, was formerly known as the City Museum and Art Gallery. It aims to preserve the cultural heritage of China and promote art with a local focus. In 1991, it opened its doors at the current Tsim Sha Tsui Premises.

- The Hong Kong Cultural Centre marked a new era in the development of the performing arts of all variety in Hong Kong. The foundation stone was laid in 1979, construction works started in 1984 and the building completed in 1989. Since its grand opening on 8 November 1989, the Cultural Centre has remained the premier cultural venue offering stimulating environment for arts talents and quality programmes to the public.

- The Hong Kong Space Museum , the main local institution aimed at popularising astronomy and space science, was officially opened in October 1980. Its unique egg-shaped dome has become a striking landmark of the City.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Basalt Island is an island south of Town Island (Fo Tau Fan Chau) and Wang Chau, east of Bluff Island (Sha Tong Hau Shan) and north of the Ninepins. 

To log, what date is written on the monument? e.g 19 May 2001; 19/5/01.

Like Bluff Island and Wan Chau, the outcropped stratum of Basalt Island is part of the Early Cretaceous Kau Sai Chau Volcanic Group. The island has very well developed sea stacks, island reefs and wave-cut bays which clearly demonstrate the impacts of wave erosion on the environs. Waves, in forms of erosion, abrasion and dissolution, cause devastating damage to the shores. 
Given that the Kau Sai Chau Volcanic Group is full of columnar joints and fissures, impacts of pounding waves on rocks are particularly obvious. Meanwhile, continuous abrasion by sand and gravel carried by waves has brought changes to the shores and submerged bedrock, sculpting an amazing array of precipitous cliffs and spectacular landforms. In geology, wave cut action is one example of exogenous effect. The islands and wave-cut terrains in the Basalt Island region are excellent showcases that reveal how of this geological process modified geomorphology.  </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Private boat hire is required. As there are many outlying islands in Sai Kung, it is a good idea to hire a boat at Sai Kung pier and sail around Jin Island (Tiu Chung Chau), Bluff Island, Basalt Island, Wang Chau and other islets. You can have a close look at the rugged primitive rock formations and spectacular rock cliffs that plunge deep into the sea. Only set off on a fine day when weather is stable. To avoid accidents, do not visit this island when the sea is rough.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Wang Chau is the smallest amongst the Ung Kong Islands. The highest point is merely 80 metres above sea level while the narrowest part measures only 500 metres. Geological sceneries, however, are enthralling. On the north side of Wang Chau one finds a striking sea cave. 

To log, what is the estimated height, width and depth of the sea cave at the lat/lon? e.g 10m high x 5m wide x 2m deep or just 10 x 5 x 2.

Sea caves on the island are well developed. As a result of geological factors and sea level movements, they are greater in depth than width. Major geological factors include the types of shore-forming rocks or substances and their resistance to erosion, attitude of rock beddings, geological composition and crustal movement of the coastal region. These factors influence coastal characteristics and evolution to a great extent. Therefore, this site has stunning tubular rock formations and a spectacular sea cave. To see it in true grandeur, visit a few days after a typhoon when the ravaging ocean surge has subsided but the sea is still a little rough. On such days, swirling swells beat up a spectacular resonance in the cave, testifying to the mighty power of nature. The impressive sea cave is situated on the north-east shoreline at the lat/lon given. The tubular rock formations can be seen around the cave and at most points around the island.    </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The volcanic rock with columnar joints found in the High Island region is a type of acidic rhyolite ¾ dacite porphyroclastic lava. It is rich in potash feldspar and quartz phenocrysts. About 400 metres thick, these rocks are known as High Island Formation. They are part of the Early Cretaceous Kau Sai Chau Volcanic Group.These grotesque volcanic rock columns stand as high as 30 metres. They first appeared some 140 million years ago when subterranean magma and volcanoes were active. Whenever there was an eruption, great lava flows gushed out along with scorching volcanic ash. They spread across the ground surface and formed lava layers. During the cooling period, the rock contracted very uniformly and gave rise to the marvelous hexagonal columnar joints seen today.

Columnar joints are common in basalt as well as other igneous rocks like obsidian and welded tuff. After consolidating in temperature as high as several hundred degrees Centigrade, igneous rock continues to cool down until it reaches air temperature. During such time it contracts and eventually develops columnar joints. Similar columnar joints can be seen in mud that has dried and contracted.

Judging by its distribution characteristics, High Island Formation seems to have been formed inside a huge caldera. When the lava flow ran rapidly into this recess, just like porridge being poured into a bowl, it created a semi-enclosed environment which was beneficial to slow cooling. When the lava cooled down slowly, it gradually developed contraction joints.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Sharp Island is the perfect place to learn about igneous rocks, as it is rich in various igneous rocks, such as volcanic breccia, rhyolite, tuff and quartz monzonite. At low tide, a gravel tombolo emerges, linking Sharp Island with Kiu Tau.

To log, what was the time of high tide on day of your visit AND what is size of the geological feature at 22° 21.788'N 114° 17.642'E ? e.g 1407hrs; sandstone rock 10m high x 20m long.

Sharp Island is located about 2 km southeast of Sai Kung Town Centre. Sharp Island is the perfect place to learn about igneous rocks, as it is rich in various igneous rocks, such as volcanic breccia, rhyolite, tuff and quartz monzonite. At low tide, a gravel tombolo emerges, linking Sharp Island with Kiu Tau, allowing visitors to walk to Kiu Tau along the tombolo. The end of the Sharp Island Geo Trail is located at the top of Kiu Tau, where visitors can enjoy gorgeous landscapes in the panoramic view of Clear Water Bay Peninsula and Port Shelter. As the tombolo will be submerged at high tide, the tidal information posted on the Hong Kong Observatory’s website should be checked before setting off. The tectonic setting of Hong Kong lies within a continental margin. In the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous massive volcanic eruptions took place.  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Ping Chau, or Tung Ping Chau to differentiate from Peng Chau, sits in Mirs Bay of the northeastern waters. It is the easternmost outlying island of Hong Kong. This crescent-shaped island, measuring 600 metres long and 200 metres wide, is renowned for strange rock formations. Unlike most other rock types across the territory, the island is made up of sedimentary rock including shale, siltstone, dolomitic siltstone, mudstone and chert. 

To log, what is the estimated thickness of the shale layers? e.g. 3m-4m; 3-4m.

Shale is usually made up of pyrite, geolite and augite. The vivid colours come from micrograined calcium, iron and magnesium particles that the rock contains. After formation, the rock was exposed to weathering and wave action, creating eye-dazzling plum, ochre, charcoal and bottle-green outcrops.
Close observation will reveal vague or faint ripple marks in every layer. We can thus infer that the rock was close to the lake surface or submerged in relatively shallow water at the time of formation. In such setting, even small ripples would leave detectable marks.  </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>A ferry service runs between Ma Liu Shui and the island. Visitors can travel by MTR East Rail and get off at the University Station, then walk for about 15 minutes to Ma Liu Shui Pier where ferry service to Tung Ping Chau is available. The normal boat traveling time is about 1 hour 40 minutes. Visitors are advised to take the ferry schedule into consideration in planning the trip.  Tel +852 2527 2513.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>
