Please do not place anything else in this micro; this is a high risk muggle area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is another train and another micro. We never visited Breyten until this afternoon. I was not even aware that it had a train station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today we were searching for the exact starting location or the eye of the Vaal River. The exact location has a bridge and a dam and the Vaal River actually starts as a spring. Somehow I think somebody pulled wool over my eyes. After having a lot of trouble with dust roads, drivers from hell, a lot of dead ends and no friendly farmers we decided to call it a day. For the first time we visited this one horse town. To be frank, I think the horse died a long time ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This afternoon I suddenly remembered the days when my parents and I travelled from George to Durban with the train. This trip was done every year and it was a highlight for me. The stations were cleaned and no rubbish was present. I remember the polished floors of the train stations. In the morning on the train you could hear them shouting “coffee, coffee”. Later the conductor came around shouting “tickets tickets” and they always rattled the door with their key. Then I remember the thick blue blankets and the white linen, they always smelled good and clean. Always present was the clack clack of the wheels. I remember my old mother with her picnic baskets with a lot of goodies to eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I felt sad while driving through the town and after visiting the old station. The old railway houses are run down and are falling to pieces. Even the train is the symbol of decay and soon he will not be there. This place was probably throbbing when the trains were still active.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please do not park in the main road but use the street about 10 meters from the train that turns off the main road. Be aware of anyone approaching when you do this cache. If you feel unsafe abandon the cache. Please feel free to move the micro to another location if you believe you found a better place.

This cache marks the beginning of the Brummer Dam cache series. Terrain rating is a problem. During dry seasons I noticed people with normal sedans using this road. I personally would recommend something with a bit of clearance. If it starts to drizzle you could need a 4x2 with diff-lock. If it really starts to pour then you will probably need a 4x4. In extreme weather you could consider a boat. (Lol)

Have a good look at the road at this point and make your decision. Be careful when you retrieve this cache and have something handy to wipe your hands. Good luck and I hope you enjoy this area. If you have time and you have a fishing license then Brummer Dam is the one for you.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a traditional cache with the normal goodies placed on a hill with a view over the dam.

Right now you are on your way to the Brummer Dam. Very few people actually realize that there are two dams in this area. There is no entrance fees to this dam. A gravel road will guide you but there is various off-road tracks that will take you directly to the cache if you are brave enough. In this area several quad bike competitions are held quite regularly. Try to follow the sequence of the series and all will be fine. The terrain can be rough and I made the cache finds relatively easy.

From this point you will have a clear view on the Willem Brummer Dam. Please enjoy it and keep your eyes open for any muggles and other strange elements and nastiest.

The town Ermelo is supplied with raw water from the Douglas dam and the Willem Brummer dam. These dams are approximately 8 km to the north west of the town. Other water resources is the Usutu-vaal system which is in turn fed by the Jerico, Morgenzon and Heyshope dams. The raw water is purified at the northern water purification works, which has a purification capacity of about 13.2 Ml/day. The southern purification works has a capacity of about 5 Ml/day and it is used as a standby during emergency situations such as draught periods. Enjoy it.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please park your vehicle in such a way that you do not obstruct the traffic. You can do this one the hard way or the soft way. Hard way is to park your vehicle next to the road, take a hike and climb up to the cache. The soft way is to find the correct entrance road and to drive right up to the little hill. From here you can bunny hop from rock to rock. It is your decision.

From here on the right you will see the old caravan park of Ermelo. In its days it was a favorite place for many but today ...</groundspeak:long_description>

I will change this to a nano at one stage – all depends on the survival rate of the cache. it is not inside the building and it is not needed to climb to a lower level at all or from the platform.

Here at this quiet place a tragic incident has occurred on the 14 March 2010. If you are lucky you will find the wooden cross on your right hand as you move towards the cache. Inconsiderate people with no respect are destroying the wooden cross at regular intervals.

Attie Kleinsmit was employed as a security guard for Acsu when this tragic occurred. He did not return home at the end of his shift and his wife got worried. His son then started to search for him and he found his father's clothes hanging on the rails at the dam wall. His wife then reported him missing to the police. The police was searching for 3 days but no sign of him was found. The police divers found the body on 17 March 2010 near the dam wall. An investigation into his death came to the conclusion that no foul play is involved. Further investigations then pointed to the following story.

It is assumed that the wind blew his pet into the water. He took his clothes off and he dived or jumped into the water to retrieve it. It is believed that the cold water caused a heart attack. Attie was alone and there was no one available to assist him. He drowned at this point. The investigation revealed that someone noticed him at this location on that fatal Sunday afternoon but no one has witnessed the actual drowning. He was only 43 years old and was just recently employed by Acsu in Ermelo. His family is originally from Brits. This cache will mark the spot and hopefully some people will remember this person.

This cache is a stark reminder that our days are never 100% sure and just maybe tomorrow will never be there for us. It reminds me that we should do what we need to do today and never postpone it for a later day. If you want you can hug your partner here. Ok, if you are caching with another cacher he could slap you silly. So make your choice very carefully.

Please be careful at this location. Also have a good look at the dam wall with his leaks and the condition of the river below. If you are brave please look inside the little building. Do not trust the railings and stay clear of them as if they are not there.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a very quiet location; but keep your eyes open and keep an eye on your vehicle. There is no need to cross the river with your vehicle. Trust me - you will not like it to get stuck here. Rather do the bunny move - hop onto rocks and soon you will be on the other side. I hope the key word is &quot;dry&quot;.

Scan the area for any nastiest that want to get to you; then close your eyes and listen to the wind and/or the silence. This is a different world and you will hear some weird bird sounds in this area. From here the going will get tougher but the little valley is getting deeper and more isolated. But I prefer not to take cachers down into the valley as it is not safe from this point onward. Please check for any slithering animals before removing rocks. If this river is in flood please leave the cache alone - it will be unsafe to attempt it. Take care and enjoy it.</groundspeak:long_description>

Here you can see the effect of bad rehabilitation and the scar it left. To recover the area for possible farming will be difficult to do. If you feel like it you walk down into the quarry. I would recommended that you leave your vehicle at the top. I tried to place the cache in such a way that your vehicle is always close to you. Have a good look at the different rocks in this area. You will also notice several human interventions at this location.

Please be careful in this area and do not stick your hand in anything that was not tested with a stick. Again, please do not obstruct any traffic. If you decided to follow a off road track please take care for any holes or rocks.</groundspeak:long_description>

Use the house number to calculate the final waypoint. It could be tricky to find the correct route; please does not drive on any routes with a no entrance or private property sign. 

This house in de Jagerstreet has many legends attached to it. One of the legends are saying that the females “entertained” the British forces which was a long way from home. However, I will use the more acceptable and romantic version in this listing.

During the scorched earth policy of the British this particular house was left alone and no harm were done to the house or its occupants. It is alleged that one of the daughters of the family that stayed in this house during that period had some sort of relationship with a captain of the British forces. The family was instructed as per legend to raise the British flag on the day Ermelo was torched and attacked. The captain issued an instruction to his men concerning this house. Anyone harming the inhabitants or their property will be shot. The British experienced no resistance and Ermelo was torched except this house and a church. A few days later the British was attacked at Chrissiesmeer by the Burghers and many British soldiers perished. Maybe this was the end of the relationship.

Today this house is the oldest house in town and is declared a national monument. Please do not disturb the owners of this house as they were not informed. 

To find the cache do the following.
1. Confirm that the red bicycle is in front the house to ensure you have the correct one. The cache is not at or near the house. 
2. You need to determine the number of the house. This should be easy.
3. House number = XG
4. Cache is at S26 30.330 E30 00.0(X+G)4

This location will not have any meaning to many cachers visiting the cache. But this is a very important location for Ermelo.

On 29 August 2008 a very special event took place at this location. A human chain was formed with children and teddy bears to attempt a world record. The facts of this historical event were as follows.

The chain was formed with 2581 children each with the same number of teddy bears. (Never knew that they could get that many children together in this small town) 
The children were mainly from the primary schools in Ermelo but some of the scholars of the senior schools also joined. 
The chain was more than 2.6 km long and was a close loop all around the street block where this cache is hidden. 
The previous record was done with 1714 children. 
The teddies were donated afterwards to the Greater Rape Intervention project. (GRIP) 
The Misty Knights Mpumalanga motor bike riders also helped with the event and the organization. 
To be recognized as a world record the chain had to form a close loop and must be held close for a time period of 10 minutes. 
The main brain behind the event was Jaco Breyl and his wife Corlani organized it.
For primary children to hold on to the teddies to their left and right for a 10 minute period is a lot to ask. The news reporters were present as well as people from the Guinness book of records. My biggest fear was that my daughter will drop her teddy in front of the whole world. At one stage it was a near reality, a chopper with the observers came down in the middle to watch the chain. A lot of dust was blowing around in the area but the children hold on to their teddies with their eyes closed. After 10 minutes the alarm was sound and all the children thrown the teddies in the air. It was quite funny to see more than 2500 teddies getting airborne.

The record was set. Everybody was happy and everybody in town was watching the news that evening. To their dismay only 5 seconds was shown on television with no reference to the record or of Ermelo itself. But the event was mentioned in the Beeld and the local newspapers and that was fine. We planted the cache so that everybody can remember this event in years to come and to say thanks to the children. While you attend to the cache follow the street with your eyes and try to imagine the circle of children holding more than 2500 teddies.</groundspeak:long_description>

It was originally at the train and it lasted for a while. This cache is since archived and it was replaced with a micro on the Vaal Japie close by - this one did not lasted long before it also went to cache heaven. 

This location is in the Industrial Park and quite a couple of industries are presented here. See of you can recognize the different industries. This is our final try to stash a cache in this area. Hopefully this one will last.</groundspeak:long_description>

The old folks are telling a lot of stories about this location. People is small towns are normally very superstitious and are quick to explain any unnatural incident and to add their understanding. This is the story which was told to me and which some people still believe is the truth.

This is how it happened according to the legend. Somewhere in the past a violent thunder and hail storm erupted on one of the farms near Standerton. The farmer was furious when he saw his crops ready for harvesting destroyed. Out of frustration and desperation he grabbed his rifle and stormed to the outside. He allegedly cursed the Creator and he started to discharge his rifle wildly, aiming at the thunderclouds above him. The rifle was in his one hand and with the other hand clenched in a fist raised high above his head he stood there in the howling wind and hail. His wife and kids stood in the doorway of their home; shouting at him to return. The kids were frightened and were holding onto their mother screaming and crying.

Then it happened, a massive single bolt of lighting struck the farmer. His wife stated afterwards he stood there in the middle of the field glowing inside a white light. The wife and kids ran into the home and stayed there until the storm has passed. This is the legend as told for more than 100 years.

At this location you will find a monument which explains the truth. The farmer named Daniel Poklenberg Erasmus was a Christian which happened to be at the wrong place. He was struck on 25 January 1884 and the monument marks the exact spot. Farmer Erasmus was 44 years 6 months and 22 days old when he was struck. His family erected this monument during 1981 in an attempt to explain the truth and to stop the legends and rumours that dishonoured him.

The legend however has a strange twist in the tale. If you look very carefully you will notice that there are two indents directly in front of the monument. The legend is saying that this is where farmer Erasmus was standing when he was struck. The legend is saying that these marks will reappear if you rake the area. The legend is also saying that no grass will ever grow in this area. His family do not believe in this.

During my visit I drove around in this area for some clues. I found a dwelling about 1.8 kilometres away from the place where the farmer was struck. I do not believe that the farmer stormed out of his house and he ran into the fields for nearly 2 kilometres before he was struck. At a distance of 2 kilometres it will not be possible for his wife to see the incident. We will probably never know the truth; it is possible that the legend will carry on. But to me this was a very sad incident that took the life of farmer Erasmus.

On the other hand the grass is not growing at the indent …

Please replace the cache as found and make sure that it is not visible. Not many cachers will visit the cache and a very long time could pass before the next visit.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is always difficult for me to visit the graves of innocent children that passed away in the concentration camps. These camps were erected by the British during the Anglo Boer wars. I always experience a feeling of sadness and a feeling of shock rather than a feeling of hate.

The British was not equipped to deal with the concentration camp situation. Tents and food were scares and the war took longer than anticipated. The British started previously with a scorched earth policy and they destroyed many cattle and very little food production was seen. Language and culture was a massive barrier between the two nations. The Burghers stayed on farms before this war and any sicknesses was in many cases isolated and contained on the farm and it could not spread easily.

At Standerton one of the worst winters was experienced. Many sicknesses was aggravated due to overcrowding and sleeping on the cold earth. The burghers were now concentrated in one area and with a weaken immune system these sicknesses spread quickly through the camps. This had a huge negative impact and deaths occurred quickly. Every morning an ox wagon would do his rounds through the camp – picking up the corpses of the ones that passed during the night. They were then transported to this location to their final resting place. We can only imagine the hardships that were experienced. Black people and children were laid to rest at another location. But the suffering was sometimes even harder for them. They received less food rations and less medical attention and the Burghers shared their food with them.

At this location you will also see a little building near the graves of the children. Inside you will find a lantern which is no longer burning. To me it is a symbol of a little light that never had the chance to shine.</groundspeak:long_description>

Today this area is a recreational area where people come to enjoy themselves. Little bit of fishing, braaing and quad biking can be seen. A nice area where one can relax next to the Vaal River. However, more than 100 years ago this was a place of suffering too great for words.

The location is part of the Anglo Boer Wars which took place during 1899 and 1902. The cache is at the original Standerton concentration camp; which were situated next to the Vaal River. This was one of the camps with the highest death toll and mostly children have perished during this period. During this period abnormal cold conditions were experienced; it even snowed during 1901.

The children that passed away were not laid to rest at the cache area but was transported via ox wagon to another location and were laid to rest at that area. There is a cache called &quot;It ended here&quot; if you need to visit this location.

Close to the cache location you will notice a small monument which serves two purposes. The one side is to remember that 22 074 children has perished in these camps in less than 3 years. That is about 7358 children in a year. On average about 20 children died each day for 3 years. It is hard to understand the fears, the pain and suffering these innocent children had to endure.

On the other side of the monument you will see the names of the children of Magrietha Swart van Roodekrans who all died at this location. It is worth noting the details and the dates.</groundspeak:long_description>

No need to climb through the fence - just walk pass the entrance and around. If you follow this road you will end at the Mahawane Holiday Resort.


Volksrust is a town in the Mpumalanga Province. The main industries are beef, diary, maize, wool, and sunflower seed industries. One Escom Power Station operates close to this town. This town was established near the site of The Battle of Amajuba. Dorothea de Jager, daughter of Dirk Uys, named the town Volksrust (People's Rest). Literally the people were resting again after the British were defeated at Amajuba.Volksrust is situated some 1 675 m above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and hills that witnessed many historical happenings. The town was established in 1885 on a farm that was used by the Boers to recuperate after the battle of Amajuba (1881), during the Anglo-Transvaal War of Independence The Amajuba battle site features a memorial to British casualties on the spot where Gen Colley fell. The British suffered catastrophic losses at Amajuba.


During the second Boer War a concentration camp was built in Volksrust where many Boer children and women died. You will find a monument in town with regards to this. About 772 people died at that camp, mainly children. A bit further on with this road you will find the monument erected for those that fell during the Battle of Laingsnek which includes Dirk Uys.


If you have time you can also visit the Convention Bridge on Grensspruit which have been proclaimed a national monument. In 1894 Britain and the Transvaal Republic decided to strike a new agreement that put Swaziland under Transvaal control. A railway carriage was hauled to the middle of the bridge so that the conference table could stand astride the borders. President Kruger sat on Transvaal ground and Sir Henry on British ground.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a traditional cache. You will search for a small little LnL container under the wall on the outside of the wall. Every time I pass Volksrust it is hard to believe that there are no caches in this town. So today we paid a quick visit to see if we can get Volksrust on the geocaching map. We were amazed to find Anglo Boer War graves near the town.

In the Battle of Laingsnek (28 January 1881) fourteen men of the Boer forces died. One of them was the 25-year old son of D.C. (&quot;Swart Dirk&quot;) Uys, the famous Voortrekker leader who, after the battle of Amajuba, took part in the peace negotiations at O'Neil's Cottage. The family, grief-stricken at their loss, felt that the younger D.C. Uys, as well as his comrades, should be commemorated and so erected the tombstone in their house.

Swart Dirk Uys died in 1910. In the years to follow, the original Uys house fell into disrepair and the municipality of Volksrust has therefore erected a stone wall in close proximity to the original foundation around the grave. The original tombstone is a small round little monument and it is further on near the dam wall. This round monument was built to enclose the tomb of young Dirk Uys, killed at the Battle of Laing's Neck. His grief-stricken parents brought the body back and buried it in the lounge of their farmhouse so that he would always be with the family! The house has long since disappeared but the grave remains. To visit the original monument you will have to enter and pay the entrance fee as day visitor. We will plant a cache at this location at a later stage.

You will enter the Mahawane Resort road from the N11. The resort is further down this road. There is no entrance fee and the graves of this listing are considered public domain. As soon as you enter this road from the N11 you will have to keep your eyes open for a small dirt track on your right which will end at the graves. A long time ago there was a sign pointing to this grave yard but this no longer exists but you will find the original pole on your left hand side. If you end at the access gate of the resort then you have to make a U turn and search for the access road to the graves again.</groundspeak:long_description>

While driving around in this area I came across some strange and sometimes good locations in Volksrust. At one stage we found a German restaurant with the best German food available in Mpumalanga. We had lunch and we enjoyed their company. For obvious reasons we did not plant any caches at this restaurant. We then decided to visit the oldest part in Volksrust. We have seen good examples of houses build for an era that passed long time ago.

At this location you will find various locations which were unknown to us until today. First you will drive pass the golf course with a par of 73. Then you will find the small airport on your right. Today was a busy day and we noted two aeroplanes touching down. Then you will find the off road club entrance. Then you will find the raceway. Yes, they have a raceway. Maybe not of international status but it is there. Ok, sort of being a raceway. :) If you carry on you will find the cemetery.

I drove pass this town so many times but never bothered to stop and to have a closer look at the town. There is a lot to offer and we even discovered that there is a waterfall close by. I hope you enjoyed Volksrust.

The Battle of Schuinshoogte (8 February 1881)
During the First Boer war three very important battles took place namely the Battle of Laingsnek, Battle of Schuinshoogte and then the final Battle and British defeat at Amajuba. Colley suffered a defeat at each of these battles and he paid the highest price at Amajuba where he was killed. We will describe the battle of Schuinshoogte – also called the Battle of Ingogo.

Colley’s motive was to march to Pretoria. His plans received a major blow at Laingsnek where he suffered a huge loss and defeat. Colley had no choice – he had to withdraw to Mount Prospect and he had to wait for reinforcements. Communication with Newcastle, supplies and the transport of the sick and wounded was a critical task. The Burghers was an enemy who was on the move all the times and who did not fight or act in the established conventional warfare at that time. The slow moving transport from and to Newcastle quickly became a target for the Burghers.

Commandant-General PJ Joubert was in charge of the Burghers and he was supported by Commandants Nicholas Smit, J.D. Weilbach, A. Pretorius, Stephanus Roos, D.J. Malan, Joachim Ferreira and Gideon Erasmus. Most of these men took part in the Battle of Laingsnek and their spirit and morale was good. They done many raids and reconnaissance trips – even past Newcastle and the movements of Colley was well known to Commandant-General PJ Joubert.

The biggest disadvantage of the British was that they believed in conventional warfare which is more or less static. Parties will dig in, both will open fire and when the one party weakens the winning party will do a charge with bayonets. The Burghers on the other hand was mobile and they believed in a strategy of hit and run. The Burghers was famous for their accurate fire even on horse back with a gallop. The khaki clothes the Burghers worn at that time more or less blended in with the environment. They became an invisible enemy. In contrast the British 60th Rifles wore dark green uniforms with light helmets and both did not blend well with the South African veldt. The gunners and the mounted brigades were also equipped with dark uniforms.

Colley decided to teach the Burghers a lesson and he decided to use a show of force to stop the raids on the logistics. As the British commanding officer he had to gain some face after the defeat he suffered at the Battle of Laingsnek. This show of force took place on 8 February 1881. Transport was scheduled to leave for Newcastle. He allowed them time to move along and he then followed with a strong contingent. His motive was to ensure that they get pass the Ingogo river and the long gently sloping hill known as Schuinshoogte. The idea was to meet up with the transport from Newcastle and to escort them back to camp while the wagons destined for Newcastle then just carries on. At least he would be able to defend them in the Ingogo area against the irritating raids of the Burghers. Colley himself took charge of two 9 pounder guns, two 7 pounder guns and men totalling about 273. They reached the present Valley Inn on the banks of the Ingogo River and it appeared as if his master plan is working. No contact with any Burghers was made.

Colley had to make sure that there is a safe return route for him and he left the two 7 pounder guns and one Rifle Company just before crossing the river. They started the long climb and as they reached the plateau (Schuinshoogte) fire was drawn from about 200 Burghers. The Burghers did not plan this attack - this was a spur of the moment attack. Colley reacted and he deployed his men in a semi circle guarding both sides of the road. The battle started with full force. The Burghers were relieved as they ran out of ammunition. The rapid and sustained fire power confused the British and they felt overpowered. At this stage the gunners had a very difficult task as the target was moving all the time as the Burghers went from cover to cover. The impact of the guns was insignificant. The moment the gunners started to reload accurate and consist fire from the Burghers caused heavy casualties among the British. The mounted troops attempted a charge but accurate fire from the Burghers killed most of their horses and they had to return.

Colley ordered Macgregor to move a company from the right flank across the road to stabilize the left flank. Macgregor was killed and the company received a severe blow and most of them were killed in the following hours that followed. One can only admire the courage of the British not to raise the white flag under this severe fire but they stood their ground for hours in the killing field. At one stage the Burghers and the British was only 40 meter apart but no attempt was made to do a bayonet charge. The British was famous for this charge but this time for some unknown reason no attempt was made. A heavy downpour was experienced at about 17h00. This was a relief for those that were exposed to the blistering sun and suffering from thirst. But this quickly turned into a very chilly night and with nightfall both parties withdrawn. Some of the wounded probably died because of this added factor. At about 21h30 the British moved away and they left their dying and wounded on the battlefield. They destroyed their ammunition as there were just enough horses left to move the guns.

But their misery had no end. The Ingogo was now in flood and Colley with very little ammunition left decided not to cross at the established drift in fear of an ambush. Another 8 men were washed away and they drowned. The next morning a British party returned and they attended to the wounded. On 9 February Lieutenant Wilkinson was also washed away while attending to the wounded. This occurred on his 4th crossing.

At the end the British lost 4 officers and 62 men. About 4 officers and 63 men were also wounded. The total loss calculates to 142 including the soldiers that have drowned. The Burghers had 8 men killed and 6 that were wounded of whom 2 died at a later stage. This was the beginning of the end and the Battle of Amajuba still had to come. Colley received another serious blow and he should have known that the Burghers are outclassing him with their tactics and their superior shooting skills under command of Commandant-General PJ Joubert. His final lesson and his final sacrifice were now due in 19 days at Amajuba – the place of the doves.

There is also another interesting site at this location. As you walk down to the grave site you will notice a pile of rocks on your right hand side. This pile of rocks is the ruins of a fort that was build during the Second Anglo Boer. Have a good look at the rocks and you will notice the outlay of it.

There are several huge boulders on this road - this is the biggest of them - use your GPS to guide you the one containing the cache. Climb on top of this rock, look for a natural hollow covered by some vegetation- the cache is inside. Be on the look - out for prying eyes, the road is busy at some times. 
The original cache contains a plastic ant, some coins I picked up at other caches and a Navy needle card.

This cache can also be reached from the Newcastle / Volksrust road - take the Ingogo turn off towards Inkwelo, when you come to T-junction, take the road towards the Skuinshoogte battlefield, continue with this road past the battlefield, let your GPS guide you the cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In a time of war there are always two sides. But bravery and courage do not take sides and we should recognize a brave attempt even if it is not in our favour. At this location you will find the grave of a man that received the Victorian Cross for action against the Burghers. This is the grave of Sergeant John James Clements. He was born in Middelburg in the Old Cape Colony on 19 June 1872. He died on 18 June 1937 only one day before his 65th birthday and was buried in Newcastle. On 24 February 1901 Clements who was a corporal at that stage received a serious shot trough the lungs at Strijdenburg. This is his story.

On this specific day a scouting part which consisted of Lieutenant Harvey, Corporal Clements, a intelligence officer and four men were busy with a scouting party near a farm about 5 miles south of Strijdenburg when they heard a party of Boers were near. They managed to capture one of the Burghers which informed them that there is another 5 burghers close by on the hill. They left one man with the captured Burgher and they stormed the hill. During this attempt Clements were wounded when he received a bullet through the lungs. The Burghers then called for their surrender. Instead the 28 year old Clements threw himself between the Burghers and with his revolver managed to shot three of the Burgers. Two Burghers died at the spot and the other 3 then surrendered. With other words a total of 4 Burghers were captured. For his action he received the Victorian Cross.

Sergeants Clements went to King Edward’s Coronation in the Diamond’s Horse contingent and when they returned on 15 February 1902 he came back to South Africa and started farming again. However Clements who was also a boxer was always ready for another “scrap”. He enlisted in Botha’s scouts for the German South West Campaign in the Great War and he served his time until the autumn of 1915. He then returned and carried on with his farming activity until his death. A total of 8 children were born out of this marriage.

The VC (Victorian Cross) was introduced by Queen Victoria on 29 January 1856 to reward acts of bravery. This medal is awarded at the time of writing only 1356 times. It is been told that the metal used is from the Russian cannons captured at the Siege of Sevastopol. But this is questionable. Only 13 medals were awarded since World War two. A medal like this can reach over 400 000 pounds on an auction today and is considered very rare. The most medals ever issued for one single event was at the Battle of Rockies drift. It is also very important to note that this medal takes preference to all other medals and are always worn on the left side of all the other medals when you view the person.

*** Please note that the cache is not in the cemetry due to respect. His grave number is M79 and for fun you can search it. ***</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The following series of caches is in the Drakensberg on a panoramic pass called Mike’s Pass. 


Mike's Pass has been named after Mike De Viliers who built the pass by hand along with Italian Prisoners of war in the 1940's. Mike built the pass to access a part of the little 'berg to conduct research on the effect tree plantations would have on water sources. A weather station is build in this area equipped with all sorts of equipment that records all there is to know about water in this catchment’s area.


No ordinary sedan vehicles are allowed to drive this road and access will be denied for sure; 4x2 is the minimum requirement for this pass. During snow and rainy conditions a 4x4 could be needed. In dry seasons you do not need any specialized skills. You can also walk the pass; it is only 6.5 km long. You can also use your mountain bike. This pass is perfect for the person that hates walking but still would like to enjoy the Drankensberg and the scenery.


Entrance fee is R25 per person and access is to the left of the gate. You have to report to the hotel reception and here you have to pay for the use of the pass at R50 per vehicle. From here you have to go back to the main gate and the security will allow you access onto Mike’s Pass. To make it worth the while we decided to add some caches to the one existing cache in this area. At present only one cache exists.


Note: We believe that not many visits will be done so it will be unfair to the owner to drop his TB or coin inside a cache on this road. If you have an urge to drop a TB or coin please communicate your intention with the owner of the trackable before you drop it in a MP cache. If he agrees so be it.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Gemiler Island, also known as St Nicholas Island as it is
believed the legendary figures once made his home here, was the
perfect place to hide my #1000 finding celebration cache with the
help of Izmir dragger, my padawan aprentice.

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
On the Island are the remains of churches dating back to the 5th
Century, graves, cisterns and ancient houses. There is a tunnel
500m in length which connects two of the churches.&lt;br/&gt;
A climb to the top of the Island to watch the sunset is a
must.&lt;br/&gt;
I´m sure you gonna love it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You can reach the island by boat or swimming and there is a 4€
admission fee.&lt;br/&gt;
Its not recommended for children because you´ll be near the cliff.

&lt;p&gt;Small note on cache maintenance: There is a local
cache guardian who will assist.&lt;br/&gt;

Kätkö sijaitsee lähellä Punkaharjun hienoa harjualuetta. Ota oma kynä mukaan. Autolla tätä kätköä on turha kytätä matkakätköksi sillä pysäköinti ei onnistu turvallisesti kovin lähelle.

Huomaa, että alue on osa Punkaharjun luonnonsuojelualuetta. Harjualueella voi liikkua jalan tai hiihtäen, mieluiten olemassa olevia polkuja pitkin ja lemmikkieläimet kytkettynä. Avotulen teko ja leiriytyminen luonnonsuojelualueella on kielletty.

Kioskista voit pyytää panttia vastaan avaimen kunnostetulle korsulle.

An easy cache near centre of Joensuu, bus station and railway station.


Kätkö on Pielisjoen varressa koskikalastajien &quot;ottipaikoilla&quot;. Jästeistä ei juuri haittaa pitäisi olla... ellei sitten kalastajat onkeineen siihen satu.

Purkki on Matkahuollon lahjoittamia teemapurkkeja ja siihen mahtuu varsin kivasti matkalaisia. Alkuvaiheessa sisältönä on myös lapsille vaihtotavaroita.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Tämä on virallisesti Opencaching-sääntöjen mukaan Suomen ensimmäinen OC-kätkö, jota voi myös reliikkikätköksi kutsua! Se perustettiin jo olemassa olevaan GC-kätköön nimeltä Noljakanmäen lampi. Suomen ensimmäisen OC-kätkön löysi tästä kätköstä legendaainen joensuulainen hälyrihemmo, FTF-hunttaaja SIMPPASUURI eli Simotic ennenkuin kukaan muu oli julkaissut edes toista OC-kätköä :).
Noljakanmäellä nykyisen Lähdesuonkadun lenkin sisälle sijaitsi vielä 1980- luvun alussa lampi, jonka päättäjät kaikessa viisaudessa päättivät räjäyttää taivaan tuuliin. 
Kiivaan rakentamisen yhteydessä 1980- luvulla menetettiin eräs Noljakanmäen luonnon monimuotoisuutta rikastuttanut elementti. Noljakanmäen länsireunalla tasaisessa painanteessa sijaitsi mutapohjainen suoreunainen lampi, joka sai lisävettä yläpuolella sijaitsevasta lähteestä.
Kerrotaan, että lammessa olisi elänyt ruutanoita sekä harvinainen rauhoitettu vesilisko. Rakentamisen rytinässä arvot kuitenkin unohtuivat ja lampi räjäytettiin taivaan tuuliin ja lähde tukittiin. 10 000 kuutiota täytemaata ajettiin tilalle ja vedet johdettiin mäen alarinteeseen.
Heikki Vesajoki, Noljakan kirja 
Lammen paikalla on rakennettu omakotitaloja pihapiireineen.
Eräs omakotitalon asukas kertoi kerran vastamuuttaneelle naapurilleen seuraavaa:” Tiedätkös, että sinulla ja minulla voisi olla muuten tässä talon yhteydessä rantatontti. ”Siihen uusi naapuri:”Älä valehtele, voi per…”- ja samaa mieltä olen minäkin. Noljakan väki kävi lammella uimassa vielä 80- luvun alussa helteisinä kesäpäivinä.


Kätkö sijaitsee noin 90 metriä räjäytetystä lammesta koilliseen. Noljakanmäen lähde, josta Lähdesuonkatu on saanut nmensä, on sijainnut soikion muotoisen Lähdesuonkadun länsipuolella rinteessä suuren kuusen läheisyydessä. Muutenkin voit kuvitella hevosenkengän muotoisen lammen sijainnin vanhojen mäntyjen ja kuusien perusteella katselemalla kätköltä länteen päin kohti omakotitaloja.

In this cache you come to the area where a pond once situated. In 1980's the pond was destroyed. The cache is situated about 90 meters north east from the area a pond once was.
