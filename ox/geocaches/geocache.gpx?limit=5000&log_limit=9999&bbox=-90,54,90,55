            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Two Trees is an lovely picnic and camping spot - not too far from Abu Dhabi - and not too far off road to prevent learners to get some sand driving experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember that you need to take at least 2 cars when driving off road - have water and the correct recovery kit with you. Even this gentle drive can be a nightmare if you get stuck alone!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;when we placed the cache there were the remains of a gazelle that had fallen into the water and died trying to get out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do look for the desert roses (on the northern side of the water - 3/4 of the way up the slope).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Really enjoyed this spot - have had a few picnics here. Some good dune driving around the area. Also some nice picnic and camping spots - but can be popular - so be prepared to find the area full. We placed the cache on an overcast day when the rain came down for a while.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Where else do you think it would be - look in the sand - next to a sprinkler - yep - you read that right! </groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Thanks for bringing us out this way - a nice little jaunt to introduce some visitors to the desert.</groundspeak:text>

Had a little uneasy feeling as I approached the cache GZ - felt a little nervous reaching for the cache - so after looking carefully from all angles I did a lightning fast retrieve - and WOW - a snake was laying under the container. It was fairly small and darted under nthe rock next door. I'm sure it was still there when I replaced the cache carefully. Wonderfully stocked cache - introduced a new caching team to the sport today too.</groundspeak:text>

It took us about 40 minutes from Abu Dhabi - so could leave early and still make a wonderful sunrise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Great spots close by for a swim in clear water with no rocks underfoot. Nice and shallow - but the current does get a little strong in the main channel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look at the wonderful rock structures close to here. Also there are stromatolites growing in the Sabkha - a very interesting phenomenon.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It’s a road sidecache so please take care when caching with small children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area takes it name from one of the most prestigious and highly regarded tribes of Southern Arabia. Its origin can be traced back to Yas Bin Amer, whose tribe came from the tribe of Nizar Bin Maid bin Adnan. Partly because of its numerical superiority, but mainly because of its military prowess and proven loyalty to allies, many other tribes sought to join the Bani Yas for protection and security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most numerous and significant tribe of the UAE, the Bani Yas is made up of approximately 20 subsections. Originally centred in the Liwa oasis, the Al Bu Falah subsection resettled in 1793 in Abu Dhabi; from this subsection come the Al Nahyan family, who are the present-day rulers of Abu Dhabi. Traditionally the members of the Al Bu Falah tribe &quot;spent the winter with their camels in the desert, and many of them went pearling during the summer in the boats of other Bani Yas. The Al Bu Falah were the first to acquire property in the Buraimi oasis, and the members of the ruling family have systematically continued this policy until now&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As befits a tribe from which so many noble families have come, the members of the Bani Yas tribe are well known for their patronage of, and involvement in, the literary arts. They are also renowned for their generosity, hospitality and chivalry, as were their Bedouin forefathers.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This mosque is a copy of the Dome of the Rock mosque in Jerusalem. - A lovely building with great photo opportuntities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dome of the Rock (Arabic translit.: Masjid Qubbat As-Sakhrah) is an important Islamic shrine and Jerusalem landmark located on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. The structure, the oldest extant example of early Islamic architecture, was completed in 691 CE at the order of Arabian Umayyad Caliph, Abd al-Malik. The site's significance stems from religious traditions regarding the rock, known as the Foundation Stone, at its heart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dome of the Rock is located at the visual center of a platform known as the Temple Mount. It was constructed on the site of the Second Jewish Temple, which was destroyed during the Roman Siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. In 637 CE, Jerusalem was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate army during the Muslim conquest of Syria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dome of the Rock was erected between 689 and 691 CE. The names of the two engineers in charge of the project are given as: Yazid Ibn Salam from Jerusalem and Raja Ibn Haywah from Baysan. Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan who initiated construction of the Dome, hoped that it would “house the Muslims from cold and heat” and intended the building to serve as a shrine for pilgrims and not as a mosque for public worship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Shlomo Dov Goitein of the Hebrew University states that the Dome of the Rock was intended to compete with the many fine buildings of worship of other religions. The very form of a rotunda, given to the Qubbat as-Sakhra, although it was foreign to Islam, attempted to rival the many Christian domes of its time. A.C. Cresswell in his book Origin of the plan of the Dome of the Rock notes that those who built the shrine used the measurements of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The diameter of the dome of the shrine is 20.20m and its height 20.48m, while the diameter of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is 20.90m and its height 21.05m.&lt;br/&gt;The structure is basically octagonal. It comprises a wooden dome, approximately 60 feet (20 m) in diameter, which is mounted on an elevated drum consisting of a circle of 16 piers and columns. Surrounding this circle is an octagonal arcade of 24 piers and columns. During his travels in Jerusalem, Mark Twain wrote that:&lt;br/&gt;”Every where about the Mosque of Omar are portions of pillars, curiously wrought altars, and fragments of elegantly carved marble - precious remains of Solomon's Temple. These have been dug from all depths in the soil and rubbish of Mount Moriah, and the Moslems have always shown a disposition to preserve them with the utmost care.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;he outer side walls are made of porcelain and mirror the octagonal design. They each measure approximately 60 feet (18 m) wide and 36 feet (11 m) high. Both the dome and the exterior walls contain many windows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dome&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exterior&lt;br/&gt;The Dome is in the shape of a Byzantine martyrium, a structure intended for the housing and veneration of saintly relics, and is an excellent example of middle Byzantine art. During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent the exterior of the Dome of the Rock was covered with Iznik tiles. The work took seven years. Haj Amin Al-Husseini, appointed Grand Mufti by the British, along with Yacoub Al Ghussein implemented restoration of Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.&lt;br/&gt;In 1955 an extensive program of renovation was begun by the government of Jordan, with funds supplied by the Arab governments and Turkey. The work included replacement of large numbers of tiles dating back to the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, which had become dislodged by heavy rain. In 1965, as part of this restoration, the dome was covered with a durable aluminum and bronze alloy made in Italy, that replaced the lead exterior. The restoration was completed in August 1964. In 1993 the golden dome covering was refurbished following a donation of $8.2 million by King Hussein of Jordan who sold one of his houses in London to fund the 80 kilograms of gold required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interior&lt;br/&gt;The interior of the dome is lavishly decorated with mosaic, faience and marble, much of which was added several centuries after its completion. It also contains Qur'anic inscriptions. Sura Ya-Seen is inscribed across the top of the tile work and was commissioned in the 16th century by Suleiman the Magnificent. Al-Isra is inscribed above this. According to Goitein, the inscriptions decorating the interior clearly display a spirit of polemic against Christianity, whilst stressing at the same time the Qur'anic doctrine that Jesus was a true prophet. The formula la sharika lahu 'God has no companion' is repeated five times, the verses from Sura Maryam 19:35-37, which strongly reaffirm Jesus' prophethood to God, are quoted together with the prayer: Allahumma salli ala rasulika wa'abdika 'Isa bin Maryam - &quot;In the name of the One God (Allah) Pray for your Prophet and Servant Jesus son of Mary&quot;. He believes that this shows that rivalry with Christendom, together with the spirit of Muslim mission to the Christians, was at work at the time of construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Sunni Islamic tradition, the rock is the spot from which Muhammad ascended to Heaven accompanied by the angel Gabriel. Further, Muhammad was taken here by Gabriel to pray with Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. An important distinction is that this is to Islam what the Transfiguration of Jesus is to Christians, a fulfillment of scripture. After Muhammad's return, he called all who would believe him to join with him and be Muslim. It was at this juncture that Islam came into existence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Foundation Stone and its surroundings is the holiest site in Judaism. Just as Muslims pray towards the Kaaba at Mecca, the holiest site in Islam, Jews pray towards the raised platform on which the Dome of the Rock stands. Jews have traditionally regarded the location of the stone as the holiest spot on Earth, the site of the Holy of Holies during the Temple Period. The Jewish tradition does not have information regarding the exact location of the Holy of Holies, but the majority of scholars and rabbis believe it is somewhere in the area of the raised platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most propitious site for Jewish prayer is the spot that is nearest the Foundation Stone. Because Muslim authorities refused to permit Jewish prayer on the Temple Mount, the custom developed of praying near the Western Wall, since it was the site nearest to the Foundation Stone, or on the Mount of Olives facing the site of the Temple. Between 1948 and 1967, when Jordanian authorities refused permission to Jews to enter the Old City of Jerusalem, Jews made pilgrimages to rooftops on Mount Zion and prayed towards the site of the ancient Holy of Holies. According to Jewish tradition, the stone is the site where Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Christianity it is believed that during the time of the Byzantine Empire, near the spot where the Dome was later constructed was where Constantine's mother built a small church, calling it the Church of St. Cyrus and St. John, later on enlarged and called the Church of the Holy Wisdom. On the walls of the Dome of the Rock is an inscription in a mosaic frieze that includes the following words: &quot;Such was Jesus son of Mary and peace upon him on the day of birth and on the day of death and on the day he is raised up again. It is a word of truth in which they doubt. It is not for God to take a son. Glory be to him when he decrees a thing he only says be, and it is.&quot; (Quran:19:33–35) The date recorded as 72 after the Hijra (or 691–692 CE), which historians view as the year of the Dome's construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Welcome to the Khalifa B Mini Nano.
&lt;p&gt;This cache is slightly off the Express way but please
don't stop on the expressway as there are two areas where you
can pull off safely and it is possible to drive right up to GZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a Mini Nano container so please bring your own
tweezers, magnifying glass and a super sharp pencil. Just initial
the log sheet as this is minute with very little space available
for writing. Please place back carefully as found.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located in the heart of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates Zayed Sports City is the leading destination for sports and entertainment in the UAE. Zayed Sports City features a host of different facilities that are ideal for training, corporate events, concerts, and team sports. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is also home to the Abu Dhabi Harlequins Rugby Football Club (an affiliate club of the London Harlequins).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten Pin  Bowling, Ice Skating, Tennis and Football (soccer) are also all played at thi venue, including the annual exhibition tournament in early January for some of the top mens tennis players in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sheikh Zayed Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. It is currently used mostly for football matches but can also stage athletics. It is named after the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the founder and first president of the UAE. The construction of the stadium was completed in 1979 and it originally was designed to hold 60,000 people. However, after renovations to make the stadium comply with FIFA safety standards, its capacity diminished to 49,500 persons. It has hosted many international and regional events such as GCC football tournament in 1982, 1994, and in 2007. It was also a venue for the Asian Federation Cup final in 1996 between the host UAE, and Saudi Arabia when the latter won the championship from the penalty spot. A major event held in this stadium was the opening and final match of the FIFA Youth World Cup in 2003. Every year, the UAE cup final is played here.&lt;br/&gt;This was also the venue for the game between Manchester City Football club and UAE National Team on November 12, 2009. The final score was 1-0 to the UAE National Team.&lt;br/&gt;The stadium hosted the 2009 and 2010 FIFA Club World Cups with Al Jazira Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium. It hosted 5 of the 8 matches of the tournament including the finals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

From the signal you can go right on round about for yet another majestic view. &lt;br/&gt;Nano was placed a bit far from the mosque due to lack of parking.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The Umm al Nar junction can really feel like a twisted blob of
spaghetti for new residents.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;The big trick in this cache is finding a SAFE parking spot. And
there is a very safe one (look between the highway and golf course
road - next to the electrical pylon). DO NOT park anywhere else -
it will be dangerous there - especially not on the highway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The island of Umm al-Nar, adjacent to Abu Dhabi island, has
given its name to one of the major periods in the history of
southeastern Arabia, the Umm al-Nar period, which lasted from
around 2700 BC to 2000 BC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First excavated in 1959 by a Danish team, and subsequently
surveyed by archaeologists from the UAE and Iraq, the island of Umm
al Nar has yielded up finds that have made an enormous contribution
to our understanding of the culture and lifestyle of the early
inhabitants of the UAE. From around 2500 to 2000 BC the island was
involved in fishing and the smelting of copper, and traded as far
afield as Mesopotamia and the Indus valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indigenous people established a relatively large settlement
here and archaeologists have discovered a cemetery comprising 50
above-ground tombs. Some of these are circular in shape, from 6 to
12 metres in diameter, several metres high, and divided into
chambers accessed through small, trapezium-shaped entrances. Each
chamber was designed to contain several bodies; it is difficult to
determine numbers because skeletal remains have been scattered by
the ravages of time and the intrusion of early grave robbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tombs were dome-shaped and constructed using dressed stones,
some of which were employed in the restoration of a number of tombs
during the 1970s. The ring walls of the larger buildings were
sometimes decorated with carvings of oryx, ox, snakes and
camels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much can be determined about the activities of the islanders
from the objects found within the tombs and throughout the
settlement area. These include personal adornments such as
necklaces, jewellery and a gold hairpin; copper weapons and
imported red pottery vessels, finely crafted and decorated with
elaborate designs. Fish hooks and net sinkers clearly illustrate
the people’s dependence on the sea for food. Dugong or sea-cow
seems to have been a staple of the diet and the hide and oil were
also utilised. Now a protected species, dugongs must have once been
plentiful, for many of their bones have been identified from the
organic material found on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is almost certain that the region underwent a significant
climate change since there is no archaeological evidence of large
stone buildings on the coast and islands of Abu Dhabi after around
2000 BC. This suggests that the Bronze Age people could not survive
in the increasingly arid environment and developed a more nomadic
lifestyle, returning to the islands only during the cooler winter
season. The view that temperatures rose whilst rainfall decreased
is further supported by the analysis of the bones of birds no
longer native to the region. These include the Darter, now found no
nearer than the marshes of the Tigris/Euphrates Delta and Bruce’s
green pigeon which is found no closer than Dhofar in Oman. Dugong
bones were also found in the remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the island is very small, the special characteristics
of its ancient history have made “Umm al Nar Culture” an
internationally recognised term for the civilization that prevailed
throughout the Arabian Gulf and southeast Arabia over four thousand
years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WILL THIS BE PSEACRAFT's 100th CACHE??? - YEP - even with the
co-ord confusion. Well done &amp; And a joint FTF with Viga001.
Sorry for the confusion Camel Master - you had a good crack at FTF
too - if it wasn't for my error.&lt;/p&gt;

Waiting for the Bangladeshi made me smile
Magnetic or not?
The weather was not that hot
Cache in hand and end of the trial

TFTC - glad we got there - after some GPSr bounce putting us in the middle of no where with many options. A Bangladeshi gadner thought we were fair sport to watch - but fortunately moved on.

Glad to get closer to 800.</groundspeak:text>

Look Northwest to see the progress. City will be completed in 2016. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Masdar City aims to be a totally ebvironmentally friendly city. No cars will be allowed - one will need to park them outside the city and take driverlees electric PRTs (Personal Rapid Transports) into the city. These will run under the buildings and will drop you within 150m of your destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 60 - 100 000 people will call theis 6.5 square km area home. It also consists of a university (the main building you can currently see) which is part of the MIT network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new head office building for Masdar will be energy positive - i.e. produce more energy that it uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Masdar Street Scene&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Masdar from around the cache location in 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aerial view of Masdar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the website the following is extracted:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the first major hydrocarbon-producing economy to take such a step, Abu Dhabi has established its leadership position by launching the Masdar Initiative.The Masdar Initiative driven by the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Mubadala Development Company (Mubadala) is a global cooperative platform for the open engagement in the search for solutions to some of mankind's most pressing issues: energy security, climate change and the development of human expertise in sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abu Dhabi is leveraging its substantial resources and experience in global energy markets into the technologies of the future. One key objective of Masdar is to position Abu Dhabi as a world-class research and development hub for new energy technologies, effectively balancing its strong position in an evolving world energy market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A related objective is to drive the commercialization and adoption of these and other technologies in sustainable energy, carbon management and water conservation. In doing so, Masdar will play a decisive role in Abu Dhabi's transition from technology consumer to technology producer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is the establishment of an entirely new economic sector in Abu Dhabi around these new industries, which will assist economic diversification and the development of knowledge-based industries, while enhancing Abu Dhabi's existing record of environmental stewardship and its contribution to the global community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">OK...this log is a bit complicated...but here goes.   My Dad is headed over to the UAE to visit my brother.  I asked my brother if he would try and find this cache so we could move some coins and TB's here.   While my brother knew about geocaching, he had never actually gone after or found one.  So I spent about a week setting him up and he agreed to give it a shot, even without a hand held GPS.   

Last night, at about 12:45am my time (Eastern US), the phone rings.   It is never good when the phone rings that late.  But in this case it was brother telling me that he had found the cache!   He was very excited and so was I.   DadsGLC was over the top happy this morning when I let her know.   

So while I was not there, I did all of the leg work and guided him to the cache from 1/2 way around the world.  So since my brother put mine, DadsGLC, and his own name in log, I am logging the cache here. This may be the closest I ever get to actually finding a cache in this part of the world.

I will log in the coins and TB's once they are actually in the cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Masdar City, a clean-technology cluster located in what aims to be one of the most sustainable cities in the world. As you will see and&lt;br/&gt;hear during your tour, bringing such a project to life necessarily began at the design stage, long before the first shovel of sand was lifted. It will continue throughout the construction phase and will be maintained during the life of the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to achieve the city’s goal of being one of the most sustainable cities in the world – as well as a great place to live and work – every aspect of the city’s urban planning and architecture has been&lt;br/&gt;approached with sustainability in mind. More specifically, design should seek to facilitate energy generation where applicable (such as the angling and shape of roofs) and reduced consumption of electricity and water. As a result, seven overriding characteristics define Masdar City:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optimally Oriented&lt;br/&gt;The city and street grid are oriented on a southeast-northwest axis, thereby providing some shading at the street level throughout the day, minimising thermal gain on building walls and facilitating the flow of cooling breezes through the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integrated&lt;br/&gt;There are no separate zones for industry or culture. The university and traditional business elements are embedded in the heart of the community, as are entertainment and leisure facilities. Residents and commuters living and working here will find everything they need close at hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low Rise, High Density&lt;br/&gt;These two elements are central to a lowenergy urban community for a variety of reasons, including lower energy use on transportation (both between and within buildings) and reduced heating/cooling loads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vibrant urban Realm&lt;br/&gt;Public spaces are as important as the buildings in Masdar City, with a variety of tactics used to activate these space. As a result, the city is a place where streets and squares facilitate interaction and engagement with fellow residents, commuters and visitors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pedestrian Friendly&lt;br/&gt;A pedestrian city on the pedestrian level of the street allows buildings to be closer together, thereby providing greater overshading and a cooler street environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High Quality of Life&lt;br/&gt;Masdar City is designed to provide the highest quality of life with the lowest&lt;br/&gt;environmental impact, in part to demonstrate that environmentally responsible living does not imply hardship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Convenient Public Transportation&lt;br/&gt;Whether through the network of electric buses, other clean-energy transport solutions and the PRT system being test piloted, or the Abu Dhabi light rail and metro systems, Masdar City is designed to&lt;br/&gt;be comfortably and easily reached and traversed by public transportation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional Arabian City Design&lt;br/&gt;The city’s master planners, took inspiration from traditional Arabian city planning. Not only does this indigenous design incorporate numerous strategies to address the desert climate, but it also is characterised by relatively low overall energy consumption. That’s because traditional Arabian cities are compact and densely populated. They are also socially&lt;br/&gt;diverse places where people live and work in the same environs, and feature lively and enjoyable public spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CODEWORD REQUIREMENT: I need to know what is the name of the Residence block next to Caribou Coffee shop (Green Arrows)</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Next to the new ALDAR headquarters - the round building - dubbed &quot;The Dirham Building&quot; by my sons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Dirham or dirhem is a unit of currency in several Arab nations, and formerly the related unit of mass (the Ottoman dram) in the Ottoman Empire. The name derives from the Greek currency drachma. Historically, the word &quot;dirham&quot; is derived from the name of a Greek coin, the Drachma; the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire controlled the Levant and traded with Arabia, circulating the coin there in pre-Islamic times and afterward. It was this currency which was initially adopted as an Arab word; then near the end of the 7th century the coin became an Islamic currency bearing the name of the sovereign and a religious verse. The dirham was struck in many Mediterranean countries, including Spain, and could be used as currency in Europe between the 10th and 12th centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compare the Armenian dram for a currency whose name bears a similar origin. Also compare dinar for another currency circulated in the Muslim world but originating with the Romans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dirham (code: AED) is the currency of the United Arab Emirates. The ISO 4217 code (currency abbreviation) for the United Arab Emirates dirham is AED. Unofficial abbreviations include DH or Dhs. The dirham is subdivided into 100 fils.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The United Arab Emirates dirham was introduced in 1973. It replaced the Qatar and Dubai riyal at par. The Qatar and Dubai riyal had circulated since 1966 in all of the emirates except Abu Dhabi, where the dirham replaced the Bahraini dinar at 1 dirham = 0.1 dinar. Before 1966, all the emirates that were to form the UAE used the Gulf rupee. As in Qatar, the emirates briefly adopted the Saudi riyal during the transition from the Gulf rupee to the Qatar and Dubai riyal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On 28 January 1978, the dirham was officially pegged to the IMF's Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). In practice, it is pegged to the U.S. dollar for most of the time. Since November 1997, the dirham has been pegged to the 1 U.S. dollar = 3.6725 dirhams, which translates to approximately 1 dirham = 0.272294 dollar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name Dirham derives from the Greek word Drachmae, being one of the most widely used currencies of all time. Due to centuries old trade and usage of the currency, dirham survived through the Ottoman regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coins&lt;br/&gt;In 1973, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 fils, and 1 dirham. The 1, 5 and 10 fils are struck in bronze, with the higher denominations in cupro-nickel. The fils coins were same size and composition as the corresponding Qatar and Dubai dirham coins. In 1995, the 50 fils and 1 dirham coins were reduced in size, with the new 50 fils being curve-equilateral-heptagonal shaped.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The value and numbers on the coins are written in Eastern Arabic numerals and the text is in Arabic. The 1, 5 and 10 fils coins are rarely used in everyday life, so all amounts will be rounded up or down to the nearest multiples of 25 fils. The 1 fils coin is a rarity and does not circulate significantly. In making change there is a risk of confusing the old 50 fils coin for the modern 1 dirham coin because the coins are almost the same size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since 1976 the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates has minted several commemorative coins celebrating different events and rulers of the United Arab Emirates. For details, see Commemorative coins of the United Arab Emirates dirham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Issues with fraud&lt;br/&gt;By August 2006 it became publicly known that the Philippine one peso coin is the same size as one dirham. As 1 peso is only worth 8 fils, this has led to vending machine fraud in the U.A.E. The Australian ten cent coin is the same size, shape and weight as the U.A.E. Dirham. Pakistan's 5 Rupee coin, Omani 50 Baisa coin and the Moroccan Dirham is also the same size as U.A.E. one Dirham coin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although coins from other countries are the same size and shape as the United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED), they are an unofficial currency therefore cannot be used in vending machines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Banknotes&lt;br/&gt;In 1973, the U.A.E. Currency Board introduced notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 1000 dirham. A second series of note was introduced in 1982 which omitted the 1 and 1000 dirham notes. 500 dirham notes were introduced in 1983, followed by 200 dirham in 1989. 1000 dirham notes were reintroduced in 2000. Banknotes are currently available in denominations of 5 (brown), 10 (green), 20 (light blue), 50 (purple), 100 (pink), 200 (green/brown), 500 (navy blue) and 1000 (greenish blue) dirham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The obverse texts are written in Arabic with numbers in Eastern Arabic numerals; the reverse texts are in English with numbers in Arabic numerals. The 200 dirham denomination is scarce as it was only produced in 1989; any circulating today come from bank stocks. The 200 dirham denomination has since been reissued and is now in circulation since late May 2008 - it has been reissued in a different colour; Yellow/Brown to replace the older Green/Brown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Source: Mostly Wikipedia)</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt; This is a magnetic Water Tight Film Canister and only contains the log. Bring your own pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a nice park situated near a couple of Hotels.&lt;br /&gt;
Should be attractive both night and day. There can be significant muggle traffic depending on your timing. But the cache is situated where you should be able to avoid too much attention.&lt;br /&gt;
Attached 3 feet from the ground.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please visit all my other caches!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stealth required!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy GeoCaching&lt;/p&gt;

BTW I think its safer to replace it where it is now. If a cacher cant find it then who can  	[:)]</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">In from North Carolina, USA.  I like finding a clean log. [:D]  One of the tougher caches I've ever gotten to.  Thats because I had to walk seven miles to log it!  3.5 miles from the hotel to the cache and 3.5 back. [xx(]  Although it wasn't particularly hot, it wasn't cool either.  It was sunny!  Then I had to go to work after this ordeal!

I had to get at least one cache in before I left and this was the closest one not disabled.  Great location.  I loved the title and theme.  I had no idea what to expect when I got there and just laughed out loud when I got to the location.  Very nice location and nice hide.  The cache and log are in good shape.  Thanks for your work in putting out caches in this locale.  Dropped some coins for mileage.  SL TFTC.  </groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Highway Jungle&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This is a regular size Water Tight cache box and contains the logbook, pen and space for some items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the nice Cache site between two streets near the CORNICHE, not far from “The Seven Fountain”, situated near a couple of Hotels.&lt;br /&gt;
I stashed this cache when I was out for a walk in the morning. I think Abu Dhabi needs much more caches, bigger than magnetic nanos.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache container is hidden under a stone slab on the edge of a big stone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fastest way to reach the cache site is the dangerous road crossing, the second choice is own risk parking 20 meters nearby the cache and the recommended cache access is you can regular paid parking and have approximately 200 meters walk around the fountain (see Google Earth cache site).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Stealth required!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy GeoCaching&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately it was very hazy due to dust in the air. But thanks for bringing us to this spot. Good to see different parts of the city. Enjoyed walking through the nearby Iranian souk

Stealth is required due to the high muggle area nearby (the labour camp in the area), and it is NOT a good idea to leave coins in this cache either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be extra careful when retrieving and replacing this cache. The previous cache in the area was most likely muggled by bored labourers . The cache is on the road side not the seaside , so not a lot of rock climbing is required, however some climbing is still required so  be careful.&lt;br/&gt;PLEASE place the cache back very carefully once you have signed the log sheet, make sure it is secure and not visible to passing traffic, so that other cachers may also enjoy  the hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This cache is dedicated to “Antron” ,who is a geocaching  team in South Africa. They introduced us to a standard of caches, that we have tried to keep. Always willing to take a new cacher under their wing and help them get the most enjoyment from the hobby, we have a lot to thank them for.  </groundspeak:long_description>

Cache was still well visible once you knew what you were looking for. My initial idea of what to look foir was wrong - so nice hide - another top cache for the Clan.
