&lt;p&gt;Cache site features a nice place to sit and enjoy a few minutes
in a tranquil spot surrounded by industry and agriculture. &lt;b&gt;Cache
is not at posted coodinates - see hint.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

trail/dirt road.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The name &quot;Concrete Forest&quot; evokes images of urban
sprawl and frantic activity. But not to worry, this is actually in
a very serene and natural setting.  The coordinates for the
first part will place you in the middle of an old abandoned
dairy.  This area is used for paintball games sometimes so it
may be difficult to access during those times. Cache is a large nut
container and can be reached  by driving or walking on one of
the dirt roads in the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Camarillo Regional Park has a gate which is
normally shut during the week and sometimes on weekends.  It
is open when model airplane and boating hobbyists are
present.  If the gate is open and you drive in, leave a note
on the end of the gate, telling when you went in and what you are
driving, so that if someone comes along to lock it, they will know
that you will be out soon. Be sure to remove the note when you
leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can park outside the gate legally from 7AM to 7PM and walk
in.  It is a flat 1.9 mile round trip from the gate to both
parts of the cache and back.  (Keep to the right so you will
be on the dirt road south of the model airplane field on your way
to part one.  On the way back from the final location, you can
take the dirt road north of the field then continue west back to
the gate.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful - bees sometimes are near this
location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pleasant Valley has a rich history created by a blending of
peoples and cultures over the centuries beginning with the
prehistoric ancestors of the Chumash and encompassing Spanish and
Mexican settlers of the Mission Era and romantic Rancho Period, and
the &quot;Americanos&quot; who settled in the new State after the Mexican
War. The rich agricultural area flourished as the early ranchers
and farmers worked to develop the towns and economy, an effort
assisted by the advent of the railroad. The Museum and Garden are
designed to provide visitors with a glimpse of this heritage by
sharing the legacy of those who brought dreams to life in this
Pleasant Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroll along paved paths through the native plants and trees of
the Charles L. Honn Botanical Garden. Linger in the Victorian
Gazebo or rest among the foliage on a bench or chair enjoying the
fragrance and beauty of this living collection and stop to rest and
enjoy the beauty on the many chairs and benches. Specimen plants
and trees are identified.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Difficulty is based on your ability to find the way to the cache
location. A level, but &quot;dirty&quot; road will let you drive right up to
the cache location. It may be hard to get to cache area on the
weekend if the paintball battlefield is active and the rest of the
time if you read too many signs.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is another &quot;mini confluence&quot; cache where the intersection of
lat/long lines on the map is what determines where to place a
geocache. It turns out that the path to this location is very
entertaining and is for the adventurous among you. There is a gate
near the cache. If it is locked, it will be necessary to use the
riverbed for a few yards and approach from that direction. The
cache is a large ammo box so bring your hard-to-fit travel
bugs.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Note: There is a paintball field that is active on weekends from
9AM to 4PM about 1/2 mile west of the cache. The road to the cache
is adjacent to the &quot;battleground&quot;. If you arrive during those
hours, please go to the Urban Quest office/shack and tell them you
are seeking the geocache and wish to pass through. The owner (Dave)
is interested in geocaching and just wants to know that
non-paintballers are in the area. The cache is also accessible from
the east via hiking or biking.

just off one of the little known trails that provide sweeping views
of the land along the Highway 118 corridor. From the cache, you can
look north and see a Victorian building on the corner of Hwy 118
and Center School Road. This historical house was a school about
100 years ago. Further north you will see the hills between
Camarillo and Santa Paula. The cache is a camoflaged M&amp;Ms

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is the second incarnation of this cache. The first one was
placed too close to the fence next to the Santa Monica Mountains
National Recreation Area and needed to be archived after only three
finds. The original log is still in the container. The container is
not unique but you might never see another one like it. It is about
the size of a nut jar. It is log only. Please bring a pen or

The corner of 10th and Santa Barbara streets in Santa Paula is surrounded by tributes to the three forces that shaped the town: farms, trains and oil. The train tracks, the railroad depot and the Mill building — a future farm museum — are all visible from that corner, and the California Oil Museum is just a block away.

Given those surroundings, the neighborhood's newest attraction might as well have been dropped from space.

It's a perfectly spherical, 5,300-pound ball of granite imported from India. It floats above its granite stand by a steady stream of water.</groundspeak:long_description>

Other stuff had gotten in the way of teaming up for a power caching run this year, so this was a great way and area to conclude 2009 with an exclamation point, for we found [b][i]205 caches[/b][/i] with only a handful of DNFs!  While 251 is the personal best in a day, today's effort certainly knocked the rust off our GPS receivers!!! We found #100 before noon (5 hours ETI) and #200 before 6PM (11 hours ETI ). Would like to thank all those who helped to make it so memorable by hiding and maintaining these hides!  [8D]

In the midwest with the cold winters they are turned off for a good part of the year and sometimes because of maintenance they don't turn on the water at all. So I was really happy to see that this one was on and I could play with the ball. It is amazing how long the ball will rotate once you start it moving. Thanks for placing a cache here.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The corner of 10th and Santa Barbara streets in Santa Paula is
surrounded by tributes to the three forces that shaped the town:
farms, trains and oil. The train tracks, the railroad depot and the
Mill building — a future farm museum — are all visible
from that corner, and the California Oil Museum is just a block
away.
&lt;p&gt;Given those surroundings, the neighborhood's newest attraction
might as well have been dropped from space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a perfectly spherical, 5,300-pound ball of granite imported
from India. It floats above its granite stand by a steady stream of
water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santa Paula unveiled the fountain Monday, August 14, 2006. It's
the centerpiece of Railroad Community Park, a privately funded
venture that was officially turned over to the city during a Sept.
5, 2006 ribbon-cutting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you are here, be sure to do the excellent virtual cache by
Chaosmanor, &quot;This Stop is Santa Paula&quot; just down the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is mint container. You'll have a &lt;b&gt;ball&lt;/b&gt; finding
this.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Ozone (O3) is a triatomic molecule, consisting of three oxygen atoms. It is an allotrope of oxygen that is much less stable than the diatomic O2. Ground-level ozone is an air pollutant with harmful effects on the respiratory systems of animals. Ozone in the upper atmosphere filters potentially damaging ultraviolet light from reaching the Earth's surface. It is present in low concentrations throughout the Earth's atmosphere. It has many industrial and consumer applications. Ozone therapy is a controversial alternative medicine practice; mainstream scientific medicine has found ozone to be harmful to humans,[1] and equipment intended to be used for ozone therapy is banned in the United States.[2] Ozone, the first allotrope of a chemical element to be described by science, was discovered by Christian Friedrich Schönbein in 1840, who named it after the Greek word for smell (ozein), from the peculiar odor in lightning storms.[3] The odor from a lightning strike is from ions produced during the rapid chemical changes, not from the ozone itself.[4]

my visit. The other caches were traditional caches, this one you've
got to figure out the puzzle to find the actual location of the
cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial cashe contents include: Log and pen, 10 marbles, 2
bottles of bubbles, 2 party poppers, 3 pencils (Winnie the Pooh,
Eyor and Tigger), 2 heart bracelets, black bear figurine, and an
exclamation point stamper.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I noticed that there were no listed caches in Kettleman City, so I decided to be the instigator of some treasure hunting.

Initial contents of this cache include a pack of 15 glow necklaces and connectors, 2 heart bracelets, 2 crazy straws, 2 pencils (Eyor and Tigger), and a pocket tissue pack.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a decon container, just off Highway 108, a few miles east of Kennedy Meadows, across the road from a wide turnout.

0ut exploring 108 we could see many waterfalls, and some snow still in a few areas, even in July. But this waterfall along Deadman's Creek was right off the side of the road and we had to stop to look. We found a small trail that led to a perfect lookout of the falls, just 15-20 feet off the road. I imagine in spring the water coming down covers this entire rock structure. If you walk along the road just past the falls you can access them at the top, and see additional falls and pools above this one.

I'm not exactly sure what the winter restrictions are like on 108, but this section of the road does close at some point due to snow. I believe it is still accessible by foot or snowmobile when the road is closed.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>At the end of the small path there is a large rock you can stand on to face the falls and view the pool below. The cache is under that rock.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Flat Road, just 1.5 miles south of where Hwy 108 ends.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This location made us immediately think about the signal fires that
were on the tops of a string of mountains in the movie &quot;The Lord of
the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; These signal fires were used to
communicate that a stronghold was in danger of attack by enemies
and that help was needed. We have found everything needed but the
fuel to burn. Very impressive views of the Sierra Nevada mountain
range. At this location you will actually be 9,800 ft above sea
level, which is even higher than Sonora Pass by about 175 ft. Turn
around and you have a stunning view of the white peaks of the
Sweetwaters. Enjoy a truly breathtaking 360 degree view. Just
remember, the Eye of Sauron is always watching! 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>[Hint 1.] Sauron's eye is about the same height as yours. 
[Hint 2.] Locate the large flat rock half way up east side of column that has several golf ball size rocks on top of it. Look there!</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;In general
relativity, an event horizon is a boundary in spacetime, most often
an area surrounding a black hole, beyond which events cannot affect
an outside observer. Light emitted from beyond the horizon can
never reach the observer, and any object that approaches the
horizon from the observer's side appears to slow down and never
quite pass through the horizon, with its image becoming more and
more redshifted as time elapses. The traveling object, however,
experiences no strange effects and does, in fact, pass through the
horizon in a finite amount of proper time.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;While
searching google earth for a great spot to hide an ammo can, I came
across a large black area on the map. I couldn't really tell what
the terrain looked like, but I figured neither could future cache
seekers. I knew I had found my spot! The original idea was to place
this one in the middle of this &quot;black hole&quot;, but I found a spot
right next to the black hole that I liked better, thus the name
&quot;Event Horizon&quot;.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I'm not going
to lie, I left this one with some bumps and bruises. The terrain is
definitely not friendly for small kids.I was able to park about .75
miles away by following a &quot;trail&quot;. And by trail I mean a really
rocky area that at one point somebody had driven something over, so
you're not going to get that close in the family
wagon.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Note: I didn't
put the &quot;dog friendly&quot; attribute on this cache, but I did take my
dogs when I placed the cache. They were absolutely exhausted by the
time we were done, and they got some good cuts on their pads, so I
probably wouldn't suggest it.&lt;/b&gt;

Get the podcast here-  http://sprkygrg.podbean.com/mf/web/vdd4gk/creekstonerev1.mp3 (right click and save) OR read the description.. 1.5 mile walk on paved paths. Moderate altitude gain. Accessible walkways until the last 100 feet, which is level grass. Container is a nice size lock and lock, (about right sized for a block of tillamook cheese).

Thanks for trying out a podcache. When I first heard of the concept it seemed intriguing, I hope it is a fun hunt for you. This is not a challenging cache in the sense of tricky hides or clues to decipher, it is pretty straightforward so as to test the podcache concept and delivery methods. Bring some paper and pencil (or whatever electronic equivalent you prefer) to record some data and do some simple math. The total walk, or bike ride, will be about 1.5 miles. Nearly all is on paved walking paths, some is on sidewalk, and less than a hundred feet is on a level grassy surface. There is some moderate altitude gain. I would expect walking should take an hour and a half. A bike ride could be done in less than half an hour, (depending on fitness level and math skills.) The final is in a pretty exposed location, so please try to employ some stealth, perhaps returning after dark if time allows. It is a good sized lock and lock with some decent trade goods stocked to start off with. I have laid out a parking spot based on the thought that it will never be in front of someone's house. Right now, since the development is not yet filled in, there is space up at the trailhead, but I assume due to the BPA easement there will never be housing at my planned parking spot. I also anticipate a couple of new caches in locations which would be accessible from this parking spot. Head uphill to 46 11.659, 119 11.494. That is the trailhead. You could actually park back at the west end of the demonstration garden at the Mid-Columbia Library-Kennewick branch, reachable from off 19th, but since the Bureau of Reclamation has posted the canal access I didn't think it the best jumping off point for most. I see a lot of the local homeowners walking the canal bank, in fact some have put in stairs to access the canal bank from their backyard or cul-de-sac, but postings are postings. Head on up to the trail head, press pause now and start back up when you get there. Head west on the pathway, the canal will be on your right and homes on your left. The next control point and some data to record will be at 46 11.621, 119 11.778, which is about .23 miles in, where you cross a road. Pause your player and enjoy the walk to the control point. At the first control point look for a light pole. I think all the street lights are owned by the PUD, each pole has a unique identifier. Look for a five digit code, starting with the letter K, finishing with four numbers. The numbers are up high, on metal embossed tags with large black numbers on a yellow background. Record the four numbers for later ___ ___ ___ ___ . Cross the street and stay on the path. Cool little retention basin here with some interesting rocks. I hope to have another cache at this spot. If it doesn't pan out maybe someone else will put one in. The next control point is a footbridge. Press pause. At about .39 miles into the walk there is a small footbridge over the canal. It links to other pathways that can loop back to parking, out to the start of the exercise loop or out to 10th. The bridge is all metal. Anyone thinking what I'm thinking? Next control point is an intersection in the path with some exercise equipment. Pause. The exercise equipment is at (very approximately) 46 11.499, 119 11.973. Turn left and go up the hill past this gear. It is the last part of a walking/exercise installation. If you look downhill and west you can see the start of the exercise route. Sounds like the startings of a multi-cache to me. They have some signs with details on how to do the exercises, look for the one with some stretches, labeled &quot;Maybe&quot; and &quot;NO&quot;. It is the last station on the way uphill. You don't need to leave the path. Write down the station number ___ ___ and head uphill toward the next control point, the water tank. Pause until you get close to the tank. As the path approaches the tank you can see a No Trespassing sign, red letters on white background. The sign has a sequence of numbers along the bottom, 14 digits total. The format is xx.xx.xxx-xx.xx.xxx. Extract the 6th and 7th digit, multiply by 11 and add 5. this is the decimal Lon. 119 11.xyz. ___ ___ x11= ___ ___ ____ +5= _____ _____ ____ . Head uphill past the water tank, then bear right, uphill, through the open space on your way to 27th. Try not to envision any caches under the strategically placed rocks along this fence. There aren't a lot of houses backed up against the path here, and plenty of people will be taking walks so who would notice a cacher if we don't make the hides too difficult? Head up to the roundabout on 27th, pause it till then. At 27th, cross the street twice to get to the southeast corner. Get the number from the light pole. ___ ___ ___ ____ . The pole should be at about 46 11.326, 119 11.764. Take the number of the first pole, subtract the number of the second pole, add the station number from the exercise gear, then add 108. This yields the decimal part of the Lat, 46 11.abc. ___ ___ ___ ___ - ___ ___ ___ ___ + ___ ___ + 108 = ___ ___ ___. The checksum is, add your two decimal results, you should get 950. Now the hunt is on!! To get back to the parking spot you have many options. Here is my route- cross back to the southeast side of the roundabout. Head downhill on the serpentine asphalt walkway past the PUD gear (large dark green ground mounted box) with L915 marked on it. Go down the hill and cross the corner of 24th and Harrison at an angle. Continue on the path to the next street. At 23rd and South Grant leave the path turning left on Grant. Go to 20th and turn right. Go to Fillmore and turn left. As you cross 19th stay on Fillmore, which means you bear slightly left. At the next intersection, jog to the right as you cross 18th and enter the pathway again. Keep on the pathway as you cross 17th and 16th, this path t-bones into the original walkway between the trailhead and the first control point. Turn right on the path and head back to parking. Hope you have a fun time on this cache, I would appreciate any feedback. Cache on. </groundspeak:long_description>

I averaged readings from three different days, but went back later and was told I was 20 feet off by the GPS. Not sure if I can blame sunspots or not, but it should be an easy find very near the paved trail. If you start heading down into the little ravine turn around and head back up, you'll probably spot it easier from that vantage anyway. </groundspeak:long_description>

Read Carefully... 



Robin Hood of Wyoming



Cassidy rode into history with certain panache not all attain. His
infamous story might have started when, as a teenager, he rode into
town finding the haberdashery closed he broke in and took a pair of
jeans leaving an IOU on the till. Honesty mixed with lack of
thought coalesced in getting him arrested. Wherever it started,
Cassidy was to many the Robin Hood of Wyoming.


In his teen years Robert Leroy Parker, became friends with Mike
Cassidy, an older ranch hand who taught him cowboy skills,
including small time rustling. At seventeen, Roy, was busted for
stealing a saddle but never convicted. The next year Roy left home
fleeing charges for horse theft. At twenty, Roy left his legal name
behind taking the name George Cassidy in honor of his
mentor.


The next few years Cassidy was adrift in the old west. He was a
hard working cowboy, making life long friends all over the west. He had a natural style when it came to the ladies, never needing an ice breaker. NOPE
Cassidy also drifted into the McCarty gang and his first train
robbery. In the early 1890s, Cassidy was accused of horse theft and
earned his nickname working as a butcher before being convicted.
Butch Cassidy was sentenced to prison and later pardoned by the
governor.


Butch left prison in 1896 determined to take up life as an outlaw.
Cassidy headed directly to Johnson County. In this southwest corner
of Wyoming, he organized his gang, the Wild Bunch. As in all
business, it is location, location, location.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Molson is a place with a population of 35 (according to the
sign at the entrance to town) located just south of the Canadian
border in Okanogan County, Washington. It is actually the remnants
of three distinct early 20th Century phases of Molson: Old Molson,
Central Molson, and New Molson. During its heyday 100 years ago,
the population of the area was several hundred. There are two
museums in town; the Old Molson Museum and the Molson
Schoolhouse.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Hello OpenCachers,

This OpenCache is located in Kelowna's beautiful Mission Creek Greenway.
This is an existing geocache from geocaching.com.(GC2CCD6)
If you would like to challenge yourself a bit then you will like this one. It's a nice walk up to it. (Parking: N 49° 51.060 W 119° 23.228  - Trailhead: N 49° 51.005, W 119° 23.032)
You are looking for a small camo'ed plastic container with a few small trading items and a log book.
You will be required to bring your own writing stick.

If you decide to bring kids then PLEASE watch them carefully... the hill is steep and dangerous to kids and adults if not paying attention.
I hope you like it.

Johnnygeo

Turbo is a friendly, fluffy tabby cat.

This can be a quick stop-and-grab, or part of a longer trip along the Greenway, where there are several other caches. Bring your own pen.
Stay on the walkway portion of the bridge. You don't need to do anything dangerous to find this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

Not even in town for an hour and I had to rush off and find a cache... lol
Car thermometer was showing an outdoor temp of 37!
Brought a newbie with me. I think I may have created another &quot;geocacher&quot;... We'll see...
Once I found the cache it was time to relax and enjoy an ice cold &quot;refreshment&quot;.
Thanks for the OpenCache,

Lock and Lock Container with lots of space.

I have been trying to promote geocaching in my community and I have started getting neighbors and friends involved so we created this quick easy cache.

It's a great intro cache to bring new cachers to and it is a really easy drop off spot for trackables.

It's on a discreet corner of our property that is mostly blocked from view by your vehicle if you came in one.

It is easy for us to maintain and add goodies to on a regular basis.

**Cache #112 of the Okanagan CacheFest hosted by the Kelowna Geocaching Club

Happy Caching!
