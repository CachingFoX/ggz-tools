Many people like follow the Rio Rimac up to the little town of Chosica. But if you want to get a little of the beaten path turn your GPS on and Look and for Santa Eulalia.

This will take all of a day if you staying in Lima&lt;br/&gt;Look for a white round plastic one gallon jar with a black Plastic lid&lt;br/&gt;Descripcion:&lt;br/&gt;Si visitas Lima Peru alguna vez y tienes un dia completo dedicado a explorar .Muchas personas les gusta ir a Chosica  siguiendo el Rio Rimac. Pero si quieres ir mas adentro enciende tu GPS y busca la cuidad de Santa Eulalia. Nosotros encontramos un bonito lugar donde comer en el restaurant campestre La Olla de Barro y desde que  estaba lloviendo sabiamos que el lugar seria mas aun perfecto. Esto te tomara todo un dia completo sit e quedas en Lima.&lt;br/&gt;Busca un bote de plastico blanco con tapa negra .&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Two miles wide, this island retreat is a great snorkeling and dive spot. A coral reef surrounds the island. It is the epitome of the cruise lines’ private beach resorts with mangrove trees surrounded by spectacular white sand beaches.

The 13 people present at the Last Supper incorporates this idea, and it is still considered unlucky to have 13 people at a table. A coven of witches was supposed to have 13 members. The 13th day of the month is considered unlucky, especially when it falls on a Friday.&lt;br/&gt;The number thirteen is lucky in Chinese because it sounds close to &quot;definitely living.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subha Muhurtham days In 2011 May 13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some cultures think &quot;13&quot; is unlucky some consider it auspicious.

Aujourd'hui direction Chilleurs aux Bois, Saint Jean de Braye et le bord de la Loire pour une grosse journée de découvertes et de caches.
Je suis mon co-pilote en vélo tout le long, qui s'est occupé du parcours et de l'intendance.
De mon côté j'ai résolu les énigmes tranquillement à la maison. 

Après 2 énigmes de Campa nous attaquons à la série alphabétique de l’Évent des Bois.
L'endroit est vraiment magnifique surtout quand on la chance de croiser des biches sur le chemin.    [8D]
La boite est vite découverte et cela sera de même tout au long de la journée sauf pour une Mystery devenue Tradi.

[Green]Merci Klaptev pour cette cache !!!

Permission to place this cache here has been obtained from Blake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CACHE IS NOT AT THE ABOVE LISTED COORDINATES !  The coordinates given will take you to a picture window – inside the picture window is one of the original horse drawn carriages used by this business in 1885.  Located just a few feet away is a replica of the John Constant House (circa 1720) which was rebuilt on this location in 1994 by Constantia Chapter D.A.R.  This house is still used by the public for a variety of meetings.  This business has been at this location since 1942 but has been in business since 1885 when it was started at the corner of Main St and E. Washington Street in downtown Suffolk as a furniture store that dealt in made-to-order coffins and home furnishings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also at this location please take the time to enjoy the California Redwood tree which was transplanted here in 1954.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once at this location and when you are done admiring the carriage, take a very short walk to the front of the replica John Constant House (small house behind the main building of this business).  Take a seat on the stone bench directly in front of the house and spend a few moments to take in the Redwood Tree and the garden area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Permission has been obtained to place this cache here but the owner asks that if the parking lot is full of cars, there is a service ongoing, and please return at a later time.  NO bush-wacking is involved in this cache.  Also be aware that the local L.E.O.s may be present in the parking lot at night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a Ammo Can (11x8x6) – original contents included, log, pen, various toys, the Shiro Travel Bug, a Symbology Geocoin, and for the First To Find – a 2000 Gold One Dollar John Quincy Adams Coin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*** CONGRATS to L.E.O.GEOs for the FTF ! ! ! ***</groundspeak:long_description>

with 5 of my personal tags for the F5TF, and several others that I
have extras of.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, if you take a Pathtag,
leave a Pathtag so that others can add onto their

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you figure out the above coordinates you will
need to know the answer to the question listed below.. The answer
can be found on this website. I learned about this great thing we
all love by researching the history. I thought that it would be
cool to get others to do the same and maybe learn something they
didn't already know.&lt;br /&gt;
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RETRIEVE CACHE WITHOUT ANSWER.&lt;br /&gt;
The container does require a some amount of force to open as long
as you have the correct answer. Once you enter the answer pull
firmly on both ends to open the container. If the container is
still too difficult to open please let me know and I will conduct
some maintenance to make it easier to open.&lt;br /&gt;

****What is the name of the person that coined the term

I was half way to Smithfield, when I noticed that my Leatherman utility tool was missing. Knew right where I left it. Turned around to head back to Oak Grove to look for it. There it was.

I actually spotted this a couple of weeks ago and waited until today to have my 10-yr son discover before opening.

When he went to open cache, we found that the can was unlatched and full of water.  Unfortunately, the ziploc bag holding the logbook was also full of water.  We drained bag and container, leaving a new HotWheels car and my son choosing a rubber snake - to scare his mother...

Fun start to a new hobby!  Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

Please bring your own pen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your adventure begins by parking the car. Look for Mark Carey's Chesapeake's Red Barn. Then look for the Orb of Parking (may be restricted on Sunday).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hike now starts with your passage through the Family of Trees. Many cachers abandon the cache at this point. Like the song of the siren, many stop and picnic and forget the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next is the Sunray Canyon. It is a sight to behold. Use care crossing this vast expanse. There is a way around this if you don't mind the detour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next is the Fence with No Gate. If ones mind is pure and without any doubt or fear, you may pass through the Fence with No Gate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next you will see the the Tracks to Nowhere. Look both ways before crossing. This is, after all, the future site of high speed rail. You must follow the tracks to the cache. This is not for the timid or faint of heart. Muster your strength for the final push to the cache. Machete and chainsaw optional.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you find it, give yourself a pat on the back. You made it! Take a minute and think about your adventure. I'm sure you will agree this cache is for the birds! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. All teamalara caches allow spoiler photos, phone a friend, calling the CO, posting alternative coordinates and any other clues posted here to finding the cache. This cache is designed to be found. Do not hesitate to post a DNF if you can't find the cache. A DNF is a red flag on this cache indicating cache maintenance is required.&lt;br/&gt; 2. All teamalara cache coordinates are accurate within 6 feet. teamalara will never deliberately dither or post inaccurate coordinates. If you find the coordinates incorrect, please post corrected coordinates. After a sufficient number of corrective coordinates are obtained, we will correct the coordinates.&lt;br/&gt; 3. All teamalara caches are open to the public as private caches are contrary to our mission beliefs for geocaching.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK389TQ - GC389TQ Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 36° 46.813 W 076° 24.649&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TH389TQ - Entrance&lt;br/&gt;N 36° 46.858 W 076° 24.530</groundspeak:long_description>

I had never heard of the place until a couple of wrong turns while driving.  Cradock was one of the nation's first planned communities, built for the ship welders and growing industry in the area at the time.  You can learn more about it here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.historiccradock.org/index.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original plot design of Cradock was an Anchor with plots and the town center based on the outline of the Anchor.  It's a wonderful honor to currently live in a neighborhood built to support both the Navy and the growing industry of a Young America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This geocache is literally (and figuratively) at the bottom of the Anchor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This is a Nano cache, and is carefully placed.  Please be sure to place the Nano EXACTLY where it was found, as this &quot;Anchor&quot; can often be neglected and subject to the ill's of the environment.  You are looking for a tiny black bullet Nano Cache with Log. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Coordinates will take you to the &quot;bottom&quot; of the Anchor.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I gave this cache a slightly higher difficulty rating due to traffic and the fact it's a tiny black Nano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF to  Nealio302 !!!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Seriously, look at the bottom of the Anchor... And maybe the back left of it.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

An easy, drive-by cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I normally would never place a cache in a graveyard, but this story must be told.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A while back, I heard stories of construction workers digging up a tombstone with a back-hoe. They had found an abandon family graveyard. After contacting the city officials, they received permission to relocate the graves. They searched and found more stones, but alas no graves. The contractor did the best he could and relocated the stones to where they are now. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were &quot;stories&quot; and &quot;unconfirmed reports&quot; of strange lights at night in the field near the hardware store. http://members.cox.net/teamalara/Ok.htm They have all been written off as common everyday things like Swamp Gas, UFO's and even Geocachers. None were ever proven or confirmed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I do know that after August of 2007, all the strange reports abruptly stopped. I think I know why. http://members.cox.net/teamalara/Civil%20War%20soldier%20gets%20final%20farewell%20in%20Chesapeake.htm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;William James Lassiter was given final military honors. He was a farmer and a soldier. He was called an ordinary and an extraordinary man. May he and his family rest in peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now on to the cache. It is not...  repeat... not located on or near the tombstones. Please show proper respect and don't be poking around the graves. The cache is not there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are seeking a 3&quot; diameter magnetic Altoids container. It's about 12-15 feet away from the graves. You won't even have to leave the street to grab it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please take a minute and take in the sights. It wouldn't hurt to bring a few flowers too. Remember wars fought so long ago. Times when it was important to fight for GOD, Country, Family and Honor. Thank you, Mr. Lassiter, Farewell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTICE: Although my legal team has advised me this may be a cemetery under Virginia law, I disagree. It looks like a strip mall to me now. However, if you are stopped by the cops after dark here, don't blame me. Use your own discretion.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You get no additional description. Please replace this cache
EXACTLY as you find it or it may not survive. Much stealth will be
required to retrieve it and put it back. I would suggest taking it
to your vehicle to do the logging and then use stealth and cunning
to return it without drawing attention. The container is magnetic,
and contains a log sheet and pencil. Again, be SNEAKY. Thanks.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; T.C.Walker was a prominent figure in our region serving on a
presidential panel for Negro affairs, founded the Bethel Baptist
Church, and serving as the counties first black attorney are just a
few of major known accomplishments. The cache is a small lock on

&lt;p&gt;This Virtual  is
     located in York River State Park,
     located 11 miles west of Williamsburg. From I-64, take the
     Croaker Exit 231B. Go north on Route 607 (Croaker Rd.) for one
     mile, then right on Route 606 (Riverview Rd.) about one and a
     half miles to the park entrance. Take a left turn into the
     park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;York River State Park offers visitors an opportunity
      to experience the environment of a coastal estuary. This park
      is known for its rare and delicate environment, where
      freshwater and saltwater meet to create a habitat rich in
      marine and plant life. The main focus of the park is to
      preserve a portion of York River frontage and its related
      marshes while providing an area for passive day-use
      recreation for visitors. York River State Park served as a
      role model for all of Virginia’s state parks in developing
      resource management plans. The park’s natural resources make
      it a significant place for environmental education at all
      levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posted coordinates lead you to the trailhead
      entrance to Fossil Beach, which can be reached via the
      Mattaponi trail. At Fossil Beach you may find many examples
      of ancient fossils, from whale and dolphin bones and shark's
      teeth to shells of gastropods and mollusks, and even Corals
      and Bryozoas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of years ago this area was covered by a shallow
sea. As the sea receded, many rivers and streams were left to drain
the land, cutting in the layers of sediment that once made up the
sea bottom, exposing the many fossils of the ancient sea life that
once were in abundance here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone that wishes to keep fossils must obtain a permit
from the park staff. DO NOT DIG IN OR DISTURB THE CLIFFS. Only
collect from the shoreline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TO LOG THIS CACHE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Fill in the blank: An ancient shallow sea, which
existed 10 million years ago, extended from here to where

This is at my home, you can park on the side of Pleasantview drive near ark road or park in my driveway if you want to alert me or my family to your visit.Trackables dropped here will be sucked into a wormhole weekly and sent to connecting cache in Northern Minnesota.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Stargates were created by the earliest inhabitants of the universe, the Ancients, as a means of near-instantaneous interstellar travel. These marvelous devices are located on countless worlds scattered throughout our galaxy. Each stargate is a massive circular structure with a rotating inner ring on which are inscribed 39 symbols (glyphs) that correspond to various star constellations. The outer ring has nine chevrons. When the correct combinations of glyphs on the inner ring make contact with seven of the chevrons on the outer ring, a wormhole is activated connecting the “dialing” stargate with the destination stargate.&lt;br /&gt;
Your mission is to decipher the coordinates from the dialing stargate, input-ed By TheGrabber to determine the location of the wormhole on this end. These coordinates were entered from GC3N95 in Pleasant Valley, Minnesota. The uniqueness of these stargates is that by using only 7 of the chevrons, you can dial up locations here in the same world. The calculations are special also in that they will only transport small items like Travle bugs, Geocoins, etc. If you leave a Trackable item in the cache, it will get sucked in and sent to the original site in Minnesota Cache #GC3N95(Stargate PVSI). inclueded are the screen shots of the Dialing Stargate, use the translation dial to determine the correct 7 digit Coordinate for Lat and Long.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in the
town of Ewell on an island in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay.
Here you will find the best crab cakes, soft shell crab and a local
specialty, homemade 10 layer cake! Walk the quiet streets and see a
bit of Bay history. The island is dotted with old homes, a church,
museum and a few places to get a meal and ice cream too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a pen, camera and
insect repellent.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Growing up, my dad regaled me with the tales of the baseball heroes of his youth in the 1950s.  It seemed a simpler time to me, with simpler heroes.  Sometimes, when I think that life is too complex, I just head out to the ballpark to hear the crack of the bat and see the puff of dirt as a fastball hits the catcher's glove. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Begin at the initial coordinates, which give you the right place to receive the accolades of your teammates after hitting the game winning home run.  Use the word problem below to figure out your next move:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start with the number of Career wins by Cy Young&lt;br/&gt;Then subtract Wade Boggs position in the batting order for World Series Game 6 in 1986 &lt;br/&gt;Then divide that result by Numerical Month of Reggie Jackson's Nickname &lt;br/&gt;Multiply that result by the number of letters in the last name of the pitcher with the most career no hitters &lt;br/&gt;And finally add the retired jersey numbers from Yogi Berra, Phil Rizutto, Joe DiMaggio, Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The answer will give you the compass bearing on which to start your search.  Walk along that line of bearing until it becomes cumbersome to continue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you could answer all of the above questions from memory without looking any up, make sure to let us know in your comments.  Happy Searching.</groundspeak:long_description>

this so please handle with care.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the eighty sixth cache in the Chuck Co. (Charles County) NYTPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Guidelines to follow for this series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.       You cannot park on the side of the road. This is a hiking / biking trail only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.       Please park @ Please park @ N 38° 33.500 W 076° 59.000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b.      This is the parking lot for Food Lion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c.       While there may be closer “parking” for some of these caches in residential areas, please do not park there, that would be considered trespassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.       Replace all caches the way you found them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.       Stealth is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.       Not all caches are the same. Some are easy and some are hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.       Bring tweezers, a screwdriver, a pen and dry clothes/shoes (you might get wet on a cache or two)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a.       If a special item is needed for a cache, it will be added in the attributes for that cache!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.       If you are caching in a group, please use a group name for the day as to not fill up the logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7.       Please cross the road at the cross walks for safety reasons. When we placed all the caches, we used the cross walks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.       Do not feel obligated to post a special log for each cache. We will not be offended if you cut and paste one huge write up and post it for every cache if you choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9.       And most importantly be safe, have fun, and practice responsible caching! Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is cache eigthy ninth in the Chuck Co. (Charles County) NYTPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To log this cache, you must first complete an All-Star day. What is an All Star day you ask? An All Star day is a single calendar day (12:00 AM to 11:59 PM) in which you find a combination of caches with all nine “star” rating values (1.0/1.5/2.0/2.5/3.0/3.5/4.0/4.5/5.0). The “star” ratings can be either the difficulty or the terrain or a mix of the two. A single cache can be counted for 2 of the star ratings. As an example, a cache rated as a 1.5/2.0, can count for the 1.5 and the 2.0. So, the challenge can be completed with as few as 5 caches or as many as 9 caches.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have completed the challenge, you can find and log the cache online. On your online log, please include the date of the day you completed the challenge requirements and a list of the caches and star ratings that the caches represent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are a few rules for completing the challenge;&lt;br /&gt;
• All qualifying caches must be found and logged on a single calendar day&lt;br /&gt;
• Any cache type can be used.&lt;br /&gt;
• There is no date limitation on when the All Star day occurs.&lt;br /&gt;
• You cannot count this Challenge cache as part of the All Star day.&lt;br /&gt;
(We got this idea from this cache out in Kentucky &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=fae515f4-1341-4777-834c-b7e1386a87b5&quot;&gt;SherpaRon's All-Star Day Challenge&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of caches that we did on our way to GWX:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our List of caches found on 5/24/2012&lt;br /&gt;
Echol's X - GC229Z2 - &lt;b&gt;1/&lt;/b&gt;1.5&lt;br /&gt;
The Power Of Ten - GC2G1YK - 1&lt;strong&gt;/1.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Walking Dead End - GC3WTQ &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;/2&lt;br /&gt;
Outside The Box - GC339A9 -&lt;strong&gt;2.5&lt;/strong&gt;/1&lt;br /&gt;
JM and You - GC10KA9 - &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;/2&lt;br /&gt;

Wernher von Braun Memorial Cache - GC2W026 - &lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;/3.5&lt;br /&gt;
Gio Would Stalk Tin - GC3HXAA - &lt;strong&gt;4.5&lt;/strong&gt;/2&lt;br /&gt;
Bridge Over Lighted Water at JMU Staduim Parking - GC1DFH3 - &lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;/1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the ninety second cache in the Chuck Co. (Charles County) NYTPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidelines to follow for this series:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the parking lot for Food Lion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there may be closer “parking” for some of these caches in residential areas, please do not park there, that would be considered trespassing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Bring tweezers, a screwdriver, a pen and dry clothes/shoes (you might get wet on a cache or two). If a special item is needed for a cache, it will be added in the attributes for that cache!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. If you are caching in a group, please use a group name for the day as to not fill up the logs.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The little Zombies and I have really enjoyed the last year of
caching and wanted to start thanking our caching friends. This one
the little Zombies dreamed up in their evil little minds. They
wanted to thank CoupleOCachers and DBZDude!

&lt;p&gt;6. If you are caching in a group, please use a group name for the day as to not fill up the logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7. Please cross the road at the cross walks for safety reasons. When we placed all the caches, we used the cross walks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8. Do not feel obligated to post a special log for each cache. We will not be offended if you cut and paste one huge write up and post it for every cache if you choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9. And most importantly be safe, have fun, and practice responsible caching! Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the 17th cache in the Chuck Co. (Charles County) NYTPT&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Guidelines to follow for this series:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;1. You cannot park on the side of the road. This is a hiking / biking trail only&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Please park @ N 38° 37.197 W 076° 56.188&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the parking lot for Food Lion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there may be closer “parking” for some of these caches in residential areas, please do not park there, that would be considered trespassing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Replace all caches the way you found them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Stealth is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Not all caches are the same. Some are easy and some are hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Bring tweezers, a screwdriver, a pen and dry clothes/shoes (you might get wet on a cache or two). If a special item is needed for a cache, it will be added in the attributes for that cache!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. If you are caching in a group, please use a group name for the day as to not fill up the logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7. Please cross the road at the cross walks for safety reasons. When we placed all the caches, we used the cross walks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8. Do not feel obligated to post a special log for each cache. We will not be offended if you cut and paste one huge write up and post it for every cache if you choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9. And most importantly be safe, have fun, and practice responsible caching! Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guidelines to follow for this series:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;1. You cannot park on the side of the road. This is a hiking / biking trail only&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Not all caches are the same. Some are easy and some are hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. If you are caching in a group, please use a group name for the day as to not fill up the logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the 51st cache in the Chuck Co. (Charles County) NYTPT&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Guidelines to follow for this series:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;1. You cannot park on the side of the road. This is a hiking / biking trail only&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Please park @ N 38° 37.197 W 076° 56.188&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the parking lot for Food Lion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there may be closer “parking” for some of these caches in residential areas, please do not park there, that would be considered trespassing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Replace all caches the way you found them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Stealth is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Not all caches are the same. Some are easy and some are hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Bring tweezers, a screwdriver, a pen and dry clothes/shoes (you might get wet on a cache or two). If a special item is needed for a cache, it will be added in the attributes for that cache!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. If you are caching in a group, please use a group name for the day as to not fill up the logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7. Please cross the road at the cross walks for safety reasons. When we placed all the caches, we used the cross walks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8. Do not feel obligated to post a special log for each cache. We will not be offended if you cut and paste one huge write up and post it for every cache if you choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9. And most importantly be safe, have fun, and practice responsible caching! Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

Papa Zombie is the infamous leader of this strange horde. He is often seen on the trails, at events and on message boards spreading the disease. Proceed with caution when dealing with him.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Papa Zombie thinks he is in charge of their small portion of the horde, but in reality Mama rules the roost. They will often be seen with their little zombies and other members of the horde. Please Replace Cache has found or better.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This is the 57th cache in the Chuck Co. (Charles County) NYTPT&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Guidelines to follow for this series:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;1. You cannot park on the side of the road. This is a hiking / biking trail only&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Please park @ N 38° 37.197 W 076° 56.188&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the parking lot for Food Lion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there may be closer “parking” for some of these caches in residential areas, please do not park there, that would be considered trespassing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Replace all caches the way you found them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Stealth is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Not all caches are the same. Some are easy and some are hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Bring tweezers, a screwdriver, a pen and dry clothes/shoes (you might get wet on a cache or two). If a special item is needed for a cache, it will be added in the attributes for that cache!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. If you are caching in a group, please use a group name for the day as to not fill up the logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7. Please cross the road at the cross walks for safety reasons. When we placed all the caches, we used the cross walks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8. Do not feel obligated to post a special log for each cache. We will not be offended if you cut and paste one huge write up and post it for every cache if you choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9. And most importantly be safe, have fun, and practice responsible caching! Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

Depending on the number of visits it receives I may place more. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That aside, this cache is also part of a larger puzzle that is found on geocaching.com. While this cache (which is listed here exclusively) can be found independently of that cache, finding the final cache, Charity, will also require finding the first cache in the series, Faith (posted elsewhere). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding Hope will require a gentle walk through the wooded portion of the park which sits at the intersection of Bayard and Sands Roads. The cache itself is well hidden with natural camouflage . Please take care when retrieving and replacing the cache when visiting. Thank you and good luck! </groundspeak:long_description>

Lots of bounce and several different GZ's, and loads of trash in the area didn't really help out. To be honest, I felt a bit uncomfortable here, like someone was watching me, then as I got to the parking area enroute to the other side of the park for the other caches, there was a very unsavory type soul in the parking area. Needless to say, I didn't feel comfortable leaving the car in the parking area while searching for the others, so instead I headed up the road to work on the WLT caches. Thanks for the hunt though! Perhaps during winter this one may be easier.</groundspeak:text>

This was my first stop and I spent about 45-60 minutes searching the wrong area. I'd somehow failed to get the two OX caches loaded to my GPS and had to hand enter them. I had my self 0.3 minutes north of GZ. I left to find Faith and then returned, thinking I had a better idea of what to look for. After speaking to NetworkCacher, who'd returned my PAF text from my first visit, I rechecked my coords and noticed that I'd mistyped them. Some days, I feel like a noob!

Great camo. Even after speaking to NW, who basically confirmed my thinking, and getting to the correct area for GZ, it took me a little bit to find this.

Picked up trackable turtle and signed the log.

Thanks and Happy Trails!</groundspeak:text>

After I parked I checked the OX iphone app to see if any new logs had popped up.  Nope. So took the short, cold walk to GZ with a little more motivation.   As I approached GZ I got a little nervous this might be a tough hunt.  It did take a little while longer, but I had to smile when I finally found it and admired the owner's craftsmanship.  I grabbed the extra info, left a trackable turtle and carefully rehid the cache for the next finder.  This was a fun cache and I'm glad to see a good new one posted on OX.

*funny glitch today, this is actually the third attempt to log this cache.  The first from the iphone app failed, then I manged to delete the log online with an errant keystroke.</groundspeak:text>

Much like the first, this was an idea that I have been kicking around for some time but hadn't found a way to implement it in an actual hide until now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically, the concept is simple. Go to ground zero and find the cache. However, the terrain (heavily influenced by the time of year) will be the greatest challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The park sits at the western intersection of Bayard and Sands Roads but there is little more to it than the parking area and the two basketball courts nearby. The true beauty of this park, however, is in the grasslands that lie to the west of the parking area. A walk through the faint deer trails over the wild grasslands can feel oddly isolating but relaxing and remarkably scenic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those willing to go the proverbial 'extra mile,' there's also more here than meets the eye...</groundspeak:long_description>

After finding Hope and Faith and therefore having the necessary coords for finding Charity, my good friend and I did not want to leave the park without finding ALL of the caches hidden in the park.  Therefore we made our way to this cache before heading to Charity.

As we hiked across the field, we made guesses as to what the hint for this cache meant.  My friend pretty much nailed it .... When we got to GZ, using spot-on coords (my GPSr was reading 0.4' to the cache right at the cache) we (not me, but my friend) were able to come up with the find pretty quickly.  A very awesome hide; very nicely done!

This was our third find in the park today.  I really hope to see more hides in the park; it was an awesome place to cache.  Thanks for bringing me here!</groundspeak:text>

I got very lucky on this one, which could easily have kept me out here for hours of searching.  I walked over from Faith, taking the two-track that rings the field.  I was also trying to avoid some ATVers, roaring around the field.  Came up the hill to GZ, which wasn't too bad.  I would never give this one a try during the growing season.  As it was, my heavy jeans and gaiters withstood the stickers and snags well.

I started with a systematic search once I got close.  That went on for many minutes until I got a bright idea and went back to check the description.  Oh, look at the coords...that's evil!  Change of tactics.  Managed to find a spot where I zeroed out and the coords were dead on.  Then I started carefully spiraling out.  In about five minutes I had the container in hand!  Man were those coordinates accurate, it was less than two feet away!  I left a signature and tried to tuck it back just how I found it.  Thanks for the fun!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">An easy cache in Valley Mill Park, which is within Paint Branch Park. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were caches hidden in Pilgrim Hills park across the street from Valley Mills and also a lot if you cross Fairland Road, at the end of the Valley Mill walk. But, there were no caches hidden in the actual Valley Mills park where we walk our dog a lot, so I knew I had to place one. Valley Mills is a very nice park. There is a little pond (some geese and ducks live there), swings, playground, fields, basketball court, and more, all along the walking path. It is not too long of a walk, but a nice one. The cache is hidden more towards the front of the park. The cache is a Sterilite box, which can hold small trade items, and small trackables. It is not a hard find at all. I call this the Friends Cache because we call this park the Friends Park. We know almost every person (and dog) that walks on that path. So, I hid this cache in honor of all our friends at Valley Mills park. The cache is near the pond, so stop off and see the geese and duck families after you find the cache. The cache is filled with keychains. I do not know why, but I filled it with keychains. If you can, take a keychain and leave one. The FTF prize is a wristband, treasure the words on it. Or you can just take a keychain if you don't want the wristband. Happy Hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;This cache is not at the
above location&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But it's a great place to park and the start of the Wherigo
Cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;
This cartridge &lt;b&gt;can not&lt;/b&gt; be played on an emulator.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To find this cache, you will need to find your way through an
invisible maze using&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wherigo.com/cartridge/details.aspx?CGUID=207f06ab-06c7-4685-bb93-e90cc7aacb50&quot;&gt;
The Maryland Minotaur's Maze Wherigo Cartridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find your way through, and the defeated Minotaur will reveal the
cache location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The verification code written inside the container is needed to finish the Wherigo Cartridge and obtain the Wherigo Completion Code.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wherigo.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wherigo.com/cartridge/download.aspx?CGUID=207f06ab-06c7-4685-bb93-e90cc7aacb50&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This Wherigo Cache is located entirely within Kinder Farm Park,
and is placed with permission. The Maze completely covers two
entire fields of the several located at the Harvey Garcelon Sports
Complex. There is no park fee for visiting this section of the
park, and it is open from 7:00 a.m. to dusk but is closed on
Tuesdays, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. The sports portion of
the park is often open outside of normal park days and hours though
so don't be afraid to check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sports activities take priority&lt;/b&gt;, so if there is a game or
other scheduled activity on these particular fields, you'll need to
wait it out. Coordinates for the fields are listed as a waypoint so
that you can be sure they are available before you begin the
cartridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maze is a 9x9 matrix of approximately 50' square cells. The
NW cell is labeled 11 and the SE cell is labeled 99. I suggest
printing out the blank grid and mapping the maze while you work
your way through it. Once you enter the maze, the only way out is
to successfully find the exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first enter the maze, you will
be in cell 99. It's graphic,attached to this listing, will be displayed.
From cell 99, you can travel North to cell 89 or West to cell 98.
You cannot exit the maze to the East, where you entered, nor can
you go South. The Eastern wall of cell 99 is dashed since it is a
door into the maze, but not an exit. To exit the maze, look for the
cell that has a green door and travel through it. As you enter a
cell, its graphic will be displayed. Only the cell you are in and
cells that you can travel to will be displayed, so for example,
from cell 99, cells 89, 98, and 99 will be available. After you
exit the maze, you will be able to travel to the cache. When you
are near the cache, the cartridge will place the geocache in your
inventory. Open the geocache in your inventory to enter the code
number you find inside the real cache container. The cartridge will
be marked complete and saved after entering the correct code.
Please be sure to unlock and log playing the cartridge on
Wherigo.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to my brother &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=9cd457bd-c612-4fe5-b693-a730f1a4c43c&quot;&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is not at the listed coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire ants compete successfully against other ants, and have been enlarging their range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have ever lived in the Southeast or Southwest, you are well versed in living with fire ants. They believe that colonies were accidentally introduced into the United States from cargo ships bringing goods from Brazil that were infested with this pesky species. Growing up we were always told that they riding on a banana boat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since their introduction they have spread to almost every state of the American South, from Texas to Maryland. Since the 1990s infestations have been reported in New Mexico in the Southwest. They have also been reported in California in the West, but probably arrived via ship or truck rather than by spreading. They were still on the move in the US in the early 21st century, often traveling from one area to another in turf, root balls of nursery plants, and other agricultural products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire ants are more aggressive than most native ant species, and have a painful sting. An animal, including humans, typically encounters them by inadvertently stepping into one of their mounds, which causes the ants to swarm up the legs, attacking en masse. The ants respond to pheromones released by the first ant to attack and sting in concert, often killing smaller animals by overloading their immune systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire ants are extremely resilient, and have adapted to contend with both flooding and drought conditions. If the ants sense increased water levels in their nests, they will come together and form a huge ball or raft that is able to float, with the workers on the outside and the queen inside. Once the ball hits a tree or other stationary object, the ants swarm onto it and wait for the water levels to recede. To contend with drought conditions, their nest structure includes a network of underground foraging tunnels that extends down to the water table. Also, although they do not hibernate during the winter, colonies can survive temperatures as low as 16 °F (−9 °C).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They could be controlled, but not eradicated. A number of products are available, which can be used on a mound-by-mound basis to destroy ant colonies when they appear. With all such efforts, it is important to reach and kill the queens, which may be as far as six feet (2 m) underground; otherwise, some queens may simply move a short distance away and quickly re-establish the colony. However, during the past few years, even this technique resulted in failure to control colony growth. Scientists then discovered that an adaptation in RIFAs had resulted in many populations having multiple queens in mounds over a large area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A big thanks goes out to Czar7 for the container, and inspiration for the puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 09.FGH W 076° 44.JKL&lt;br/&gt;A.

Something seems to be wrong with this cache. Either the coordinates are off or the cache size is incorrect. The cache is definately not handicapped accessible. Google maps and my GPSr put the cache in the woods. I do not know how I could miss a cache of regular size. The area is covered with poison ivy, so that didn't help. I tip-toed my way through it for an hour, but could not find it.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the first half of the twentieth century, this area was the site of the Bay Shore Amusement Park. In its heyday it offered recreation and relaxation on the Chesapeake Bay in a setting of gardens, pathways, and Edwardian architecture. The park included a dance hall, a bowling alley, a restaurant, Trolley Station, Carousel, and a pier jutting out into the bay on which the cache is placed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a modest entrance fee to the park. Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/central/northpoint.asp&quot;&gt;DNR website&lt;/a&gt; for current fees and park rules.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I have always been fascinated with bases other than 10 when it
comes to numbers. This might be the reason I ended up as a computer
programmer. We are always using bases like binary (base 2), Hex
(base 16) or Oct (base 8). But there are bases for just about every
number.
&lt;p&gt;For instance...if you use base 6, then then you will only have
numbers up to 5...the number 6 is then represented as 10. Once you
get above base 10 (decimal), then you start using letters. In hex
(base 16) you represent the numbers 10-15 as the letters A, B, C,
D, E, F. So the number 15 is represented as F and the number 16 is
represented as 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a base, other than 10, to disguise the coordinates for
the cache and the result is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only used one base for all of the conversions. To be
clear...if the North coordinates are represented as N DD MM.NNN I
converted DD as one number, MM as one number and NNN as one number.
Then I did the same with the other set of coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final is located here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;N 43 14.117


W 084 44.183&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before you head off to a field in the middle of
Michigan...please use the coordinate checker below to verify you
have the correct location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final is only a short - but possibly difficult - walk from
the listed coordinates. Please be mindful of the white tipped posts
and do not cross the property line. The final is located near the
line but not over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any logs that post the base, in any form, will be deleted.
Sorry...it should be fun for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty rating takes into consideration the puzzle and
the final hide, which is not overly easy in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please return the container to the same spot you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to sfcchaz for FTF honors
and his 100th FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>You can drive to the listed coordinates for this cache and you will find a binary number listed there.  Convert the binary number to a decimal (base 10).  Now convert 1000 to decimal and subtract it from the first number and that will be the base you need to convert the coordinates.  You can see this binary number from your car (think yellow).  This is also a reasonable place to park for the final.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache sits aside the Black Marsh Trail in North Point State Park just west of the marsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the designated parking, you will eventually find 2 trails that parallel one another. One trail has nice gravel paving (it is the old trolley rail bed), and the other is a more natural dirt path. I suggest you &lt;b&gt;stick to the dirt trail&lt;/b&gt; as it makes for much easier access to the cache. If you want to keep going after you find the cache, the two trails merge just a bit farther along at the edge of the marsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is in a designated wildlands area of the park, so please use your &quot;leave no trace&quot; skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, the gravel trail was part of the rail bed for the Bay Shore Shuttle trolley that carried many a pleasure seeker from the city out to the Bay Shore Amusement Park, which operated in the first half of the 20th century on the shore south of here.&lt;/p&gt;
There is a modest entrance fee to the park. Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/central/northpoint.asp&quot;&gt;DNR website&lt;/a&gt; for current fees and park rules.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;It is easy to get close to this cache, but the final 30-50 feet
will require a small hill climb, bushwhacking (thick in the
summer), lots of thorns (even in winter) and a reach up. I am 6'1&quot;
and I needed to reach to place this one. It can be seen, from the
correct angle, from ground level. There is an assist at GZ so that
the reach is possible for some one shorter, but you have been
warned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please do not pull this down if you can not replace
it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache was placed a few days before the Ravens are to play
the Colts in the AFC Divisional Playoffs in the 2009/10 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hurts that we have not beaten them...especailly when it comes
to big games. So I am placing this cache in the hopes that it will
change that luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I hope this cache brings them luck, any time I have put or
taken Ravens items in a cache, they have lost the next weekend. So
beyond the description, there are no other Ravens refrences in the
cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Container is a round plastic tube that, in a former life, held 5
small tubs of crystal lite. It is covered in camo tape. There is a
pen, but don't count on it working...especially in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is snow cover, you should not attempt this cache.
First, it will make it almost impossible to attempt to reach it.
Second, your trail will lead muggles right to it...and we would not
want that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No hints on this one unless I see there are too many issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to redleg7 on the quick FTF!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and happy caching!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This was our second find, though we had about as much trouble navigating our way from &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot; than in finding the cache. However, I was just following and didn't know for sure which cache we were headed for.

I'd found CC2 back in February and had DNF'd this one on 2 separate visits that same day.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Welcome to Fox Rock
Quarry!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is believed to be the oldest of several large ledge
quarries in the Woodstock/Granite area. In the late 1800's to early
1900's the quarry operations here were perhaps the biggest economic
driver in the state. Be sure and spend some time enjoying this
area, and the entire Granite Historical District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a companion cache to Earthcache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC2Q4RT&quot;&gt;GC2Q4RT Woodstock
Granite&lt;/a&gt;, located in downtown Baltimore, which explores the
dimensional stone quarried at this location in the context of a
building constructed from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mid 1800's, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington,
D.C. sent Dr. David Owen on an inspection tour of building material
sources. On arriving here he reported: &quot;For about a mile square at
this locality is an outburst of quartzose, granite of magnificent
quality, both as regards beauty of appearance, compactness of
structure and uniformity of color, texture and composition. I have
never seen anything superior in this country. Indeed, I doubt
whether it can be excelled in any country. It cannot be surpassed
for strength and durability by any building material in the
world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fox Rock Quarry was opened in 1836 on land then owned by
Nicholas Owings. A couple of stone cutters from Baltimore named
John Emery and Cyrus Gault leased the quarry for a term of 6 years,
beginning on November 10th, 1840. To pay the lease, they agreed to
quarry at minimum 40,000 cubic feet of stone each year and pay 1.25
cents per cubic foot. The principal early demand was from the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad for stone stringers, dressed to
correspond to the flange and tread of the car wheels. Early in the
lease Nicholas Owings died and the land was passed to his son. Many
legal issues evolved from the death and debts owed. In the end
Emery and Gault worked the quarry for about 10 years and built a
railroad from the quarry, acrocss the Patapsco, and connected to
the B&amp;O's Old Main Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Emery and Gault abandoned their activity, the quarry sat
idle for several years and the railroad spur and bridge
deteriorated, never to be repaired. In 1866 the land was part of a
purchase by the Jesuits as the site for a seminary named Woodstock
College. The main building was constructed entirely of stone from
Fox Rock and opened in 1869. The campus buildings still exist less
than a mile southwest of here and are now used as a Job Corps
training center. The College then sold the quarry location outright
and it passed through several hands including William and Matthew
Gault who formed the Woodstock Granite Company. The quarry operated
under various owners through the 1920's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach the
cache:&lt;br /&gt;
I recommend entering the park just south of the former Nike Missile
Base Complex BA-79C at the trailhead coordinates. DO NOT ENTER THE
MISSILE COMPLEX. Proceed west following the fence on your right
until you can turn to the north (you will see an old military no
trespassing sign here that no longer applies) and continue to
follow the fence until you are forced to turn west again. Follow
the trail west toward GZ. If you'd rather not bushwhack, then
simply resist the temptation to leave the trail.&lt;br /&gt;
I can't remember what I put in there for a FTF prize but it is
something unactivated and trackable.&lt;/p&gt;

It was at night &amp; raining, but I had my headlights on it &amp; I had a flashlight.  I dug leaves out of all the spaces between the cinder blocks/bricks, but I couldn't find it.  The picture on this site -- when I zoom all the way in -- makes it look like it's across the street, around the back of that group of buildings.  I'll go back and look, but it doesn't seem to match my GPS or the hint (maybe I'll see it matches the hint better when I go back).  I'll also recheck in the daylight where I thought it should have been.For those reasons, I'm checking it needs attention (do you know if it's still actually there?  If it's supposed to be so obvious maybe someone picked it up -- it was planted a year ago.), and ratings reflect my experience with looking.  The terrain is obviously easy (wheelchair accessible, I'd say), and since I didn't find it, I can't rate the object itself.

Oct. 16:  Went back &amp; looked across the street - still couldn't find it -- not obvious, and spent a lot of time looking all over, even un-obvious places.  Also could not find Lunchtime #2, and I checked the guardrail thoroughly at EVERY light pole.  These searches were my first geocaching experiences, and I'm giving up on this particular series.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As some of you know, I am an amateur astronomer. About 15 years ago
I was introduced to a rather quirky fellow at a monthly meeting of
my astronomy club.
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few years we would meet occasionally to observe
and talk about astronomy. During those discussions, I noticed that
he had some strange names for some of the well know constellations
and stars. He always understood my names, but would then use his
own to describe the same object. I also noticed that he would
disappear for months on end, and would then pop back up and be
around all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, while attending the Black Forrest Star Party, in PA, he
showed up out of the blue. He told me that we was getting ready to
leave and needed me to write some things down and keep them safe.
At least until he returned. I agreed and he told me one wild story
about aliens and pirates and space ships and all sorts of odd
things. I smiled and figured my friend was out of his mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was done weaving this tale, he had me write down some
coordinates. Not being a geocacher nor, at this time, even owning a
GPS...I really did not know what to make of them. But I wrote them
down along with a few other notes and he seemed satisfied. I put
the paper in some of my observing logs and wished him well on his
journey. He seemed a bit sad as he departed...but as I said...he
was a bit quirky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched as he walked across the observing field and slipped
across the street into the darkness. A few minutes later I saw his
headlights head up the road to the North...towards
Coudersport...and then he was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back to observing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 45 minutes later murmurs started to fill the observing
field. And as everyone watched one of the most spectacular auroras,
that anyone could remember, exploded across the sky. It was visible
as far south as Florida and Texas. The background (and gallery)
image is one I took of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never saw him again...and to be honest...I completely forgot
about the information he gave me until about a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking through some of my old astronomy stuff and found
the notes I had jotted down along with the coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I am deeply involved in Geocaching and I own several
GPSr's, the coordinates held some intrigue for me. Not only
that...the coordinates he had me write down seemed to be at key
points around Liberty reservoir and were close to my home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the other day I found myself wandering around Liberty
reservoir looking for what? I was not sure until I looked up and
there was my answer. A laminated card attached to a tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out...he is not quite as crazy as I might of first
thought. I am also starting to think that his stories might be
true. I just wonder if that aurora was related to him leaving.
Hmmm...still not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The card on the tree was a picture of a constellation with one
star circled. Through a little detective work, I have figured out
that the information represents a number...but right now I am not
sure what this might mean or how I might use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only guess that at the other locations I will find
something similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my fellow geocachers love a good hunt, I decided to bring
you all along for the fun. But since I have the original
information, I get to find these things first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He left me a total of 5 sets of coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I find each site, locate whatever is there, and decipher it,
I will post it as a new cache. Since I am not sure if the original
coordinates have any bearing on this mystery...I am going to move
the caches to a nearby site and conceal it. That way, it should
remain safe, but is close enough that I will remember where the
original was located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coordinates for this cache are within 100 feet of the
coordinates he gave me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I am not sure if you need to find these in order or
not. The names of the caches are his notes that went along with
each set of coordinates (and apparently the clues).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows what we might find at the end of this process...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not going to make you go through the hassle of figuring out
the puzzle he left at each site. I will just include the number
that I worked out in each cache. Make sure you write down the
number...it must be important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sites are spread out around Liberty Lake...so it may be 2
or 3 weeks before I get out to the next site. So keep an eye out
for each one. Hopefully by the end of the summer I will have found
them all and have figured out this mystery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the time and are not too worn out...when you are
done...go back to the fire road and continue until you come to
another road snaking back to your left...very obvious...follow this
and you will come right out at the dam. You will get to see the dam
from the less accessed side. Worth the short hike from the
cache!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy hunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimers:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Do not go after this in the dark. - First parking will be
illegal and second with the terrain at GZ it could be very
dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Be careful as you approach GZ...the area is unsteady and there
are steep climbs and falls.&lt;br /&gt;
3. The terrain is listed as a 4 for a reason...the hike in is long
(about 8/10ths of a mile one way), and the last 200 - 300 feet are
bushwhacking and steep in places, depending on your approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ZigZagMI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For FTF Honors on this one!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK28REX - EH Cacoeg Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 39° 22.550 W 076° 54.244&lt;br /&gt;Parking here is from Dawn to Dusk.   Parking at any other location is at your own risk.   Enough room for 3-4 cars.   Do not park in the driveway next to this access area and do no block the fire road.&lt;br /&gt;RF28REX - EH Cacoeg Dino Head&lt;br /&gt;N 39° 22.616 W 076° 53.633&lt;br /&gt;At this location you will find a rock that both me and my daughter thought looked like a dino head.   Can you see the eye and the nose?

Anyway...this is a good point to leave the fire trail and head towards GZ.

There are other ways to get there...this is just the one that has a good marker and seems to work well.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>1.  Easiest approach has you leaving the fire road trail at the dino head rock (see the way point).
2.  There are a ton of places to look...you are searching for a cammo'd ammo can covered with rocks...this will become a problem once you see the location.
3.  As you approach GZ...look for one of the largest trees a the edge of a rock face (it will be on top), it sits near the end of a medium sized fallen tree.   
4.  Search the small cave (not really a cave...more of a small outcove covered by the rock overhang.

That's about the best I can do.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">woke up at 4 this morning and was looking at new caches in Maryland when I saw this one? 3 days and not found. was on call this morning so figured it would get found. looked again around 10:30 and still not found so thought I would have a drive out. after finally finding the parking area fired up my Oregon to find no geocaches on it. But still had my trusty 60csx so decided to take the hike. found the first way-point with no problem and then on to gz. where the fun started. could not remember what size container I was looking for, and no hint. And there must be a thousand hiding spots around there (watch out for loose rocks). So looked and looked and looked and then there it was. opened it up and to my surprise could claim FTF. Sat and had lunch, and enjoyed the view. will have to come back in the winter when there is not so much foliage and you can see the whole lake. Thanks for hiding this cache really enjoyed the hike and hunt. Left TB</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located on the streetscape in front of the old Baltimore County Courthouse on Washington Avenue. GZ is easy to access on foot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Named in honor of one of our favorite movie characters, and possibly the start of a new series. Keep your eyes peeled.&lt;br/&gt;Sheriffs deputies protect this house of justice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located in the heart of the county seat, this cache is located in a muggle rich but scenic environment. There is no need to walk into the grounds of the courthouse, but the gardens are indeed worth a visit. While you're here, take some time to read the signs and plaques that are scattered in the area, which share some history of the courthouse, county, and honors the heroes of Baltimore County. While most people should have no problem plucking the cache from it's home, some may find it easier to use a stick or tweezers to dislodge the container for retrieval. There is parking-a-plenty, but free parking is very limited, but is much easier to obtain during the early morning and nighttime hours when street parking is free. These hours are also the best time to attempt the find, since the area is prone to very heavy foot traffic during business hours. Please try to put the container back where you found it so others may enjoy the search.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any feedback regarding the coordinates or the cache itself, good or bad, are greatly appreciated.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Well...I did not pay close attention to where this one was. After
hiking into the fourth location, I could have just continued on to
this one.
&lt;p&gt;I checked the maps and figured this one was about equal distant
from the parking at Wards Chapel and parking at S. Lake Dr. So I
decided to come in from S. Lake Dr.. I needed to check on a couple
of caches along the trail and I wanted to go after one that I had
been working on for awhile and finally solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out...this one is much easier coming from Wards
Chapel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My GPS told me that the hike from WC to EH 4 was 1.89 miles. It
also showed that the hike from there to EH 5 was another .5 miles.
My hike last night...which included about a tenth of a mile
diversion for my side trips, told me I hiked in (one way) 3.16
miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went out, I hiked out Oakland Road to Deer Park and
headed back to S. Lake Dr. I can tell you two things about this
hike. First, it is not as bad as I first thought, considering it is
on the road. Second, the closest legal parking is about 1.5 miles
from the cache at Deer Cross Ct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be warned though...you will be walking, most of the time, on
well traveled roads. Use all precautions when trying to do this
hike from that location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you come in on the trails from S. Lake Dr. the topography of
the lake forces you to do a lot of twisting an turning and there
are some pretty steep hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suggestions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want the shortest route...park on Deer Cross Ct. and hike
in on the roads. (about 3 miles round trip)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want the nicest hike...park at Wards Chapel (about 4.5
miles round trip)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are working on any of the puzzle caches out here or you
just want the most challenging hike...park at S. Lake Dr. (about 6
miles round trip)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with the story behind this cache please
visit the first four descriptions in this series called EH Cacoeg - First Right (GC28REX),
EH Cacoeg - Left (GC2B8VG),
EH Cacoeg -Second Right
(GC2BW42), and EH Cacoeg
Not South (GC2CFXT). Because the story is long I will ask you
to read it there...and then continue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Not South, I looked up the coordinates on this one and
figured I could just about drive most of the way there.
Nope...there is a gate right before the fire trail you need to take
and no parking signs everywhere. The closest you can legally park
is out on Deer Cross Ct. It might work if you use a bike or if you
have someone drop you off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING: Do not park on Oakland Road...the
locals do not want cars there...there are no parking signs on the
whole road...and they will call the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go after this one last night after work. I had just
enough time to get out here and back before dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never actually been out on this spur before. I am betting
that, in the winter, there are going to be some spectacular views
of the watershed from here. I also came across about 20 deer on my
way out...so in the fall...it should be loaded with hunters as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular card was back to the normal hide style It was
attached about 10 feet up in a tree. For this one...the tree it was
attached to was a great spot for the cache. So I simply removed the
card and placed the cache near the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puzzle actually took me a few hours and some internet work
to figure out. But I finally got it. The solution is written on the
lid of the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK...from looking at what I have done...here is what I can
surmise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. My friend placed these clues at all of the cardinal points of
the watershed.&lt;br /&gt;
2. I have visited the 3 major tributaries for the watershed along
with the dam itself.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Some of the sites seem to be manufacturing or residential in
nature.&lt;br /&gt;
4. My friend liked to be alone and did not mind walking long
distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The first three clues and the information that went with them
seem to be the combination to a lock.&lt;br /&gt;
2. The second two clues seem to relate to coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
3. I have some information about the last two clues that I have not
told you yet.&lt;br /&gt;
4. My friend gave me some information about the last location
without giving me the actual coordinates. Now that I have
everything...I would not have been able to figure out the final
starting point without everything.&lt;br /&gt;
5. If you have not found all 5, get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on hiking out to the final location in about 2 weeks.
Depending on what I find there...and assuming there are no more
puzzles...I want to publish the final on Saturday - September 18th.
I figure me birthday would be as good a time as any to let you guys
in on the secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you have enjoyed these finds. I also hope you take the
time to go after the final. It should be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the hike or bike ride and good luck with cache. Terrain is
based on the 2 mile hike or long bike ride in...if you get dropped
off...terrain is at most a 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some feedback from Tomulus, I have added a trail head
waypoint below (N 39° 24.350 W 076° 51.696) for parking location 2.
Note that access to this trail head is down what appears to be a
private drive way. The private property actually begins just beyond
this trail head (you will see the markings on the trees) and the
drive way is actually shared right-of-way until that point. Using
this trail head will cut out a small portion of bush whacking that
can be rough in the late summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, please be mindful of all No
Trespassing signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ZigZagMI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For FTF Honors on this one!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;P22CFXW - GC2CFXW Parking 2&lt;br /&gt;N 39° 24.248 W 076° 51.666&lt;br /&gt;Second Parking area...good place if you want to go after 4 and 5 together.&lt;br /&gt;PK2CFXW - GC2CFXW Parking 1&lt;br /&gt;N 39° 26.104 W 076° 53.018&lt;br /&gt;One of two legal parking areas.&lt;br /&gt;TR2CFXW - Easiest Trail Head Entry - For Parking 2&lt;br /&gt;N 39° 24.350 W 076° 51.696&lt;br /&gt;The trail head next to the parking location, while convenient, is not the most direct route to the cache. There is a fire road trail head, on the other side of the bridge, further up what looks like a private driveway next to the parking area. The private property begins just beyond the trail head.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>This should be easy for an experienced cacher.

Just in case though...

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Hmmm...we are getting closer to a solution for this one. I am
getting very intrigued.
&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with the story behind this cache please
visit the first three descriptions in this series called EH Cacoeg - First Right (GC28REX),
EH Cacoeg - Left (GC2B8VG),
and EH Cacoeg -Second Right
(GC2BW42). Because the story is long I will ask you to read it
there...and then continue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well...I looked up the coordinates on this one and figured I
could just about drive right up to it. Nope...there is a gate a
good 1/3 mile from this one and no parking signs everywhere. The
closest you can legally park is out on Deer Park Rd...and that is
one nasty hike in. It might work if you use a bike or if you have
someone drop you off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING #1 - Do not park on Oakland Road...the
locals do not want cars there...there are no parking signs on the
whole road...and they will call the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now...I scoped this out and decided I would go over to Wards
Chapel and park at the fire trail head about 1/2 mile from Rt. 26.
It turns out to be a good fire trail all the way in. It is about a
2 mile hike (one way) to the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did this in the evening (before dark) and it was a great hike.
The hills are not too bad. There are a couple of muddy spots where
small streams cross the trail...but nothing that would suck your
boots off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now...when I got to GZ, I came up on what must have been an old
mill...but not THAT old. It appears to have been abandoned within
the last 30 years or so. The water wheel is actually metal and not
wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING #2 - The building is not stable. Do
not approach the building and certainly do not go in. This building
looks to be home to teenagers on occasion...so be cautious when
approaching the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder...this looks like it might have been usable in the last
few years. Could my friend have been using this pace for something?
Could he have been making something back here. Heck...you could
probably set off fireworks and no one would hear you...so who
knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me awhile to find this one...for two reasons.
First...with the hills and rocks...the GPS was bouncing something
fierce. Secondly...unlike the others...this one was not in a
tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I literally stumbled on it. It was etched neatly into a jet
black rock and then placed near the base of a tree. Had it been
near a trail, I am sure someone would have spotted it. But then
again...it was slightly off from the coordinates he gave me. I
wonder if someone else found it and had no idea what to do with
it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing. There was more than the clue etched into the
rock. There were some other instructions. I am not including them
here...but will post them in the final puzzle cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is getting exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get to this cache from either side of the stream. If you
find yourself on the wrong side...there are many places to cross or
there is a bridge right where it enters the reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING #3: Do not go up the road, past the
mill, from the reservoir. You will notice a tree with a yellow
stripe, almost parallel to the mill...this is where the private
property starts. The locals will call you on it as well. Stay close
to the mill and you should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING # 4: DO NOT GO AFTER THIS ONE IN THE
DARK. THE AREA IS CLOSED FROM DUSK TO DAWN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again...since I don't want the find to be too hard, there is a
picture of the mill and a picture of the actual hiding spot
attached to this listing. Take a look at both before you head
out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please return this exactly the way you found it. And if there
are muggles around....please use stealth or come back another
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the hike or bike ride and good luck with cache. Terrain is
based on the 2 mile hike or long bike ride in...if you get dropped
off...terrain is at most a 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one left and then we find out what the mystery is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some feedback from Tomulus, I have added a trail head
waypoint below (N 39° 24.350 W 076° 51.696). Note that access to
this trail head is down what appears to be a private drive way. The
private property actually begins just beyond this trail head (you
will see the markings on the trees) and the drive way is actually
shared right-of-way until that point. Using this trail head will
cut out a small portion of bush whacking that can be rough in the
late summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, please be mindful of all No
Trespassing signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;C-Finder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For FTF Honors on this one!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;PK2CFXT - EH Cacoeg 4 - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 39° 24.248 W 076° 51.666&lt;br /&gt;Parking that will entail about a 2 mile hike (one way) to the cache...also gives you the opportunity to find the other two caches back here.&lt;br /&gt;TH2CFXT - Easiest Trail Head Entry&lt;br /&gt;N 39° 24.350 W 076° 51.696&lt;br /&gt;The trail head next to the parking location, while convenient, is not the most direct route to the cache.   There is a fire road trail head, on the other side of the bridge, further up what looks like a private driveway next to the parking area.  The private property begins just beyond the trail head.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>1.  Across the stream from the mill.
2.  Cross the stream just down stream from the mill.
3.  Stand on the large rocks with the mill slightly behind and to your left..and face the bank...
4.  Study the attached picture.
5.  This is completely hidden...but it is a big old ammo can.   Should not be too hard!</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;p&gt;When you find this cache, please pay
attention to exactly how it is hidden and replace it EXACTLY the
way you found it. Please make sure the rope used to attach it to
it's hiding spot is well concealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well the story continues and the mystery deepens. If you are not
familiar with the story behind this cache please visit the first in
this series called EH Cacoeg -
First Right (GC28REX). Because the story is long I will ask you
to read it there...and then continue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided I would go after the second location on the morning of
July 4th. I got up early because it was going to be a hot day and
after looking at some maps, I knew this one was going to be a long
walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got to the location, it appears that my friend may have
been living near this area for awhile. I found a fully functional
basketball court, lawn furniture, tiki torches, and recently used
fire pits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the card (again) attached to a tree very close to the
coordinates he gave me. This one took a bit more figuring to coax
out a number...but I did get it. It will be in the cache I
place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to put the cache in the area I found the card...but
since he has been gone for so long and this area looks well (and
recently) used, either he has returned or someone has taken it
over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will note here...be careful when going after this cache. I am
not sure what sorts are using the area and would not want anyone to
get vaporized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't suggest it...but if you must take a look at the
camp...it is on the southern side of the larger stream. The trail
to it snakes off of the fire road to the east about 50 -75 yards
from the stream. The b-ball court is about 60 feet in and the lawn
furniture is near the stream (but down from the crossing). If
someone is playing basketball here...you will know it! (I have
included some pictures of the sites)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to put the cache where the two major streams, feeding
the reservoir from the west come together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am placing this in the summer (when the growth is high). I
will revisit in the late fall to make sure this cache is still well
hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk in is about 7/10ths of a mile from two different
parking spots. Any other approach will take you onto private land
and is against the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there have been heavy rains or the water levels are really
up, the larger stream may be uncrossable. Due to this, and the fact
that approach is a bit easier, I am suggesting that you come in
from the parking area to the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But...if you are trying to get Solitude and/or Got Wood while
out here, then you will want to use the parking area to the
east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will put the coordinates for both as way points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not meant to be a nasty hide...but pick a nice day for a
fairly long (and hilly) hike. There is a small amount of off-trail
right at the cache site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last note...this trail is used extensively by horse back
riders. Be courteous and remember to yield the right of way to them
on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UFF298&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For FTF Honors on this one!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;P22B8VG - G2B8VG Parking - North&lt;br /&gt;N 39° 26.465 W 076° 57.009&lt;br /&gt;This is the Northern Parking location for this cache. 

To travel directly to the cache, choose the fire road that heads off to the right (as you enter the parking) and travels directly along the driveway.&lt;br /&gt;PK2B8VG - GC2B8VG Parking - East&lt;br /&gt;N 39° 26.060 W 076° 56.848&lt;br /&gt;This is the Eastern Parking location for this cache.   Use this parking if you want to go after Solitude and/or Got Wood at the same time.   

Be warned...if the water levels are high, you may not be able to cross the large stream very close to the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>1.  Don't try to come in from the stream.   Get in the area bordered by both streams (by crossing one of them).
2.  Get right to the point.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">WARNING: From September to January this is very
active deer hunting territory. Take all necessary precautions when
entering and searching this area.
&lt;p&gt;Since I could not adopt or transfer the
cache, I had to create a new one. If you have found this one in the
past you may re-log this cache. &lt;b&gt;But - to do so..you MUST sign
the new log in the final AND drop me an e-mail with a description
of the puzzles on all of the new ropes.&lt;/b&gt; New
finders do not need to send me an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Original Cache Description from
NCPositronics:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be prepared for a 6 mile hike along the
western reaches of Liberty Reservoir. The trail rolls over several
hills. Obey all 'No Trespassing' signs. Parking is at N39 26.294,
W076 56.252.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a five-stage multi. At each
stage, you will find the coordinates to the next stage on one or
two ropes, more or less in plain view. The final is a small
tupperware-like container placed out-of-view, but with a rope
dangling within three feet of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best EPE I got while scouting and
hiding this cache was 56 feet (this seems to be par for the course
around Liberty Reservoir), so use the coordinates to get close,
then look for the rope(s) using the hints below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE DO NOT UNTIE ANY KNOTS! (In
fact, some of the knots are reinforced by Gorilla Glue.) Three of
the stages can be taken from their perches for closer examination
(not true anymore), but please do not
alter them, and return them as you found them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow a minimum of three hours to
complete this cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some additional information from
me:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No Gorilla's were harmed during the
making of this cache!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for ropes that will
have clues to the next stage. You will need to decipher the clues
on the ropes to figure this out. Colors play a large role in what
you are deciphering. Don't make it too hard...it's not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don't untie any of the
ropes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please return the ropes exactly as you
found them. There are lots of folks in these woods and these ropes
tend to go missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the hike, the views, and the time
in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Hints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- 1 - There are zeros in the
answers/clues...look out for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- 2 - The last rope has something in it
that the other ropes do not...please be aware of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- 3 - Think accounting (Red -
Black).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- 4 - None of the ropes are in the
water and the hike should make sense as an out and back, 6 mile,
hike with a loop at the far end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- 5 - There are no decimal points
represented on the ropes...so if you see a dot...it does NOT mean a
decimal point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- 6 - On the first rope there is what
appears to be a double ring of red - this is not intentional. It
should be one solid ring..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UFF298&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For FTF Honors on this one!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Stage 1: hanging from limb by two large crossed logs. Stage 2: low, among downed logs.
Stage 3: on stick passing through forked tree.
Stage 4: approximately 1/2 mile from Stage 3, on downhill side of trail, between large twisting vine and trail.  In Summer...the twisted part is largely covered in undergrowth...look for it.
Final: The coordinates here are pretty good and bounce is low.  Get close, use your geosenses, and look for a smaller (well hidden) rope this time!</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;br /&gt;
I figured since I was bringing you out here, I might as well give
you another cache to find.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now...as with The Bunker cache, you do not need to dig or
destroy anything to find this one. It is in plain sight...but may
not be recognized as a cache container. And...while the actual
micro is the same as The Bunker...the container holding the micro
is NOT the same as The Bunker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and enjoy the hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking: N 39° 27.524 W 076° 52.475&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking for this is a little odd. Park in front of or to
the&lt;br /&gt;
right of the sign that allows you to park here. Do not park
in&lt;br /&gt;
front of the gate or anywhere near the No Parking sign. Once in
the&lt;br /&gt;
parking area, to get to the trail...as you face the No Parking
sign&lt;br /&gt;
the trail goes into the woods to your left. Follow it into
the&lt;br /&gt;
woods and then bear to the right and out onto the fire road
going&lt;br /&gt;
down the hill. Checking with DNR at Soldiers Delight, this is
legal&lt;br /&gt;
access to this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

From the legal parking sign to the right (as you face the sign) is OK...just not in front of the gate - this will make sense when you get there.

Legal trail in is to the left of the no parking sign and then bear right to the fire road running down the hill.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the replacement for my original The Bunker, 515 cache
(GC2E98Y) that had to be archived. This is a brand new cache so if
you logged the old one, you can log this one as a new find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day, while waiting for my daughter to finish soccer
practice, I started playing with my GPS. I was exploring the points
of interest and one of the categories was &quot;Geographic Points&quot;. I
clicked on it and one that caught my eye was labeled The Bunker,
515 Ft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw where it was and thought I would like to hike there. So I
went home to look it up on line. Surprisingly, when I googled it,
it came up. There is not much information about it...or why it is
listed...but I figured there needed to be a cache there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So...today, I hiked out to the spot. It is a good hike with a
couple of good steep hills. Nothing too tough though. At the actual
location of the GPS POI, there was nothing but some dead wood. The
location is at an elevation of 515 feet (according to the GPS). But
it is not even the highest point within site. So I wandered up to
the top of the hill and started exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was not able to keep the original cache at it's location
at the top of the hill...I figured I would let you see both sides
of The Bunker. You will hike to the top and then back down the
other side to get to the new cache location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This container is home made is not at all obvious. Please be
respectful of the environment while searching. The cache container
is completely visible without uncovering anything. It may not be
obvious...but it is in plain view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the bounce here was pretty good, I will give you one small
hint. This container fits the general setting but upon further
examination it is a little out of place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and enjoy the hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking: N 39° 27.524 W 076° 52.475&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking for this is a little odd. Park in front of or to the
right of the sign that allows you to park here. Do not park in
front of the gate or anywhere near the No Parking sign. Once in the
parking area, to get to the trail...as you face the No Parking sign
the trail goes into the woods to your left. Follow it into the
woods and then bear to the right and out onto the fire road going
down the hill. Checking with DNR at Soldiers Delight, this is legal
access to this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For FTF Honors on this one!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK2FTGM - GC2FTGM Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 39° 27.524 W 076° 52.475&lt;br /&gt;Do Not Park in front of the NO PARKING Sign. From the legal parking sign to the right (as you face the sign) is OK...just not in front of the gate - this will make sense when you get there.

Legal trail in is to the left of the no parking sign and then bear right to the fire road running down the hill.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please stay clear of the BGE power lines further down the road.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No real trails in...only deer paths.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;One warning...if you stay out of the woods too long, you will encounter a fence.  It is better to enter the woods at the top of the hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area is not &quot;Posted&quot; so you should take the appropriate precautions during hunting season.   You might understand why I mention this when you see the artifact that has been discarded near this cache.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hint:  The cache is not in or within 10 feet of the big blue thing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please feel free to send me corrected coordinates if you feel the need.   I took many readings, but with the bounce in this area, they were all over the place.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF honors go to MRMALLETHEAD.

In fact...make sure you stay on public property as you search.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The house across the street from this cache used to be owned by the Hunter's.   The white house next to it used to be owned by the Lynch's.   I was good friends with Denny Lynch growing up and spent a lot of time at these two houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Lynch used to own a local shop (was it John Deere?) that is now a transmission shop directly in front of the large water tower in Chartley.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have all moved on...but I have great memories of playing in these two houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the hunt.</groundspeak:long_description>

should use to get to The Bunker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I figured since I was bringing you out here, I might as well give
you a fairly simple cache. The others, that are on The Bunker, are
pretty tough.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The trick to this one is not the hide...but rather how to actually
get to the hide. You may find yourself backtracking about 50-70
feet to approach this without a struggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and enjoy the hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking: N 39° 27.524 W 076° 52.475&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking for this is a little odd. Park in front of or to
the&lt;br /&gt;
right of the sign that allows you to park here. Do not park
in&lt;br /&gt;
front of the gate or anywhere near the No Parking sign. Once in
the&lt;br /&gt;
parking area, to get to the trail...as you face the No Parking
sign&lt;br /&gt;
the trail goes into the woods to your left. Follow it into
the&lt;br /&gt;
woods and then bear to the right and out onto the fire road
going&lt;br /&gt;
down the hill. Checking with DNR at Soldiers Delight, this is
legal&lt;br /&gt;
access to this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For FTF Honors on this one!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From the legal parking sign to the right (as you face the sign) is OK...just not in front of the gate - this will make sense when you get there.

There is a fence that you can not scale between the highway and the
cache.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;FROM SEPTEMBER TO JANUARY THERE IS
DEER HUNTING IN THIS AREA!&lt;br /&gt;
BE MINDFUL, BE CAREFUL, AND BE CIVIL!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is active bow hunting in this area of the park. PLEASE wear
appropriate clothing (orange
blaze) when looking for this cache from September to
January.
&lt;p&gt;This area needs lots of attention. If at all possible...bring in
a trash bag and take out a load. I have been taking a bag out every
time I come and have not even dented the surface...but with all the
cachers out there...if we all do a little, it might have a big
impact. Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache gets it name from the smattering of large trees that
populate this little forest. As you walk through these woods, you
will see several of these old giants lurking. This one was not so
lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF prize may or may not be of use to you. I had an extra
delorme USB gps reciever for your computer or laptop. Legally the
software is not transferable (because I am still using it), but a
windows machine will recognize the GPS when plugged in. If you have
mapping software installed, it should work with this guy. If you
can't use it, leave it for the next to find. There is also a space
shuttle mission patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to UFF298 on the FTF honors.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Here is the challenge. This cache will be muggled. If you are
seen grabbing this one, it will be snagged/removed...otherwise it
should go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will keep a tally of finds before it is muggled...can we get
more than 1?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you up to the challenge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember this is all in good fun. Even the stealthyest
among us get snagged sometimes. Just do your best and if you happen
to get caught...oh well...we start again!&lt;/p&gt;

hunting season. Please use all precautions when searching for this
cache.
&lt;p&gt;Parking coordinates will be displayed (and
can be downloaded to a gps) when/if you are successful with the
coordinate checker at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise...you are
on your own for parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficulty rating is for the series and not just for this cache.
Since you will need to find five other caches in order to complete
this one...the difficulty rating is high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... &lt;b&gt;WOW!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put together all the clues along with one last piece of
information he gave me and went out after whatever the last thing
was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fully expected it to be a card with a telephone number or
something ridiculous like that...but instead...you are going to
love this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found was a locked box. There was a master lock on
it...so I bet you can figure what the first three numbers are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the box was a treasure map. Yes...a real treasure map.
There were also some codes printed on the lid of the box. It took
me a minute to figure out how to use it...but it quickly made
sense. I followed it and...well...I won't ruin the surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now...I can't bring you all this way and not give you the fun of
doing this...so I have made some copies of the map. I have set up a
way to protect them and even used his original Master lock to
secure them. While most people in the woods will not notice
this...with your GPS and being a geocacher...you will spot this
very easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once there, open the lock and retrieve a map. You may keep the
map...but please let me know how many you took in your log. That
way I will know when to go back out and restock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;NOTICE&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one laminated map that is secured to container...DO NOT
REMOVE THIS MAP!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a piece of paper and something to write with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in case this laminated map is the last one in the
container, please copy the map to your piece of paper...and make a
note in the log so I can re-stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;u&gt;INSTRUCTIONS FOR FIRST
LOCATION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright...you are going to need to know how to use the
information you were given in the first 5 caches to find the
maps/starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note...if at any time, while you are adding or
subtracting, you go higher than .999 or lower than .000, please add
one to the whole number or subtract one from the whole number
respectively...and keep going. ie....you have N44 24.987 and you
are asked to add .100, you would end up with N44 25.087.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the clue you received in #4 and add it to the decimal North
coordinates for this cache. We will call this Orion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the clue you received in #5 and subtract it from the
decimal for the West coordinates. We will call this Virgo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You are not done yet!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the three numbers you got from #1, #2, and #3. To that total
add 535. We will call this value &quot;The Factor&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add The Factor to Orion to get the North coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subtract The Factor from Virgo to get the West coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will now have the starting point for this cache ...you will
get all the other information you need to find the final at the
location you have calculated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BRING THE CODES YOU GOT FROM THE FIRST THREE
CACHES TO THE FINAL. YOU WILL NEED THEM TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE

If you have read the entire listing you will understand why and how
you will need them!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got to the final location, I was somewhat put back by
what I found. Let's just say that the stories my friend told me way
back at Cherry Springs were true. The only problem is that the
currency of the money he left is completely useless here. So I have
a lot of very pretty paper and a bunch of metal that appears to be
tin. I guess this is worth something somewhere...but not here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to make this one a good treasure hunt. The final was
originally stuffed with some nice items (ie. Ravens T-Shirt,
Astronomy items, some NASA DVD's, etc), so please try and trade
equally here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;C-Finder and BeerMoney&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For Co-FTF Honors on this
one!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was great meeting you guys at the final
and awarding the FTF prizes to you!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. Enjoy the hunt and let me know if you have any trouble at
all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The caterpillars stripped the trees of their leaves preventing photosynthesis. This, together with a prolonged drought, killed the trees. The dead trees were removed in 2008 and the area was replanted with acorns and hardwood saplings.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache will be extremely difficult (if
not impossible) to get to when the water levels are at their very
highest. This cache was placed in July after the water level had
dropped from the spring high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you untie the cache to retrieve it, please
tie it back in place. This is to keep it from floating away if the
water levels rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also...please return it well hidden. This
area has some visitors and if they spot this container it will
disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well the story continues and the mystery deepens. If you are not
familiar with the story behind this cache please visit the first
two descriptions in this series called EH Cacoeg - First Right (GC28REX)
and EH Cacoeg - Left
(GC2B8VG) . Because the story is long I will ask you to read it
there...and then continue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a trip to Dallas for work so this one had to wait a bit
before I could go grab it. As it turns out, that might be a good
thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area appears to flood regularly and GPS reception is
horrible (at least right now - July).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did get to the coordinates and found the next card...as with
the others, it was attached to a tree. Now that I now what I am
looking for...the cards are getting easier to spot. But I can also
understand why others have not seen them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area made finding a spot for the actual cache a challenge.
I don't mean for this one to be hard...but due to the traffic in
the area (yes there are a lot of fishermen back here) I needed to
cover this one well. There is more information (if you are so
inclined) in the hint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again...please cover this as well or better than you found
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now...back to the story...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This card also equated out to a number. So that you understand
what I am dealing with...each card I have found so far has had a
picture of a constellation (stars) with one circled. If I look up
the constellation in my star atlas, the circled star has a number
next to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on what I find at the next two caches, I might include
the cards in a future cache so you can see what I went through to
decode the clues. Not overly difficult for an astronomer..but way
to hard for the average person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the clues he gave me, I have an idea of what these numbers
represent...but we will see. The next cache clue is a little
befuddling, but I will need to see what the card contains and that
might clear it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache will take you to where it all begins (well at least
where the reservoir begins at least)! This is the northern end of
the stream that was dammed to form the reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the winter you might actually be able to see the 140 bridge
and, if the water is high enough, the northern tip of the
reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick to this one, and the reason the numbers are fairly
high, is that figuring out how to get here (without a boat) is a
real trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't be surprised by the fishermen that are usually back
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also...the railroad tracks back here are active (but rarely
used)...so be careful if approaching them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, please be mindful of all No
Trespassing signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For Co-FTF Honors (although Beer Money
admits that C-finder actually came up with the cache
first!).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>1.  This cache is no further in from the stream channel edge than about 15 feet.   
2.   This cache is on the ground and covered with brown thick grass and a small pile of sticks.   
3.  It is not obvious...but if you have found the second in this series and know what the rope looks like that was used to attach that cache...look for that color and you may spot it.   I could see just a little bit of it as I approached from one direction - not the obvious direction though.

This
cache is located on the grounds of the Grand Lodge of Maryland and
was placed with special permission. Please do not seek this cache
between 7pm - 7am or if the gates are
closed.

When
you find the cornerstone, look 12 feet to the North for another
&quot;cornerstone&quot; to find the coordinates to the final
&quot;cornerstone&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;

At
the close of the Civil War, the Grand Lodge of Maryland, the
governing body of Ancient Free and Accepted Masonry in Maryland,
commissioned architect Edmund G. Lind to design a new Masonic
Temple a block north and a block west of a building in the 100
block of St. Paul Street which they had occupied since the 1820s.
Lind drew up plans for a three-story marblefront building just
south of St. Paul's [P.E] Church, its first floor partially taken
up by shops and its two upper floors devoted entirely to Masonic
purposes. These multiplied as the number of Masons in Baltimore
grew, and when the building was gutted by fire on Christmas Day,
1890, the Grand Lodge seized the opportunity to expand its
facility, instructing the architectural firm of Carson and Sperry
to add an additional floor in the course of the rebuilding process.
The firm retained Lind's 1867 facade, but added an additional floor
above it. The result must have met with the Masons's approval: when
fire again ravaged the building in January, 1908, the Grand Lodge
once more called upon Joseph E. Sperry - by then a solo
practitioner - to restore their home to the splendor to which they
had grown accustomed and to enlarge it still further. Sperry this
time added two more upper floors, disguised by a Mansard roof to
look like only a single additional story from the Charles Street
side of the building. Among the ten meeting rooms available for
Masonic use were a Tudor Gothic one modeled on the Roslyn Chapel in
Edinburgh, Scotland, and another room which recreated the interior
of an Egyptian temple. The building also featured ornate lobbies, a
marble staircase, stained-glass windows, and rococo chandeliers,
pipe-organs, and two large kitchens. The Grand Lodge maintained its
headquarters here until 1994, when the shift of Masonic membership
to the suburbs finally decided it to move to the property it owns
in Baltimore County's Hunt Valley. The Charles Street temple was
put on the market, and acquired eventually by Baltimore attorney
and developer Peter Angelos. The building was then remodeled and
stands today as the Tremont Grand Hotel, however the cornerstone
was brought here for preservation.

I was a little worried about security given all the stories that had been logged but the only person I noticed was someone who came out from the Grand Lodge and pretended to be browsing the monuments while I was at stage 1. He went back inside when I headed off to stage two.

No problems finding the cache and everything is in good shape. Left a few small items. I was planning on dropping a coin but realized I didn't have it with me in my bag today. This is a good place for it though so I'll be back to place it soon.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located in &quot;Harford Estates Park&quot; near my home, a small open field and wooded area along side a stream in the Forest Hill area.  Free street side parking is available on Bernadette Drive.  Look for the almost unreadable wooden sign that identifies the park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is at the bottom of a valley on Bernadette Drive that we used to bike down to as kids.  As you will be able to tell, you can get up some speed going down this road.  This &quot;park&quot; is rarely used except by kids walking in the woods or playing in the stream on hot summer days.  There is a small, unmarked trail that will get you to GZ, but it is often impeded by briers, so long pants and maybe a pair of snips will help.  When you get to GZ, you are looking for a camo lock-n-lock box.  You should be able to make the find without having to venture too far off the trail.  The container is full of swag (hopefully the FTF will find something inside to their liking).  Good Luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is my first hide of anything larger then a nano, my first woods hide, and my first hide using only my cell phone.  Any feedback regarding the coordinates or the cache itself (good or bad) are appreciated.  I plan on seeing how this cache does here before trying a new hiding method in its place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONTRATS TO TEAMWOODSEDGE FOR THE FTF!

There should be no problem retrieving the container once you locate it, but some people may find a pair of tweezers or even a stick to be helpful. There is plenty of parking around, but muggles will be about, especially during feeding time and banking hours, so be mindful of that.

Or go under RT 40 and Follow the old railroad bed to the cache. There is no elevation change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to do the other caches across the river, use the RT. 40 bridge, use the right toll lanes and purchase an AVI decal.  Cost is $10 and it gives you unlimited crossings on RT. 40 only for a FULL YEAR!!  Better than EZpass.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; HAVE FUN [8D]</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This hide is in honor of the water stop I have worked for the last two years at the NCR Trail Marathon put on by the Baltimore Road Runners Club.   This year was the 20th anniversary and I felt this little, out of the way, spot needed a cache since I spend so much time here.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the cache is not directly on the trail, it is a quick walk from the trail, on a paved road, to get to it.  Absolutely no bushwhacking is required, so this is a great one if you are running or riding the NCR trail in this area.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also get a nice persepective of the stream and old railroad bridge back on the trail from this spot.   While you are here (and if it is not summer) you might see the remains of the old house up on the hill.   Local history says this was a hunting cabin but it seems a bit big for that to me.   Feel free to let me know your thoughts on it.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One last thing of interest here.   As you come off the trail (or drive over it), you will see a sign that is the split for Hicks Road and Wilson Road.   You would think the change should be just beyond the bridge where the road makes a hard right, but this is not the case.   The railroad generally followed the river but at spots (like this one) moved away from it to keep a level grade or cut off sharp bends.   In this case the railroad became a property line and consequently the road changed names as it crossed the railroad tracks.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a small, twist apart, telescope eyepiece case, covered in camo tape.   There is a log but no pencil, so please bring one along.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please replace as found (not harder or easier).   This should be a quick find if lucky and real stumper if not!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Ump35&amp;Bee and PaHawkEye for a shared FTF on this one.</groundspeak:long_description>

Also looks like the treeline was pushed back a bit.  Worries were unfounded as I quickly found the cache.

Log is a damp.  Ziploc was ruined so I replaced it. Not sure if the cache was were it was supposed to be but I left it where I found it. Sending a pic to the CO so they can verify placement. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Other then geocaching my hubby and I really enjoy fishing...  We spend alot of time around the resevoir and last year we were fishing off the rocks on the corner of the cove and I caught the biggest Large Mouth Bass I've ever seen come out of Prettyboy.  Took me twenty minutes to reel in.  As I'm about to pull him up he jumps out the water, hits the rocks, breaks my line and gets away.  My hubby even dove in after him. We love the area and this is a great fishing spot. The cache overlooks the spot were Mumbo Jumbo got away.  The terrain is rather rough going down down to the water so please be careful!  Follow the trail down to the left, when you reach the bottom, follow the trail that goes to the right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is very poor reception in this area, and we had tons of bounce.  The coords. are the best I could get, so there is a picture of the exact location of the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

It wasn't well covered but didn't look like it had been disturbed. Signed log, picked up the Deaf Awareness geocoin and started a new cachekinz on it's journey. I did not see the Jellyfish coin in the cache. It's a shame about all the bottles in an otherwise great fishing spot. This is a prime location for a CITO unfortunately I had no bags with me.

Prettyboy Reservoir water is transferred to Loch Raven Reservoir via Gunpowder Falls rather than directly to Baltimore. The dam releases water as needed into the river channel, which flows into Loch Raven Reservoir. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prettyboy Reservoir is in the northwest corner of Baltimore County and its 80 square mile watershed lies in northern Baltimore County and small portions of northeastern Carroll County and southern York County, Pennsylvania. Prettyboy Dam was completed in 1932, has a spillway crest elevation of 520 feet of MSL, impounds about 19 billion gallons of water, and covers about 1,500 acres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several stories concerning the origin of the name &quot;Prettyboy&quot; but one considered authentic is that quite some time ago a farmer had a beautiful white colt named &quot;Pretty Boy&quot;, which was the pride of the neighborhood. The colt was out in the pasture bordering a stream that was a tributary of the Gunpowder River. Suddenly a thunderstorm arose and the colt was forced to seek shelter near the bank of the stream. Sadly, the colt fell into the stream and perished. From that time on, in memory of the colt, the tributary was named &quot;Prettyboy&quot;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pretty Boy Reservoir&lt;br/&gt;Elevation above mean sea level 520 feet &lt;br/&gt;Spillway length 274 feet &lt;br/&gt;Total length 845 feet &lt;br/&gt;Height of crest above stream bed 130 feet &lt;br/&gt;Length of shore line at crest elevation 46 miles &lt;br/&gt;Area of land owned 7,380 acres &lt;br/&gt;Flooded area at crest elevation 1,500 acres &lt;br/&gt;Initial storage capacity: 20 billion gallons &lt;br/&gt;Crest elevation: 520 feet above mean sea level &lt;br/&gt;Area of watershed: 80 square miles &lt;br/&gt;Construction completed: 1933 &lt;br/&gt;Overflowed crest first time September 23, 1933</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located in Ernest Arlington Park. This is a wooded park located at the end of Orwig Rd in the borough of New Freedom. Parking is located at N 39 43.294 W 76 41.475. The cache is less than ¼ mile from the parking area. There are nice trails to within about 75 feet of the cache. Some bushwacking may be required depending on the time of year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is in a hole near the base of a large tree. The tree should be easy to find. While in the area be sure to check out the original Mason Dixon milestone #51. The milestone is located at N 39 43.263 W 76 41.608 and is only about 700 feet from the parking area of this cache. To find the milestone from the Park, drive west on Orwig Rd for about 1/10 mile, then turn south onto Keeney Rd. Go about 100 feet and stop on Keeney Rd where the macadam ends. The milestone is located west of Keeney Rd along the tree line beside the retention pond. The stone can be viewed from your vehicle. The milestone has nothing to do with this cache. Thanks to CCCooperAgency who, in 2003, suggested this cache name to me. </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The large tree is about 50 feet in a somewhat southerly direction from the foundation.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Let's face it the gas prices are out of this world, so why not spend the day in York County where you will be able to find 100 new caches. Make a weekend of it and bring the family to enjoy the sights of York County PA. These caches will take you to some very cool places and you might even learn a little bit about York along the way.</groundspeak:long_description>

Let's face it the gas prices are out of this world, so why not spend the day in York County where you will be able to find 100 new caches. Make a weekend of it and bring the family to enjoy the sights of York County PA. These caches will take you to some very cool places and you might even learn a little bit about York along the way.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">3658.  Made the trip up here, specifically to find this cache, since it was the closest unfound OC.US cache to home.  I was having trouble locating it, at first, so I went over to find A Very Good Friend, after not being able to get sfcchaz on the phone.

When I came back, the GPS seemed to do a better job of putting me in the right place.  Looked around a bit and spotted the cache.

I don't remember the name, but it had been found and the log signed earlier today by som OC.com cachers.

Unless someone else had been here and not signed the log, they seem to have traded sfcchaz's Pathtag for a couple breath mints (unwrapped) and a pack of ketchup.  Sigh...  (There was nothing else in the cache, other than the log and pencil.)

I took these items and dropped off a small black D-ring.  At least, I now had fresh breath!  

This was my 198th OpenCaching.US cache.  I only log crosslisted caches as &quot;found&quot; on one site, to be able to keep a count a distinct finds.

Thanks and Happy Trails!

[BTW - The cache is not &quot;exclusive&quot; to Garmin, per my comments above.]</groundspeak:text>

I traded a personal pathtag of mine for the one inside the cache. TFTC

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I decided to try and see how many days in a row I can find a cache. For todays cache, I did a PSD cache in honor of his 2000th cache find. As I started hiking the snow covered trail, I saw where somebody had been on this trail and left red spots in the snow (blood maybe?). Halfway to the cache the tracks went off the trail and towards the water, so the rest of the way to the cache was through snow that hasn't been disturbed expect for some animal tracks. Once I got to GZ, there were people tracks coming down the hill, across the trail and continuing down the hill (probably how someone got hurt and left the trail going back to the road with the red spots). I tried to find this one 2 years ago but DNF'd, but today after a little searching, I found the cache just in time as it was starting to get dark. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Traffic can be heavy at times, so it's not for kids or pets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have always loved visiting these structures and Pennsylvania  has 197 of them, over 25 in Lancaster County. Neff's Mill Covered Bridge or Pequea 7 Bridge is  very busy so be alert at all times. The view here is great and this one even has windows, so enjoy the view of the little creek. Cache is inside, no need to crawl under the bridge. Please hide as found so others may have the same fun.&quot; Remember &quot;  it is your responsibility to do this cache safely. Disclaimer: You are under no obligation to hunt my cache. You do so at your own risk. Like any outdoor sport, it carries the risk of unforeseen hazards. Use your best judgment with the environment and conditions. As conditions and cache locations may vary, it is the responsibility of the searcher to be familiar with the conditions in the area to be searched, to adequately prepare for those conditions, and to conduct oneself safely and responsibly and remain within his or her personal abilities and limitations. Children should be well supervised. When and if you find a cache, you are under no obligation to touch it, reach it, climb to it, dig for it, pick it up, or even open it. Open it at your own risk. If food or drink is present, do not consume it, throw it out. &quot;Good Luck&quot; on this one.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">YCGS thought it would be a great idea to place 100 caches all over York County, PA and have them all published on one day! Let's face it the gas prices are out of this world, so why not spend the day in York County where you will be able to find 100 new caches. Make a weekend of it and bring the family to enjoy the sights of York County PA. These caches will take you to some very cool places and you might even learn a little bit about York along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be respectful in this area.  This will take you to a cemetery that is also a history lesson.  When you arrive you will see on top of the memorial a piece of one of the former Twin Tower's.  This is a sight to see and respect.  Also drive through the cemetery you will see plaques showing you headstone's of famous people buried there and brief description.  Use stealth and respect.

Jine the cavalry!&lt;br/&gt;If you want to catch the Devil, if you want to have fun,&lt;br/&gt;If you want to smell Hell, jine the cavalry!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This song was sung by the men of J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry during the American Civil War.  Stuart was a cavalry commander known for his mastery of reconnaissance and the use of cavalry in support of offensive operations. While he cultivated a cavalier image (red-lined gray cape, yellow sash, hat cocked to the side with a ostrich plume, red flower in his lapel, often sporting cologne), his serious work made him the trusted eyes and ears of Robert E. Lee's army and inspired Southern morale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On June 27, 1863, during the Confederate invasion, Dover was visited by a small squad of Jenkins’s cavalry.  These soldiers came here from Carlisle, being the advance of Ewell’s corps, part of which had proceeded as far east as Shiremanstown in Cumberland County.  They remained at Dover for a short time and then returned to Carlisle.  At this time Early’s division of Ewell’s corps was moving toward York and had encamped for the night of June 27, in the vicinity of Bigmount and Farmers Post Office in Paradise Township.  A few of Early’s men reached Dover on the morning of Sunday, &lt;br/&gt;June 26.  After spending a short time there obtaining provisions and securing a few articles in the village stores, they joined the division at Weiglestown, while on the march toward York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early in the morning of July 1, General J. E. B. Stuart’s cavalry division began to arrive at Dover.  This force numbered nearly 6000 men, composed of three brigades, commanded respectively by General Fitzhugh Lee, of Virginia; General Wade Hampton, of South Carolina, and Colonel Chambliss, of Virginia.  Stuart came to Dover from Hanover, passing through Jefferson, and York New Salem.  When he arrived at the last named place, he heard that Early’s division had fallen back toward Gettysburg or Carlisle and he proceeded to Dover.  After the fight at Hanover between Stuart and Kilpatrick’s Union cavalry, the Confederate commander was entirely cut off from communications with General Robert E. Lee’s army which on July 1 had open the battle of Gettysburg.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 200 Union Cavalrymen, captured at Hanover and elsewhere, were paroled in the office of Dr. John Ahl at Dover.  General Wade Hampton superintended the parole of these prisoners, who then went to York.  Soon after the arrival of Stuart at Dover he ordered breakfast prepared for his staff, his brigade commanders and himself at the upper hotel on the west side of Main Street.  About 8 o’clock in the morning, these officers partook of a bountiful meal and while eating engaged in conversation about the stirring events then taking place as a result of the Confederate invasion into Pennsylvania.  While they were eating, army surgeons in an adjoining room dressed the wounds of several Confederate soldiers who had received saber cuts in the cavalry battle at Hanover the day before.  Stuart, Hampton and Lee maintained a composed dignity during the two hours that this large body of Confederate cavalry occupied Dover.  During the forenoon squads of mounted men, acting as scouts, were sent out in various directions into Dover and Conewago Townships and captured many farm horses that had not been taken across the Susquehanna.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before leaving the hotel, General Stuart’s adjutant, who afterward wrote a biography of his commander, paid the hotel clerk,  George Dick, later a resident of York, for the breakfast they had ordered.  The money received was United States notes or “greenbacks” as they were called.  This was exceptional, for the Confederate invaders at other placers always paid their obligations in confederate bank notes, which afterward became worthless.&lt;br/&gt;While these cavalrymen remained at Dover, guards were placed around the hotel so that none of the men would drink intoxicating liquors to excess.  In fact, neither of the two hotels had much whiskey at the bar or in the cellar.  A few days before, when the proprietors had heard of the approach of the enemy, all the brandy, whiskey and other liquors in their possession had been placed in the cellar of the United Brethren church built in 1851, within the limits of the town, and was never discovered by the invaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three guides, citizens from the vicinity of Hanover, who had been forced to accompany the Confederates on their march to Dover, were now released and other guides pressed into service at Dover in order to show the Confederates the most direct way toward Carlisle, where Stuart then thought the Confederate forces were concentrating.  About the time that General Stuart, with almost the entire cavalry force of the army of Northern Virginia, left Dover for Carlisle, the battle of Gettysburg opened.  Early in the morning of that day, General Lee near Gettysburg dispatched Colonel Venable, his staff officer, in search of Stuart.  On his way toward York, where he expected to meet Stuart, he was intercepted by Kilpatrick’s cavalry, somewhere north of Hanover.  He rode up to East Berlin, and then proceeded toward Davidsburg, and as he approached the borough of Dover, he again saw at a distance a squadron of Union cavalry around the old Dover church.  He failed to find out the exact position of Stuart’s cavalry, thinking it was possibly then on its way toward Gettysburg.  Colonel Venable returned to the scene of battle and was compelled to report to General Lee that he could find the enemy but not their own cavalry.&lt;br/&gt;Stuart had been without communication with General Lee since he had crossed the Potomac, almost within sight of Washington, on June 28.  He passed on to Carlisle but did not reach Gettysburg until the evening of the second day of the battle.  Some military critics claim that if Stuart had reached the scene of action at Gettysburg on July 1, the tide of battle on July 2 might have been in favor of the Confederate army.  He and his troopers rode on to Dillsburg, seemingly within hearing distance of the cannon’s road at Gettysburg, but he knew nothing of the battle until he got to Carlisle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The train of 125 wagons which he had captured shortly after he crossed the Potomac River was driven through Dover on toward Dillsburg and York Springs and was delivered to the quartermaster general of the Confederate army, four miles northwest of Gettysburg on the evening of July 2.  This wagon train contained provisions and munitions of war used by the Confederates on the last day of the battle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The detour that Stuart made through York County was one of the most unfortunate episodes to the Confederate cause during the Civil War.  This gallant soldier had won distinction for strategy on several occasions before, but his raid through Pennsylvania in 1863 will always be considered a military blunder.  He was killed in battle the following year in a brilliant charge against Sheridan’s cavalry, near Richmond, Virginia. (This might be an overstatement but I'll let it pass)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coordinates lead you to a plaque about Stuart's raid on Dover.  To get credit for this cache you must tell me when the plaque was erected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sources:  History of York County, Pennsylvania&lt;br/&gt;Prowell        Vol 1 1907&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cannonbal!

Let's face it the gas prices are out of this world, so why not spend the day in York County where you will be able to find 100 new caches. Make a weekend of it and bring the family to enjoy the sights of York County PA. These caches will take you to some very cool places and you might even learn a little bit about York along the way.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Another walk in York county public park's! Enjoy this park.</groundspeak:long_description>

FTF#2&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;This
is #2 in Hopefully A Long Series that was started by
Nanni&amp;PapK57!! Lets please keep it going!! The FTF of The
Caches Are Asked To hide a cache within the York County Area within
30 Days And call it YCF#2, #3, #4, ETC. FTF of #2 will then Place
and Name Their Hide YCF#3 and so on!! If you choose not to do this
Please Post a note to the cache page so the next finder willing to
play along can volunteer to keep the series going. When posting
your cache please include the paragraph including the requirements.
Any theme and addition to the name is up to the hider.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Let's see how
many new caches we can get around the county. Please keep the
caches within York County or within 1 Mile of the York County Line
in any of the surrounding Counties!! Thanks For Playing
Along!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 If you have any Questions about
this series direct them by Email to

Nanni&amp;PapK57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 (Nanni&amp;PapK57 supplied me with a container
since I was FTF on YCF#1. Instead of using that container, we are
supplying it to the FTF of YCF#2 to help keep this series
going).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The Cache is
located Rocky Ridge County Park. Please respect the area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; You are
looking for a Lock n Lock container.&lt;br /&gt;
As always Please
Cover as Well or Better Than when found.&lt;br /&gt;

This is a restored bridge, please be respectful and as always be careful and have fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have always loved visiting these structures and Pennsylvania has 197 of them, over 25 in Lancaster County. This Covered Bridge is a combination of two bridges, the Millers Farm Bridge and the Goods Ford Bridge. It is now called The Willows Covered Bridge.  Enjoy the view of the little creek. Cache is inside, no need to crawl under the bridge. Please hide as found so others may have the same fun.&quot; Remember &quot; it is your responsibility to do this cache safely. Disclaimer: You are under no obligation to hunt my cache. You do so at your own risk. Like any outdoor sport, it carries the risk of unforeseen hazards. Use your best judgment with the environment and conditions. As conditions and cache locations may vary, it is the responsibility of the searcher to be familiar with the conditions in the area to be searched, to adequately prepare for those conditions, and to conduct oneself safely and responsibly and remain within his or her personal abilities and limitations. Children should be well supervised. When and if you find a cache, you are under no obligation to touch it, reach it, climb to it, dig for it, pick it up, or even open it. Open it at your own risk. If food or drink is present, do not consume it, throw it out. &quot;Good Luck&quot; on this one.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">YCGS thought it would be a great idea to place 100 caches all over York County, PA and have them all published on one day! Let's face it the gas prices are out of this world, so why not spend the day in York County where you will be able to find 100 new caches. Make a weekend of it and bring the family to enjoy the sights of York County PA. These caches will take you to some very cool places and you might even learn a little bit about York along the way.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Wow this place has a spectacular view. If I were a bird this is what I would see. Take a rest and just enjoy the surroundings.</groundspeak:long_description>

During hunting season be sure to wear florescent orange as required by law. Watch for ground hog holes, covered by grass and weeds in summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever felt like someone is watching you, well now there is, the path watcher. Coords are always tricky in tree covered areas. Please hide as found so others may have the same fun.&quot; Remember &quot; it is your responsibility to do this cache safely. Disclaimer: You are under no obligation to hunt my cache. You do so at your own risk. Like any outdoor sport, it carries the risk of unforeseen hazards. Use your best judgment with the environment and conditions. As conditions and cache locations may vary, it is the responsibility of the searcher to be familiar with the conditions in the area to be searched, to adequately prepare for those conditions, and to conduct oneself safely and responsibly and remain within his or her personal abilities and limitations. Children should be well supervised. When and if you find a cache, you are under no obligation to touch it, reach it, climb to it, dig for it, pick it up, or even open it. Open it at your own risk. If food or drink is present, do not consume it, throw it out. &quot;Good Luck&quot; on this one.</groundspeak:long_description>

Tonight the Mrs mentions that she has always wanted to stop and check it out.  Her dad agreed that he too was curios about it so stop we did!  Not much to look at, but it makes you wonder what this area used to look like.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I stood here and wondered... Could Johnson have ever thought that his bones would be rattled day in and day out by ten thousand conveyances not yet imagined.  Did it ever occur to him that his final resting place would be smack in the middle of everything?  He never heard of a North-Going Zax and a South-Going Zax, but even so, his presence here has caused the same reaction.  Time just moves on around or over you.  I doubt he cares much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope 150 years after they bury me that I don't have a hover strip over my grave, but by then, I guess I won't care much either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take care when parking for this one.

Cache is within 20' of trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever felt like someone is watching you, well now there is, The Trail Watcher. There is only room for the log, BYOP. Please be very stealthy as this is a busy trail. Hide cache completely. The coordinates were tricky with the overhead tree cover. Please hide as found so others may have the same fun.&quot; Remember &quot; it is your responsibility to do this cache safely. Disclaimer: You are under no obligation to hunt my cache. You do so at your own risk. Like any outdoor sport, it carries the risk of unforeseen hazards. Use your best judgment with the environment and conditions. As conditions and cache locations may vary, it is the responsibility of the searcher to be familiar with the conditions in the area to be searched, to adequately prepare for those conditions, and to conduct oneself safely and responsibly and remain within his or her personal abilities and limitations. Children should be well supervised. When and if you find a cache, you are under no obligation to touch it, reach it, climb to it, dig for it, pick it up, or even open it. Open it at your own risk. If food or drink is present, do not consume it, throw it out. &quot;Good Luck&quot; on this one.</groundspeak:long_description>

Let's face it the gas prices are out of this world, so why not spend the day in York County where you will be able to find 100 new caches. Make a weekend of it and bring the family to enjoy the sights of York County PA. These caches will take you to some very cool places and you might even learn a little bit about York along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy quick find!</groundspeak:long_description>

PLEASE be CAREFUL of traffic on the bridge, not for kids and pets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have always loved visiting these structures and Pennsylvania  has 197 of them, over 25 in Lancaster County. Shenk's Mill covered bridge or Big Chickies # 4 bridge is  very busy so be alert at all times. The view here is great and this one even has windows, so enjoy the view of the little creek. Cache is inside, no need to crawl under the bridge. Please hide as found so others may have the same fun.&quot; Remember &quot; it is your responsibility to do this cache safely. Disclaimer: You are under no obligation to hunt my cache. You do so at your own risk. Like any outdoor sport, it carries the risk of unforeseen hazards. Use your best judgment with the environment and conditions. As conditions and cache locations may vary, it is the responsibility of the searcher to be familiar with the conditions in the area to be searched, to adequately prepare for those conditions, and to conduct oneself safely and responsibly and remain within his or her personal abilities and limitations. Children should be well supervised. When and if you find a cache, you are under no obligation to touch it, reach it, climb to it, dig for it, pick it up, or even open it. Open it at your own risk. If food or drink is present, do not consume it, throw it out. &quot;Good Luck&quot; on this one.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Lil Chickadee had a lax game nearby and this was our second of three stops on the way home hoping to grab a few caches. As I pulled over to the side of the road a car drove by slowly, then stopped and then started to back up. Oh great! This is worse than Officer Friendly stopping! I'll tell this nosy lady that I'm fine and she can move along to go bother some one else but now she's smiling and waving. Hey, I know that smiling face - it's (Mrs) MidnightsRaiders! OK, now off to find this cache that has eluded me and Laurie decided to get out and watch us overthink the hide as I did the previous two times. After a small boost I finally found this stinker. We chatted some way and headed on to the last one on the agenda. TFTC </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Easy access 24 hours, but recommend Tuesday afternoon and/or evening to experience the full cultural &quot;flavor&quot; of this local landmark cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is one of our favorite spots spring, summer, and fall.  Winter is a bit off season, but still a nice time to visit.  This is a micro cache with a log only.  Bring your own pen.  I recommend hitting this cache on a Tuesday when you have an hour or two to spare so that you can experience the rich flavor of this PA Dutch country tradition.  Tuesday visits will require the use of extreme stealth (see note below).  The name of this cache is derived from the old hiding spot.  The Verizon phone booths have since been removed, but the new hide is very close.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;### Note ###&lt;br/&gt;When I moved the cache to its new location, there was a bench there.  Now during the summer months there is a market booth blocking access to the hide.  Considering this seasonal weekly obstruction, I recommend avoiding fair weather summer Tuesdays for searching.  The stand is not there during fall and winter months.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is within 20' of the trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have you ever felt like someone is watching you, well now there is, The Trail Watcher. Container has a FTF coin. There is only room for the log, BYOP. Please be very stealthy as this is a busy trail. Hide cache completely. The coordinates were extra tricky with the overhead tree cover.  The hint will help. Please hide as found so others may have the same fun.&quot; Remember &quot; it is your responsibility to do this cache safely. Disclaimer: You are under no obligation to hunt my cache. You do so at your own risk. Like any outdoor sport, it carries the risk of unforeseen hazards. Use your best judgment with the environment and conditions. As conditions and cache locations may vary, it is the responsibility of the searcher to be familiar with the conditions in the area to be searched, to adequately prepare for those conditions, and to conduct oneself safely and responsibly and remain within his or her personal abilities and limitations. Children should be well supervised. When and if you find a cache, you are under no obligation to touch it, reach it, climb to it, dig for it, pick it up, or even open it. Open it at your own risk. If food or drink is present, do not consume it, throw it out. &quot;Good Luck&quot; on this one.</groundspeak:long_description>

wanted to be, and you were happy for it too.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Kreider's Meeting House was built in 1859 and was part of
the White Oak District of the Dunker Faith. Today it is part of the
Church of the Brethren. According to an article in the Lancaster
paper, the cemetery is probably older than the Meeting House
building. Kreiders (or Kreiters as it was sometimes referred to)
was one of four Dunkard Churches in Penn Township, Graybills,
Gibbles and Longnecker's being the other three. It was built
&quot;near Cornelius Kreider's&quot; and is no longer used
as a Church, but is used several times a year for special
events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent vandalism of the nearby cemetery is good reason to not
look suspicious while searching for this cache. It has been placed
with permission, but do not look for it at night. Please be
respectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The property line for the home behind the structure actually
runs though the structure. With that in mind, there is no need to
search behind the building. In fact, you can narrow your search
area to the interior of this lovely location.&lt;/p&gt;

 Parents are not so fond of our rough riding hero though. His high riding days are mostly gone
with everyone watching those calories and fattening foods. No
doubt, our wrangler friend will ride again, but his posse might
never be as large as it once was. Besides, can you really trust a
guy who's name is &lt;i&gt;Twinkie&lt;/i&gt;?
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Twinkie propaganda - Twinkies by the
Numbers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;500 million: The number of Twinkies baked each year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10: The minutes it takes to bake a Twinkie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1930: The year James Dewar invented the two-for-a-nickel
treat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;150: The number of calories in one Twinkie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50: The number of recipes in the Twinkies Cookbook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7: The number of Twinkies needed to make the &quot;Patriotic Twinkie
Pie&quot; recipe in the Twinkies Cookbook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1: The rank of New Orleans in terms of per capita Twinkie
consumption compared to other cities in the U.S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1999: The year President Bill Clinton included Twinkies in the
millennium time capsule.&lt;/li&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache has 6 stages and will take you through the Lititz area
to various historic locations. You should plan for about 1 - 2
hours to complete. Please do not attempt at night since a few of
the stages are not available from dusk to dawn. The final stage is
hidden with permission on private property. Please follow the
instructions at stage 6 and do not take any short cuts to the final
stage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache was originally designed to be a Wherigo, but the
platform was just to buggy to support the amount of detail I had
planned. There is a ton of information that I have assembled to
accompany this cache. I have compiled it all into a
PDF file. I am including it here instead of at
the final stage because I think it would be useful as you progress
through the stages. It does contain some of the information needed
to complete the cache, and could serve as a spoiler. So be it. Play
the game as you like. The point is that you end up with a greater
appropriation of this beautiful area of our country. Things were
not always as they are today and it is good to remind ourselves of
this fact. Have fun and God bless America!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First four years on plaque at listed cache coordinates in order
of occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;
ABCD, EFGH, IJKL, MNOP&lt;br /&gt;
Q=E+L&lt;br /&gt;
R=O-C&lt;br /&gt;
Park at PD.CPP LH.IKP&lt;br /&gt;
Clue to next stage at PD.QRK LH.ENP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a sign that might discourage you from parking at the
suggested coordinates, but it is OK if you are visiting the
historic area. Use your own judgment according to your comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years on plaque in order of occurrence&lt;br /&gt;
ABCD, EFGH&lt;br /&gt;
P=H-D&lt;br /&gt;
Q=G-E&lt;br /&gt;
R=C+E&lt;br /&gt;
S=B-G&lt;br /&gt;
T=H-C&lt;br /&gt;
Park at: EP.GPB EB.EQR&lt;br /&gt;
Clue to next stage at: EP.QBB EB.PTS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proprietor is aware that visitors will be looking for this
object. He encourages your discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years on plaque in order of occurrence&lt;br /&gt;
ABCD, EFGH, IJKL, MNOP&lt;br /&gt;
Q=G+L&lt;br /&gt;
MH.QGK&lt;br /&gt;
EN.HOA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be careful here. People drive quickly along this road.
Parking further up the hill and walking down is my suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years on Plaque in order of a occurrence&lt;br /&gt;
ABCD, EFGH, IJKL&lt;br /&gt;
X=C-D&lt;br /&gt;
Y=J-L&lt;br /&gt;
Z=B-H&lt;br /&gt;
GX EK.GYZ&lt;br /&gt;
FY HK.ZLY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please park directly in front of GZ. The neighbor does not like
people in his driveway or on his property, but has given permission
for parking directly in front of GZ. There is no container at this
location to search for. You might not even need to get out of your
vehicle. Just solve the following puzzle to get the next
coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten individuals are noted on this plaque.&lt;br /&gt;
John, Matthias, Katharine, Matthias, Christian, John, Abraham&lt;br /&gt;
Jacob, Abraham, Christian, Katharine, Abraham, Brinser, Buehler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a micro hidden here that contains the coordinates to
the final stage. There are also instructions on how to get there.
Please follow the instructions and do not take any shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final might be a bit NW of the given coordinates, but you
are looking for a camouflaged ammo can. It should not be too
difficult to locate.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

instructions... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Manheim Train Station is a great place to train your
kids!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;freight room&quot; is now a community room and museum. The
freight office and men's and women's waiting rooms have been
restored to original decor. The facilities are open to the public,
free of charge, on Sunday afternoons from 1-4pm from June through
September or by appointment. The station continues to be a popular
tour for school children who enjoy the history and the trolley ride
usually available with the tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the home of the Birney Trolley # 236. In 1990 a
derelict Brill Birney safety car trolley was obtained from the
Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. It was one of only a
small number of surviving cars of this type. Originally in service
in Lancaster, it was lovingly restored by Society members. Weather
permitting, the trolley is available for tours and short rides when
the station is open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reason to climb on any of the cars. There are
neighbors across the street, so park appropriately and use common
urban stealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the puzzle:&lt;br /&gt;
40 AB.CDE&lt;br /&gt;
76 PQ.RST&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = C - P&lt;br /&gt;
B = Number of telegraph (in clerks office window) + Q&lt;br /&gt;
C = Number of trunks on the first wagon&lt;br /&gt;
D = Number of barrels on the second wagon + Q&lt;br /&gt;
E = D&lt;br /&gt;
P = Number of bushel crates on the second wagon&lt;br /&gt;
Q = Number of steps leading to the clerk's office&lt;br /&gt;
R = Number of spokes on one of the wooden wagon wheels - 10&lt;br /&gt;
S = A&lt;br /&gt;
T = Number of spokes on one of the iron wagon wheels - E&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Great Ice Cream Challenge! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cache is NOT at the listed
coordinates!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area is home to not one, not two, but THREE ice cream
shops! And if that wasn't enough, there is a chocolate factory next
door! And to add to your summer afternoon pleasure, you can take a
relaxing stroll through lovely Lititz Springs Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located at the following coordinates:&lt;br /&gt;
N 40° 09.ABC&lt;br /&gt;
W 76° 18.XYZ&lt;/p&gt;
Two of the establishments are on private property and the owner
would not be pleased if you wander around here after hours. There
is a sign telling you what will happen if you park here
UNAUTHORIZED. They even quote the law for you. QRST equals the P.L.
number.&lt;br /&gt;
X equals the number of large windows not counting the door at the
Pantry At Lititz.&lt;br /&gt;
YZ equals the number on the door of Freeze &amp; Frizz +
(X/2)squared&lt;br /&gt;
Apparently the doors have been replaced at Greco's Italian Ices
&amp; Homemade Ice Cream and the number is now missing. So AB
equals 49 + S + T.&lt;br /&gt;
C equals the last digit in the PA Code Title (not Chapter)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is within walking distance and will hold small travel
bugs and coins, but you need to bring your own pen. If you drive to
it, please do not park in the Wilbur Employee parking lot as this
is marked private property.&lt;br /&gt;
And one more thing... everyone says they end up in the middle of
nowhere, so if you find yourself in that spot, just walk north
about 40 feet and try looking near there. It's not a tough
hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the tastes of Lititz!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;p&gt;I used to come here for Sunday School picnics. We would have
peanut scrambles and play ball. There was a two seater outhouse
that I found interesting back then, but it is long gone. The
pavilion is still used quite often for family reunions and get
togethers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a ratjam special so that should be easy to spot,
but getting the cache could be another story. You might even need a
special tool of some sort. Have fun and be careful!&lt;/p&gt;

Only a limited selection of plants today but they are expecting a bunch of inventory later in the day.

This is my first find on OpenCaching. I'm impressed with the cache rating idea. Hope to see more caches published in the area. Added my Hawk Mountain Hike already and will probably add my Northern Corner of Berks County cache as well.</groundspeak:text>

encourage through hiking.&lt;/p&gt; 

 
&lt;p&gt;The caches in this series are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP68 - Swiss Woods
(1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP69 - Snavely Mill
(2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6A - Hedge Apple Row
(3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6B - Green Pastures
(4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6D - Still Waters
(5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6E - King of the Road
(6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each log in the series contains a set of coordinates at the top.
You will want to keep a record of these points for future use.
Trust me, you'll be glad you wrote them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conestoga Trail system has its northern terminus at the old
Lebanon Pumping Station just off route 322 (N 40 14.666, W 76
20.198). The Horseshoe Trail also crosses the CTS at this point.
The southern terminus is located at Lock 12 in York County just
across the Norman Wood Bridge and off route 372. At this southern
terminus, the CTS reaches the Mason-Dixon Trail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section of the Conestoga Trail is mostly on the road. Be
sure to walk against traffic and be careful. An interesting feature
on this walk is the old mill on E. Meadow Valley Road. There is a
benchmark (KW0635)
in the front step of this building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a micro at stage 2 and a small at the final.
I will warn you that stage 2 could be tricky. I used an old CCCA
technique here. Be careful extracting the container so that it can
be hidden again. You might need let your fingers do the
walking.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

during hurricane Agnes in 1972. When you enter the parking area of
the church, look for the flood line markers on the posts around the
parking lot.
&lt;p&gt;You can often find ducks, muskrats and snakes around the stream.
This cache is on the church property with permission, so please be

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Hurricane Agnes Category 1 hurricane (SSHS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formed:&lt;/strong&gt; June 14, 1972 (1972-06-14)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dissipated:&lt;/strong&gt; June 25, 1972 (1972-06-26)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Highest winds:&lt;/strong&gt; 85 mph (140 km/h) (1-minute
sustained)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Lowest pressure:&lt;/strong&gt; 977 mbar (hPa; 28.85 inHg)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fatalities:&lt;/strong&gt; 130 direct&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Damage:&lt;/strong&gt; $3 billion (1972 USD) / $15.6 billion
(2010 USD)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Areas affected:&lt;/strong&gt; Yucatán Peninsula, western Cuba,
Florida Panhandle, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland,
Pennsylvania, New York&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurricane Agnes was the first tropical storm and first hurricane
of the 1972 Atlantic hurricane season. A rare June hurricane, it
made landfall on the Florida Panhandle before moving northeastward
and ravaging the Mid-Atlantic region as a tropical storm. The worst
damage occurred along a swath from central Maryland through central
Pennsylvania to the southern Finger Lakes region of New York, as
illustrated by the rainfall map below. Agnes brought heavy rainfall
along its path, killing 129 and causing $1.7 billion in damage,
with railroad damage so extensive it contributed to the creation of
Conrail. At the time, it was the most damaging hurricane ever
recorded, surpassing Hurricane Betsy, and it would not be surpassed
until Hurricane Frederic in 1979. Agnes was also the only Category
1 hurricane to be retired at the time, and one of 5 today (other
Category ones were Cesar, Klaus, Noel, and Stan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a three stage multi. All stages are within the church
property boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage one is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; in the greenery. Please do not
trample the vegetation. You can get to it without stepping on or
searching through the landscaping.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

avoid the urge to drive to trailheads to save time. Just get a

&lt;p&gt;The caches in this series are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP68 - Swiss Woods
(1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP69 - Snavely Mill

&lt;p&gt;The Conestoga Trail system has its northern terminus at the old
Lebanon Pumping Station just off route 322 (N 40 14.666, W 76
20.198). The Horseshoe Trail also crosses the CTS at this point.
The southern terminus is located at Lock 12 in York County just
across the Norman Wood Bridge and off route 372. At this southern
terminus, the CTS reaches the Mason-Dixon Trail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section of the Conestoga Trail has seen it's share of
caches. You have probably been here before. There is a burned out
shell of a Sycamore tree near the final. Further down the trail you
will find Erb's Bridge and if you are lucky, another cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a nano at stage 2 and a bison tube at the
final. Keep your eyes peeled and your weight centered.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

during October and November. They have a knack for repelling
spiders, so grab a few to put in the dark corners of your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a micro at stage 2 and a small at the final.
At the final you will become acquainted with the baying hounds of

disgusted enough to not even try it. So, as an extra challenge, if
you want to make this WORTH your EFFORT, you can park at any of the
following locations and bushwhack your way to GZ. Then you can feel
like you have REALLY accomplished something.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Swimming Hole Stroll&lt;br /&gt;

Lone Wolf &amp; Cub&lt;br /&gt;

Hey! You Sank My Battleship!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So there you go Vertumnis &amp; Klatch. Something for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;
If you want to minimize the bushwhacking and mail a letter, you can
park down by the Elm post office and huff it up the hill.&lt;br /&gt;
Common sense and stealth are in order. 
&lt;p&gt;The Building that the post office is in used to be a hub of
activity in this area. This is the old location of Bomberger's
Store. You could stop here and mail your letters, fill your tank,
grab some groceries, pay your utilities, stock up on ammunition and
firearms, buy new flooring for your kitchen, find a replacement
door knob and buy a hunting lisense all in one visit. On your way
out you could rent a cement mixer just in case Vinny was comming
over later in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;
Now were can you do that today?&lt;br /&gt;
Not at Walmart!&lt;br /&gt;
(Take that Cookie!)&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h2&gt;Anatoly Karpov&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;12th World Champion&lt;br /&gt;
1975 - 1985&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIDE Champion&lt;br /&gt;
1993 - 1999&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anatoly Evgenievich Karpov was born in Zlatoust, Russia in 1951.
His early rise in chess was swift, as he became a Candidate Master
by age eleven. At twelve, he was accepted into Mikhail Botvinnik's
prestigious chess school, though Botvinnik made the following
remark about the young Karpov: &quot;The boy does not have a clue about
chess, and there's no future at all for him in this profession.&quot;
Karpov acknowledged that his understanding of chess theory was very
confused at that time, and wrote later that the homework which
Botvinnik assigned greatly helped him, since it required that he
consult chess books and work diligently. Karpov improved so quickly
under Botvinnik's tutelage that he became the youngest Soviet
National Master in history at fifteen in 1966; this tied the record
established by Boris Spassky in 1952.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 1975, a few days before his 24th birthday FIDE declared
him the World Champion after Bobby Fischer, the current World
Champion, refused to defend his title. Karpov was embarrassed that
he had acquired the title in this manner and subsequently played in
many strong tournaments to prove that he deserved to be World
Champion. He performed impressively and accumulated the finest
tournament record in history. He once said, &quot;To be champion
requires more than simply being a strong player; one has to be a
strong human being as well.&quot; He retained his title until losing to
Garry Kasparov in a controversial match in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1993 Kasparov rejected FIDE leaving Karpov to play in the
official FIDE World Championship match in which he defeated Jan
Timman of the Netherlands. However, his victory was over-shadowed
by the independent championship match played at the same time
between the current World Champion, Kasparov and British
Grandmaster, Nigel Short. Both Karpov and Kasparov won their
championship matches and both claim the title of World
Champion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Riddle:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A man's integrity can be determined by his words. Only the unbroken
ones count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Puzzle:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asperation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;istentialist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;piration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hilarating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;istentialist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pediency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;amination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aggeration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;citing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pediency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluded&lt;/li&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is our PA version of the Jasmer Challenge.  It is for those geocachers who have traveled all over the US and found caches for every month from May 2000 to now. The difficulty rating is for all the caches you need to get to complete this  Challenge. &quot;Note&quot; Disregard the challenge name on the log sheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  #1     In order to log this cache, you need to provide the GC code of a cache that was placed in each month for all of 2000 and 2001 in your log entry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, you have to have a find for caches placed in all other months (up to and including the current month) as well, but those tend to be easier to come by and don't require as much verification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are also encouraged to run the Monthly Coverage GSAK macro , that sums this all up and post a screen grab of the output in the Gallery. We will post our screen prints as an example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; # 2.  Go to the posted coordinates which are for a benchmark which you can log as a benchmark find.  While at the benchmark site you need to do a little puzzle to find the cache.  &lt;br/&gt;First count the total number of carriage bolts on both sides of the bridge.  The final number will be a 2 digit number.  Add these 2 numbers together and add that to the N coordinates.  &lt;br/&gt;Second count the number of posts on the opposite side of the bridge from the benchmark.  The final number will also be a 2 digit number.  Add these 2 numbers together and subtract that number from the west coordinates. &lt;br/&gt;Now you will have the coodinates for the PA Jasmer Watcher Challenge.  Remember,  it is your responsibility to do this cache safely. Disclaimer: You are under no obligation to hunt my cache. You do so at your own risk. Like any outdoor sport, it carries the risk of unforeseen hazards. Use your best judgment with the environment and conditions. As conditions and cache locations may vary, it is the responsibility of the searcher to be familiar with the conditions in the area to be searched, to adequately prepare for those conditions, and to conduct oneself safely and responsibly and remain within his or her personal abilities and limitations. Children should be well supervised. When and if you find a cache, you are under no obligation to touch it, reach it, climb to it, dig for it, pick it up, or even open it. Open it at your own risk. If food or drink is present, do not consume it, throw it out. &quot;Good Luck&quot; on this one.  There is a FTF prize in it.  Park at the Eckert Road Trailhead off of Elizabethtown Road.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now go and get it and don’t be afraid of the PA Jasmer Watcher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN3G8KJ - Sammydogs hiding place&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This series covers 10.2 miles and is intended to be hiked from
the beginning to the end. It can be completed in stages, but please
avoid the urge to drive to trail heads to save time. Just get a
friend to drop you at the starting point and pick you up when you
have completed the section. The series has been designed to
encourage through hiking.&lt;/p&gt; 

 
&lt;p&gt;The caches in this series are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP68 - Swiss Woods
(1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP69 - Snavely Mill
(2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6A - Hedge Apple Row
(3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6B - Green Pastures
(4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6D - Still Waters
(5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6E - King of the Road
(6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each log in the series contains a set of coordinates at the top.
You will want to keep a record of these points for future use.
Trust me, you'll be glad you wrote them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conestoga Trail system has its northern terminus at the old
Lebanon Pumping Station just off route 322 (N 40 14.666, W 76
20.198). The Horseshoe Trail also crosses the CTS at this point.
The southern terminus is located at Lock 12 in York County just
across the Norman Wood Bridge and off route 372. At this southern
terminus, the CTS reaches the Mason-Dixon Trail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section of the Conestoga Trail features the Snavely Mill
and takes a turn between the stream and a feeder run for the
mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a micro at stage 2 and a small at the final.
You might notice that I love Sycamore trees. They are often hollow
and you will see many of them on your hike. There is also a
swimming hole just below the mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to grab CT -
Coonville along the way. I hear that Russian Roulette - Anatoly Karpov
is near by as well. Might be a good time to talk to the CO if you
have not found that one yet.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h2&gt;Alexander Khalifman&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;FIDE Champion&lt;br /&gt;
1999-2000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander Valeryevich Khalifman was born in Leningrad (Saint
Petersburg), Russia in 1966. He was taught chess by his father at
the age of six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gained the Grandmaster title in 1990 with one particularly
good early result being his first place in the 1990 New York Open
ahead of a host of strong players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His most notable achievement was winning the FIDE World Chess
Championship in 1999, a title he held until the following year. He
was rated 44th in the world at the time, which some compared
unfavorably to &quot;Classical&quot; World Champion Garry Kasparov being
rated #1. Khalifman said after the tournament, &quot;Rating systems work
perfectly for players who play only in round robin closed events. I
think most of them are overrated. Organizers invite same people
over and over because they have the same rating and their rating
stays high. Perhaps in response, Khalifman was invited to the next
Linares chess tournament, and performed credibly (though placing
below joint winner Kasparov).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his trainer Genadi Nesis he runs a chess academy in St.
Peterburg, called &quot;The Grandmaster Chess School.&quot; There he trains
players from all over the world following the motto: &quot;chess =
intellect + character&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Boris Spassky&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;10th World Champion&lt;br /&gt;
1969 - 1972&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boris Vasilievich Spassky was born in Leningrad (Saint
Petersburg), Russia in 1937. He learned chess as a youngster in the
Urals where he lived during the Second World War. He became
international master in 1953, and junior world champion in 1955 and
received his grandmaster title in the same year. He won the World
Championship against Tigran Petrosian in 1969 and became one of the
most popular of all champions with his naturally polite, friendly
disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1972 American Bobby Fischer challenged Spassky for the title
of World Champion which was held in Reykjavik, Iceland. This most
publicized world championship in chess history took place during
the Cold War between the USA and the USSR. As a consequence both
players were under considerable pressure to win. When Fischer
defeated Spassky, 35 years of Soviet domination of the world
championship also ended. Spassky returned to his homeland in
disgrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this match Spassky continued to play at top level and won
the 1973 Soviet championship and other international tournaments.
He still plays occasionally today and is a frequent participant in
the annual Ladies vs. Veterans competitions.&lt;/p&gt;

coordinates! The coordinates are for suggested parking only.
Hunting is permitted in this area, so please be aware of the
seasons and applicable laws. Wear hunter orange during deer
season. &lt;br /&gt; This is the Mrs. of the six-pac. One night after solving Ratjam's

DOTS puzzle cache - GC1BP4C, I was inspired to place a cache
(my only other cache being Good Camouflage - GC180BN). Mr. Pac was very supportive, as he always is when I come up with an idea, and instantly began to improve upon my original idea. 
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But I like my idea the way it is.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
 &quot;I know, but this is BETTER!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
 &quot;No, its not, its more confusing and no one will get it&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
 &quot;What do you mean, no one will get it? EVERYONE knows______&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;*I* don't, and I don't really think anyone else will.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we decided to actually CREATE how the log would look, me
doing it my way, and he doing it his way. After viewing each others
ideas, we were convinced!!! The other HAD to be wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
So now, the battle is on. Since there is no way to prove which way
IS the best way without posting both, we started to talk about
launching two caches, to see whose would be found more often, but I
realized that there would be no closure to that. He would always be
saying &quot;In another week MINE will have more.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
So I suggested a duel… on the SAME cache. What you have before you
are BOTH our ideas. Both pictures will give you the same set of
coordinates… the question is which did you solve to find the cache?
When you find the cache, log which picture you used to get your
coordinates from (blue or red). For each person that finds it using
MY picture, I get a hit on his Battleship, and for each entry that
used his picture, he gets a hit on mine. We will see who sinks the
others Battleship first.&lt;br /&gt;
Because of the &quot;delicacy&quot; of this situation, we cannot offer any
hints or helps (Mr. Pac, I'm watching your cell phone logs!) until
one person's ship is sunk. The ONLY hint is that both of these are
codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not use PAF or similar methods to obtain the actual
coordinates. If you have solved this puzzle, please do not give out
the answer. I'm not going mention any names, but Mr. Six-Pac says
that he has observed some &quot;cheaters&quot; in the wild. Please play
fair!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; It would appear that the Mrs. is more
in tune with the Geocaching society than the Mr. as we see his
battleship has truly been sunk! So much for computer savvy puzzle
codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Since there has been such an outcry from the masses for a hint,
I will provide a bit of history:&lt;br /&gt;
 The &lt;strong&gt;Blue&lt;/strong&gt; code's first
known description was recorded a very long time ago by the esteemed
Mr. Pingala and is
currently in use worldwide.&lt;br /&gt;
 The &lt;strong&gt;Red&lt;/strong&gt; code originated
more recently in 1844, but
is not used very much these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Please hide as found so others may have the same fun.&quot; Remember &quot; it is your responsibility to do this cache safely. Disclaimer: You are under no obligation to hunt my cache. You do so at your own risk. Like any outdoor sport, it carries the risk of unforeseen hazards. Use your best judgment with the environment and conditions. As conditions and cache locations may vary, it is the responsibility of the searcher to be familiar with the conditions in the area to be searched, to adequately prepare for those conditions, and to conduct oneself safely and responsibly and remain within his or her personal abilities and limitations. Children should be well supervised. When and if you find a cache, you are under no obligation to touch it, reach it, climb to it, dig for it, pick it up, or even open it. Open it at your own risk. If food or drink is present, do not consume it, throw it out. &quot;Good Luck&quot; on this one.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This series covers 10.2 miles and is intended to be hiked from
the beginning to the end. It can be completed in stages, but please
avoid the urge to drive to trailheads to save time. Just get a
friend to drop you at the starting point and pick you up when you
have completed the section. The series has been designed to
encourage through hiking.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;The caches in this series are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP68 - Swiss Woods
(1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP69 - Snavely Mill
(2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6A - Hedge Apple Row
(3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6B - Green Pastures
(4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6D - Still Waters
(5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6E - King of the Road
(6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each log in the series contains a set of coordinates at the top.
You will want to keep a record of these points for future use.
Trust me, you'll be glad you wrote them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conestoga Trail system has its northern terminus at the old
Lebanon Pumping Station just off route 322 (N 40 14.666, W 76
20.198). The Horseshoe Trail also crosses the CTS at this point.
The southern terminus is located at Lock 12 in York County just
across the Norman Wood Bridge and off route 372. At this southern
terminus, the CTS reaches the Mason-Dixon Trail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section of the Conestoga Trail will take you through
privately held lands. You will see many No Trespassing signs. You
are permitted to hike on the trail, but please respect the land
owners and do not deviate from the path marked by orange blazes. As
you near Speedwell Forge Lake, you will pass through property
belonging to the Swiss Woods B&amp;B. They have many trails on
their property, but the one you are looking for will be close to
the stream past stage two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a micro at stage 2 and a camouflaged bison
tube at the final. Be careful extracting the container at stage 2
as it's placement is fragile.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Stage 1: Read clockwise from noonStage 2: SkulduggeryFinal: Six feet up</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

It really is a&lt;br/&gt;pleasant walk depending on how you come. You are looking for a&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;RED&lt;/b&gt; M&amp;M cylinder. This should&lt;br/&gt;not be too hard for very short people (like eight-year-olds). If&lt;br/&gt;you have not tried to find Liar's&lt;br/&gt;Cache, it's just up the trail a bit.

One person small, but if I would have had to pick one person I thought it would be, it would have been N0k1a... and it was. STF is not bad though. My GZ was a good 10 feet+ to the west, but had it been daylight (and not raining) I think I would have found it much faster.

&lt;h2&gt;Garry Kasparov&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;13th World Champion, 1985 - 1993&lt;br /&gt;
PCA Champion, 1993 - 2000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garry Kimovich Kasparov was born Gary Weinstein in Baku,
Azerbaijan, USSR in 1963. Kasparov learned to play chess from his
father who later died in a road accident when he was 7 years old.
He subsequently changed his name to Kasparov, a Russified version
of his mother's maiden name, Kasparyan. Kasparov's chess talent was
apparent at an early age. In 1973 he attended the Botvinnik Chess
School and Kasparov continued to make rapid progress. In 1975 at
the age of 12 he became the youngest ever player to win the USSR
Junior Championship. At 16 he won the World Junior Championship. He
achieved the title of Grandmaster on his 17th birthday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1984 he challenged the current reigning World Champion,
Anatoly Karpov for the title. This match was a hard fought battle
and lasted 6 months, the longest in the history of chess. It was
finally stopped by Florencio Campomanes, president of FIDE and a
rematch ordered. In November 1985 Kasparov won the rematch against
Karpov and became the youngest World Champion at the age of 22
years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasparov held the official FIDE world title until 1993, when a
dispute with FIDE led him to set up a rival organization, the
Professional Chess Association. He continued to hold the
&quot;Classical&quot; World Chess Championship until his defeat by Vladimir
Kramnik in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1996 Kasparov competed in a six game match against an IBM
computer called Deep Blue. Kasparov won with a score of 4 games to
2 games. The following year, he competed against an improved
version called Deeper Blue and was defeated 3.5 games to 2.5 games.
It was the first time a Grandmaster had lost a series of games to a
computer. He is currently the highest rated player there has ever
been in the history of chess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasparov's ratings achievements include being rated world #1
according to Elo rating almost continuously from 1986 until his
retirement in 2005 and holding the all-time highest rating of 2851.
He was the world number-one ranked player for 255 months, by far
the most of all-time and nearly three times as long as his closest
rival, Anatoly Karpov. He also holds records for consecutive
tournament victories and Chess Oscars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasparov announced his retirement from professional chess on 10
March 2005, to devote his time to politics and writing. He formed
the United Civil Front movement, and joined as a member of The
Other Russia, a coalition opposing the administration of Vladimir
Putin. He was a candidate for the 2008 Russian presidential race,
but later withdrew. Widely regarded in the West as a symbol of
opposition to Putin, Kasparov's support in Russia is low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the current coach of the world's number-one ranked player,
Magnus Carlsen.&lt;/p&gt;

This is just one possible
spot to park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is sure to be poetry in motion. You will enjoy a
lovely walk through the woods. You (or your monkey) will climb to
new heights. You will swing from the tree tops! You will have fun
and so will any good little children you happen to bring along.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cold winter days and lonely walks make me think of
&lt;strong&gt;Robert Frost&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Well, at least I like to think about some of his poems. I was
hiking along one day when I came upon a choice of paths to take.
One was new and thus I surmised, less traveled. I took this path
and thought about the poem as I walked along. This cache will help
you learn a bit about one of America's most famous poets.&lt;br /&gt;
You should do your research before heading out and you can only
find the cache legally during daylight hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage one coordinates are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
N 40 AB.CDE&lt;br /&gt;
W 76 FG.HIJ&lt;br /&gt;
AB: The last two digits of the year &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot; was FIRST
published &lt;strong&gt;minus&lt;/strong&gt; F.&lt;br /&gt;
C: Second digit of the day he was married to Elinor Miriam
White.&lt;br /&gt;
D: Last digit of the year his wife Elinor died.&lt;br /&gt;
E: Number of stanzas in &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
F: The number of roads in the yellow woods&lt;br /&gt;
G: The number of children born to Robert and Elinor&lt;br /&gt;
HIJ: X-(Y+Z)&lt;br /&gt;
X: The day of the year when he stopped by the woods on a snowy
evening.&lt;br /&gt;
Y: Robert Frost's age at death.&lt;br /&gt;
Z: The number of words in the first stanza of &quot;Dust of Snow&quot; plus
one.&lt;br /&gt;
You might want to consider actual dates and leap year in your
calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have included two of my favorite Frosty poems for you to
consider as you take a nice walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whose woods these are I think I know,&lt;br /&gt;
His house is in the village though.&lt;br /&gt;
He will not see me stopping here,&lt;br /&gt;
To watch his woods fill up with snow.&lt;/p&gt;
My little horse must think it queer,&lt;br /&gt;
To stop without a farmhouse near,&lt;br /&gt;
Between the woods and frozen lake,&lt;br /&gt;
The darkest evening of the year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gives his harness bells a shake,&lt;br /&gt;
To ask if there is some mistake.&lt;br /&gt;
The only other sound's the sweep,&lt;br /&gt;
Of easy wind and downy flake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woods are lovely, dark and deep,&lt;br /&gt;
But I have promises to keep,&lt;br /&gt;
And miles to go before I sleep,&lt;br /&gt;
And miles to go before I sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Road Not Taken&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,&lt;br /&gt;
And sorry I could not travel both&lt;br /&gt;
And be one traveler, long I stood&lt;br /&gt;
And looked down one as far as I could&lt;br /&gt;
To where it bent in the undergrowth;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then took the other, as just as fair,&lt;br /&gt;
And having perhaps the better claim,&lt;br /&gt;
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;&lt;br /&gt;
Though as for that the passing there&lt;br /&gt;
Had worn them really about the same,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And both that morning equally lay&lt;br /&gt;
In leaves no step had trodden black.&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, I kept the first for another day!&lt;br /&gt;
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,&lt;br /&gt;
I doubted if I should ever come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shall be telling this with a sigh&lt;br /&gt;
Somewhere ages and ages hence:&lt;br /&gt;
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—&lt;br /&gt;
I took the one less traveled by,&lt;br /&gt;
And that has made all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe there is a reason they still run away even in this park. You can never be too cautious when you're a deer. You do not need to remove the prop. Please just leave it where it is.

&lt;h2&gt;Vladimir Kramnik&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;14th World Champion&lt;br /&gt;
2006-2007&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical World Champion&lt;br /&gt;
2000-2006&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Kramnik was born in Tuapse, Russia in 1975. His
father's birth name was Boris Sokolov, but he took his stepfather's
surname when his mother (Vladimir's grandmother) remarried. As a
child, Vladimir Kramnik studied in the chess school established by
Mikhail Botvinnik. His first notable result in a major tournament
was his gold medal win as first reserve for the Russian team in the
1992 Chess Olympiad in Manila. His selection for the team caused
some controversy in Russia at the time, as he was only sixteen
years old and had not yet been awarded the grandmaster title, but
his selection was supported by Garry Kasparov. He scored eight
wins, one draw, and no losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, Kramnik played a sixteen game match against Garry
Kasparov in London, for the Classical Chess World Championship.
Kramnik won the match without losing a game. This was only the
second time in history that a World Champion had lost a match
without winning a single game. This event marked the first time
Kasparov had been beaten in a World Championship match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2004, Kramnik successfully defended his title against
challenger Peter Leko in a drawn match played in Brissago,
Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Garry Kasparov broke with FIDE, the federation governing
professional chess, to play the 1993 World Championship with Nigel
Short, he created a rift in the chess world. In response, FIDE
sanctioned a match between Anatoly Karpov and Jan Timman for the
FIDE World Championship, which Karpov won. Subsequently, the chess
world has seen two &quot;champions&quot;: the &quot;classical&quot; championship,
claiming lineage dating back to Steinitz; and the FIDE endorsed
champion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2006, FIDE announced a reunification match between
Kramnik and Topalov, the FIDE World Chess Championship 2006. The
match took place in Elista, Kalmykia. After the first four games,
Kramnik led 3-1 (out of a maximum of 12). After the fourth game,
however, Topalov protested that Kramnik was using the toilet
suspiciously frequently, implying that he was somehow receiving
outside assistance whilst doing so. Topalov said that he would
refuse to shake hands with Kramnik in the remaining games. The
Appeals committee decided that the players' toilets be locked and
that they be forced to use a shared toilet, accompanied by an
assistant arbiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kramnik refused to play the fifth game unless the original
conditions agreed for the match were adhered to. As a result, the
point was awarded to Topalov, reducing Kramnik's lead to 3-2.
Kramnik stated that the appeals committee was biased and demanded
that it be replaced. As a condition to continue the match, Kramnik
insisted on playing the remaining games under the original
conditions of the match contract, which allows use of the bathroom
at the players' discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy resulted in a heavy volume of correspondence to
Chessbase and other publications. The balance of views from fans
was in support of Kramnik. Prominent figures in the chess world,
such as John Nunn, Yasser Seirawan, and Bessel Kok also sided with
Kramnik. The Russian and Bulgarian Chess Federations supported
their respective players. Kramnik's behavior during the match
earned him widespread support in the chess community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After twelve regular games the match was tied 6-6, although
Kramnik continued to dispute the result of the unplayed fifth game
until the end of the tournament. On 13 October 2006 the result of
the disputed fifth game became irrelevant as Kramnik won the rapid
tie-break making him the first undisputed World Champion, holding
both the FIDE and Classical titles, since Kasparov split from FIDE
in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mikhail Botvinnik&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;6th World Champion&lt;br /&gt;
1948 - 1957, 1958 - 1960, 1961 - 1963&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mikhail Moiseevich Botvinnik was born in St Petersburg, Russia
in 1911. He learned to play chess at the age of 12. He was a Soviet
and Russian International Grandmaster and three-time World Chess
Champion. He is often considered as one of the greatest chess
players of all time. Working as an electrical engineer at the same
time, he was one of the very few famous chess players who achieved
distinction in another career while playing top-class competitive
chess. He also developed a chess-playing algorithm that tried to
&quot;think&quot; like a top human player, but this approach has been
superseded by a brute-force search strategy that exploits the rapid
increase in the calculation speed of modern computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Botvinnik was the first world-class player to develop within the
Soviet Union, putting him under political pressure but also giving
him considerable influence within Soviet chess. From time to time
he was accused of using that influence to his own advantage, but
the evidence is unclear and some suggest he resisted attempts by
Soviet officials to intimidate some of his rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Botvinnik also played a major role in the organization of chess,
making a significant contribution to the design of the World Chess
Championship system after World War II and becoming a leading
member of the coaching system that enabled the Soviet Union to
dominate top-class chess during that time. His famous pupils
include World Champions Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov and Vladimir
Kramnik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The puzzle:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Answer the following questions (use algebraic chess notation for
the first 4):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is queen side castling notated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What symbol is used to notate a move that captures a
piece?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What symbol is used to notate check?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What notation indicates that white won the game?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many dark squares are on a standard chessboard?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What shorthand notation indicates an excellent move?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what country did the precursor to chess most likely
originate?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Vasily Smyslov&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;7th World Champion&lt;br /&gt;
1957 - 1958&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vasily Vasilievich Smyslov was born in Moscow, Russia in 1921.
He learned to play chess at the age of 6. He learned much about
chess from his father and studied the chess books in his father's
library. Smyslov was an opera singer but made chess his career
after narrowly failing an audition for the Bolshoi Opera in 1950.
He once said, &quot;I have always lived between chess and music.&quot; and
brought music to his games. He once sang operatic extracts on Swiss
radio and during the interval of a serious living chess game
against Botvinnik; he sang to an audience of thousands. He defeated
Botvinnik in 1957 World Championship match but lost the title to
Botvinnik in the 1958 rematch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a Candidate for the World Chess Championship on eight
occasions. Smyslov was twice equal first at the Soviet Championship
(1949, 1955), and his total of 17 Chess Olympiad medals won is an
all-time record. In five European Team Championships, Smyslov won
ten gold medals. He remained active and successful in competitive
chess well into the 1960s and 1970s and he qualified for the finals
of the World Championship Candidates' Matches as late as 1983.
Despite failing eyesight, he has remained active in the composition
of chess problems and studies and he is currently the oldest living
former World Chess Champion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The puzzle:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Who is your teacher, he's lived very long.&lt;br /&gt;
It's true he's half blind, but he sings a nice song.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This challenge is for those, like us, who love to cache in old cemeteries.  In this challenge there are requirements that have to be met before you can begin your search.  Don’t fret about FTF, getting the requirements is what makes this challenge fun. As with all cemetery caches, PLEASE DO THIS CACHE BETWEEN DAWN AND DUSK, NO NIGHT CACHING!  If we find out you have done this in the dark, we will delete your log until you do it during the day.  Be respectful of where you are. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Requirements&lt;br/&gt;1.  Qualifying caches - Only caches that have the word cemetery, graveyard, tombstones, etc., or have a reference to them in the title, description or logs will qualify for this challenge.   &lt;br/&gt;2.  Post a qualifying public bookmark on this cache page of 100 or more qualifying caches.  This cache cannot count as #100, so your list must have at least 101 caches on it. We will post  our own shared bookmark of over 200 cemetery caches that we have found.  Add this cache to your shared list and then it will show up on this cache page.   Any questions, just contact us. &lt;br/&gt;3.  After posting your qualifying bookmark, go to the posted coordinates to begin your quest.  Here is a simple math puzzle to get the final coordinates which are within walking distance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do the puzzle &lt;br/&gt;Starting at the posted coordinates, look for a family who, from their name, would appear to have no money.  Using THIS FAMILY find -&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A = Count how many were born in the 1800’s&lt;br/&gt;B = Count how many headstones/plaques there are with “names plus dates” on them. &lt;br/&gt;C = Count how many W.W.II eagle plaques are there. &lt;br/&gt;Add A + B + C and multiply that answer times 3.&lt;br/&gt;That answer = D&lt;br/&gt;E = Count how many headstones that are with name only.  Multiply E times 2.  That answer = F&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D + F = G     Add G to the North posted coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;H = Count the letters in the arch above your head.&lt;br/&gt;I = Count how many driveways are there in and out of here.  &lt;br/&gt;H + I = J  Subtract J from the West posted coordinates&lt;br/&gt;Now go and get it.  Don’t be afraid of the cemetery watcher.  Please replace cache as found. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember ”it is your responsibility to do this cache safely”. Disclaimer: You are under no obligation to hunt my cache. You do so at your own risk. Like any outdoor sport, it carries the risk of unforeseen hazards. Use your best judgment with the environment and conditions. As conditions and cache locations may vary, it is the responsibility of the searcher to be familiar with the conditions in the area to be searched, to adequately prepare for those conditions, and to conduct oneself safely and responsibly and remain within his or her personal abilities and limitations. Children should be well supervised. When and if you find a cache, you are under no obligation to touch it, reach it, climb to it, dig for it, pick it up, or even open it.  Open it at your own risk.  &quot;Good Luck&quot; on this one.  There is a small prize for the FTF. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus, a second prize which is not in the cache,  will be available to the first person who posts and logs this cache with 200 cemetery finds.  It will be mailed or given to  you at an event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN3FPTJ - Cemetery Watcher Challenge&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

competitions, and of course the fair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plenty of parking is available here and the cache is a short
walk. This cache is hidden with permission and could require
stealth during certain events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Please Note:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Do not bother trying this
cache if it has rained in the past 24-48 hours or if the humidity
level is above 80%. I can pretty much guarantee that you will
&lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; be able to recover the cache if the area is
wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hints will be provided by request, but only after a posted DNF.
There are only a few places this one could be, so it should be
pretty easy for seasoned cachers. BYOP and please take care to
replace the cache gently so that other cachers can also enjoy a
successful hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

The &quot;No Trespassing&quot; sign at the beginning of the blue trail refers to the log cabin, not the public trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was placed during my walk up to the cache Five Hundred Steps.  The three other individuals with me stopped here to take a break before the big push up the mountain.  While standing here I thought this would be a great spot for a cache.  I hope you all enjoy it and use this as a great rest spot before the rest of your trip to get Five Hundred Steps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note the Hint is a spoiler will give you the exact location of the cache so do not use it unless you have to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK2KWEK - GC2KWEK Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 30.226 W 076° 19.043 </groundspeak:long_description>

I said no, i said im just looking for a way to get out of here, playing it cool you know!, and she tells me to  go down the road.....like i didnt know that! lol. i was just caching, i just didnt want her to know. oh well, tftc

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is an easy cache and dash... When you get there you will see
where you need to log your name and take a picture.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The 1st idea I had of this was not to even have a cache hidden here
to just go to the cords and sign &quot;THE LOG BOOK&quot; AND TAKE A PICTURE
OF YOUR GEOCACHING NAME AND POST IT ONLINE...I was informed that I
had to place a container here so I put a nano here also. This one
will be fun for the whole family. This is a nano cache you can find
and log. To log this one you need to take a picture of your (GEO
NAME) that you (log) at the above cords. YOU WILL SEE OTHER NAMES
EVERYWHERE. OR Take a picture of you and whoever is with you,
Pointing at your name you logged. You can log it anyway you would
like. 1) find the NANO...log it... 2) find the location and sign
the (LOG BOOK) and post a picture online of your name. We were at
the park and walked by this and I got the idea. Jeni and I signed
this many years ago when we were dating. This is signed with 1000's
of names, you may have already written your name on this...Here is
your chance to put you GEO NAME on it. It is completly ok to sign
this so have fun and enjoy. I will never have to replace the log
book as the park will REPLACE IT EVERY YEAR. Free parking Free
admission FREE entertainment and FREE picnic facilities. The park
closes at 10 pm during the peak season. Check out the posted site
for times and when it is open.(Do not try this at night AFTER 10
PM) VERY HIGH MUGGLE AREA GOOD LUCK NOT BEING SEEN WITH LOCATING
THE NANO. THIS IS REALLY NOT ABOUT THE NANO IT IS MORE JUST TO PUT
YOUR GEO NAME ON THE (LOG BOOK) AND TAKE A PICTURE TO POST YOUR
LOG. I left a hint for the NANO, now you may be able to pinpoint
the area so you should make quick work of it. You Need to find the
nano Too..&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Just bring a pen or better yet a sharpie...
And a camera to post your Picture..

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This Cache is dedcated to 2CATSNJ. They are one of the first
cachers we met while caching. We both started caching around the
same time. When we met them Jeni was very pregnant with Jordan and
we chated for some time. We remember that they shared some corn on
the cob. We have become pretty good friends through e-mail and we
have bumped into one another from time to time caching. It is
always nice to give a hint or get one on some local caches we can
not find. We have also met up with 2CATSNJ at 2 or 3 of the past
events, it is always fun to chat with them and talk about caches.
They are always looking to meet new cachers, very outgoing and nice
people. This is where the cache name came from, when they talk to
people you can almost always count on hearing. &quot;Hi, we're 2CATSNJ,
NOT FROM NEW JERSEY&quot; followed by their names. You will have to meet
them to find out there names. We have both hid alot of caches, and
are always looking to hide more. So this cache is hidden in true
2CATSNJ fashion. Please be respectful to those who are at rest
here, and enjoy this dedication to our friends 2CATSNJ. (FROM PA
NOT FROM NEW JERSEY) They also dedicated a cache to Jordan it is
listed below.

just had to do one too.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Not much to say, But this could be an easy cache and dash. This
micro only holds 2 small log books. A pen will be needed, to log
your visit. I did not hide it behind anything. It is in plain view.
As of 3-8-08 there are 2 caches on this thing, one side is how I
first hid it and the other side is the very easy side, big enough
for a coin drop. OIf you ca not find it go to the other side, then
repete youll get them both. enjoy&lt;br /&gt;

seen better days. I am not sure how much this is used but there are
trails through out the park. It is also posted so please stay on
the trails.(If You Can) You can use the grill for a cook out, or
just sit down for break. A really nice FTF PRIZE ENJOY&lt;br /&gt;

But when we opened to retrieve the log, that was interesting.  Very cool containers.  They fit the cache perfectly.  Thanks for another cool cache Joe, and it was great seeing you, Jeni and Jordan at the TGIF event in Lewisburg.  TFTCSL...

On our way down, we cached, despite the rain. We had a good time, and got a few caches. I put in 5 geotokens for a free geocoin from eatstayplay. 
I enjoyed this cache a lot....I do love the poop humor! ;)</groundspeak:text>

Squirrel Revival was muggled so I archived it, but I liked it so
much I took the time to replace it. But I placed it somewhere it
should not get muggled. Squirrel Revival 2 is near a church, there
is fishing (catch and release) close buy. No need to worry about
parking there is plenty close by. When you get to the parking lot
you will see the access area to the cache. It is a little path,
with some light bush wacking. For those of you wo had a chance to
get the 1st one please let me know what you think of this one.. It
is worth being the FTF&lt;br /&gt;

Once we found it, it was a question of how to get to it, then we figured it out right away.  We take our hats off to you guys to yet another awesome cache.  Took USA Mystery GEOCoin and left Harley II T.B.  This was our last cache for the day, and by far the best one.  TFTC...

stocked ammo can with a Unactivated geocoin for the FTF Wear good
shoes it can be slick at times.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Cache is not at the posted coordinates...Good luck..Not too
hard to get to the cache. The last 300 feet are the hardest. But it
is getting the right coordinates. Below I listed more the 300
coordinates, you will have to enter them all into a mapping
program. Google earth, Expert GPS, MapSource, or you can just put
them all into your gps but it is better to see it on a big screen.
After you type them all in you SHOULD see a picture (zoom in and
out to get a good look) You will need to use the hint to find the
right set of coordinates. Have fun !!!! This is my hardest cache to
date, let me know if I need to change it to a 5 star... There is no
true path, but there were plenty of ways to the cache. I made this
one alot harder then any of my other caches. I hope you enjoy it.

Being the first, what better place than the Visitors Bureau is there for it? From here you will find much information about area attractions and local events. After the Cache, Come in and say Hi.</groundspeak:long_description>

We were able to get caches in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and 27 PA counties including 20 new ones.  Mrs.uccacher was able to spot this one after a brief search.  Nice spot for a hide.

On our way down, we cached, despite the rain. We had a good time, and got a few caches. I put in 5 geotokens for a free geocoin from eatstayplay. 
I have been seeing this one on my cache radar, but never was able to do it. Glad i had the tools with me today. it was fun. thanks guys.</groundspeak:text>

Needless to say, we've had a great time and certainly enjoyed the views ... not many hills, much less mountains where we're from! 

After Mike's workshop, we teamed up with our good friends and CHN teammates Jemeeza for some caching in the Bloomsburg area.  This particular cache was a quick find for us.  We SLTNLN ... thanks for a fun break and adding to our adventure!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Welcome to the Bloomsburg Fair... This is in a magnetic Silver
hide-a-key. Be sure not to come when the Monsters are in town. Also
if it is Fair week you may have a hard time getting to this. (THE
LAST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER) CHECK THE POSTED WEB PAGE FOR THE INFO.
This is one of our favorite places, we met here and really enjoy
going for the food. Please replace the cache as you found it so it
will not get wet. Place the open end down. Thanks and Enjoy&lt;br /&gt;

Needless to say, we've had a great time and certainly enjoyed the views ... not many hills, much less mountains where we're from! 

After Mike's workshop, we teamed up with our good friends and CHN teammates Jemeeza for some caching in the Bloomsburg area.  This particular cache was a quick find for us.  We SLTNLN ... thanks for a fun break and adding to our adventure!

trying to place a cache here but could never think of a way to do
it without it being spoted. I think I may have done the job???
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is another micro (my smallest cach to date) Remember in school
when you used to compete in everything??? Like who could write
there name the smallest. Well here's your chance. There is no pen
please bring you own. If you find it the best thing to do is to
take it to the car, and then log it. When your done please put it
as you found it. new container, the other 3 containers got
muggled.&lt;br /&gt;

Needless to say, we've had a great time and certainly enjoyed the views ... not many hills, much less mountains where we're from! 

After Mike's workshop, we teamed up with our good friends and CHN teammates Jemeeza for some caching in the Bloomsburg area.  This particular cache was a quick find for us.  We SLTNLN ... thanks for a fun break and adding to our adventure!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is an easy C&amp;D it is more about the Container then anything
else. If you have done any of my other caches you should not be
surprised. I like to think up of new cache ideas and have alot of
them made up. The hard part is finding a place to put them. I have
almost as much fun making and hiding them as I do looking for
caches. You can drive with-in 10-15 feet of this one. Please be
respectfull to those who rest here. I have another cache like this
already hiden. I was here and when I saw the sign and where it was
located, it just struck me as funny. I already had this made as a
replacement for another one of my caches and it just happen to fit
this location too.&lt;br /&gt;

muggles everywhere, so be carefull. It is on our local campus. This
is a nice campus feal free to look around . Enjoy the
sites...Parking at times can be very hard to find.(good luck)
Depending on the time and the time of year this can have alot of
people around, but think about it and you can get in and out with
out being seen.&lt;br /&gt;

Needless to say, we've had a great time and certainly enjoyed the views ... not many hills, much less mountains where we're from! 

After Mike's workshop, we teamed up with our good friends and CHN teammates Jemeeza for some caching in the Bloomsburg area.  This particular cache was a quick find for us.  We SLTNLN ... thanks for a fun break and adding to our adventure!

Needless to say, we've had a great time and certainly enjoyed the views ... not many hills, much less mountains where we're from! 

After Mike's workshop, we teamed up with our good friends and CHN teammates Jemeeza for some caching in the Bloomsburg area.  This particular cache was a quick find for us.  We SLTNLN ... thanks for a fun break and adding to our adventure!

After Mike's workshop, we teamed up with our good friends and CHN teammates Jemeeza for some caching in the Bloomsburg area.  This particular cache was a quick find for us.  We SLTNLN ... thanks for a fun break and adding to our adventure!

level....
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Every time you look around there is something new going in
Bloomsburg. Banks, restaurants, gas stations. Well before I got
into geocaching there were not too many geochaces in Bloomsburg.
Now with 2catsnj and myself we have hidden quit a few caches. So
help us out with this cache. The cache is filled with 55 caches in
various containers. Some are just a film container, there are some
with camo tape wraped around them, there are also some with magnets
attached. So if you want too feel free to root through it and get
one you want to hide. I will replace the cache containers up to 50
after there are 55 hiden this will be just a Tb and a coin cache. I
may add mor containers as needed, Just for fun. That will take some
time though. I only ask when you take one to hide, that you include
BE in your cache name and the number of the container (A river view
B.E.#1 or spell it out.. Bloomsburg Expansion) however you want to
do it. This way I can find them to link to this page. You do not
have to leave the sticker on the cache you hide, it is just to keep
track of what one you have hiden. I think every container has a log
inside and a cache lable. I would like the caches to be hiden near
Bloomsburg.. I want to get alot of caches in the area so maybe we
can hold an event here at the Town Park.(down the road) In the log
book you can write down what cache you took. If you are from out of
the area and can not come to check on it, I will gladly check on it
for you if anything is wrong with it.(Just send me an email) Please
do not over tighten it. Otherwise the next cacher will not be able

Needless to say, we've had a great time and certainly enjoyed the views ... not many hills, much less mountains where we're from! 

After Mike's workshop, we teamed up with our good friends and CHN teammates Jemeeza for some caching in the Bloomsburg area.  This particular cache was a quick find for us.  We SLTNLN ... thanks for a fun break and adding to our adventure!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have so many caches made up, and I am going to try and place them
ASAP. Here is a new Idea I had made awhile ago. I hope you enjoy
it. It is a small cache and it should be very easy. Please return
it back like you found it.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This hide is a nano micro. Yea, we all love them. It is outside and
near the Berwick Armory. It is not placed on government property,
and please respect the &quot;No Trespassing&quot; signs. You do not need to
go onto government property to find this cache. Only contains a log
and you will need to BYOP. While there, reflect on those soldiers
serving overseas, and think positive thoughts for their safe return
home... &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is a regular size container. Terrain is good with a slight
elevation change.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cache contains plenty of trade items, including a TB I activated to
start its journey in this cache. Good sized round container which
is camoed. Coords are accurate to within 8 ft. This should be a
quick cache and dash. This is another cemetery cache. In fact,
there are two cemetery's here. Don't enter the one that says
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;&quot;no trespassing&quot;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Look for the road with the
enter arrow. Please make sure the lid is on tight and the cache is
hidden well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 There is a FTF prize for the taking. Congratulations to

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Nothing special about this one, Just a spot I passed by today
caching. I thought of the name as I drove past it. So, I turned
around to put a cache here. Just a lock and lock type container.
Please be respectfull to those that rest here, and pull in the pull
off area. There is not much room for parking but 1 car will fit
fine, I did not see any other place to park. There may be some
though??? You can be in and out in in just a few moments. Please
re-hide as good or better.... Thanks, Have fun....&lt;br /&gt;

Unlike Bre'r Rabbit there is nothing tricky
about this one. The cache is located in an area behind a business
and was placed with permission from the owner of the property. You
can use the business parking area while searching for the cache.
Please respect the owner and do not search for the cache at
night.
&lt;p&gt;Wander further back on the property and check out the pond or
sit in the gazebo and rest a spell. Please do not post photos of
the container or the hide location in your logs.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

close to Ithaca Road, many locals don't know where Ithaca road
actually is located. There are not too many hiding places near the
posted coordinates so this should be an easy find. The cache is
small with room for only very small items. This is my first cache
in what I hope to include in a &quot;Ithaca Small Park&quot; series of
caches. Please close the cache and place it just as you found it.
Cache has a terrain level of 2 only because there is not a paved
path to the cache though it is probably wheelchair accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container would be good for other very small coins.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;The
Florence Nightingale Pledge&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I solemnly pledge myself before God and in the presence of this
assembly, to pass my life in purity and to practice my profession
faithfully. I will abstain from whatever is deleterious and
mischievous, and will not take or knowingly administer any harmful
drug. I will do all in my power to maintain and elevate the
standard of my profession, and will hold in confidence all personal
matters committed to my keeping and all family affairs coming to my
knowledge in the practice of my calling. With loyalty will I
endeavor to aid the physician in his work, and devote myself to the
welfare of those committed to my care.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 This cache is dedicated to all the hard working Nurses out there.
The cache is stocked with heart charms. If you are or know a nurse
take a heart charm and pass it along to them. &lt;b&gt;The resident
COPY/REPLICA of the geocoin is on the logbook inside
cover.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The cache is hidden along the Finger Lakes Trail System in Tuller
Hill State Forest. The cache is hidden less than 30 feet from the
trail. Parking for this cache is off of Carson Rd. Take the white
FLT entrance. Trailhead coords N42'30. 202 W 076'06.730.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Far out in the ocean, where the water is as blue as the prettiest
cornflower, and as clear as crystal, it is very, very deep; so
deep, indeed, that no cable could fathom it: many church steeples,
piled one upon another, would not reach from the ground beneath to
the surface of the water above...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &quot;Ariel&quot; is the second in our series of Princess letterbox caches.
This cache is located off of the White blaze trail of the FLT
system in Tuller Hill State Forest. Parking/trailhead is at N 42'
30.938 W 076' 07.023 . You may loose your signal a few times on the
way to the cache. GPS accuracy was jumpy so be sure to check out
the spoiler pics and use the hint. You don't need to leave the
trail until you see the run off to the stream.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Letterboxing 101 -- Just a stamp, inkpad, logbook, and pencil. WE
WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE YOU USING YOUR OWN STAMP IN ADDITION TO
SIGNING THE LOG. You can get stamps and inkpads from arts and craft
stores. Seasonal stamps are often less than a dollar. We will be
taking photos of the nicer stamps in the logs and posting them to
this listing's gallery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Use the stamp in the box to stamp your logbook/journal or
whatever. LEAVE THE ARIEL STAMP, and the logbook in the cache. Take
only your stamp, your journal.You will need to bring your own
inkpad to this one as the Ariel stamp is a self inking stamp.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Any cacher who finds this cache may &quot;discover&quot; the COPY/REPLICA
Dorkfish coin that is a permanent resident of the logbook within
the cache. it is in the cover.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Be on the lookout for others Princess letterbox caches coming soon
in the Virgil area!&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;AP13HAX - Parking &amp; Trailhead&lt;br /&gt;N 42° 30.938 W 076° 07.023&lt;br /&gt;This is an area where you can park &amp; begin on your FLT hike to this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

contribution to the local efforts to round out the landmarks

&lt;br /&gt; 
Hope Lake
is a beautiful, man-made creation that will be part of the
expansion of the Greek Peak Ski Resort. This park has cross-country
skiing, picnicking, and swimming.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately,
it is open seasonally. This shouldn't be a problem for those
seeking this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please enjoy the

This is
our contribution to the local efforts to round out the landmarks
surrounding Cortland. Lime Hollow Nature Center seems like the
perfect spot to create a cluster of caches that showcase our local
scenery.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The
      Lemon-Lime Lizard wanted to get better acquainted with his
      new home and decided to wander some of the trails. He did not
      get too far because he couldn’t make his mind up which of
      three to take. 

&lt;p&gt;The black plastic micro
      container will require you to bring your own
      pen/pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
There is
      a bonus nearby for those interested in
      letterboxes.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Clue One: As he ponders which direction he is going, he has decided to hang out poolside.

Clue Two: Look for him in his swanky corner office.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

We decided not only to dedicate this cache to our wonderful animal friend, but to animals in general. To start off, we have stocked it with a few animal-related items in keeping with the animal theme.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Canal area has an abundance of wildlife all year long, including reptiles and migratory birds. I once stood and watched an osprey repeatedly dive for fish it spotted from high above. We'd love to hear about any wildlife sightings in your log, or better yet attach a photo!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We've had fun putting this cache together. Hope you enjoy it as well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NYS Permit #OEC-2012-001&lt;br/&gt;Town of Dewitt Permit #G06</groundspeak:long_description>

I am unsure where exactly the gate is on the road so am unsure how far of a walk you may have.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a small Lock N Lock with room for a small trade items and trackables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area is abuntant in waterfown and wildlife so bring your binoculars and camera..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are a Letterboxer you can grab our nearby LB of the same name while you are here.</groundspeak:long_description>

We use www.atlasquest.com.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to try and find this hybrid the letterboxing way then go to the above website and do a search for Picton, Ontario. Rose Museum should pop up in the results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The letterbox clue is also listed in the hint/spoiler section just incase you can't locate it at Atlasquest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area had one of the largest and oldest populations of German immigrants in the late 1700's.

Or so the reasoning goes.  Some of these folks won't get so many visitors these days, I was glad that I'd stopped by.  TFTC:)</groundspeak:text>

The container is small so please do not place anything other than coins or very small trackables.&lt;br/&gt;The cache needs to be covered well with camo so please replace as found and offer the next cacher the same experience of a good hide in the gnarly dude.</groundspeak:long_description>

Slip with this cache and play the Micheal Jackson moonwalk with this item if you like. Play with the little thing for the fun or take a snap of the kids enjoying the find. Photos with your &quot;hand&quot; inside the cache will be accepted but are not a requirement for a smiley...the cache is meant to be FUN.&lt;br/&gt;Well...it will be fun for those who discover what this last sentence means!&lt;br/&gt;You will be travelling on Wolfe Island off Oak Point Road towards Chubb Shoal. There is parking along the side of the road and all cachers should be without notice if it is done with stealth and respect for the neighbours. SHRIEKS might happen at this cache so be prepared to NOT CACHE AT NIGHT. I REPEAT...ABSOLUTELY NO CACHING AFTER SUNSET. This is a daytime cache as there is an area of little car traffic and after dusk the lights of cars will arouse suspicions to the folks who live on this road. PLEASE respect the community here as this island is a great place to visit and cache.&lt;br/&gt;Please respect any signage of PRIVATE LANES. There is no need to drive down any private road and the cache is NOT on private land. It is just off the side of the road in a dead fall zone.&lt;br/&gt;Cache is within a short stepping off point from the side of the road.In the winter there may be a snowdrift to leap but nothing that a winter cacher cannot do.&lt;br/&gt;Please replace the cache in a friendly, gentle way for the next cacher and try to have it nested in such a way that it can &quot;coccoon&quot; for a winter season.</groundspeak:long_description>

I have marked the terrain as a 3 but the first part is easy. Please be very careful when approaching GZ. This is where the terrain changes. Precaution should be taken in all seasons! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Croydon is a farming community known for its friendly residents, rich history, beautiful scenery, and small-town charm. In the early and mid 1900s, Croydon was a well developed farming community that featured several hotels, a general store, a church, a post office, a schoolhouse, and a gristmill. Although business and industry are currently non-existent in Croydon, many of the original buildings have been renovated and are serving as family homes. The main attraction is the beautiful Salmon River, which runs through the heart of Croydon. The river is used for swimming, fishing, canoeing, and kayaking. &lt;br/&gt;It was such a beautiful sunny last day of summer, Muggle Hubby and myself decided we would venture out and hide a cache. We knew exactly where we wanted to put it.&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a lock-n-lock container.</groundspeak:long_description>

the worst train wrecks in Canadian
History&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You are looking for a magnetic green
nano container. Stealth may be needed at times. Please put it back
where you find it.
&lt;p&gt;The stone memorial at the site reads as
follows...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;One of the worst accidents in Canadian railway history occurred
at this site at 8:43 P.M. on December 27, 1942. A special train
carrying Canadian soldiers for overseas service struck the rear of
a stationary train crowded with holiday passengers, demolishing the
three rear coaches. The number known to have died was 39, and more
than 150 were injured. Almonte citizens, military personnel,
railway staff and other volunteers from Ottawa Valley towns did
their utmost to help the doctors and nurses. The Almonte town hall
was used as a morgue, the capacity of the local hospital was
exceeded, and the O'Brien Theatre adjacent to this site was used as
a first aid centre. Most of the injured were transported by train
to Ottawa.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Good luck and have fun!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">THE CACHE IS AT THE POSTED CO-ORDINATES
&lt;p&gt;This is a Challenge Cache. If order to log a find on this cache,
you must first meet the below mentioned criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;***NOTE - IF YOU CHOOSE TO ENTER FITZROY
PROVINCIAL PARK AND MAKE THE FIND FROM A CLOSER VANTAGE POINT,
THERE WILL BE A $14 CHARGE PER VEHICLE, IF YOU STAY MORE THAN 1/2
AN HOUR.***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***NOTE#2 - I AM NOT SURE HOW WELL THE WATER
AROUND THIS ISLAND FREEZES IN THE WINTER. WHILE THE WATER ISN'T
OVERLY DEEP, IT MOVES QUICKLY WITH IT'S PROXIMITY TO THE HYDRO DAM.
IF YOU DO DECIDE TO ATTEMPT AN ICE CROSSING, PLEASE USE CAUTION AND
TRAVEL WITH A FRIEND.***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first started caching, I read on a forum about a local
cacher who had strung together 367 days of caching. I thought to
myself how difficult this would be. I tried and managed 11 days. I
kept trying, but could not manage to string together more than 7 or
8 days without something coming up that stopped my streak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one day I checked my stats and realized I was on a 9 day
streak and decided it was time to get past 11 days so I pushed on
through. Those 9 days turned into 10, then 11, then the next thing
I know I was at 50. After that, the streak seemed to take control.
I would say to myself, &quot;How can I stop now, I've come this
far...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to set up this challenge cache, even thought there is
one already in the area, I don't feel it exemplifies the true
dedication some may have for this game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In order to log this cache you must simply do 1 thing: Sting
together 100 days in a row of cache finds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can prove this by either sending a list of your finds to me
from over the 100 days, create a public bookmark list, or use one
of the many stats generators out there. If you don't have a premium
geocaching.com profile, we'll figure something else out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are logging this cache during a current streak, it CAN be
logged on your 100th day, but it CAN'T be the first find on that
day.&lt;br /&gt;
You have to have 100 consecutive days of caching, &lt;u&gt;BEFORE&lt;/u&gt;
logging this find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Because of the amount of work involved in logging this cache, I
will accept Current streaks, as well as previous streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need a boat to find this cache as it is on an island.
I've included the Co-ordinates for the public boat launch in
Fitzroy Harbor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be careful when approaching the island, as it is in
fairly close proximity to the Fitzroy hydro dam and as we all know,
water levels around hydro dams can change rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also attached a dymo tag to a tree very near to the cache
hide, if you find the dymo, your very close. You should also look
at the inside of the lid when you grab the cache. There may be a
quiz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Logs not meeting the criteria of this challenge will be
deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
On a completely unrelated note, I placed this cache while staying
in Fitzroy Provincial Park, and while I can't place caches in the
park boundry, I found an interesting place in the park, if you
happen to be staying there, check it out. It is an old grave
marker. I've included a waypoint for it.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;strong&gt;Cette cache est accessible en voiture, elle est à l'entrée du sentier #56 du Parc de la Gatineau.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Idéale pour ceux qui entame ou termine un randonnée dans le Parc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Ramasse-Poussière (Dustpan) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
En été, plus particulièrement par temps sec, le chemin Eardley-Masham se transforme en nuage de poussière, provenant du gravier du chemin. Remarquez les arbres longeant le chemin, ils sont couverts de poussière de roche.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Avec le temps, cette cache deviendra sûrement un ramasse-poussière, la camouflant encore davantage!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
La cache est en bordure du chemin. Faites tout de même attention!&lt;br /&gt;
Bon géocaching! 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Note : D'après les documents de la CCN, la cache est exclue de la zone de conservation intégrale dans ce secteur. </groundspeak:long_description>
