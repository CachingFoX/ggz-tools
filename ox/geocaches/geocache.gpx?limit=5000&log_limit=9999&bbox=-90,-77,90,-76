The cache is a 35mm container with only a log. This one will be hard to maintain so please be careful and use your geo-stealth
 

Princess Cays is located about 30 miles from Nassau, at the southern portion of Eleuthera Island. Two miles wide, this island retreat is a great snorkeling and dive spot. A coral reef surrounds the island. It is the epitome of the cruise lines’ private beach resorts with mangrove trees surrounded by spectacular white sand beaches. There are plenty of cushioned lounge chairs, beach umbrellas, tiki huts and hammocks strung in shaded areas to relax. </groundspeak:long_description>

If you don't get torn up by some sort of briar you are probably in the wrong place.
Sometimes love is painful.
You might watch out for snakes and bugs.
Sometimes love &quot;bites&quot;.
And then you will find love... and it will make it worth the pain and suffering!


A themed cache.
If you take something out, please replace it with something that you deem worthy.
The love you give is what you get back.

Not far off the beaten path but is full of the things we wish we didn't have to go through to retrieve a cache.
It's not worth having if it's easy!

Remember to obey park rules.
Wear bug repellent, carry a walking stick.

Larger craft may not be able to negotiate the water hazards.
It is a container large enough to hold specifically sized TB,PT's and small swag.

The cache is surrounded by water.
Watch the wind for the proper water height to reach the cache easily.

The number 13 has been associated with bad luck at least since Roman times. The 13 people present at the Last Supper incorporates this idea, and it is still considered unlucky to have 13 people at a table. A coven of witches was supposed to have 13 members. The 13th day of the month is considered unlucky, especially when it falls on a Friday.
The number thirteen is lucky in Chinese because it sounds close to &quot;definitely living.&quot;

Subha Muhurtham days In 2011 May 13


Some cultures think &quot;13&quot; is unlucky some consider it auspicious. What ever way you consider this number is up to you. We like it and it has given us fun caches. Hope you have fun with them as well.
Look carefully around this lovely area and as always leave it the way you found it.

High muggle area be careful.

The difficulty really depends on what condition you are in and what you will do for a cache.
The muggle factor is high. Occasionally it is super high!

This cache is in a place where the local skateboarders practice the luge.
PLENTY of parking.
Hide this back exactly as you found it so others may experience the same pleasure/pain.</groundspeak:long_description>

Well camouflaged.
One of our favorite city parks.
Please observe the posted hours and watch out for R.O.U.S.

The three dangers of the Fire Swamp are,
The flame spurt, which should be easy to avoid because each is proceeded by a popping sound.
Lightening sand (keep your eyes open and carry a rope).
R.O.U.S......rodents of unusual size. I don't believe they exist but there were some piles of poop back there that made us say W.T.H.

Persistence pays off! FTF SOUTH TEXAS you rock! WOOHOO!

make sure you are wearing the right kind of shoes.

A large micro in a camo'd pill bottle. Swag and path tags inside.
Good balance a must, you will walk across a narrow &quot;spillway&quot; to the cache. Water on both sides of you.

This cache is designed for trading Pathtags. I am starting this off
with 5 of my personal tags for the F5TF, and several others that I
have extras of.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, if you take a Pathtag,
leave a Pathtag so that others can add onto their
collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Once you figure out the above coordinates you will
need to know the answer to the question listed below.. The answer
can be found on this website. I learned about this great thing we
all love by researching the history. I thought that it would be
cool to get others to do the same and maybe learn something they
didn't already know.&lt;br/&gt;
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RETRIEVE CACHE WITHOUT ANSWER.&lt;br/&gt;
The container does require a some amount of force to open as long
as you have the correct answer. Once you enter the answer pull
firmly on both ends to open the container. If the container is
still too difficult to open please let me know and I will conduct
some maintenance to make it easier to open.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
****What is the name of the person that coined the term
&quot;Geocaching?&quot;**** I have placed theCryptex in a large
plastic bag to help protect from moisture. Please ensure that you
put it back in the bag once you have logged your find.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN2C7GF - GC2C7GF Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ </groundspeak:long_description>

Please [b]DO NOT[b] park in the Cox Communications parking lot as their security is not geocacher friendly.  I have provided a WP for parking not far from the cache.

Cache is on business side of the fence, please stay out of the Apartment Complex. 
Cache is about 8 foot just inside the tree line(coordinates) and blends extremely well. 
For additional help,use the hint.

This is my first cache. It is a little smaller than the normal small size but can still hold small coins and TBs. This is a well cammo'd container that will be less difficult in the winter months.

This cache is probably right within your eye site. It is just well camo'd. You can drive right up to where you need to be to look for the cache.
PLEASE put it back exactly where you found it so the next cacher has the same experience.</groundspeak:long_description>

The &quot;Ivy Green&quot; by Charles Dickens

Oh, a dainty plant is the Ivy green,
That creepeth o'er ruins old!
Of right choice food are his meals, I ween,
In his cell so lone and cold.
The wall must be crumbled, the stone decayed,
To pleasure his dainty whim:
And the mouldering dust that years have made
Is a merry meal for him.
Creeping where no life is seen,
A rare old plant is the Ivy green.

Fast he stealeth on, though he wears no wings,
And a staunch old heart has he.
How closely he twineth, how tight he clings
To his friend the huge Oak Tree!
And slyly he traileth along the ground,
And his leaves he gently waves,
As he joyously hugs and crawleth round
The rich mould of dead men's graves.
Creeping where grim death hath been,
A rare old plant is the Ivy green.

Whole ages have fled and their works decayed,
And nations have scattered been;
But the stout old Ivy shall never fade,
From its hale and hearty green.
The brave old plant, in its lonely days,
Shall fatten upon the past:
For the stateliest building man can raise
Is the Ivy's food at last.
Creeping on where time has been,
A rare old plant is the Ivy green.

&lt;p&gt;This Virtual  is
     located in York River State Park,
     located 11 miles west of Williamsburg. From I-64, take the
     Croaker Exit 231B. Go north on Route 607 (Croaker Rd.) for one
     mile, then right on Route 606 (Riverview Rd.) about one and a
     half miles to the park entrance. Take a left turn into the
     park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;York River State Park offers visitors an opportunity
      to experience the environment of a coastal estuary. This park
      is known for its rare and delicate environment, where
      freshwater and saltwater meet to create a habitat rich in
      marine and plant life. The main focus of the park is to
      preserve a portion of York River frontage and its related
      marshes while providing an area for passive day-use
      recreation for visitors. York River State Park served as a
      role model for all of Virginia’s state parks in developing
      resource management plans. The park’s natural resources make
      it a significant place for environmental education at all
      levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posted coordinates lead you to the trailhead
      entrance to Fossil Beach, which can be reached via the
      Mattaponi trail. At Fossil Beach you may find many examples
      of ancient fossils, from whale and dolphin bones and shark's
      teeth to shells of gastropods and mollusks, and even Corals
      and Bryozoas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of years ago this area was covered by a shallow
sea. As the sea receded, many rivers and streams were left to drain
the land, cutting in the layers of sediment that once made up the
sea bottom, exposing the many fossils of the ancient sea life that
once were in abundance here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone that wishes to keep fossils must obtain a permit
from the park staff. DO NOT DIG IN OR DISTURB THE CLIFFS. Only
collect from the shoreline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in the
town of Ewell on an island in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay.
Here you will find the best crab cakes, soft shell crab and a local
specialty, homemade 10 layer cake! Walk the quiet streets and see a
bit of Bay history. The island is dotted with old homes, a church,
museum and a few places to get a meal and ice cream too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a pen, camera and

To that end, this cache is the first Opencaching.com cache I have placed and the first in this area. Depending on the number of visits it receives I may place more. 

That aside, this cache is also part of a larger puzzle that is found on geocaching.com. While this cache (which is listed here exclusively) can be found independently of that cache, finding the final cache, Charity, will also require finding the first cache in the series, Faith (posted elsewhere). 

Finding Hope will require a gentle walk through the wooded portion of the park which sits at the intersection of Bayard and Sands Roads. The cache itself is well hidden with natural camouflage . Please take care when retrieving and replacing the cache when visiting. Thank you and good luck! </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">3068 / 1.  This is my first OX cache.  I was brought here in order to complete the CO's inter-site series.  This was my first stop and I spent about 45-60 minutes searching the wrong area.  I'd somehow failed to get the two OX caches loaded to my GPS and had to hand enter them.  I had my self 0.3 minutes north of GZ.  I left to find Faith and   then returned, thinking I had a better idea of what to look for.  After speaking to NetworkCacher, who'd returned my PAF text from my first visit, I rechecked my coords and noticed that I'd mistyped them.  Some days, I feel like a noob!

Great camo.  Even after speaking to NW, who basically confirmed my thinking, and getting to the correct area for GZ, it took me a little bit to find this.

Picked up trackable turtle and signed the log.

Thanks and Happy Trails!</groundspeak:text>

After I parked I checked the OX iphone app to see if any new logs had popped up.  Nope. So took the short, cold walk to GZ with a little more motivation.   As I approached GZ I got a little nervous this might be a tough hunt.  It did take a little while longer, but I had to smile when I finally found it and admired the owner's craftsmanship.  I grabbed the extra info, left a trackable turtle and carefully rehid the cache for the next finder.  This was a fun cache and I'm glad to see a good new one posted on OX.

*funny glitch today, this is actually the third attempt to log this cache.  The first from the iphone app failed, then I manged to delete the log online with an errant keystroke.</groundspeak:text>

Basically, the concept is simple. Go to ground zero and find the cache. However, the terrain (heavily influenced by the time of year) will be the greatest challenge.

The park sits at the western intersection of Bayard and Sands Roads but there is little more to it than the parking area and the two basketball courts nearby. The true beauty of this park, however, is in the grasslands that lie to the west of the parking area. A walk through the faint deer trails over the wild grasslands can feel oddly isolating but relaxing and remarkably scenic.

For those willing to go the proverbial 'extra mile,' there's also more here than meets the eye...</groundspeak:long_description>

I got very lucky on this one, which could easily have kept me out here for hours of searching.  I walked over from Faith, taking the two-track that rings the field.  I was also trying to avoid some ATVers, roaring around the field.  Came up the hill to GZ, which wasn't too bad.  I would never give this one a try during the growing season.  As it was, my heavy jeans and gaiters withstood the stickers and snags well.

I started with a systematic search once I got close.  That went on for many minutes until I got a bright idea and went back to check the description.  Oh, look at the coords...that's evil!  Change of tactics.  Managed to find a spot where I zeroed out and the coords were dead on.  Then I started carefully spiraling out.  In about five minutes I had the container in hand!  Man were those coordinates accurate, it was less than two feet away!  I left a signature and tried to tuck it back just how I found it.  Thanks for the fun!</groundspeak:text>

This cache should be challenging, that is at least what I hope. The cache size is straddling the fence of small and regular. To get to the cache you have to go up a somewhat steep hill, so do not attempt this cache if you don't have confidence in your athletic abilities. Enjoy the hunt! Please rehide as found.

There were caches hidden in Pilgrim Hills park across the street from Valley Mills and also a lot if you cross Fairland Road, at the end of the Valley Mill walk. But, there were no caches hidden in the actual Valley Mills park where we walk our dog a lot, so I knew I had to place one. Valley Mills is a very nice park. There is a little pond (some geese and ducks live there), swings, playground, fields, basketball court, and more, all along the walking path. It is not too long of a walk, but a nice one. The cache is hidden more towards the front of the park. The cache is a Sterilite box, which can hold small trade items, and small trackables. It is not a hard find at all. I call this the Friends Cache because we call this park the Friends Park. We know almost every person (and dog) that walks on that path. So, I hid this cache in honor of all our friends at Valley Mills park. The cache is near the pond, so stop off and see the geese and duck families after you find the cache. The cache is filled with keychains. I do not know why, but I filled it with keychains. If you can, take a keychain and leave one. The FTF prize is a wristband, treasure the words on it. Or you can just take a keychain if you don't want the wristband. Happy Hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I have always been fascinated with bases other than 10 when it
comes to numbers. This might be the reason I ended up as a computer
programmer. We are always using bases like binary (base 2), Hex
(base 16) or Oct (base 8). But there are bases for just about every
number.
&lt;p&gt;For instance...if you use base 6, then then you will only have
numbers up to 5...the number 6 is then represented as 10. Once you
get above base 10 (decimal), then you start using letters. In hex
(base 16) you represent the numbers 10-15 as the letters A, B, C,
D, E, F. So the number 15 is represented as F and the number 16 is
represented as 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a base, other than 10, to disguise the coordinates for
the cache and the result is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only used one base for all of the conversions. To be
clear...if the North coordinates are represented as N DD MM.NNN I
converted DD as one number, MM as one number and NNN as one number.
Then I did the same with the other set of coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final is located here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;N 43 14.117


W 084 44.183&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before you head off to a field in the middle of
Michigan...please use the coordinate checker below to verify you
have the correct location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final is only a short - but possibly difficult - walk from
the listed coordinates. Please be mindful of the white tipped posts
and do not cross the property line. The final is located near the
line but not over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any logs that post the base, in any form, will be deleted.
Sorry...it should be fun for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty rating takes into consideration the puzzle and
the final hide, which is not overly easy in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please return the container to the same spot you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to sfcchaz for FTF honors
and his 100th FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>You can drive to the listed coordinates for this cache and you will find a binary number listed there.  Convert the binary number to a decimal (base 10).  Now convert 1000 to decimal and subtract it from the first number and that will be the base you need to convert the coordinates.  You can see this binary number from your car (think yellow).  This is also a reasonable place to park for the final.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;It is easy to get close to this cache, but the final 30-50 feet
will require a small hill climb, bushwhacking (thick in the
summer), lots of thorns (even in winter) and a reach up. I am 6'1&quot;
and I needed to reach to place this one. It can be seen, from the
correct angle, from ground level. There is an assist at GZ so that
the reach is possible for some one shorter, but you have been
warned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please do not pull this down if you can not replace
it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache was placed a few days before the Ravens are to play
the Colts in the AFC Divisional Playoffs in the 2009/10 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hurts that we have not beaten them...especailly when it comes
to big games. So I am placing this cache in the hopes that it will
change that luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I hope this cache brings them luck, any time I have put or
taken Ravens items in a cache, they have lost the next weekend. So
beyond the description, there are no other Ravens refrences in the
cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Container is a round plastic tube that, in a former life, held 5
small tubs of crystal lite. It is covered in camo tape. There is a
pen, but don't count on it working...especially in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is snow cover, you should not attempt this cache.
First, it will make it almost impossible to attempt to reach it.
Second, your trail will lead muggles right to it...and we would not
want that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No hints on this one unless I see there are too many issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to redleg7 on the quick FTF!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and happy caching!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As some of you know, I am an amateur astronomer. About 15 years ago
I was introduced to a rather quirky fellow at a monthly meeting of
my astronomy club.
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few years we would meet occasionally to observe
and talk about astronomy. During those discussions, I noticed that
he had some strange names for some of the well know constellations
and stars. He always understood my names, but would then use his
own to describe the same object. I also noticed that he would
disappear for months on end, and would then pop back up and be
around all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, while attending the Black Forrest Star Party, in PA, he
showed up out of the blue. He told me that we was getting ready to
leave and needed me to write some things down and keep them safe.
At least until he returned. I agreed and he told me one wild story
about aliens and pirates and space ships and all sorts of odd
things. I smiled and figured my friend was out of his mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was done weaving this tale, he had me write down some
coordinates. Not being a geocacher nor, at this time, even owning a
GPS...I really did not know what to make of them. But I wrote them
down along with a few other notes and he seemed satisfied. I put
the paper in some of my observing logs and wished him well on his
journey. He seemed a bit sad as he departed...but as I said...he
was a bit quirky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched as he walked across the observing field and slipped
across the street into the darkness. A few minutes later I saw his
headlights head up the road to the North...towards
Coudersport...and then he was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back to observing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 45 minutes later murmurs started to fill the observing
field. And as everyone watched one of the most spectacular auroras,
that anyone could remember, exploded across the sky. It was visible
as far south as Florida and Texas. The background (and gallery)
image is one I took of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never saw him again...and to be honest...I completely forgot
about the information he gave me until about a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking through some of my old astronomy stuff and found
the notes I had jotted down along with the coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I am deeply involved in Geocaching and I own several
GPSr's, the coordinates held some intrigue for me. Not only
that...the coordinates he had me write down seemed to be at key
points around Liberty reservoir and were close to my home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the other day I found myself wandering around Liberty
reservoir looking for what? I was not sure until I looked up and
there was my answer. A laminated card attached to a tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out...he is not quite as crazy as I might of first
thought. I am also starting to think that his stories might be
true. I just wonder if that aurora was related to him leaving.
Hmmm...still not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The card on the tree was a picture of a constellation with one
star circled. Through a little detective work, I have figured out
that the information represents a number...but right now I am not
sure what this might mean or how I might use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only guess that at the other locations I will find
something similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my fellow geocachers love a good hunt, I decided to bring
you all along for the fun. But since I have the original
information, I get to find these things first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He left me a total of 5 sets of coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I find each site, locate whatever is there, and decipher it,
I will post it as a new cache. Since I am not sure if the original
coordinates have any bearing on this mystery...I am going to move
the caches to a nearby site and conceal it. That way, it should
remain safe, but is close enough that I will remember where the
original was located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coordinates for this cache are within 100 feet of the
coordinates he gave me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I am not sure if you need to find these in order or
not. The names of the caches are his notes that went along with
each set of coordinates (and apparently the clues).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows what we might find at the end of this process...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not going to make you go through the hassle of figuring out
the puzzle he left at each site. I will just include the number
that I worked out in each cache. Make sure you write down the
number...it must be important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sites are spread out around Liberty Lake...so it may be 2
or 3 weeks before I get out to the next site. So keep an eye out
for each one. Hopefully by the end of the summer I will have found
them all and have figured out this mystery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the time and are not too worn out...when you are
done...go back to the fire road and continue until you come to
another road snaking back to your left...very obvious...follow this
and you will come right out at the dam. You will get to see the dam
from the less accessed side. Worth the short hike from the
cache!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy hunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimers:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Do not go after this in the dark. - First parking will be
illegal and second with the terrain at GZ it could be very
dangerous.&lt;br/&gt;
2. Be careful as you approach GZ...the area is unsteady and there
are steep climbs and falls.&lt;br/&gt;
3. The terrain is listed as a 4 for a reason...the hike in is long
(about 8/10ths of a mile one way), and the last 200 - 300 feet are
bushwhacking and steep in places, depending on your approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ZigZagMI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For FTF Honors on this one!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK28REX - EH Cacoeg Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 22.550 W 076° 54.244&lt;br/&gt;Parking here is from Dawn to Dusk.   Parking at any other location is at your own risk.   Enough room for 3-4 cars.   Do not park in the driveway next to this access area and do no block the fire road.&lt;br/&gt;RF28REX - EH Cacoeg Dino Head&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 22.616 W 076° 53.633&lt;br/&gt;At this location you will find a rock that both me and my daughter thought looked like a dino head.   Can you see the eye and the nose?

Anyway...this is a good point to leave the fire trail and head towards GZ.

There are other ways to get there...this is just the one that has a good marker and seems to work well.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>1.  Easiest approach has you leaving the fire road trail at the dino head rock (see the way point).
2.  There are a ton of places to look...you are searching for a cammo'd ammo can covered with rocks...this will become a problem once you see the location.
3.  As you approach GZ...look for one of the largest trees a the edge of a rock face (it will be on top), it sits near the end of a medium sized fallen tree.   
4.  Search the small cave (not really a cave...more of a small outcove covered by the rock overhang.

That's about the best I can do.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

But still had my trusty 60csx so decided to take the hike. found the first way-point with no problem and then on to gz. where the fun started. could not remember what size container I was looking for, and no hint. And there must be a thousand hiding spots around there (watch out for loose rocks). So looked and looked and looked and then there it was. opened it up and to my surprise could claim FTF. Sat and had lunch, and enjoyed the view. will have to come back in the winter when there is not so much foliage and you can see the whole lake. Thanks for hiding this cache really enjoyed the hike and hunt. Left TB</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located on the streetscape in front of the old Baltimore County Courthouse on Washington Avenue. GZ is easy to access on foot.

Named in honor of one of our favorite movie characters, and possibly the start of a new series. Keep your eyes peeled.
Sheriffs deputies protect this house of justice.

Located in the heart of the county seat, this cache is located in a muggle rich but scenic environment. There is no need to walk into the grounds of the courthouse, but the gardens are indeed worth a visit. While you're here, take some time to read the signs and plaques that are scattered in the area, which share some history of the courthouse, county, and honors the heroes of Baltimore County. While most people should have no problem plucking the cache from it's home, some may find it easier to use a stick or tweezers to dislodge the container for retrieval. There is parking-a-plenty, but free parking is very limited, but is much easier to obtain during the early morning and nighttime hours when street parking is free. These hours are also the best time to attempt the find, since the area is prone to very heavy foot traffic during business hours. Please try to put the container back where you found it so others may enjoy the search.

Any feedback regarding the coordinates or the cache itself, good or bad, are greatly appreciated.</groundspeak:long_description>

I believe, for some strange reason, that I can effect the outcome of football games with geocaches.

In reality it has not worked yet...but I am going to keep trying.

I have jinxed Indy and Pittsburgh...so now it is time to get another division rival...Cincinnati...it's your turn!.

Small lock-n-lock container - commo'd.    

Good Luck!

Please re-hide as well or better than you found.

Currently, when leaving the parking location, just before you get to the trail, there is an inactive but downed power line. Please be careful when in this area. BGE was contacted and they confirmed that the line was not active and that they are are aware of the issue. Even with BGE's comments, I would stay clear of this line.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Well...I did not pay close attention to where this one was. After
hiking into the fourth location, I could have just continued on to
this one.
&lt;p&gt;I checked the maps and figured this one was about equal distant
from the parking at Wards Chapel and parking at S. Lake Dr. So I
decided to come in from S. Lake Dr.. I needed to check on a couple
of caches along the trail and I wanted to go after one that I had
been working on for awhile and finally solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out...this one is much easier coming from Wards
Chapel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My GPS told me that the hike from WC to EH 4 was 1.89 miles. It
also showed that the hike from there to EH 5 was another .5 miles.
My hike last night...which included about a tenth of a mile
diversion for my side trips, told me I hiked in (one way) 3.16
miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went out, I hiked out Oakland Road to Deer Park and
headed back to S. Lake Dr. I can tell you two things about this
hike. First, it is not as bad as I first thought, considering it is
on the road. Second, the closest legal parking is about 1.5 miles
from the cache at Deer Cross Ct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be warned though...you will be walking, most of the time, on
well traveled roads. Use all precautions when trying to do this
hike from that location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you come in on the trails from S. Lake Dr. the topography of
the lake forces you to do a lot of twisting an turning and there
are some pretty steep hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suggestions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want the shortest route...park on Deer Cross Ct. and hike
in on the roads. (about 3 miles round trip)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want the nicest hike...park at Wards Chapel (about 4.5
miles round trip)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are working on any of the puzzle caches out here or you
just want the most challenging hike...park at S. Lake Dr. (about 6
miles round trip)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with the story behind this cache please
visit the first four descriptions in this series called EH Cacoeg - First Right (GC28REX),
EH Cacoeg - Left (GC2B8VG),
EH Cacoeg -Second Right
(GC2BW42), and EH Cacoeg
Not South (GC2CFXT). Because the story is long I will ask you
to read it there...and then continue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Not South, I looked up the coordinates on this one and
figured I could just about drive most of the way there.
Nope...there is a gate right before the fire trail you need to take
and no parking signs everywhere. The closest you can legally park
is out on Deer Cross Ct. It might work if you use a bike or if you
have someone drop you off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING: Do not park on Oakland Road...the
locals do not want cars there...there are no parking signs on the
whole road...and they will call the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go after this one last night after work. I had just
enough time to get out here and back before dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never actually been out on this spur before. I am betting
that, in the winter, there are going to be some spectacular views
of the watershed from here. I also came across about 20 deer on my
way out...so in the fall...it should be loaded with hunters as
well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular card was back to the normal hide style It was
attached about 10 feet up in a tree. For this one...the tree it was
attached to was a great spot for the cache. So I simply removed the
card and placed the cache near the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puzzle actually took me a few hours and some internet work
to figure out. But I finally got it. The solution is written on the
lid of the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK...from looking at what I have done...here is what I can
surmise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. My friend placed these clues at all of the cardinal points of
the watershed.&lt;br/&gt;
2. I have visited the 3 major tributaries for the watershed along
with the dam itself.&lt;br/&gt;
3. Some of the sites seem to be manufacturing or residential in
nature.&lt;br/&gt;
4. My friend liked to be alone and did not mind walking long
distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The first three clues and the information that went with them
seem to be the combination to a lock.&lt;br/&gt;
2. The second two clues seem to relate to coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;
3. I have some information about the last two clues that I have not
told you yet.&lt;br/&gt;
4. My friend gave me some information about the last location
without giving me the actual coordinates. Now that I have
everything...I would not have been able to figure out the final
starting point without everything.&lt;br/&gt;
5. If you have not found all 5, get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan on hiking out to the final location in about 2 weeks.
Depending on what I find there...and assuming there are no more
puzzles...I want to publish the final on Saturday - September 18th.
I figure me birthday would be as good a time as any to let you guys
in on the secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you have enjoyed these finds. I also hope you take the
time to go after the final. It should be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the hike or bike ride and good luck with cache. Terrain is
based on the 2 mile hike or long bike ride in...if you get dropped
off...terrain is at most a 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some feedback from Tomulus, I have added a trail head
waypoint below (N 39° 24.350 W 076° 51.696) for parking location 2.
Note that access to this trail head is down what appears to be a
private drive way. The private property actually begins just beyond
this trail head (you will see the markings on the trees) and the
drive way is actually shared right-of-way until that point. Using
this trail head will cut out a small portion of bush whacking that
can be rough in the late summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, please be mindful of all No
Trespassing signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ZigZagMI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For FTF Honors on this one!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;P22CFXW - GC2CFXW Parking 2&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 24.248 W 076° 51.666&lt;br/&gt;Second Parking area...good place if you want to go after 4 and 5 together.&lt;br/&gt;PK2CFXW - GC2CFXW Parking 1&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 26.104 W 076° 53.018&lt;br/&gt;One of two legal parking areas.&lt;br/&gt;TR2CFXW - Easiest Trail Head Entry - For Parking 2&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 24.350 W 076° 51.696&lt;br/&gt;The trail head next to the parking location, while convenient, is not the most direct route to the cache. There is a fire road trail head, on the other side of the bridge, further up what looks like a private driveway next to the parking area. The private property begins just beyond the trail head.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>This should be easy for an experienced cacher.

Just in case though...

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Hmmm...we are getting closer to a solution for this one. I am
getting very intrigued.
&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with the story behind this cache please
visit the first three descriptions in this series called EH Cacoeg - First Right (GC28REX),
EH Cacoeg - Left (GC2B8VG),
and EH Cacoeg -Second Right
(GC2BW42). Because the story is long I will ask you to read it
there...and then continue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well...I looked up the coordinates on this one and figured I
could just about drive right up to it. Nope...there is a gate a
good 1/3 mile from this one and no parking signs everywhere. The
closest you can legally park is out on Deer Park Rd...and that is
one nasty hike in. It might work if you use a bike or if you have
someone drop you off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING #1 - Do not park on Oakland Road...the
locals do not want cars there...there are no parking signs on the
whole road...and they will call the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now...I scoped this out and decided I would go over to Wards
Chapel and park at the fire trail head about 1/2 mile from Rt. 26.
It turns out to be a good fire trail all the way in. It is about a
2 mile hike (one way) to the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did this in the evening (before dark) and it was a great hike.
The hills are not too bad. There are a couple of muddy spots where
small streams cross the trail...but nothing that would suck your
boots off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now...when I got to GZ, I came up on what must have been an old
mill...but not THAT old. It appears to have been abandoned within
the last 30 years or so. The water wheel is actually metal and not
wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING #2 - The building is not stable. Do
not approach the building and certainly do not go in. This building
looks to be home to teenagers on occasion...so be cautious when
approaching the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder...this looks like it might have been usable in the last
few years. Could my friend have been using this pace for something?
Could he have been making something back here. Heck...you could
probably set off fireworks and no one would hear you...so who
knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me awhile to find this one...for two reasons.
First...with the hills and rocks...the GPS was bouncing something
fierce. Secondly...unlike the others...this one was not in a
tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I literally stumbled on it. It was etched neatly into a jet
black rock and then placed near the base of a tree. Had it been
near a trail, I am sure someone would have spotted it. But then
again...it was slightly off from the coordinates he gave me. I
wonder if someone else found it and had no idea what to do with
it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing. There was more than the clue etched into the
rock. There were some other instructions. I am not including them
here...but will post them in the final puzzle cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is getting exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get to this cache from either side of the stream. If you
find yourself on the wrong side...there are many places to cross or
there is a bridge right where it enters the reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING #3: Do not go up the road, past the
mill, from the reservoir. You will notice a tree with a yellow
stripe, almost parallel to the mill...this is where the private
property starts. The locals will call you on it as well. Stay close
to the mill and you should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WARNING # 4: DO NOT GO AFTER THIS ONE IN THE
DARK. THE AREA IS CLOSED FROM DUSK TO DAWN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again...since I don't want the find to be too hard, there is a
picture of the mill and a picture of the actual hiding spot
attached to this listing. Take a look at both before you head
out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please return this exactly the way you found it. And if there
are muggles around....please use stealth or come back another
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the hike or bike ride and good luck with cache. Terrain is
based on the 2 mile hike or long bike ride in...if you get dropped
off...terrain is at most a 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one left and then we find out what the mystery is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some feedback from Tomulus, I have added a trail head
waypoint below (N 39° 24.350 W 076° 51.696). Note that access to
this trail head is down what appears to be a private drive way. The
private property actually begins just beyond this trail head (you
will see the markings on the trees) and the drive way is actually
shared right-of-way until that point. Using this trail head will
cut out a small portion of bush whacking that can be rough in the
late summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, please be mindful of all No
Trespassing signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;C-Finder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For FTF Honors on this one!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;PK2CFXT - EH Cacoeg 4 - Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 24.248 W 076° 51.666&lt;br/&gt;Parking that will entail about a 2 mile hike (one way) to the cache...also gives you the opportunity to find the other two caches back here.&lt;br/&gt;TH2CFXT - Easiest Trail Head Entry&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 24.350 W 076° 51.696&lt;br/&gt;The trail head next to the parking location, while convenient, is not the most direct route to the cache.   There is a fire road trail head, on the other side of the bridge, further up what looks like a private driveway next to the parking area.  The private property begins just beyond the trail head.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>1.  Across the stream from the mill.
2.  Cross the stream just down stream from the mill.
3.  Stand on the large rocks with the mill slightly behind and to your left..and face the bank...
4.  Study the attached picture.
5.  This is completely hidden...but it is a big old ammo can.   Should not be too hard!</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;p&gt;When you find this cache, please pay
attention to exactly how it is hidden and replace it EXACTLY the
way you found it. Please make sure the rope used to attach it to
it's hiding spot is well concealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well the story continues and the mystery deepens. If you are not
familiar with the story behind this cache please visit the first in
this series called EH Cacoeg -
First Right (GC28REX). Because the story is long I will ask you
to read it there...and then continue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided I would go after the second location on the morning of
July 4th. I got up early because it was going to be a hot day and
after looking at some maps, I knew this one was going to be a long
walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got to the location, it appears that my friend may have
been living near this area for awhile. I found a fully functional
basketball court, lawn furniture, tiki torches, and recently used
fire pits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the card (again) attached to a tree very close to the
coordinates he gave me. This one took a bit more figuring to coax
out a number...but I did get it. It will be in the cache I
place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to put the cache in the area I found the card...but
since he has been gone for so long and this area looks well (and
recently) used, either he has returned or someone has taken it
over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will note here...be careful when going after this cache. I am
not sure what sorts are using the area and would not want anyone to
get vaporized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't suggest it...but if you must take a look at the
camp...it is on the southern side of the larger stream. The trail
to it snakes off of the fire road to the east about 50 -75 yards
from the stream. The b-ball court is about 60 feet in and the lawn
furniture is near the stream (but down from the crossing). If
someone is playing basketball here...you will know it! (I have
included some pictures of the sites)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to put the cache where the two major streams, feeding
the reservoir from the west come together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am placing this in the summer (when the growth is high). I
will revisit in the late fall to make sure this cache is still well
hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk in is about 7/10ths of a mile from two different
parking spots. Any other approach will take you onto private land
and is against the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there have been heavy rains or the water levels are really
up, the larger stream may be uncrossable. Due to this, and the fact
that approach is a bit easier, I am suggesting that you come in
from the parking area to the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But...if you are trying to get Solitude and/or Got Wood while
out here, then you will want to use the parking area to the
east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will put the coordinates for both as way points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not meant to be a nasty hide...but pick a nice day for a
fairly long (and hilly) hike. There is a small amount of off-trail
right at the cache site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last note...this trail is used extensively by horse back
riders. Be courteous and remember to yield the right of way to them
on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UFF298&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For FTF Honors on this one!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;P22B8VG - G2B8VG Parking - North&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 26.465 W 076° 57.009&lt;br/&gt;This is the Northern Parking location for this cache. 

To travel directly to the cache, choose the fire road that heads off to the right (as you enter the parking) and travels directly along the driveway.&lt;br/&gt;PK2B8VG - GC2B8VG Parking - East&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 26.060 W 076° 56.848&lt;br/&gt;This is the Eastern Parking location for this cache.   Use this parking if you want to go after Solitude and/or Got Wood at the same time.   

Be warned...if the water levels are high, you may not be able to cross the large stream very close to the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>1.  Don't try to come in from the stream.   Get in the area bordered by both streams (by crossing one of them).
2.  Get right to the point.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">WARNING: From September to January this is very
active deer hunting territory. Take all necessary precautions when
entering and searching this area.
&lt;p&gt;Since I could not adopt or transfer the
cache, I had to create a new one. If you have found this one in the
past you may re-log this cache. &lt;b&gt;But - to do so..you MUST sign
the new log in the final AND drop me an e-mail with a description
of the puzzles on all of the new ropes.&lt;/b&gt; New
finders do not need to send me an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Original Cache Description from
NCPositronics:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be prepared for a 6 mile hike along the
western reaches of Liberty Reservoir. The trail rolls over several
hills. Obey all 'No Trespassing' signs. Parking is at N39 26.294,
W076 56.252.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a five-stage multi. At each
stage, you will find the coordinates to the next stage on one or
two ropes, more or less in plain view. The final is a small
tupperware-like container placed out-of-view, but with a rope
dangling within three feet of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best EPE I got while scouting and
hiding this cache was 56 feet (this seems to be par for the course
around Liberty Reservoir), so use the coordinates to get close,
then look for the rope(s) using the hints below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE DO NOT UNTIE ANY KNOTS! (In
fact, some of the knots are reinforced by Gorilla Glue.) Three of
the stages can be taken from their perches for closer examination
(not true anymore), but please do not
alter them, and return them as you found them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow a minimum of three hours to
complete this cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some additional information from
me:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No Gorilla's were harmed during the
making of this cache!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for ropes that will
have clues to the next stage. You will need to decipher the clues
on the ropes to figure this out. Colors play a large role in what
you are deciphering. Don't make it too hard...it's not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don't untie any of the
ropes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please return the ropes exactly as you
found them. There are lots of folks in these woods and these ropes
tend to go missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the hike, the views, and the time
in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Hints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- 1 - There are zeros in the
answers/clues...look out for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- 2 - The last rope has something in it
that the other ropes do not...please be aware of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- 3 - Think accounting (Red -
Black).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- 4 - None of the ropes are in the
water and the hike should make sense as an out and back, 6 mile,
hike with a loop at the far end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- 5 - There are no decimal points
represented on the ropes...so if you see a dot...it does NOT mean a
decimal point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- 6 - On the first rope there is what
appears to be a double ring of red - this is not intentional. It
should be one solid ring..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UFF298&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For FTF Honors on this one!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Stage 1: hanging from limb by two large crossed logs. Stage 2: low, among downed logs.
Stage 3: on stick passing through forked tree.
Stage 4: approximately 1/2 mile from Stage 3, on downhill side of trail, between large twisting vine and trail.  In Summer...the twisted part is largely covered in undergrowth...look for it.
Final: The coordinates here are pretty good and bounce is low.  Get close, use your geosenses, and look for a smaller (well hidden) rope this time!</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I figured since I was bringing you out here, I might as well give

&lt;p&gt;Now...as with The Bunker cache, you do not need to dig or
destroy anything to find this one. It is in plain sight...but may
not be recognized as a cache container. And...while the actual
micro is the same as The Bunker...the container holding the micro
is NOT the same as The Bunker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking: N 39° 27.524 W 076° 52.475&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking for this is a little odd. Park in front of or to
the&lt;br/&gt;
right of the sign that allows you to park here. Do not park
in&lt;br/&gt;
front of the gate or anywhere near the No Parking sign. Once in
the&lt;br/&gt;
parking area, to get to the trail...as you face the No Parking
sign&lt;br/&gt;
the trail goes into the woods to your left. Follow it into
the&lt;br/&gt;
woods and then bear to the right and out onto the fire road
going&lt;br/&gt;
down the hill. Checking with DNR at Soldiers Delight, this is
legal&lt;br/&gt;
access to this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From the legal parking sign to the right (as you face the sign) is OK...just not in front of the gate - this will make sense when you get there.

Legal trail in is to the left of the no parking sign and then bear right to the fire road running down the hill.</groundspeak:long_description>

Once your by the bay make your way down to the shoreline path for a spectacular view of the sunset. There is plenty of space to sit in the sun and relax to the sounds of the bay.

A small lock and lock with waterproof log book is what your looking for. </groundspeak:long_description>

This can be quick if you know what you are  looking for.   It can also be a struggle if you are not so lucky.

There used to be a sno-ball stand in this corner of the parking lot.   But times being what they are...it has not been back for the last two summers.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the replacement for my original The Bunker, 515 cache
(GC2E98Y) that had to be archived. This is a brand new cache so if
you logged the old one, you can log this one as a new find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day, while waiting for my daughter to finish soccer
practice, I started playing with my GPS. I was exploring the points
of interest and one of the categories was &quot;Geographic Points&quot;. I
clicked on it and one that caught my eye was labeled The Bunker,
515 Ft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw where it was and thought I would like to hike there. So I
went home to look it up on line. Surprisingly, when I googled it,
it came up. There is not much information about it...or why it is
listed...but I figured there needed to be a cache there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So...today, I hiked out to the spot. It is a good hike with a
couple of good steep hills. Nothing too tough though. At the actual
location of the GPS POI, there was nothing but some dead wood. The
location is at an elevation of 515 feet (according to the GPS). But
it is not even the highest point within site. So I wandered up to
the top of the hill and started exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was not able to keep the original cache at it's location
at the top of the hill...I figured I would let you see both sides
of The Bunker. You will hike to the top and then back down the
other side to get to the new cache location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This container is home made is not at all obvious. Please be
respectful of the environment while searching. The cache container
is completely visible without uncovering anything. It may not be
obvious...but it is in plain view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the bounce here was pretty good, I will give you one small
hint. This container fits the general setting but upon further
examination it is a little out of place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and enjoy the hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking: N 39° 27.524 W 076° 52.475&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking for this is a little odd. Park in front of or to the
right of the sign that allows you to park here. Do not park in
front of the gate or anywhere near the No Parking sign. Once in the
parking area, to get to the trail...as you face the No Parking sign
the trail goes into the woods to your left. Follow it into the
woods and then bear to the right and out onto the fire road going
down the hill. Checking with DNR at Soldiers Delight, this is legal
access to this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For FTF Honors on this one!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK2FTGM - GC2FTGM Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 27.524 W 076° 52.475&lt;br/&gt;Do Not Park in front of the NO PARKING Sign. From the legal parking sign to the right (as you face the sign) is OK...just not in front of the gate - this will make sense when you get there.

Legal trail in is to the left of the no parking sign and then bear right to the fire road running down the hill.</groundspeak:long_description>

We have recently seen ducks, turtles, and frogs from this location.  

This is a community bridge with some foot and bike traffic.  Do your best to be stealthy.   There is no reason to bushwhack or get wet or look for the trolls.

Park on Stocksdale Ave just past the 795 overpass (N39 27.515 W076 50.160).   Please stay clear of the BGE power lines further down the road.  

No real trails in...only deer paths.  
 
One warning...if you stay out of the woods too long, you will encounter a fence.  It is better to enter the woods at the top of the hill.

This area is not &quot;Posted&quot; so you should take the appropriate precautions during hunting season.   You might understand why I mention this when you see the artifact that has been discarded near this cache.   

Hint:  The cache is not in or within 10 feet of the big blue thing!

Please feel free to send me corrected coordinates if you feel the need.   I took many readings, but with the bounce in this area, they were all over the place.   

FTF honors go to MRMALLETHEAD.   Nice (and quick) work!

Just know that the coordinates are pretty good and there is no need to approach the mortgage company that is close to this one.   In fact...make sure you stay on public property as you search.   

The house across the street from this cache used to be owned by the Hunter's.   The white house next to it used to be owned by the Lynch's.   I was good friends with Denny Lynch growing up and spent a lot of time at these two houses.

Mr. Lynch used to own a local shop (was it John Deere?) that is now a transmission shop directly in front of the large water tower in Chartley.   

We have all moved on...but I have great memories of playing in these two houses.

Enjoy the hunt.</groundspeak:long_description>

should use to get to The Bunker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I figured since I was bringing you out here, I might as well give
you a fairly simple cache. The others, that are on The Bunker, are
pretty tough.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The trick to this one is not the hide...but rather how to actually
get to the hide. You may find yourself backtracking about 50-70
feet to approach this without a struggle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and enjoy the hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking: N 39° 27.524 W 076° 52.475&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking for this is a little odd. Park in front of or to
the&lt;br/&gt;
right of the sign that allows you to park here. Do not park
in&lt;br/&gt;
front of the gate or anywhere near the No Parking sign. Once in
the&lt;br/&gt;
parking area, to get to the trail...as you face the No Parking
sign&lt;br/&gt;
the trail goes into the woods to your left. Follow it into
the&lt;br/&gt;
woods and then bear to the right and out onto the fire road
going&lt;br/&gt;
down the hill. Checking with DNR at Soldiers Delight, this is
legal&lt;br/&gt;
access to this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For FTF Honors on this one!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK2FTK4 - GC2FTK4 Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 27.524 W 076° 52.475&lt;br/&gt;Do Not Park in front of the NO PARKING Sign. From the legal parking sign to the right (as you face the sign) is OK...just not in front of the gate - this will make sense when you get there.

Legal trail in is to the left of the no parking sign and then bear right to the fire road running down the hill.</groundspeak:long_description>

No need to bushwhack.   Please be stealthy.   There is a lot of traffic, both pedestrian and auto, in this area.   There are also lots of young muggles around that would love to make off with this cache.

Can be accessed from the side walk with no problem. Be careful for muggles, not only the ones outside, but the ones inside.


Way to small for a pen.  Only a log.  Be careful to replace it as you have found it.


The hint will be a big help- but is not a giveaway.  Try it without the hint.


Have a fun time searching.

CACHE.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
There is a fence that you can not scale between the highway and the
cache.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;FROM SEPTEMBER TO JANUARY THERE IS
DEER HUNTING IN THIS AREA!&lt;br/&gt;
BE MINDFUL, BE CAREFUL, AND BE CIVIL!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There is active bow hunting in this area of the park. PLEASE wear
appropriate clothing (orange
blaze) when looking for this cache from September to
January.
&lt;p&gt;This area needs lots of attention. If at all possible...bring in
a trash bag and take out a load. I have been taking a bag out every
time I come and have not even dented the surface...but with all the
cachers out there...if we all do a little, it might have a big
impact. Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache gets it name from the smattering of large trees that
populate this little forest. As you walk through these woods, you
will see several of these old giants lurking. This one was not so
lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF prize may or may not be of use to you. I had an extra
delorme USB gps reciever for your computer or laptop. Legally the
software is not transferable (because I am still using it), but a
windows machine will recognize the GPS when plugged in. If you have
mapping software installed, it should work with this guy. If you
can't use it, leave it for the next to find. There is also a space
shuttle mission patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to UFF298 on the FTF honors.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

for stealth to retrieve.
&lt;p&gt;Here is the challenge. This cache will be muggled. If you are
seen grabbing this one, it will be snagged/removed...otherwise it
should go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will keep a tally of finds before it is muggled...can we get
more than 1?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you up to the challenge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember this is all in good fun. Even the stealthyest
among us get snagged sometimes. Just do your best and if you happen
to get caught...oh well...we start again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;FTF honors go to Sircurly..nice work...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Warning: This area is very active during deer
hunting season. Please use all precautions when searching for this
cache.
&lt;p&gt;Parking coordinates will be displayed (and
can be downloaded to a gps) when/if you are successful with the
coordinate checker at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise...you are
on your own for parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficulty rating is for the series and not just for this cache.
Since you will need to find five other caches in order to complete
this one...the difficulty rating is high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... &lt;b&gt;WOW!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put together all the clues along with one last piece of
information he gave me and went out after whatever the last thing
was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fully expected it to be a card with a telephone number or
something ridiculous like that...but instead...you are going to
love this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found was a locked box. There was a master lock on
it...so I bet you can figure what the first three numbers are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the box was a treasure map. Yes...a real treasure map.
There were also some codes printed on the lid of the box. It took
me a minute to figure out how to use it...but it quickly made
sense. I followed it and...well...I won't ruin the surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now...I can't bring you all this way and not give you the fun of
doing this...so I have made some copies of the map. I have set up a
way to protect them and even used his original Master lock to
secure them. While most people in the woods will not notice
this...with your GPS and being a geocacher...you will spot this
very easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once there, open the lock and retrieve a map. You may keep the
map...but please let me know how many you took in your log. That
way I will know when to go back out and restock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;NOTICE&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one laminated map that is secured to container...DO NOT
REMOVE THIS MAP!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a piece of paper and something to write with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in case this laminated map is the last one in the
container, please copy the map to your piece of paper...and make a
note in the log so I can re-stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;u&gt;INSTRUCTIONS FOR FIRST
LOCATION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright...you are going to need to know how to use the
information you were given in the first 5 caches to find the
maps/starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note...if at any time, while you are adding or
subtracting, you go higher than .999 or lower than .000, please add
one to the whole number or subtract one from the whole number
respectively...and keep going. ie....you have N44 24.987 and you
are asked to add .100, you would end up with N44 25.087.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the clue you received in #4 and add it to the decimal North
coordinates for this cache. We will call this Orion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the clue you received in #5 and subtract it from the
decimal for the West coordinates. We will call this Virgo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You are not done yet!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the three numbers you got from #1, #2, and #3. To that total
add 535. We will call this value &quot;The Factor&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add The Factor to Orion to get the North coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subtract The Factor from Virgo to get the West coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will now have the starting point for this cache ...you will
get all the other information you need to find the final at the
location you have calculated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BRING THE CODES YOU GOT FROM THE FIRST THREE
CACHES TO THE FINAL. YOU WILL NEED THEM TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE
MAPS.


If you have read the entire listing you will understand why and how
you will need them!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got to the final location, I was somewhat put back by
what I found. Let's just say that the stories my friend told me way
back at Cherry Springs were true. The only problem is that the
currency of the money he left is completely useless here. So I have
a lot of very pretty paper and a bunch of metal that appears to be
tin. I guess this is worth something somewhere...but not here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to make this one a good treasure hunt. The final was
originally stuffed with some nice items (ie. Ravens T-Shirt,
Astronomy items, some NASA DVD's, etc), so please try and trade
equally here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;C-Finder and BeerMoney&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For Co-FTF Honors on this
one!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was great meeting you guys at the final
and awarding the FTF prizes to you!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. Enjoy the hunt and let me know if you have any trouble at
all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Originally it was located about 12 closer to the road (when the road was smaller) but was moved during the widening efforts here in the late 50's.   At that point it was placed on the graded hillside and most expected it to disappear.   But it has lasted.

The container is not around the rock.    You will find the container a little closer to the road and low.

Please replace just as you found it.

Please park on the opposite side of the road and be careful crossing main street.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache will be extremely difficult (if
not impossible) to get to when the water levels are at their very
highest. This cache was placed in July after the water level had
dropped from the spring high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you untie the cache to retrieve it, please
tie it back in place. This is to keep it from floating away if the
water levels rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also...please return it well hidden. This
area has some visitors and if they spot this container it will
disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well the story continues and the mystery deepens. If you are not
familiar with the story behind this cache please visit the first
two descriptions in this series called EH Cacoeg - First Right (GC28REX)
and EH Cacoeg - Left
(GC2B8VG) . Because the story is long I will ask you to read it
there...and then continue here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a trip to Dallas for work so this one had to wait a bit
before I could go grab it. As it turns out, that might be a good
thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area appears to flood regularly and GPS reception is
horrible (at least right now - July).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did get to the coordinates and found the next card...as with
the others, it was attached to a tree. Now that I now what I am
looking for...the cards are getting easier to spot. But I can also
understand why others have not seen them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area made finding a spot for the actual cache a challenge.
I don't mean for this one to be hard...but due to the traffic in
the area (yes there are a lot of fishermen back here) I needed to
cover this one well. There is more information (if you are so
inclined) in the hint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again...please cover this as well or better than you found
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now...back to the story...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This card also equated out to a number. So that you understand
what I am dealing with...each card I have found so far has had a
picture of a constellation (stars) with one circled. If I look up
the constellation in my star atlas, the circled star has a number
next to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on what I find at the next two caches, I might include
the cards in a future cache so you can see what I went through to
decode the clues. Not overly difficult for an astronomer..but way
to hard for the average person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the clues he gave me, I have an idea of what these numbers
represent...but we will see. The next cache clue is a little
befuddling, but I will need to see what the card contains and that
might clear it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache will take you to where it all begins (well at least
where the reservoir begins at least)! This is the northern end of
the stream that was dammed to form the reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the winter you might actually be able to see the 140 bridge
and, if the water is high enough, the northern tip of the
reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick to this one, and the reason the numbers are fairly
high, is that figuring out how to get here (without a boat) is a
real trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't be surprised by the fishermen that are usually back
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also...the railroad tracks back here are active (but rarely
used)...so be careful if approaching them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, please be mindful of all No
Trespassing signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;C-finder &amp;


Beer Money&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For Co-FTF Honors (although Beer Money
admits that C-finder actually came up with the cache
first!).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>1.  This cache is no further in from the stream channel edge than about 15 feet.   
2.   This cache is on the ground and covered with brown thick grass and a small pile of sticks.   
3.  It is not obvious...but if you have found the second in this series and know what the rope looks like that was used to attach that cache...look for that color and you may spot it.   I could see just a little bit of it as I approached from one direction - not the obvious direction though.

This
cache is located on the grounds of the Grand Lodge of Maryland and
was placed with special permission. Please do not seek this cache
between 7pm - 7am or if the gates are
closed.

When
you find the cornerstone, look 12 feet to the North for another
&quot;cornerstone&quot; to find the coordinates to the final
&quot;cornerstone&quot;
&lt;br/&gt;

At
the close of the Civil War, the Grand Lodge of Maryland, the
governing body of Ancient Free and Accepted Masonry in Maryland,
commissioned architect Edmund G. Lind to design a new Masonic
Temple a block north and a block west of a building in the 100
block of St. Paul Street which they had occupied since the 1820s.
Lind drew up plans for a three-story marblefront building just
south of St. Paul's [P.E] Church, its first floor partially taken
up by shops and its two upper floors devoted entirely to Masonic
purposes. These multiplied as the number of Masons in Baltimore
grew, and when the building was gutted by fire on Christmas Day,
1890, the Grand Lodge seized the opportunity to expand its
facility, instructing the architectural firm of Carson and Sperry
to add an additional floor in the course of the rebuilding process.
The firm retained Lind's 1867 facade, but added an additional floor
above it. The result must have met with the Masons's approval: when
fire again ravaged the building in January, 1908, the Grand Lodge
once more called upon Joseph E. Sperry - by then a solo
practitioner - to restore their home to the splendor to which they
had grown accustomed and to enlarge it still further. Sperry this
time added two more upper floors, disguised by a Mansard roof to
look like only a single additional story from the Charles Street
side of the building. Among the ten meeting rooms available for
Masonic use were a Tudor Gothic one modeled on the Roslyn Chapel in
Edinburgh, Scotland, and another room which recreated the interior
of an Egyptian temple. The building also featured ornate lobbies, a
marble staircase, stained-glass windows, and rococo chandeliers,
pipe-organs, and two large kitchens. The Grand Lodge maintained its
headquarters here until 1994, when the shift of Masonic membership
to the suburbs finally decided it to move to the property it owns
in Baltimore County's Hunt Valley. The Charles Street temple was
put on the market, and acquired eventually by Baltimore attorney
and developer Peter Angelos. The building was then remodeled and
stands today as the Tremont Grand Hotel, however the cornerstone
was brought here for preservation.

Free street side parking is available on Bernadette Drive.  Look for the almost unreadable wooden sign that identifies the park.

This cache is at the bottom of a valley on Bernadette Drive that we used to bike down to as kids.  As you will be able to tell, you can get up some speed going down this road.  This &quot;park&quot; is rarely used except by kids walking in the woods or playing in the stream on hot summer days.  There is a small, unmarked trail that will get you to GZ, but it is often impeded by briers, so long pants and maybe a pair of snips will help.  When you get to GZ, you are looking for a camo lock-n-lock box.  You should be able to make the find without having to venture too far off the trail.  The container is full of swag (hopefully the FTF will find something inside to their liking).  Good Luck.

This is my first hide of anything larger then a nano, my first woods hide, and my first hide using only my cell phone.  Any feedback regarding the coordinates or the cache itself (good or bad) are appreciated.  I plan on seeing how this cache does here before trying a new hiding method in its place.



CONTRATS TO TEAMWOODSEDGE FOR THE FTF!  Enjoy the putty.</groundspeak:long_description>

You've all hunted a cache at one of these things before, so you should know where to head when you arrive at GZ. There should be no problem retrieving the container once you locate it, but some people may find a pair of tweezers or even a stick to be helpful. There is plenty of parking around, but muggles will be about, especially during feeding time and banking hours, so be mindful of that. Good luck and happy hunting.

Parking is available on site and there is no need to go into the roadway. The cache is small so bring your own pen. Please be mindful of where you step. Also, this area can be pretty busy around dinner time, so watch for muggles.
This is my first hide so any feedback (good or bad) is appreciated.</groundspeak:long_description>

I thought this would be a Great place for a cache ,it gets lots of activity all the time but not to much where the cache itself is hid so it should stay Muggle Free. The container is Great for Trackables and Swag....The FTF gets a Gold Dollar and also in the Cache is the &quot;Land of Enchantment&quot; TB....Please rehide this the best you can. Also if anyone can get better Coordinates please let me know mine may be a bit Soft but the will get you there....Enjoy!!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This hide is in honor of the water stop I have worked for the last two years at the NCR Trail Marathon put on by the Baltimore Road Runners Club.   This year was the 20th anniversary and I felt this little, out of the way, spot needed a cache since I spend so much time here.   

While the cache is not directly on the trail, it is a quick walk from the trail, on a paved road, to get to it.  Absolutely no bushwhacking is required, so this is a great one if you are running or riding the NCR trail in this area.   

You will also get a nice persepective of the stream and old railroad bridge back on the trail from this spot.   While you are here (and if it is not summer) you might see the remains of the old house up on the hill.   Local history says this was a hunting cabin but it seems a bit big for that to me.   Feel free to let me know your thoughts on it.   

One last thing of interest here.   As you come off the trail (or drive over it), you will see a sign that is the split for Hicks Road and Wilson Road.   You would think the change should be just beyond the bridge where the road makes a hard right, but this is not the case.   The railroad generally followed the river but at spots (like this one) moved away from it to keep a level grade or cut off sharp bends.   In this case the railroad became a property line and consequently the road changed names as it crossed the railroad tracks.   

Cache is a small, twist apart, telescope eyepiece case, covered in camo tape.   There is a log but no pencil, so please bring one along.

Please replace as found (not harder or easier).   This should be a quick find if lucky and real stumper if not!

Congrats to Ump35&amp;Bee and PaHawkEye for a shared FTF on this one.</groundspeak:long_description>

Ok I've added a hint and changed the difficulty level to many DNF's and it's still in the same spot as when I hid it...Good Luck

There is a Poker Chip keyring in the cache for the FTF.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located in Ernest Arlington Park. This is a wooded park located at the end of Orwig Rd in the borough of New Freedom. Parking is located at N 39 43.294 W 76 41.475. The cache is less than ¼ mile from the parking area. There are nice trails to within about 75 feet of the cache. Some bushwacking may be required depending on the time of year.

The cache is in a hole near the base of a large tree. The tree should be easy to find. While in the area be sure to check out the original Mason Dixon milestone #51. The milestone is located at N 39 43.263 W 76 41.608 and is only about 700 feet from the parking area of this cache. To find the milestone from the Park, drive west on Orwig Rd for about 1/10 mile, then turn south onto Keeney Rd. Go about 100 feet and stop on Keeney Rd where the macadam ends. The milestone is located west of Keeney Rd along the tree line beside the retention pond. The stone can be viewed from your vehicle. The milestone has nothing to do with this cache.

This song was sung by the men of J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry during the American Civil War.  Stuart was a cavalry commander known for his mastery of reconnaissance and the use of cavalry in support of offensive operations. While he cultivated a cavalier image (red-lined gray cape, yellow sash, hat cocked to the side with a ostrich plume, red flower in his lapel, often sporting cologne), his serious work made him the trusted eyes and ears of Robert E. Lee's army and inspired Southern morale.

On June 27, 1863, during the Confederate invasion, Dover was visited by a small squad of Jenkins’s cavalry.  These soldiers came here from Carlisle, being the advance of Ewell’s corps, part of which had proceeded as far east as Shiremanstown in Cumberland County.  They remained at Dover for a short time and then returned to Carlisle.  At this time Early’s division of Ewell’s corps was moving toward York and had encamped for the night of June 27, in the vicinity of Bigmount and Farmers Post Office in Paradise Township.  A few of Early’s men reached Dover on the morning of Sunday, 
June 26.  After spending a short time there obtaining provisions and securing a few articles in the village stores, they joined the division at Weiglestown, while on the march toward York.

Early in the morning of July 1, General J. E. B. Stuart’s cavalry division began to arrive at Dover.  This force numbered nearly 6000 men, composed of three brigades, commanded respectively by General Fitzhugh Lee, of Virginia; General Wade Hampton, of South Carolina, and Colonel Chambliss, of Virginia.  Stuart came to Dover from Hanover, passing through Jefferson, and York New Salem.  When he arrived at the last named place, he heard that Early’s division had fallen back toward Gettysburg or Carlisle and he proceeded to Dover.  After the fight at Hanover between Stuart and Kilpatrick’s Union cavalry, the Confederate commander was entirely cut off from communications with General Robert E. Lee’s army which on July 1 had open the battle of Gettysburg.

About 200 Union Cavalrymen, captured at Hanover and elsewhere, were paroled in the office of Dr. John Ahl at Dover.  General Wade Hampton superintended the parole of these prisoners, who then went to York.  Soon after the arrival of Stuart at Dover he ordered breakfast prepared for his staff, his brigade commanders and himself at the upper hotel on the west side of Main Street.  About 8 o’clock in the morning, these officers partook of a bountiful meal and while eating engaged in conversation about the stirring events then taking place as a result of the Confederate invasion into Pennsylvania.  While they were eating, army surgeons in an adjoining room dressed the wounds of several Confederate soldiers who had received saber cuts in the cavalry battle at Hanover the day before.  Stuart, Hampton and Lee maintained a composed dignity during the two hours that this large body of Confederate cavalry occupied Dover.  During the forenoon squads of mounted men, acting as scouts, were sent out in various directions into Dover and Conewago Townships and captured many farm horses that had not been taken across the Susquehanna.

Before leaving the hotel, General Stuart’s adjutant, who afterward wrote a biography of his commander, paid the hotel clerk,  George Dick, later a resident of York, for the breakfast they had ordered.  The money received was United States notes or “greenbacks” as they were called.  This was exceptional, for the Confederate invaders at other placers always paid their obligations in confederate bank notes, which afterward became worthless.
While these cavalrymen remained at Dover, guards were placed around the hotel so that none of the men would drink intoxicating liquors to excess.  In fact, neither of the two hotels had much whiskey at the bar or in the cellar.  A few days before, when the proprietors had heard of the approach of the enemy, all the brandy, whiskey and other liquors in their possession had been placed in the cellar of the United Brethren church built in 1851, within the limits of the town, and was never discovered by the invaders.

The three guides, citizens from the vicinity of Hanover, who had been forced to accompany the Confederates on their march to Dover, were now released and other guides pressed into service at Dover in order to show the Confederates the most direct way toward Carlisle, where Stuart then thought the Confederate forces were concentrating.  About the time that General Stuart, with almost the entire cavalry force of the army of Northern Virginia, left Dover for Carlisle, the battle of Gettysburg opened.  Early in the morning of that day, General Lee near Gettysburg dispatched Colonel Venable, his staff officer, in search of Stuart.  On his way toward York, where he expected to meet Stuart, he was intercepted by Kilpatrick’s cavalry, somewhere north of Hanover.  He rode up to East Berlin, and then proceeded toward Davidsburg, and as he approached the borough of Dover, he again saw at a distance a squadron of Union cavalry around the old Dover church.  He failed to find out the exact position of Stuart’s cavalry, thinking it was possibly then on its way toward Gettysburg.  Colonel Venable returned to the scene of battle and was compelled to report to General Lee that he could find the enemy but not their own cavalry.
Stuart had been without communication with General Lee since he had crossed the Potomac, almost within sight of Washington, on June 28.  He passed on to Carlisle but did not reach Gettysburg until the evening of the second day of the battle.  Some military critics claim that if Stuart had reached the scene of action at Gettysburg on July 1, the tide of battle on July 2 might have been in favor of the Confederate army.  He and his troopers rode on to Dillsburg, seemingly within hearing distance of the cannon’s road at Gettysburg, but he knew nothing of the battle until he got to Carlisle.

The train of 125 wagons which he had captured shortly after he crossed the Potomac River was driven through Dover on toward Dillsburg and York Springs and was delivered to the quartermaster general of the Confederate army, four miles northwest of Gettysburg on the evening of July 2.  This wagon train contained provisions and munitions of war used by the Confederates on the last day of the battle.

The detour that Stuart made through York County was one of the most unfortunate episodes to the Confederate cause during the Civil War.  This gallant soldier had won distinction for strategy on several occasions before, but his raid through Pennsylvania in 1863 will always be considered a military blunder.  He was killed in battle the following year in a brilliant charge against Sheridan’s cavalry, near Richmond, Virginia. (This might be an overstatement but I'll let it pass)

The coordinates lead you to a plaque about Stuart's raid on Dover.  To get credit for this cache you must tell me when the plaque was erected.

 I have driven past this site so many times and always wondered about it.  Tonight the Mrs mentions that she has always wanted to stop and check it out.  Her dad agreed that he too was curios about it so stop we did!  Not much to look at, but it makes you wonder what this area used to look like.

I stood here and wondered... Could Johnson have ever thought that his bones would be rattled day in and day out by ten thousand conveyances not yet imagined.  Did it ever occur to him that his final resting place would be smack in the middle of everything?  He never heard of a North-Going Zax and a South-Going Zax, but even so, his presence here has caused the same reaction.  Time just moves on around or over you.  I doubt he cares much.

I hope 150 years after they bury me that I don't have a hover strip over my grave, but by then, I guess I won't care much either.

Take care when parking for this one.  You might need to get there from Oregon Pike.  Please close the gate securely if you go in and be respectful.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Easy access 24 hours, but recommend Tuesday afternoon and/or evening to experience the full cultural &quot;flavor&quot; of this local landmark cache. 

 This is one of our favorite spots spring, summer, and fall.  Winter is a bit off season, but still a nice time to visit.  This is a micro cache with a log only.  Bring your own pen.  I recommend hitting this cache on a Tuesday when you have an hour or two to spare so that you can experience the rich flavor of this PA Dutch country tradition.  Tuesday visits will require the use of extreme stealth (see note below).  The name of this cache is derived from the old hiding spot.  The Verizon phone booths have since been removed, but the new hide is very close.

### Note ###
When I moved the cache to its new location, there was a bench there.  Now during the summer months there is a market booth blocking access to the hide.  Considering this seasonal weekly obstruction, I recommend avoiding fair weather summer Tuesdays for searching.  The stand is not there during fall and winter months.</groundspeak:long_description>

wanted to be, and you were happy for it too.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Kreider's Meeting House was built in 1859 and was part of
the White Oak District of the Dunker Faith. Today it is part of the
Church of the Brethren. According to an article in the Lancaster
paper, the cemetery is probably older than the Meeting House
building. Kreiders (or Kreiters as it was sometimes referred to)
was one of four Dunkard Churches in Penn Township, Graybills,
Gibbles and Longnecker's being the other three. It was built
&quot;near Cornelius Kreider's&quot; and is no longer used
as a Church, but is used several times a year for special
events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent vandalism of the nearby cemetery is good reason to not
look suspicious while searching for this cache. It has been placed
with permission, but do not look for it at night. Please be
respectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The property line for the home behind the structure actually
runs though the structure. With that in mind, there is no need to
search behind the building. In fact, you can narrow your search
area to the interior of this lovely location.&lt;/p&gt;

 Parents are not so fond of our rough riding hero though. His high riding days are mostly gone

never be as large as it once was. Besides, can you really trust a
guy who's name is &lt;i&gt;Twinkie&lt;/i&gt;?
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Twinkie propaganda - Twinkies by the
Numbers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;500 million: The number of Twinkies baked each year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10: The minutes it takes to bake a Twinkie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1930: The year James Dewar invented the two-for-a-nickel
treat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;150: The number of calories in one Twinkie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50: The number of recipes in the Twinkies Cookbook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7: The number of Twinkies needed to make the &quot;Patriotic Twinkie
Pie&quot; recipe in the Twinkies Cookbook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1: The rank of New Orleans in terms of per capita Twinkie
consumption compared to other cities in the U.S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1999: The year President Bill Clinton included Twinkies in the

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache has 6 stages and will take you through the Lititz area
to various historic locations. You should plan for about 1 - 2
hours to complete. Please do not attempt at night since a few of
the stages are not available from dusk to dawn. The final stage is
hidden with permission on private property. Please follow the
instructions at stage 6 and do not take any short cuts to the final
stage. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache was originally designed to be a Wherigo, but the
platform was just to buggy to support the amount of detail I had
planned. There is a ton of information that I have assembled to
accompany this cache. I have compiled it all into a
PDF file. I am including it here instead of at
the final stage because I think it would be useful as you progress
through the stages. It does contain some of the information needed
to complete the cache, and could serve as a spoiler. So be it. Play
the game as you like. The point is that you end up with a greater
appropriation of this beautiful area of our country. Things were
not always as they are today and it is good to remind ourselves of
this fact. Have fun and God bless America!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First four years on plaque at listed cache coordinates in order
of occurrence.&lt;br/&gt;
ABCD, EFGH, IJKL, MNOP&lt;br/&gt;
Q=E+L&lt;br/&gt;
R=O-C&lt;br/&gt;
Park at PD.CPP LH.IKP&lt;br/&gt;
Clue to next stage at PD.QRK LH.ENP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a sign that might discourage you from parking at the
suggested coordinates, but it is OK if you are visiting the
historic area. Use your own judgment according to your comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years on plaque in order of occurrence&lt;br/&gt;
ABCD, EFGH&lt;br/&gt;
P=H-D&lt;br/&gt;
Q=G-E&lt;br/&gt;
R=C+E&lt;br/&gt;
S=B-G&lt;br/&gt;
T=H-C&lt;br/&gt;
Park at: EP.GPB EB.EQR&lt;br/&gt;
Clue to next stage at: EP.QBB EB.PTS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proprietor is aware that visitors will be looking for this
object. He encourages your discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years on plaque in order of occurrence&lt;br/&gt;
ABCD, EFGH, IJKL, MNOP&lt;br/&gt;
Q=G+L&lt;br/&gt;
MH.QGK&lt;br/&gt;
EN.HOA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be careful here. People drive quickly along this road.
Parking further up the hill and walking down is my suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years on Plaque in order of a occurrence&lt;br/&gt;
ABCD, EFGH, IJKL&lt;br/&gt;
X=C-D&lt;br/&gt;
Y=J-L&lt;br/&gt;
Z=B-H&lt;br/&gt;
GX EK.GYZ&lt;br/&gt;
FY HK.ZLY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please park directly in front of GZ. The neighbor does not like
people in his driveway or on his property, but has given permission
for parking directly in front of GZ. There is no container at this
location to search for. You might not even need to get out of your
vehicle. Just solve the following puzzle to get the next
coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten individuals are noted on this plaque.&lt;br/&gt;
John, Matthias, Katharine, Matthias, Christian, John, Abraham&lt;br/&gt;
Jacob, Abraham, Christian, Katharine, Abraham, Brinser, Buehler&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a micro hidden here that contains the coordinates to
the final stage. There are also instructions on how to get there.
Please follow the instructions and do not take any shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final might be a bit NW of the given coordinates, but you
are looking for a camouflaged ammo can. It should not be too
difficult to locate.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

instructions... &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Manheim Train Station is a great place to train your
kids!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &quot;freight room&quot; is now a community room and museum. The
freight office and men's and women's waiting rooms have been
restored to original decor. The facilities are open to the public,
free of charge, on Sunday afternoons from 1-4pm from June through
September or by appointment. The station continues to be a popular
tour for school children who enjoy the history and the trolley ride
usually available with the tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the home of the Birney Trolley # 236. In 1990 a
derelict Brill Birney safety car trolley was obtained from the
Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. It was one of only a
small number of surviving cars of this type. Originally in service
in Lancaster, it was lovingly restored by Society members. Weather
permitting, the trolley is available for tours and short rides when
the station is open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no reason to climb on any of the cars. There are
neighbors across the street, so park appropriately and use common
urban stealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the puzzle:&lt;br/&gt;
40 AB.CDE&lt;br/&gt;

B = Number of telegraph (in clerks office window) + Q&lt;br/&gt;
C = Number of trunks on the first wagon&lt;br/&gt;
D = Number of barrels on the second wagon + Q&lt;br/&gt;
E = D&lt;br/&gt;
P = Number of bushel crates on the second wagon&lt;br/&gt;
Q = Number of steps leading to the clerk's office&lt;br/&gt;
R = Number of spokes on one of the wooden wagon wheels - 10&lt;br/&gt;
S = A&lt;br/&gt;
T = Number of spokes on one of the iron wagon wheels - E&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Great Ice Cream Challenge! &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cache is NOT at the listed
coordinates!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area is home to not one, not two, but THREE ice cream
shops! And if that wasn't enough, there is a chocolate factory next
door! And to add to your summer afternoon pleasure, you can take a
relaxing stroll through lovely Lititz Springs Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located at the following coordinates:&lt;br/&gt;
N 40° 09.ABC&lt;br/&gt;
W 76° 18.XYZ&lt;/p&gt;
Two of the establishments are on private property and the owner
would not be pleased if you wander around here after hours. There
is a sign telling you what will happen if you park here
UNAUTHORIZED. They even quote the law for you. QRST equals the P.L.
number.&lt;br/&gt;
X equals the number of large windows not counting the door at the
Pantry At Lititz.&lt;br/&gt;
YZ equals the number on the door of Freeze &amp; Frizz +
(X/2)squared&lt;br/&gt;
Apparently the doors have been replaced at Greco's Italian Ices
&amp; Homemade Ice Cream and the number is now missing. So AB
equals 49 + S + T.&lt;br/&gt;
C equals the last digit in the PA Code Title (not Chapter)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is within walking distance and will hold small travel
bugs and coins, but you need to bring your own pen. If you drive to
it, please do not park in the Wilbur Employee parking lot as this
is marked private property.&lt;br/&gt;
And one more thing... everyone says they end up in the middle of
nowhere, so if you find yourself in that spot, just walk north
about 40 feet and try looking near there. It's not a tough
hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the tastes of Lititz!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;p&gt;I used to come here for Sunday School picnics. We would have
peanut scrambles and play ball. There was a two seater outhouse
that I found interesting back then, but it is long gone. The
pavilion is still used quite often for family reunions and get
togethers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a ratjam special so that should be easy to spot,
but getting the cache could be another story. You might even need a
special tool of some sort. Have fun and be careful!&lt;/p&gt;

Only a limited selection of plants today but they are expecting a bunch of inventory later in the day.

This is my first find on OpenCaching. I'm impressed with the cache rating idea. Hope to see more caches published in the area. Added my Hawk Mountain Hike already and will probably add my Northern Corner of Berks County cache as well.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;p&gt;I drive by here twice a day on my commute. In the evenings, this
is a spot where people often cross the road and I just don't
understand why people walk so slow here. It's like they have a
death wish! Please be careful when you are finished searching and
back out of your parking space. And if you need to cross the

the beginning to the end. It can be completed in stages, but please
avoid the urge to drive to trailheads to save time. Just get a
friend to drop you at the starting point and pick you up when you
have completed the section. The series has been designed to
encourage through hiking.&lt;/p&gt; 

 
&lt;p&gt;The caches in this series are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP68 - Swiss Woods
(1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP69 - Snavely Mill

&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6E - King of the Road
(6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each log in the series contains a set of coordinates at the top.
You will want to keep a record of these points for future use.

&lt;p&gt;The Conestoga Trail system has its northern terminus at the old
Lebanon Pumping Station just off route 322 (N 40 14.666, W 76
20.198). The Horseshoe Trail also crosses the CTS at this point.
The southern terminus is located at Lock 12 in York County just
across the Norman Wood Bridge and off route 372. At this southern
terminus, the CTS reaches the Mason-Dixon Trail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section of the Conestoga Trail is mostly on the road. Be
sure to walk against traffic and be careful. An interesting feature
on this walk is the old mill on E. Meadow Valley Road. There is a
benchmark (KW0635)
in the front step of this building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a micro at stage 2 and a small at the final.
I will warn you that stage 2 could be tricky. I used an old CCCA
technique here. Be careful extracting the container so that it can
be hidden again. You might need let your fingers do the
walking.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

during hurricane Agnes in 1972. When you enter the parking area of
the church, look for the flood line markers on the posts around the
parking lot.
&lt;p&gt;You can often find ducks, muskrats and snakes around the stream.
This cache is on the church property with permission, so please be
respectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Hurricane Agnes Category 1 hurricane (SSHS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formed:&lt;/strong&gt; June 14, 1972 (1972-06-14)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dissipated:&lt;/strong&gt; June 25, 1972 (1972-06-26)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Highest winds:&lt;/strong&gt; 85 mph (140 km/h) (1-minute
sustained)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Lowest pressure:&lt;/strong&gt; 977 mbar (hPa; 28.85 inHg)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fatalities:&lt;/strong&gt; 130 direct&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Damage:&lt;/strong&gt; $3 billion (1972 USD) / $15.6 billion
(2010 USD)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Areas affected:&lt;/strong&gt; Yucatán Peninsula, western Cuba,
Florida Panhandle, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland,
Pennsylvania, New York&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurricane Agnes was the first tropical storm and first hurricane
of the 1972 Atlantic hurricane season. A rare June hurricane, it
made landfall on the Florida Panhandle before moving northeastward
and ravaging the Mid-Atlantic region as a tropical storm. The worst
damage occurred along a swath from central Maryland through central
Pennsylvania to the southern Finger Lakes region of New York, as
illustrated by the rainfall map below. Agnes brought heavy rainfall
along its path, killing 129 and causing $1.7 billion in damage,
with railroad damage so extensive it contributed to the creation of
Conrail. At the time, it was the most damaging hurricane ever
recorded, surpassing Hurricane Betsy, and it would not be surpassed
until Hurricane Frederic in 1979. Agnes was also the only Category
1 hurricane to be retired at the time, and one of 5 today (other
Category ones were Cesar, Klaus, Noel, and Stan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a three stage multi. All stages are within the church
property boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage one is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; in the greenery. Please do not
trample the vegetation. You can get to it without stepping on or
searching through the landscaping.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This series covers 10.2 miles and is intended to be hiked from
the beginning to the end. It can be completed in stages, but please
avoid the urge to drive to trailheads to save time. Just get a
friend to drop you at the starting point and pick you up when you
have completed the section. The series has been designed to
encourage through hiking.&lt;/p&gt; 

 
&lt;p&gt;The caches in this series are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP68 - Swiss Woods
(1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP69 - Snavely Mill
(2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6A - Hedge Apple Row
(3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6B - Green Pastures
(4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6D - Still Waters
(5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6E - King of the Road
(6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each log in the series contains a set of coordinates at the top.
You will want to keep a record of these points for future use.
Trust me, you'll be glad you wrote them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conestoga Trail system has its northern terminus at the old
Lebanon Pumping Station just off route 322 (N 40 14.666, W 76
20.198). The Horseshoe Trail also crosses the CTS at this point.
The southern terminus is located at Lock 12 in York County just
across the Norman Wood Bridge and off route 372. At this southern
terminus, the CTS reaches the Mason-Dixon Trail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section of the Conestoga Trail features a long row of
Osage
Orange trees. You will find hedge apples all along the trail
during October and November. They have a knack for repelling
spiders, so grab a few to put in the dark corners of your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a micro at stage 2 and a small at the final.
At the final you will become acquainted with the baying hounds of
Hackman's bend. They know you're there, you can't sneak past
them.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

disgusted enough to not even try it. So, as an extra challenge, if
you want to make this WORTH your EFFORT, you can park at any of the
following locations and bushwhack your way to GZ. Then you can feel
like you have REALLY accomplished something.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Swimming Hole Stroll&lt;br/&gt;

Lone Wolf &amp; Cub&lt;br/&gt;

Hey! You Sank My Battleship!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So there you go Vertumnis &amp; Klatch. Something for everyone!&lt;br/&gt;
If you want to minimize the bushwhacking and mail a letter, you can
park down by the Elm post office and huff it up the hill.&lt;br/&gt;
Common sense and stealth are in order. 
&lt;p&gt;The Building that the post office is in used to be a hub of
activity in this area. This is the old location of Bomberger's
Store. You could stop here and mail your letters, fill your tank,
grab some groceries, pay your utilities, stock up on ammunition and
firearms, buy new flooring for your kitchen, find a replacement
door knob and buy a hunting lisense all in one visit. On your way
out you could rent a cement mixer just in case Vinny was comming
over later in the evening.&lt;br/&gt;
Now were can you do that today?&lt;br/&gt;
Not at Walmart!&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Anatoly Karpov&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;12th World Champion&lt;br/&gt;
1975 - 1985&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIDE Champion&lt;br/&gt;
1993 - 1999&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anatoly Evgenievich Karpov was born in Zlatoust, Russia in 1951.
His early rise in chess was swift, as he became a Candidate Master
by age eleven. At twelve, he was accepted into Mikhail Botvinnik's
prestigious chess school, though Botvinnik made the following
remark about the young Karpov: &quot;The boy does not have a clue about
chess, and there's no future at all for him in this profession.&quot;
Karpov acknowledged that his understanding of chess theory was very
confused at that time, and wrote later that the homework which
Botvinnik assigned greatly helped him, since it required that he
consult chess books and work diligently. Karpov improved so quickly
under Botvinnik's tutelage that he became the youngest Soviet
National Master in history at fifteen in 1966; this tied the record
established by Boris Spassky in 1952.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 1975, a few days before his 24th birthday FIDE declared
him the World Champion after Bobby Fischer, the current World
Champion, refused to defend his title. Karpov was embarrassed that
he had acquired the title in this manner and subsequently played in
many strong tournaments to prove that he deserved to be World
Champion. He performed impressively and accumulated the finest
tournament record in history. He once said, &quot;To be champion
requires more than simply being a strong player; one has to be a
strong human being as well.&quot; He retained his title until losing to
Garry Kasparov in a controversial match in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1993 Kasparov rejected FIDE leaving Karpov to play in the
official FIDE World Championship match in which he defeated Jan
Timman of the Netherlands. However, his victory was over-shadowed
by the independent championship match played at the same time
between the current World Champion, Kasparov and British
Grandmaster, Nigel Short. Both Karpov and Kasparov won their
championship matches and both claim the title of World
Champion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Riddle:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A man's integrity can be determined by his words. Only the unbroken
ones count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Puzzle:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asperation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;istentialist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;piration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hilarating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;istentialist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pediency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;amination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aggeration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;citing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pediency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cluded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cruciating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;istentialist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Conestoga Trail system has its northern terminus at the old
Lebanon Pumping Station just off route 322 (N 40 14.666, W 76
20.198). The Horseshoe Trail also crosses the CTS at this point.
The southern terminus is located at Lock 12 in York County just
across the Norman Wood Bridge and off route 372. At this southern
terminus, the CTS reaches the Mason-Dixon Trail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section of the Conestoga Trail features the Snavely Mill
and takes a turn between the stream and a feeder run for the
mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a micro at stage 2 and a small at the final.
You might notice that I love Sycamore trees. They are often hollow
and you will see many of them on your hike. There is also a
swimming hole just below the mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to grab CT -
Coonville along the way. I hear that Russian Roulette - Anatoly Karpov
is near by as well. Might be a good time to talk to the CO if you
have not found that one yet.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h2&gt;Alexander Khalifman&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;FIDE Champion&lt;br/&gt;
1999-2000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexander Valeryevich Khalifman was born in Leningrad (Saint
Petersburg), Russia in 1966. He was taught chess by his father at
the age of six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gained the Grandmaster title in 1990 with one particularly
good early result being his first place in the 1990 New York Open
ahead of a host of strong players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His most notable achievement was winning the FIDE World Chess
Championship in 1999, a title he held until the following year. He
was rated 44th in the world at the time, which some compared
unfavorably to &quot;Classical&quot; World Champion Garry Kasparov being
rated #1. Khalifman said after the tournament, &quot;Rating systems work
perfectly for players who play only in round robin closed events. I
think most of them are overrated. Organizers invite same people
over and over because they have the same rating and their rating
stays high. Perhaps in response, Khalifman was invited to the next
Linares chess tournament, and performed credibly (though placing
below joint winner Kasparov).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his trainer Genadi Nesis he runs a chess academy in St.
Peterburg, called &quot;The Grandmaster Chess School.&quot; There he trains
players from all over the world following the motto: &quot;chess =
intellect + character&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Puzzle:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Boris Spassky&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;10th World Champion&lt;br/&gt;
1969 - 1972&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boris Vasilievich Spassky was born in Leningrad (Saint
Petersburg), Russia in 1937. He learned chess as a youngster in the
Urals where he lived during the Second World War. He became
international master in 1953, and junior world champion in 1955 and
received his grandmaster title in the same year. He won the World
Championship against Tigran Petrosian in 1969 and became one of the
most popular of all champions with his naturally polite, friendly
disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1972 American Bobby Fischer challenged Spassky for the title
of World Champion which was held in Reykjavik, Iceland. This most
publicized world championship in chess history took place during
the Cold War between the USA and the USSR. As a consequence both
players were under considerable pressure to win. When Fischer
defeated Spassky, 35 years of Soviet domination of the world
championship also ended. Spassky returned to his homeland in
disgrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this match Spassky continued to play at top level and won
the 1973 Soviet championship and other international tournaments.
He still plays occasionally today and is a frequent participant in
the annual Ladies vs. Veterans competitions.&lt;/p&gt;

coordinates! The coordinates are for suggested parking only.
Hunting is permitted in this area, so please be aware of the
seasons and applicable laws. Wear hunter orange during deer
season. &lt;br/&gt; This is the Mrs. of the six-pac. One night after solving Ratjam's

DOTS puzzle cache - GC1BP4C, I was inspired to place a cache
(my only other cache being Good Camouflage - GC180BN). Mr. Pac was very supportive, as he always is when I come up with an idea, and instantly began to improve upon my original idea. 
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But I like my idea the way it is.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
 &quot;I know, but this is BETTER!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
 &quot;No, its not, its more confusing and no one will get it&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
 &quot;What do you mean, no one will get it? EVERYONE knows______&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;*I* don't, and I don't really think anyone else will.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we decided to actually CREATE how the log would look, me
doing it my way, and he doing it his way. After viewing each others
ideas, we were convinced!!! The other HAD to be wrong.&lt;br/&gt;
So now, the battle is on. Since there is no way to prove which way
IS the best way without posting both, we started to talk about
launching two caches, to see whose would be found more often, but I
realized that there would be no closure to that. He would always be
saying &quot;In another week MINE will have more.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
So I suggested a duel… on the SAME cache. What you have before you
are BOTH our ideas. Both pictures will give you the same set of
coordinates… the question is which did you solve to find the cache?
When you find the cache, log which picture you used to get your
coordinates from (blue or red). For each person that finds it using
MY picture, I get a hit on his Battleship, and for each entry that
used his picture, he gets a hit on mine. We will see who sinks the
others Battleship first.&lt;br/&gt;
Because of the &quot;delicacy&quot; of this situation, we cannot offer any
hints or helps (Mr. Pac, I'm watching your cell phone logs!) until
one person's ship is sunk. The ONLY hint is that both of these are
codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not use PAF or similar methods to obtain the actual
coordinates. If you have solved this puzzle, please do not give out
the answer. I'm not going mention any names, but Mr. Six-Pac says
that he has observed some &quot;cheaters&quot; in the wild. Please play
fair!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; It would appear that the Mrs. is more
in tune with the Geocaching society than the Mr. as we see his
battleship has truly been sunk! So much for computer savvy puzzle
codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Since there has been such an outcry from the masses for a hint,
I will provide a bit of history:&lt;br/&gt;
 The &lt;strong&gt;Blue&lt;/strong&gt; code's first
known description was recorded a very long time ago by the esteemed
Mr. Pingala and is
currently in use worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;
 The &lt;strong&gt;Red&lt;/strong&gt; code originated
more recently in 1844, but
is not used very much these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

the beginning to the end. It can be completed in stages, but please
avoid the urge to drive to trailheads to save time. Just get a
friend to drop you at the starting point and pick you up when you
have completed the section. The series has been designed to
encourage through hiking.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;The caches in this series are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP68 - Swiss Woods
(1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP69 - Snavely Mill
(2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6A - Hedge Apple Row
(3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6B - Green Pastures
(4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6D - Still Waters
(5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC2HP6E - King of the Road
(6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each log in the series contains a set of coordinates at the top.
You will want to keep a record of these points for future use.
Trust me, you'll be glad you wrote them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conestoga Trail system has its northern terminus at the old
Lebanon Pumping Station just off route 322 (N 40 14.666, W 76
20.198). The Horseshoe Trail also crosses the CTS at this point.
The southern terminus is located at Lock 12 in York County just
across the Norman Wood Bridge and off route 372. At this southern
terminus, the CTS reaches the Mason-Dixon Trail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section of the Conestoga Trail will take you through
privately held lands. You will see many No Trespassing signs. You
are permitted to hike on the trail, but please respect the land
owners and do not deviate from the path marked by orange blazes. As
you near Speedwell Forge Lake, you will pass through property
belonging to the Swiss Woods B&amp;B. They have many trails on
their property, but the one you are looking for will be close to
the stream past stage two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a micro at stage 2 and a camouflaged bison
tube at the final. Be careful extracting the container at stage 2
as it's placement is fragile.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">    This is part of our Watcher series. This cache is located near a State Game Land trail. Warning - It cannot be accessed from the turnpike. Don't even try. Use the parking coordinates for the trailhead. It is an easy walk on mostly level ground. The terrain rating is for the last 300 feet in which you will have to do a bit of bushwhacking. As summer approaches, so will the jaggers. Shorts and flip flops are not reccommended. 
&quot; Congratulations to John, on the FTF &quot;



Have you ever felt like someone is watching you, well now there is, the Ammo Watcher. BYOP This cache has a twist. The log is hidden inside the cache container somewhere. After you have had the fun of finding the log, be sure to write down the code found at the top of the log and email that to us. The coordinates will be tricky as the overhead tree cover increases. Please hide as found so others may have the same fun. &quot;Remember&quot; it is your responsibility to do this cache safely. Warning - you must wear orange during hunting seasons while on State Game Lands. Disclaimer: You are under no obligation to hunt my cache. You do so at your own risk. Like any outdoor sport, it carries the risk of unforeseen hazards. Use your best judgement with the environment and conditions. As conditions and cache locations may vary, it is the responsibilty of the searcher to be familiar with the conditions in the area to be searched, to adequately prepare for those conditons, and to conduct oneself safely and responsibly and remain within his or her personal abilities and limitations. Children should be welll supervised. When and if you find a cache you are under no obligation to touch it, reach it, climb to it, dig for it, pick it up, or even open it. Open it at your own risk. If food or drink is present, do not consume it, throw it out. &quot;Good Luck&quot; on this one. </groundspeak:long_description>

Trail to console DNF victims from Liar’s Cache (or lure new prey). 

 The sole purpose of this cache is to help those of us who are
truthful, trusting, and/or blind to feel better about ourselves
after not finding Liar's Cache (700 feet west). It really is a
pleasant walk depending on how you come. You are looking for a
&lt;b&gt;RED&lt;/b&gt; M&amp;M cylinder. This should
not be too hard for very short people (like eight-year-olds). If
you have not tried to find Liar's
Cache, it's just up the trail a bit. Hook up those electrodes
and give it your best shot.</groundspeak:long_description>

To find the coordinates for the final stage you will need to go to the GZ and view the available WIFI access points. You may see two wireless names but only one should stand out.  

I have setup an OPTIONAL log that you may sign.  To sign the optional log, log onto the WIFI access point and then open your
web browser.  In the address bar enter 10.10.10.10 (no WWW).  To be more precise you can enter HTTP://10.10.10.10
YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO THIS STEP TO COMPLETE THE CACHE.

The final cache could be a little tough to find. The container is a small black decon kit, it contains only the log - bring a pen.
Check the hint or contact me.

One person small, but if I would have had to pick one person I thought it would be, it would have been N0k1a... and it was. STF is not bad though.

&lt;h2&gt;Garry Kasparov&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;13th World Champion, 1985 - 1993&lt;br/&gt;
PCA Champion, 1993 - 2000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garry Kimovich Kasparov was born Gary Weinstein in Baku,
Azerbaijan, USSR in 1963. Kasparov learned to play chess from his
father who later died in a road accident when he was 7 years old.
He subsequently changed his name to Kasparov, a Russified version
of his mother's maiden name, Kasparyan. Kasparov's chess talent was
apparent at an early age. In 1973 he attended the Botvinnik Chess
School and Kasparov continued to make rapid progress. In 1975 at
the age of 12 he became the youngest ever player to win the USSR
Junior Championship. At 16 he won the World Junior Championship. He
achieved the title of Grandmaster on his 17th birthday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1984 he challenged the current reigning World Champion,
Anatoly Karpov for the title. This match was a hard fought battle
and lasted 6 months, the longest in the history of chess. It was
finally stopped by Florencio Campomanes, president of FIDE and a
rematch ordered. In November 1985 Kasparov won the rematch against
Karpov and became the youngest World Champion at the age of 22
years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasparov held the official FIDE world title until 1993, when a
dispute with FIDE led him to set up a rival organization, the
Professional Chess Association. He continued to hold the
&quot;Classical&quot; World Chess Championship until his defeat by Vladimir
Kramnik in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1996 Kasparov competed in a six game match against an IBM
computer called Deep Blue. Kasparov won with a score of 4 games to
2 games. The following year, he competed against an improved
version called Deeper Blue and was defeated 3.5 games to 2.5 games.
It was the first time a Grandmaster had lost a series of games to a
computer. He is currently the highest rated player there has ever
been in the history of chess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasparov's ratings achievements include being rated world #1
according to Elo rating almost continuously from 1986 until his
retirement in 2005 and holding the all-time highest rating of 2851.
He was the world number-one ranked player for 255 months, by far
the most of all-time and nearly three times as long as his closest
rival, Anatoly Karpov. He also holds records for consecutive
tournament victories and Chess Oscars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasparov announced his retirement from professional chess on 10
March 2005, to devote his time to politics and writing. He formed
the United Civil Front movement, and joined as a member of The
Other Russia, a coalition opposing the administration of Vladimir
Putin. He was a candidate for the 2008 Russian presidential race,
but later withdrew. Widely regarded in the West as a symbol of
opposition to Putin, Kasparov's support in Russia is low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the current coach of the world's number-one ranked player,
Magnus Carlsen.&lt;/p&gt;

the listed coordinates!&lt;br/&gt;
This is just one possible
spot to park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is sure to be poetry in motion. You will enjoy a
lovely walk through the woods. You (or your monkey) will climb to
new heights. You will swing from the tree tops! You will have fun
and so will any good little children you happen to bring along.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cold winter days and lonely walks make me think of
&lt;strong&gt;Robert Frost&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
Well, at least I like to think about some of his poems. I was
hiking along one day when I came upon a choice of paths to take.
One was new and thus I surmised, less traveled. I took this path
and thought about the poem as I walked along. This cache will help
you learn a bit about one of America's most famous poets.&lt;br/&gt;
You should do your research before heading out and you can only
find the cache legally during daylight hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage one coordinates are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;
N 40 AB.CDE&lt;br/&gt;
W 76 FG.HIJ&lt;br/&gt;
AB: The last two digits of the year &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot; was FIRST
published &lt;strong&gt;minus&lt;/strong&gt; F.&lt;br/&gt;
C: Second digit of the day he was married to Elinor Miriam
White.&lt;br/&gt;
D: Last digit of the year his wife Elinor died.&lt;br/&gt;
E: Number of stanzas in &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
F: The number of roads in the yellow woods&lt;br/&gt;
G: The number of children born to Robert and Elinor&lt;br/&gt;
HIJ: X-(Y+Z)&lt;br/&gt;
X: The day of the year when he stopped by the woods on a snowy
evening.&lt;br/&gt;
Y: Robert Frost's age at death.&lt;br/&gt;
Z: The number of words in the first stanza of &quot;Dust of Snow&quot; plus
one.&lt;br/&gt;
You might want to consider actual dates and leap year in your
calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have included two of my favorite Frosty poems for you to
consider as you take a nice walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whose woods these are I think I know,&lt;br/&gt;
His house is in the village though.&lt;br/&gt;
He will not see me stopping here,&lt;br/&gt;
To watch his woods fill up with snow.&lt;/p&gt;
My little horse must think it queer,&lt;br/&gt;
To stop without a farmhouse near,&lt;br/&gt;
Between the woods and frozen lake,&lt;br/&gt;
The darkest evening of the year.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gives his harness bells a shake,&lt;br/&gt;
To ask if there is some mistake.&lt;br/&gt;
The only other sound's the sweep,&lt;br/&gt;
Of easy wind and downy flake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woods are lovely, dark and deep,&lt;br/&gt;
But I have promises to keep,&lt;br/&gt;
And miles to go before I sleep,&lt;br/&gt;
And miles to go before I sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Road Not Taken&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,&lt;br/&gt;
And sorry I could not travel both&lt;br/&gt;
And be one traveler, long I stood&lt;br/&gt;
And looked down one as far as I could&lt;br/&gt;
To where it bent in the undergrowth;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then took the other, as just as fair,&lt;br/&gt;
And having perhaps the better claim,&lt;br/&gt;
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;&lt;br/&gt;
Though as for that the passing there&lt;br/&gt;
Had worn them really about the same,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And both that morning equally lay&lt;br/&gt;
In leaves no step had trodden black.&lt;br/&gt;
Oh, I kept the first for another day!&lt;br/&gt;
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,&lt;br/&gt;
I doubted if I should ever come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shall be telling this with a sigh&lt;br/&gt;
Somewhere ages and ages hence:&lt;br/&gt;
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—&lt;br/&gt;
I took the one less traveled by,&lt;br/&gt;
And that has made all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe there is a reason they still run away even in this park. You can never be too cautious when you're a deer. You do not need to remove the prop. Please just leave it where it is.

&lt;h2&gt;Vladimir Kramnik&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;14th World Champion&lt;br/&gt;
2006-2007&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical World Champion&lt;br/&gt;
2000-2006&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Kramnik was born in Tuapse, Russia in 1975. His
father's birth name was Boris Sokolov, but he took his stepfather's
surname when his mother (Vladimir's grandmother) remarried. As a
child, Vladimir Kramnik studied in the chess school established by
Mikhail Botvinnik. His first notable result in a major tournament
was his gold medal win as first reserve for the Russian team in the
1992 Chess Olympiad in Manila. His selection for the team caused
some controversy in Russia at the time, as he was only sixteen
years old and had not yet been awarded the grandmaster title, but
his selection was supported by Garry Kasparov. He scored eight
wins, one draw, and no losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, Kramnik played a sixteen game match against Garry
Kasparov in London, for the Classical Chess World Championship.
Kramnik won the match without losing a game. This was only the
second time in history that a World Champion had lost a match
without winning a single game. This event marked the first time
Kasparov had been beaten in a World Championship match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2004, Kramnik successfully defended his title against
challenger Peter Leko in a drawn match played in Brissago,
Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Garry Kasparov broke with FIDE, the federation governing
professional chess, to play the 1993 World Championship with Nigel
Short, he created a rift in the chess world. In response, FIDE
sanctioned a match between Anatoly Karpov and Jan Timman for the
FIDE World Championship, which Karpov won. Subsequently, the chess
world has seen two &quot;champions&quot;: the &quot;classical&quot; championship,
claiming lineage dating back to Steinitz; and the FIDE endorsed
champion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2006, FIDE announced a reunification match between
Kramnik and Topalov, the FIDE World Chess Championship 2006. The
match took place in Elista, Kalmykia. After the first four games,
Kramnik led 3-1 (out of a maximum of 12). After the fourth game,
however, Topalov protested that Kramnik was using the toilet
suspiciously frequently, implying that he was somehow receiving
outside assistance whilst doing so. Topalov said that he would
refuse to shake hands with Kramnik in the remaining games. The
Appeals committee decided that the players' toilets be locked and
that they be forced to use a shared toilet, accompanied by an
assistant arbiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kramnik refused to play the fifth game unless the original
conditions agreed for the match were adhered to. As a result, the
point was awarded to Topalov, reducing Kramnik's lead to 3-2.
Kramnik stated that the appeals committee was biased and demanded
that it be replaced. As a condition to continue the match, Kramnik
insisted on playing the remaining games under the original
conditions of the match contract, which allows use of the bathroom
at the players' discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy resulted in a heavy volume of correspondence to
Chessbase and other publications. The balance of views from fans
was in support of Kramnik. Prominent figures in the chess world,
such as John Nunn, Yasser Seirawan, and Bessel Kok also sided with
Kramnik. The Russian and Bulgarian Chess Federations supported
their respective players. Kramnik's behavior during the match
earned him widespread support in the chess community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After twelve regular games the match was tied 6-6, although
Kramnik continued to dispute the result of the unplayed fifth game
until the end of the tournament. On 13 October 2006 the result of
the disputed fifth game became irrelevant as Kramnik won the rapid
tie-break making him the first undisputed World Champion, holding
both the FIDE and Classical titles, since Kasparov split from FIDE
in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cipher:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mikhail Botvinnik&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;6th World Champion&lt;br/&gt;
1948 - 1957, 1958 - 1960, 1961 - 1963&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mikhail Moiseevich Botvinnik was born in St Petersburg, Russia
in 1911. He learned to play chess at the age of 12. He was a Soviet
and Russian International Grandmaster and three-time World Chess
Champion. He is often considered as one of the greatest chess
players of all time. Working as an electrical engineer at the same
time, he was one of the very few famous chess players who achieved
distinction in another career while playing top-class competitive
chess. He also developed a chess-playing algorithm that tried to
&quot;think&quot; like a top human player, but this approach has been
superseded by a brute-force search strategy that exploits the rapid
increase in the calculation speed of modern computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Botvinnik was the first world-class player to develop within the
Soviet Union, putting him under political pressure but also giving
him considerable influence within Soviet chess. From time to time
he was accused of using that influence to his own advantage, but
the evidence is unclear and some suggest he resisted attempts by
Soviet officials to intimidate some of his rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Botvinnik also played a major role in the organization of chess,
making a significant contribution to the design of the World Chess
Championship system after World War II and becoming a leading
member of the coaching system that enabled the Soviet Union to
dominate top-class chess during that time. His famous pupils
include World Champions Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov and Vladimir
Kramnik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The puzzle:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Answer the following questions (use algebraic chess notation for
the first 4):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is queen side castling notated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What symbol is used to notate a move that captures a
piece?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What symbol is used to notate check?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What notation indicates that white won the game?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many dark squares are on a standard chessboard?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What shorthand notation indicates an excellent move?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what country did the precursor to chess most likely
originate?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Vasily Smyslov&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;7th World Champion&lt;br/&gt;
1957 - 1958&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vasily Vasilievich Smyslov was born in Moscow, Russia in 1921.
He learned to play chess at the age of 6. He learned much about
chess from his father and studied the chess books in his father's
library. Smyslov was an opera singer but made chess his career
after narrowly failing an audition for the Bolshoi Opera in 1950.
He once said, &quot;I have always lived between chess and music.&quot; and
brought music to his games. He once sang operatic extracts on Swiss
radio and during the interval of a serious living chess game
against Botvinnik; he sang to an audience of thousands. He defeated
Botvinnik in 1957 World Championship match but lost the title to
Botvinnik in the 1958 rematch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a Candidate for the World Chess Championship on eight
occasions. Smyslov was twice equal first at the Soviet Championship
(1949, 1955), and his total of 17 Chess Olympiad medals won is an
all-time record. In five European Team Championships, Smyslov won
ten gold medals. He remained active and successful in competitive
chess well into the 1960s and 1970s and he qualified for the finals
of the World Championship Candidates' Matches as late as 1983.
Despite failing eyesight, he has remained active in the composition
of chess problems and studies and he is currently the oldest living
former World Chess Champion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The puzzle:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Who is your teacher, he's lived very long.&lt;br/&gt;
It's true he's half blind, but he sings a nice song.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

walk. This cache is hidden with permission and could require
stealth during certain events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Please Note:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Do not bother trying this
cache if it has rained in the past 24-48 hours or if the humidity
level is above 80%. I can pretty much guarantee that you will
&lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; be able to recover the cache if the area is
wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hints will be provided by request, but only after a posted DNF.
There are only a few places this one could be, so it should be
pretty easy for seasoned cachers. BYOP and please take care to
replace the cache gently so that other cachers can also enjoy a
successful hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike Bre'r Rabbit there is nothing tricky
about this one. The cache is located in an area behind a business
and was placed with permission from the owner of the property. You
can use the business parking area while searching for the cache.
Please respect the owner and do not search for the cache at
night.
&lt;p&gt;Wander further back on the property and check out the pond or
sit in the gazebo and rest a spell. Please do not post photos of
the container or the hide location in your logs.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

close to Ithaca Road, many locals don't know where Ithaca road
actually is located. There are not too many hiding places near the
posted coordinates so this should be an easy find. The cache is
small with room for only very small items. This is my first cache
in what I hope to include in a &quot;Ithaca Small Park&quot; series of
caches. Please close the cache and place it just as you found it.
Cache has a terrain level of 2 only because there is not a paved
path to the cache though it is probably wheelchair accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container would be good for other very small coins.&lt;/p&gt;

Cache is located at the best starting point (in our opinion) of another cache located in the area.

Its been noted in previous logs that the road to the lighthouse now has a gate and you maybe unable to drive right to the cache. I am unsure where exactly the gate is on the road so am unsure how far of a walk you may have.

Cache is a small Lock N Lock with room for a small trade items and trackables.

This area is abuntant in waterfown and wildlife so bring your binoculars and camera..

If you are a Letterboxer you can grab our nearby LB of the same name while you are here.</groundspeak:long_description>

If caching with children PLEASE ensure they stay close as there is an unrailed cliff about 15 meters from the cache.

Cache is located close to the entrance of the Prince Edward Wildlife Area.

Cache is a small Lock N Lock with room for small trade items and trackables.

Once you find the cache take some time to enjoy the spectacular view.

Once you have done this one why not go for our Pt Traverse Lighthouse cache as well as another Pt Traverse cache.  Not much further for them.

Cache is a wel lcamo'd micro with logbook only. BYOP

We took a look around while we were there and noticed many older stones.

As with any cache in a cemetery, please respect your surroundings.

The cache container was picked up in Aaron Haynes' fragmentation cache &quot;Pay It Forward (GC25661)'' which is located northeast of Napanee.</groundspeak:long_description>

Another Restin' series cache located at a cemetery that many do not know is here.

Although this is a very old cemetery it is still active. 

Please respect your surroundings.

Take the time to check out some of the very old markers, as well as some of the very nice newer ones. We especially likes the marker shapped like a guitar.

 We found some birth dates in the 1700's as well as some markers with burials in the early 1800's.

 We have ancestors buried here around 1800.

 Cache is a green waterproof match container.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a Letterbox/Hybrid with 1 logbook. Both geocachers and letterboxers can sign/stamp in the same book.

This is a small Lok n Lok container with only room for geocoins or small Travelbugs.

****************************************************************************************
There is a rubber stamp of a rose in the hybrid. Please DO NOT take it !!!  It is for Letterboxers to stamp in their own logbooks which they carry to keep a collection of stamps from all the boxes they find.
****************************************************************************************

Letterboxing is a hobby similar to geocaching except boxers seldom use GPSr, but rather clues posted on Letterboxing websites. We use www.atlasquest.com.

If you want to try and find this hybrid the letterboxing way then go to the above website and do a search for Picton, Ontario. Rose Museum should pop up in the results.

The letterbox clue is also listed in the hint/spoiler section just incase you can't locate it at Atlasquest.

This area had one of the largest and oldest populations of German immigrants in the late 1700's. The Rose museum is a protrayal of early life in the area.

Museum is open weekends only in May and June, daily in July and August (closed Mondays), and weekends the 1st 2 weeks of Sept.

Cache is located on Wolfe Island.

We planted this cache while heading out to Big Sandy Beach to do the 2 caches already located there.
The idea for this cache is to give you a cache that will bring you to the starting point for the 2 other caches without the walk.

Cache is a camo taped film cannister. Logbook only. BYOP

During the summer season this maybe a busy place so please use stealth.</groundspeak:long_description>

Another Restin' series cache located in a cemetery on Wolfe Island that up until a week ago I had no idea was here.

Cache is a camo taped film container. BYOP.

I was not sure of the name of the cemetery, but Jevre provided the name for me.

Most of the dates I could see are all in the 1800's early 1900's. This is a very well maintained old cemetery.

The trick to getting to this cache is finding the one and only way to it. You can see this cache behind the school on Hwy 95. However you are not permitted to access the cache from this direction.

Please heed the NO TRESPASSING sign behind the school and find the correct route

I am not sure if the way in is maintained in the winter.</groundspeak:long_description>

Today I figured that even though this was within the radius of my self imposed 'bike-to-cache' rule I could allow myself the find because I had located the route while on my bike.  Or so the reasoning goes.  Some of these folks won't get so many visitors these days, I was glad that I'd stopped by.  TFTC:)</groundspeak:text>

We thought that Wolfe Island needed a new cache so here is one.

Cache location is designed to take you to a new place on the island and is near 1 of Wolfe Islands Golfe courses.

Cache is a 35mm film cannister.

I want to keep the island caches alive.


The following description is taken directly from the original cache page:

A small round container within a well camo'd gnarly dude.

This cache is placed with the purpose of taking you on a lovely drive through the wonders of Wolfe Island. You will venture along the South Shore road with views of Bayfield Island and if conditions are right you will hear the faint whisper of the turbines overshadowed by the loud gaggling of Canada Geese.There are hundreds of birds that shelter on this side of the island and in the winter you will be entertained by the stark beauty of winter and the sculptures of the snow on the shore.
Please bring your own writing tool and I always recommend bringing a piece of paper in case you have trouble with the logs of any cache. The container is small so please do not place anything other than coins or very small trackables.
The cache needs to be covered well with camo so please replace as found and offer the next cacher the same experience of a good hide in the gnarly dude.</groundspeak:long_description>

The following description is taken directly from the original cache page:


A fun hide on Wolfe Island for the &quot;kid&quot; within you...

You are looking for a container that initially might cause some of the weak in heart to leap back but &quot;feel&quot; free to discover the FUN in this cache.

There is a section of this container that any &quot;KID&quot; of geocaching will enjoy. Slip with this cache and play the Micheal Jackson moonwalk with this item if you like. Play with the little thing for the fun or take a snap of the kids enjoying the find. Photos with your &quot;hand&quot; inside the cache will be accepted but are not a requirement for a smiley...the cache is meant to be FUN.
Well...it will be fun for those who discover what this last sentence means!
You will be travelling on Wolfe Island off Oak Point Road towards Chubb Shoal. There is parking along the side of the road and all cachers should be without notice if it is done with stealth and respect for the neighbours. SHRIEKS might happen at this cache so be prepared to NOT CACHE AT NIGHT. I REPEAT...ABSOLUTELY NO CACHING AFTER SUNSET. This is a daytime cache as there is an area of little car traffic and after dusk the lights of cars will arouse suspicions to the folks who live on this road. PLEASE respect the community here as this island is a great place to visit and cache.
Please respect any signage of PRIVATE LANES. There is no need to drive down any private road and the cache is NOT on private land. It is just off the side of the road in a dead fall zone.
Cache is within a short stepping off point from the side of the road.In the winter there may be a snowdrift to leap but nothing that a winter cacher cannot do.
Please replace the cache in a friendly, gentle way for the next cacher and try to have it nested in such a way that it can &quot;coccoon&quot; for a winter season.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">After parking your car there is a bit of a hike (less 200m). I don't advise small children do this cache, as it gets a bit dangerous near GZ. I have marked the terrain as a 3 but the first part is easy. Please be very careful when approaching GZ. This is where the terrain changes. Precaution should be taken in all seasons! 


Croydon is a farming community known for its friendly residents, rich history, beautiful scenery, and small-town charm. In the early and mid 1900s, Croydon was a well developed farming community that featured several hotels, a general store, a church, a post office, a schoolhouse, and a gristmill. Although business and industry are currently non-existent in Croydon, many of the original buildings have been renovated and are serving as family homes. The main attraction is the beautiful Salmon River, which runs through the heart of Croydon. The river is used for swimming, fishing, canoeing, and kayaking. 
It was such a beautiful sunny last day of summer, Muggle Hubby and myself decided we would venture out and hide a cache. We knew exactly where we wanted to put it.
Cache is a lock-n-lock container.</groundspeak:long_description>

I enjoyed the discovery that  I had found the correct road to the cache so saved myself a swim or wade across the waterway. The area was quiet, free of muggles and only nature itself was there to witness my search. Thanks Opalwitch for a splendid cache and one I highly recommend people to seek. Cheers</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;A Nano cache at the site of one of
the worst train wrecks in Canadian
History&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; You are looking for a magnetic green
nano container. Stealth may be needed at times. Please put it back
where you find it.
&lt;p&gt;The stone memorial at the site reads as
follows...&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;One of the worst accidents in Canadian railway history occurred
at this site at 8:43 P.M. on December 27, 1942. A special train
carrying Canadian soldiers for overseas service struck the rear of
a stationary train crowded with holiday passengers, demolishing the
three rear coaches. The number known to have died was 39, and more
than 150 were injured. Almonte citizens, military personnel,
railway staff and other volunteers from Ottawa Valley towns did
their utmost to help the doctors and nurses. The Almonte town hall
was used as a morgue, the capacity of the local hospital was
exceeded, and the O'Brien Theatre adjacent to this site was used as
a first aid centre. Most of the injured were transported by train
to Ottawa.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Good luck and have fun!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
