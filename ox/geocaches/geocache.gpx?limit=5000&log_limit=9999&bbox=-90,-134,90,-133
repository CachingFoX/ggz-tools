            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This Geocache is located in a historic mining area, there are lots of gold rush cabins, artefacts, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the rich history of goldmining in this area there are miles and miles of old roads that are now perfect trails! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located here because it has stunning views of the Mc Donald lake valley, Moose mountain, Steamboat mountain, and you can see far into Tagish lake and Atlin lake valleys. &lt;br/&gt;Also it shows the history of the area, while also putting you right in the center of endless exploration of 'easy going' hiking trails that are not on the map. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The switchback road to reach the tundra is drivable by 4x4. once on top, it does get a little trickier, especially if you're not familiar with the area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area and the geocache are accessible and findable year round. You can quad, snowmobile, snowshoe, mountain bike, 4x4, or hike your way up there! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking can be done at the parking area by 4th of July bridge (end of maintained road, beginning of forestry road), this will make for a longer hike. If you wish to keep it under 3 hours return trip than park on the bottom of the switchback roads (accessible by 2 wheel drive), and hike from there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make sure you take the Right hand side switchback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mc Donald lake campground is not far from the Geocache and could be a great overnight adventure. </groundspeak:long_description>
