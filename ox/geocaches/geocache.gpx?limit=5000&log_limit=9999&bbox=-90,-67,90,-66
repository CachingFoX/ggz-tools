FTF:Felicidades a
cyber_nuno!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nació el 23 de marzo de 1913 – 17 de noviembre de 1979 en
el Barrio Palmas Altas de Barceloneta. Este cache se encuentra en
una plasita con una estatua de Sixto Escobar Vargas. Para el FTF
hay un pin de PR.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lo largo de su carrera como boxeador tuvo 92 combates, de los
cuales ganó 79, perdió 12 y empató en uno. En su memoria, una
avenida de Barceloneta lleva su nombre, la cual se extiende de
norte a sur. Este honor se le otorgó con motivo del gran triunfo de
Sixto Escobar al conquistar el Primer Campeonato Mundial del Peso
Pluma para Puerto Rico, el 26 de junio de 1934. Por esta hazaña fue
electo en el año 1950, al reputado Salón de la Fama del Boxeo.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

FTF: Congratulations to
s3phiroth2006!!!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;En esta plaza puedes encontrar un paseo tablado con vista a un
pequeno lago. Tienes bancos dondes puedes disfrutar con tu familia.
Y si te gusta apostar a los caballos tienes la tiendita de al lado.
No gastes mucho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esta hermosa plaza fue creada en memoria de muchas personas que
aunque muchos de sus nombres han sido olvidados fueron una gran
contribución al levantamiento de Barceloneta. Entre ellos podrás
encontrar al gran fundador el Sr.Bonocio LLenza Feliu llego a PR en
1840 procedente de Blaners ciudad de Gerona, Cataluña, España, fue
el fundador de Barceloneta Y su primer Alcalde, le llamo así a este
municipio en Honor al pueblo de la Barceloneta de la Barceloneta
ubicado en la provincial de Barcelona. Es notable decir que era el
Alcalde y tan bien juez. Dueño de la hacienda El Palenque. Donde
estuvo ubicada su casa actualmente es el centro cultural Histórico
de este Pueblo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;También puedes observar una gran estatua levantada en memoria de
aquellos héroes de nuestra patria que están dando actualmente sus
servicios y aquellos que han dados sus vidas para mantener nuestro
país libre. Porque la libertad no es gratis. Y felicito a todos
aquellos que de una forma u otra como yo tienen familiares en el
Servicio Militar y en el cual me siento muy orgulloso de haber sido
parte. Y créanme esta no es una lucha perdida. Bueno el cache que
estas buscando es un nano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuando realices este cache puedes aprovechar y realizar otros
que están muy cerca en este mismo pueblo como: GC1DMR3- Don Benito:
Traigo un ramillete..., GC1DMR6-Villa Georgetti, Barceloneta,
GC1F5GV- La Boca, Barceloneta y GC2ACM6- Isla de Roque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Si te gusta caminar o Montain Bike tienes acceso a un area
bastante amplia con una vista hermosa por todo el Rio de Manati que
deciende por Barceloneta.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;El Puente San Vicente, se encuentra en la carretera 688 del
barrio Sabana, en Vega Baja.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://s01.flagcounter.com/more/E3k&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En 1873 se inauguró la Central San Vicente, en el pueblo de Vega
Baja conocida como &quot;Ciudad del Melao Melao&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El puente San Vicente fue construido en el 1945. Al sur del
mismo se encuentra cimientos de ladrillos y piedras que forman
parte del antiguo puente del sistema ferroviario de la Central de
caña San Vicente.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desde el puente se pueden ver las chimeneas de la central.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Este cache esta hubicado en la Plaza de Recreo de Arecibo. La
cual fue dedicada a Luis Muñoz Rivera. En esta plaza puedes
disfrutar de Noches de galerias que se llevan a cabo cada tercer
viernes de cada mes. Tambien no se olviden pasar por la heladeria
la cual me deleitaba desde niño es la mas antigua en Arecibo.
Pruebenlos les encantara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desde esta plaza puedes observar la Iglesia catolica que es muy
hermosa e inpresionante. Esta Plaza fue dedicada a gran procer Luis
Muñoz Rivera este nació en Barranquitas, Puerto Rico el 17 de julio
de 1859. En 1882 se dió a conocer como poeta al publicar en el
periódico ponceño El Pueblo la poesía ¡Adelante!. Se distinguió
como piloto de ideas liberales, orador, periodista y poeta. Se le
considera discípulo y continuador de la obra de Román Baldorioty de
Castro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La personalidad y obra de Luis Muñoz Rivera influyeron mucho en
la historia puertorriqueña. Es interesante recordar que Luis Muñoz
Rivera fue el padre del gran gobernador y líder político Luis Muñoz
Marín. Aún así, la fama de Luis Muñoz Rivera como político, orador
y poeta fue tan grande, que si no hubiera nacido Luis Muñoz Marín,
sería recordado por sus grandes méritos y logros personales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asi que por la hermosa historia que encierra este lugar y los
innumerables recuerdos que tengo desde niño en esta plaza junto a
mi padre y abuelo coloco este cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tengan cuidado con los muggles de dia y de noche hay muchos en
los edificios altos.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Este lugar es una delicia, Para compartir con tu familia.
Tambien me llama mucho la atencion el arbol gigante que esta detras
de la guagua. Me habian comentado que al crecer hiban perdiendo las
espinas. Pero a este chico le faltan muchos, muchos a~nos para
perder estas amiguitas. El cache es uno muy interesante. No se
olbiden traer un lápiz o bolígrafo para firmar el log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the mofogono,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We enjoy this place regularly with our family. I had been told
that the enormous tree next to the bus looses it's thorns as it
grows. This tree needs many years before loosing them. This cache
is a quick park n grab. Be discrete as it's a busy area. Happy
hunting... BYOP&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;La Playa La poza del obispo es acta para el disfrute de toda la
familia. Estas buscando un cache que no es nada de típico, bien
diferente a los usuales. Se confunde con la naturaleza. (hint)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El cache esta cerca del Faro de Arecibo. Esta playa se le otorga
su nombre (según cuentan los viejos del área) por un gran Obispo
que venia a desembarcar en San Juan y debido a una gran tormenta
que destruyo su envarcacion llegaron nadando a salvo a esta hermosa
poza. Siendo esta bautizada la Poza del Obispo. Esta hermosa poza
cuenta con una gran vida marina. La cual puedes disfrutar
realizando Snorkling veras de todo. Y es muy acta para toda la
familia. Los que disfrutan de surfing este es lugar excelente. No
se recomienda visitar el lugar cuando hay problemas atmosféricos ya
que las olas rompen hasta los gazebos y las corrientes submarinas
son peligrosas durante estos sucesos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Si deseas puedes buscar estos caches que estan muy cerca y
disfrutaras de un hermoso tours por todo el hermoso Pueblo de
Arecibo. GC238RH -La Cueva del Indio - Arecibo GC2ACJY - Dama entre
Caballeros GC29N11 - Plaza de Arecibo GC26AKW - Rotario Arecibo Te
recomiendo traer agua y sun block. &quot;&quot;BYOP&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>1. No busques por un conteiner típico.
2. No soy de plástico y puedo darte calor en algún momento.
3. Recuerda donde estoy no me caen cocos.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Es uno de los más originales que he hallado, y de paso te invito a que busques el de [url=http://coord.info/GC1XMTY]La Marquesa Forest Park[/url] que te va poner a sudar la gota gorda también! Tan pronto pasaron algunos minutos y noté que el GPSr brincaba, pensé que esto es una actividad que requiere más de pensar que de seguir el GPSr, así que me senté y fué algo así como la famosa canción: ¡&quot;saca la mano... y AHI TÁ&quot;!   ¡Muy bueno y recomendado!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Llegué a la playa a las 12:15pm. En ese momento estaba lloviznando pero pensé que no tardaría mucho y comencé a caminar hasta el GZ. Tan pronto llegué a la palma supe que no sería cuestión de unos minutos y así fue. Estuve buscando por una hora y no lograba ni siquiera encontrar un posible escondite. Por los “hints” que ofrece el cache sabía lo que estaba buscando pero el problema era dónde encontrarlo. Estaba acompañado de mi recién adquirido Colorado 300 y mi preciado iPhone y aún así no encontraba precisión en las coordenadas. Por algún motivo las coordenadas cambiaban constantemente y casi siempre me llevaban a donde no tenía que buscar.

Después de buscar por una hora y con el sol encima decidí contactar al dueño del cache vía e-mail en busca de pistas adicionales. Mientras el tiempo corría me compré una botella de agua en uno de los kioscos y descansé 15 minutos dentro de mi carro. En ese momento le envié un mensaje a mi amigo jy_hunting con esperanzas de que me respondiera. Continué con la búsqueda y milagrosamente zeq me contestó el e-mail. Con esa ayuda adicional recobré la motivación pero el sol y la arena me forzaban a irme. Pasadas dos horas arrastrándome como serpiente entre uvas playeras, jy_hunting llama. Me pregunta: ¿Todavía estás ahí? Le contesto que sí. Me dice: “Wow, tú si que eres perseverante.” Con su ayuda y la de zeq pude concentrarme en un área en particular y me vestí de paciencia para poder hallar el preciado atípico envase.

Este es mi cache #322 y me atrevo a decir que está entre los cinco más creativos y más difíciles en todo Puerto Rico. El envase es muy original. Sugiero que hagan uso de los “attributes” en el listing para que futuros geocachers tengan una idea más clara de las cualidades y condiciones de este cache. Creo que es bien importante llevar agua y protección solar. 

Muchachos los felicito por su creatividad y les agradezco haberme llevado a tan bonita playa. Gracias por su atención y por la ayuda que me brindaron con las pistas.

I was curious to see what the twisted mind of TLTOC had prepared this time and it did not disappoint.
Another great cache.
The trail is rough but easy to walk. 
It made for a nice walk late in the afternoon.
Had fun with it.

It was a wee bit foggy when we were there so if anyone is so inclined they can post a pic of the view on a clear day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are railway tracks to cross on the way to the lookout which may or may not be active so please use common sense when crossing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a peanut butter jar.  Bring your lawn bowling equipment or just enjoy the ocean while you're there.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>follow the line of stones not too far and near a grove of mountain ash trees you will find the jar</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Over 150 years ago, in 1851 the Marco Polo was built near here and became known as &quot;The Fastest Ship in the World.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the official opening of this small but very important bridge linking two sections of the city were: Hon. G.S. Merrithew, Mayor Elsie Wayne, Hon. Nancy Clark-Teed, and the Hon. WG Bishop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why not add your name to this pretegious list by signing the log?

Well I couldn't find the cache anywhere on that rail. If the nano was supposed to be on the lower part of the rail where it meets the bridge on the side of the road where the liquidation store then it's not there!
I stuck my hand in there and used a flashlight and couldn't find it. 
Tried to take a look at the rest of the guardrail with no luck.
Will wait for someone else to find it before trying again.
Thx.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;Another trail at Rockwood that I wasn't aware of... Great
unobstructed views of uptown, so bring your camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is meant as a starting point for those folks trying
out geocaching with &quot;Daytripping&quot;. Good luck guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easy path in, is to head to the trail-head off Mount
Pleasant (coordinates given as child way-point). But if you're
feeling a little braver, it is located up the hill directly across
from Lily Lake Pavilion - a steep climb, but doable. Have
fun...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;AA1A8Z4 - Trailhead&lt;br /&gt;N 45° 17.241 W 066° 03.436&lt;br /&gt;Trail head</groundspeak:long_description>

These guys are serious cachers, these are not the kind of people that decide to go out for a walk in the morning and accident bump into a cache.
No, these are serious nutcases with all the equipment, snowshoes, shovels, winter clothes gear, the only thing missing on the back of that overloaded trunk was some rope and climbing equipment, but I am sure the garage must be full of that stuff.
I would never attempt to walk the river on my own.
It's was 1.2km of walking over frozen water and with a bust ankle from a fall.
&quot;This is nuts!&quot;, I kept thinking for myself.
But we succeeded and after a quick climb on land we were in the cache area.
Got the shovels to work and it didnt take long to find the cache.
I was glad the GPS put us in the right area otherwise it would've taken serious shoveling to find the cache buried under all that snow.
Signed the logbook and started to walk the way back.
The view from the middle of the river is breathtaking.
It was fun walk and I hope I dont have to walk this much to a cache anymore. :)

Thanks Team Bikefast and Retiredhiker, I had a blast with you and I hope to do it again soon.
Left sticky frog, TN.

On arrival I had already known that others had tried and failed but I figured to give it a good try anyway. about half an hour later I figured that I would have to wait this one out and was just getting ready to go when Team Bikefast arrived and we spent another hour here before heading down to the store and grabbing another cache on the way down.  After taking a break which included another Ice cream [:p] ! We went back to the spot and tried for another half an hour and as we were leaving AJLong arrived with news that there were indeed new coords out but he had mistakenly written down the wrong ones so it was back in the direction of the store and use the wifi to get  the right ones and then back to the cache site to try again and this time it was indeed a P &amp; G like the page suggested.

Well hidden in the trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Richard Vessot Gorham B.A. M.A, LLD, ONB, of Gorham’s Bluff, NB, known to all as “Dick”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dick’s fascination with the world began early on, with a stint in the merchant marine at eighteen that took him to the Mediterranean, Spain and Northern Europe.  After completing undergraduate studies at UNB and Post Graduate Studies at Clark University, Dick joined Canada’s Foreign Service, Far East Division, in 1952. He began his adventure as a world traveler with a six year assignment in Japan in 1954, cementing a deep and lifelong love for that country, which included mastery of spoken and written Japanese, one of seven languages in his repertoire. Over thirty years, Dick also served in India and Cambodia, as well as a second tour in Japan. He served as Canada’s Ambassador to the Peoples Republic of China (1984-1991) and was Roving Ambassador and Permanent Observer to the Organization of Latin American States (1987-1990).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Dick had the good fortune and skill to lead a large and exciting life through his career, but his heart was always in the Kingston Peninsula, where he and Dorie were able to lead an active and vibrant retirement on their beautiful property at Gorham’s Bluff, contributing to community life, and strengthening rural New Brunswick.   Dick was the catalyst for and founding member of the tremendously successful Kingston Farmers Market Cooperative.  Dick also served as adjunct professor at the University of New Brunswick; on the Public Complaints Commission of the RCMP; the New Brunswick Human Rights Commission; Fundy Region Solid Waste Commission; Royal District Planning Commission; N.B Municipalities Act Review Panel; Local Service district Advisory Committee; Peninsula Heritage Inc.; Kingston Vision 2000; Kingston Peninsula Chamber of Commerce, the Kingston Ambulance Service Inc, and lent his volunteer services to countless projects in the region and around the Province.&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;In recognition of this important community work and his impressive career, Dick was awarded the Order of New Brunswick in 2006.</groundspeak:long_description>

TH #2 Coordinates is quite a walk to the closest cache, but there are others you may not already have along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache Slinger wanted to close the gap between his &quot;# TREE 6&quot; Series starting across the highway from the Irving Big Stop off Cynthia Lane and his more recent &quot; # GFA 4 &quot; (Greater Fredericton Airport) Series, best Accessed via Richmond Estates Trans Canada Trail Trail Head. If you're teaming up with another cacher you can park at one Trail Head then Car Pool to the Other Trail Head and work your way from one to the other.</groundspeak:long_description>

FTF is FTF, unless there's some rule I don't know about it stands fine with me. :)

Container is a pill bottle with room for small traders, BYOP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My father drove/sold trucks for the majority of my childhood. Bad in those days CB was the cell phones of the day and it was how we communicated when he was local and once he got out of range it was always possible to get an update from other truckers that had just returned from the direction he was headed as most truckers talked with each other or listened in on the conversations going on. I always remember when I was in the truck the odd stories I'd hear and think what a bunch of cuckoos they were. Never Worry was my fathers CB handle and it fit him well as I would come to witness as I got older. Dad never let things bother him too long and anything negative usually slide right by he'd keep on truckin. It's one of the lesson's in life I've learned to live by, never worry because tomorrow is a new day.</groundspeak:long_description>

Find all 10 and you will experience some of the most scenic locations that are situated along the or near the shores of Grand Lake West. Grand Lake is the largest body of fresh water in New Brunswick and many campers and cottagers spend their Summer months enjoying swimming, fishing, camping and boating activities. Congratulations to Sandinis for the FTF.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These containers are small plastic spice bottles all camo and contain pins for trading, a logbook, pencil and sharpener. All are placed in a tree hollow except for #6. PFP cache 3 is located at Indian Point a favourite place of mine to visit early in the morning for fishing. Beautiful view with a marsh nearby where the Great Blue Herons nest. Loons and many spies of ducks make their home here as well as the Canada Goose and the occasional Bald Eagle can be seen.&lt;br /&gt;
A micro geocoin has been placed in this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is a Tradable Pin Cache full of pins!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We ask that if you take a pin you leave a pin in its place, if you don't want to take one you are also welcome to leave one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a great way to put pins you have colected into cerculation from cacher to cacher and cache to cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

TH #2 Coordinates is quite a walk to the closest cache, but there are others you may not already have along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cacheslinger wanted to close the gap between his &quot;# TREE 6&quot; Series starting across the highway from the Irving Big Stop off Cynthia Lane and his more recent &quot; # GFA 4 &quot; (Greater Fredericton Airport) Series, best Accessed via Richmond Estates Trans Canada Trail Trail Head. If you're teaming up with another cacher you can park at one Trail Head then Car Pool to the Other Trail Head and work your way from one to the other.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is my very first hide and has been hidden in the friendly community of Douglas Harbour. This is a very popular area in the Summer and Fall as it is situated in the middle of cottage country on Grand Lake. There is something for everyone to do in Douglas Harbour hence the name Fun for all.Snowmobile/ATV trails nearby. I love to come down to the lake to fish early in the morning and watch the Great Blue Herons,Eagles,Loons and Ducks just down the road at Indian Point.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache has been initially stocked with the following items in a large round plastic camo peanut butter container.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Find all 10 and you will experience some of the most scenic locations that are situated along the or near the shores of Grand Lake West. Grand Lake is the largest body of fresh water in New Brunswick and many campers and cottagers spend their Summer months enjoying swimming, fishing, camping and boating activities.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations to Sandini for FTF.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These containers are small plastic spice bottles all camo and contain pins for trading, a logbook, pencil and sharpener. All are placed in a tree hollow except for #6. PFP cache 10 is located near Grand Lake Park. I had one cache left over after my drive around this side of the lake and placed it here next to the park.</groundspeak:long_description>

Although they don't mind GeoCaching, the best times to hunt are when the dancers are not there.

Just this morning I had to stop so that a small group of deer could safely cross the road, a regular occurance here. These fields are also home to the beautiful Canada Goose both during the Spring and Fall migration.&lt;br /&gt;
The cattle spend the winter months here and then are moved to Oromocto Island on the Saint John River for Summer grazing.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache started with the following contents: Canadian Flag micro coin, First to Find Card game for the FTF, FTF micro coin, Canadian Cacher items including luggage tag,patch, pin, zipper pull, temp tatoos, Veterans of Canada pin, Canadian Rangers gold key chain, carabiner with compass, zipper pull with compass, whistle with compass, halloween stamp, red bracelet, logbook with pen, pencil and sharpener.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">One of 10 caches in the Pining For Pins Series. Find all 10 and you will experience some of the most scenic locations that are situated along the or near the shores of Grand Lake West. Grand Lake is the largest body of fresh water in New Brunswick and many campers and cottagers spend their Summer months enjoying swimming, fishing, camping and boating activities.&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations to viking43 for the FTF.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These containers are small plastic spice bottles all camo and contain pins for trading, a logbook, pencil and sharpener. All are placed in a tree hollow except for #6. PFP cache 5 is located just across the road from a private golf course. No parking, must pull over onto the shoulder of the road for this park and grab.</groundspeak:long_description>

Congratulations to TrrekkinDuo for the FTF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All these containers contain just a log unless otherwise stated so bring your own writing utensil. All are camo and are either a matchstick container or a keychain pill container unless otherwise specified. They are located in a series on Rte 18 North of Highway 10, a series on Grand Lake Meadow Road, a series on a nearby dragline South of highway 10 and the remainder are spread through out Clarks Corners, Maquapit Lake, Lakeville Corner and Ripples. Bring your snowshoes, cross country skiis or tobaggens and get out and enjoy the great outdoors in these beautiful scenic communities. Happy caching! :) This series is located on an active logging road so keep your eyes open for large operating machinery.</groundspeak:long_description>

Find all 10 and you will experience some of the most scenic locations that are situated along the or near the shores of Grand Lake West. Grand Lake is the largest body of fresh water in New Brunswick and many campers and cottagers spend their Summer months enjoying swimming, fishing, camping and boating activities.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations to Crrash for FTF.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These containers are small plastic spice bottles all camo and contain pins for trading, a logbook, pencil and sharpener. All are placed in a tree hollow except for #6.</groundspeak:long_description>

Bring your snowshoes, cross country skiis or tobaggens and get out and enjoy the great outdoors in these beautiful scenic communities. Happy caching! :) This series is located on an active logging road so keep your eyes open for large operating machinery.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache was placed by &quot;The Pines People_Sue&quot; who has passed
it off for me to keep safe. Thanks to Sue for a great cache in one
of my favorite locations for a cache, on a dirt road! Sue's cache
listing follows, and a big thanks to her for it! Also, &quot;Captain No
Beard and the Pi Rats&quot; were really instrumental in keeping this
cache alive, they rock! Good hunting - BudSirius&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cache is located approximately 9 ½ km out the Dunbar road from
route 8. Directions: Drive out the Dunbar road 8.2 km and turn
right on to another road. (first major turnoff on right) Cache is 1
½ km down this road, on a bridge. Apparently it is a lot closer
coming from the Royal Road side, but I do not know the mileage as I
never came from that end. Bridge micro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---BudSirius note: If you come at this cache from the Royal Road
- Route 620 it is about half the distance than coming from route 8
(about 4 kms instead of 9ish). The road is normally in pretty good
shape during the summer, and unless logging is going on, you will
not each this with a vehicle in the winter. ---&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this cache out in the middle of nowhere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a mission, I wanted to find Scotch Settlement (story below)
as I have never visited the site but have heard stories about where
it is and about the Nashwaak Bicentennial Association putting up a
monument there to remember the Scots who
were……”misled” to settle there. I called
around for directions from people who have been there. I asked if
we could get there by car and was told “maybe, maybe not, but
you might get close enough to be within walking distance.
You’ll know it when you come to it. You can see it from quite
far away. There is a large area where the trees are not cut.
It’s one square KM of trees left to mark the spot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the directions given to me: Drive out the Dunbar Road
off route 8. Take the first major right. You will see lots of
little roads off to the right, but you will know what I mean by
major when you come to it. It goes down hill where you will come to
beaver dams at the bottom. From there, after a slight incline take
the third road on your left. You will climb up some more hills,
some places the road may be washed out a bit. Then you will go over
quite a bad part of road, but from here you can see the one square
KM of trees left. You will find it easily from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well……Ghostman and I thought we would try it. We
drove out the Dunbar road. We saw the little roads off to the
right, but knew they were not the “major” right as
told. When we came to this “major” road to the
right….”YUP! That hast to be it!” We drove down
this road a little piece and came to a small bridge. After the
bridge were beaver dams. “Yeah! We’re on the right
road!” The road to this point was fine but this is where we
decided to stop and turn around. The going was good, but in a mini
van and just us, two old haggards, we thought it smart to back off
from the mission. We were a long way in the woods, with no body
knowing where we were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We planted a cache on the bridge here. Maybe someone will take
up the torch and continue on with the information provided here.
Maybe a group of people might gather to continue
on……and plant a cache in Scotch Settlement. The story
behind Scotch Settlement is little known. Some claim this tragedgy
was covered up by the government of that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of extreme importance.... CITO and respect.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Scotch Settlement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1834, the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Land Company
purchased a total of 589,000 acres of land, most of it, a vast
track of land in York and Northumberland counties. The object was
to clear lots, build homes and bring to the area, settlers, who
would pay for the land over a period of time. The purpose to bring
settlers was to open up New Brunswick, build roads, and to
establish communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the company's first groups of settlers were enticed to a
section of land near Stanley, NB with promises of 100 acres of
land, five of which would be cleared ready to farm, a comfortable
log house ready, a lease of 50 years granted, a promise of
employment, a promise of established storehouses for supplies,
provisions, clothing and tools and lastly, a promise of medical aid
for the passage from Scotland as well as medical aid for the
settlement. These Scottish settlers arrived in 1836 coming from the
threat of starvation from the Eastern Isles of Scotland. To be
noted, they were not farmers. They were kelp gatherers and herring
fishermen; however, the Land Company thought them to be ideal
settlers for the deep forested land in New Brunswick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Highland settlers arrived in November 1836. Prior to
leaving Scotland they were promised free passage but after their
departure, they were forced to sign a document promising to pay for
their free passage within three years. The promised comfortable log
houses were empty shells not fit for animals to live in. The tools
promised? One rumor was that they received a crate of axe heads but
there were no holes in the heads to put a handle. I mentioned this
to one of a history buff friend and he couldn’t verify that,
however, he told me, he found, at the site, an axe head which was
made of very poor metal. He said the side of the axe head is bent
showing it’s weakness. With very little provisions, cutting
green fuel, lacking food and proper clothing and suffering from
illness, they spent a howling murderous first winter. . Forty one
or one third of the emigrants died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second winter was no better. Many of them had fled the area
but for those who remained food was scarce. It was reported they
dug the seed potatoes from the ground for food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A petition was filed for an investigation. Miraculously, the
Land Company was exonerated of any wrong doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 1838 many of the remaining immigrants pushed on
to Stanley and the nearby communities. Of the survivors was a
family of McDonalds. The daughter Mysie remained until a few months
prior to her death. She is buried in the old Catholic cemetery in
Stanley. Mysie was a strong woman determined to survive. She cut
logs and built her own cabin shingling the roof with cedar bark.
She carried her dead brother on her back to Stanley for burial. It
was reported she was honest and never begged but would accept a cup
of tea or a hot meal. Her ability to tell the future resulted in
her being called a witch. Some people poked fun at her. Mysie was
an incredible woman, a survivor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lonely site holds the shallow graves of 48 persons who
perished that first year. Piles of rocks mark the head and foot of
these hollows varying in size from infant to adult. Someone erected
a picket fence around the gravesite. In 1946, the remaining two
pickets were found by woodsman and taken to the New Brunswick
Historical Society. Twenty-five fire places have been found at this
site. The Nashwaak Bicentennial Association erected a stone
monument in remembrances of the Highland Settlers. Every fall they
visit the site, remember and maintain...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many home runs did we hit? hmmm, find the first and you will
see what happened to the last two...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Home Run Series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multi cache is located in Tay Creek around the ballfield.
All the caches are relatively easy to find and easily accessible.
We called this the &lt;b&gt;Home Run Series&lt;/b&gt; because it has a baseball
theme and we live very close. I love waking up during the summer to
hearing cheering and such (take a bow Bud and start your day ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The baseball theme is simple, each cache could be the location
of a ball hit, maybe a homerun, maybe a foul!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The First cache is about 10 yards from the coords. It contains a
clue to the 2nd, and the 2nd of course leads to the third. The
clues are not coordinate based but should lead you fairly directly
to the area to search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun and be sure to let out a good cheer for the locals that
might be listening ;)&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This will be an extended series, as we (TCI - Trois Carr Inc.)
plan to place a few more down in this area. We decided that &quot;What A
View - GC1T49K&quot; was just a little too lonely for its own good.
Hopefully a few more caches will make the trip worth while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an area I have grown up in and all the spots have some
personal tie, so I hope all involved enjoy the hunt. This is rural
NB at it's best. A dirt road will bring you close to any of these,
and in most cases a short easy hike will put you on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important: You need to come into these caches on the Tay Falls
Road (a dirt road with mail boxes located at its start). Access it
from the Stanley side. If you are using a GPS and coming from the
Royal Road you may be tempted to take one of the Woodlands road to
get here, but the bridge is out (As you will see when you find this
cache). The Tay Falls Road is just minutes from Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We threw in change among the caches that should provide gas
money for the FTF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back In Black #4&lt;/b&gt;  This overlooks a well
remembered swimming hole, It is a spot I will always hold close...
ahhh to be young and in love again ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warning! This is not cache to send kids to without direct
supervision. There is potential for a fall so be careful!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This will be an extended series, as we (TCI - Trois Carr Inc.)
plan to place a few more down in this area. We decided that &quot;What A
View - GC1T49K&quot; was just a little too lonely for its own good.
Hopefully a few more caches will make the trip worth while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an area I have grown up in and all the spots have some
personal tie, so I hope all involved enjoy the hunt. This is rural
NB at it's best. A dirt road will bring you close to any of these,
and in most cases a short easy hike will put you on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important: You need to come into these caches on the Tay Falls
Road (a dirt road with mail boxes located at its start). Access it
from the Stanley side. If you are using a GPS and coming from the
Royal Road you may be tempted to take one of the Woodlands road to
get here, but the bridge is out (see Back In Black #4 :) The Tay
Falls Road is just minutes from Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We threw in change among the caches that should at the very
least provide gas money for the FTF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back in Black #8  &lt;/b&gt;The first time I came down
this trail I did it from Tay Creek in a Jeep Cherokee. Yes, this
little trail you find the cache on snakes its way through the woods
to Tay Creek on the Royal Road.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back in Black #2  &lt;/b&gt;This is off the road a bit,
an approx. 200 yard hike through the bush will be required. What I
like about this area is it is the location of an old homestead.
About 100 feet from the cache you will find the stone basement, all
that is left from someones many years of hard work and love for the
land. The apple grove this has become is literally polluted with
all the wonderful wildlife of the area. Ruffed grouse brings me
here just about every fall. I have seen bear, deer, racooons,
rabbits, skunk, moose... just about all the things that make this
one of my favorite spots in NB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Fall 2011 Addition&lt;/b&gt; - 3 days after replacing this cache
because it had been eaten by a bear, I go back and it was literally
destroyed. Like #6 of this series I had placed this in an apple
tree and this was just 2 close to the bears dinner ;) Found a cool
replacement spot with the girls. We decided to make a series next
year just in this general area next year, with some bear proof
hiding spots!

located by a nice stream with lots of space to get to the side of
the road. The coordinates provided where taken from the road,
within 5 feet of the cache. A circular route to the cache would be
advised as there is a drop off from the road, try starting from the
culvert ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A word of warning, there is a slope and a fall would be not
fun... watch your childeran! However, that being said my 11 and 9

would be jealous with their scrambling skills :)&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

came here in the hunt of ruffed grouse. It has been recently cut
over, taking away from the hunting a bit, but still will be a spot
I will revisit over the years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Fall 2011 addition&lt;/b&gt; - This cache had to be replaced twice
this fall so I moved it with this thid cache placement about 50
meters from the original. That location was in an apple tree and I
believe a bear was coming for his apples and eating the cache
too.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Tidbits to consider when heading to the Falls Brook Falls cache:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While on your way through Bloomfield Ridge heading towards Holtville, you will arrive at a VERY sharp turn (County Line Road)… head straight and ignore the Dead End sign (or Cul-de-sac). Approximately 1km down the road, you will arrive at McKiel Gate which is run by Irving. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Falls Brook Falls are the highest falls in NB (108 feet) and are spectacular… The general public may gain access to the falls by paying a $10 fee at McKiel Gate.  Once past the gate, you will drive approximately 16 km on a woods road which is very well maintained from mid-May until snow. There is NO cell phone connection so if you can’t change a tire or are driving an unreliable vehicle, pack something for a long walk back to the gate. The road is opened all year round but it’s treacherous driving in the winter especially if it’s icy conditions. Also be warned that you may have to play an intense game of “Dodge the Dump trucks and/or Log trucks”… so drive carefully. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The start of the Falls Brook road will be on your left JUST before the second bridge. There is a sign there from June to October indicating the road. You can drive part way down with a vehicle BUT you cannot go all the way to the bottom of the road UNLESS you have a 4-wheel drive vehicle AND you aren’t afraid of driving down a very steep hill that is a eroded on one side AND you don’t have faulty breaks. If you have checked any of these off, then park the vehicle in the little cleared area on the last turn (you can’t miss it, the road angles right and starts its downward incline there). The Falls Brook road is less than a km long and the ‘drop’ is on the last 50 meters of the road. If you were able to drive to the bottom ‘parking lot’ then you will notice a little sign saying ‘falls’ (look towards the woods opposite the river). The hiking trail is short and a fairly easy one and can be done in sneakers… well during the summer months. You will not have to cross the brook at any point to reach the falls or find the cache. If you are going in the winter time, then snowshoes are recommended and a sled with a good set of breaks could be fun. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don’t be fooled by the size of Falls brook… it may be small but when it falls over a 100 feet it is quite impressive. Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inspector Gadget and Penny&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;FBWVV7 - McKeil gate&lt;br/&gt;N 46° 31.484 W 066° 30.029&lt;br/&gt;There is a gate here where you have to pay $10 to gain access to the road.&lt;br/&gt;THWVV7 - Falls Brook Falls Trail Head&lt;br/&gt;N 46° 36.053 W 066° 35.175&lt;br/&gt;Road to reach the cache is located here. Unless your driving a 4x4 do not take your vehicle in this road.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
