            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache was placed in commemoration of us finding our 150th cache (Hope &amp; Happiness, GC12H9D). We are a husband and wife geocaching team that met while both serving in the Navy. We were stationed at Naval Amphibious Base, Coronado with the Seabee battalion, Amphibious Construction Battalion One in 2007 and spent a lot of time on this beach while we were dating. This is a beautiful area of San Diego and the perfect location to place our first cache in hopes to share some of the magic we found here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This can be a high muggle area, especially during the summer. Please use your geo-senses and be discrete when searching as to reduce the possibility of the cache being muggled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache contains Seabee and Navy related swag and a Seabee challenge coin for a FTF prize. Please trade items in keeping with the Seabee/Navy theme.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is an Ammo can in a canyon. The difficulty comes from access issues, my entrance point was off a potentially dangerous street. The route to the cache is varied but mainly dirt path with vegetation and wildlife in the area. No bushwhacking needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have been sitting with this swag for quite some time meaning to go purchase a container. I finally went out and spent the money and bought an Ammo can. The cache swag is geared towards children but parental assistance will be needed with navigation to the canyon access point I used. There is a path that leads to the cache and if you continue past the cache site you will come to a housing tract with a No Trespassing sign- above the sign is a fairly large bird house hanging from a tree limb, it looks large enough for a hawk.&lt;br/&gt;This cache is directly related to a movie that came out in April and I enjoyed very much.&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 FTF prizes small $ and a Dave&amp;Busters card that I have had sitting around for a couple years and don't think I will ever get around to using.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is well camo'd but not difficult to get to, slightly off the well worn path. Not recommended for at night.  Cache is a large plastic jar with a screw top, and it is full of my kids toys that they out grew.  There is a log and pencil, but it wont hurt to bring your own writing stick.  The canyon is frequented by lots of people every day but you shouldn't have any trouble with stealth when making the grab.  enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

All around this should be an easy find for experienced cachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was put together about a month ago but I couldn't decide where to put it. The ammo can is full of things that would have been perfect for celebrating the 4th of July. I had an idea for placement on Friday July 3rd but the Geocaching server was down and I couldn't verify what was in the area. When the server came up it was too late for me to try to place the cache that day. July 4th came and went without me being able to place the cache, so today July 3rd I took advantage of an hour and found a spot. I hope that what caused the servers to go down was not very serious, I have heard rumor of a fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;cache also found at Geochaching.com</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Tourmaline Surfing Park is a local San Diego
hangout just north of Pacific Beach. Although parking is free, it
is limited during the summer and most weekends. Take only pictures,
leave only footprints (which means leave the rocks and stay off the
cliffs!). This park is open 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, but it is
recommended you do this earthcache during the day.&lt;br /&gt;
 
Tourmaline Surfing Park’s cliffs expose
six different geological formations – the Point Loma
Formation, Cabrillo Formation, Mt. Soledad Formation, Scripps
Formation, San Diego Formation, and Bay Point Formation –
which are from four different geological ages – the
Cretaceous Period, Eocene Epoch, Pliocene Epoch, and Pleistocene
Epoch. This earthcache is meant to be a tour of all the different
formations from youngest to oldest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bay Point Formation&lt;br /&gt;
N 32° 48.270 W 117° 15.694&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Bay Point Formation is visible at the top of the cliff at the
coordinates. It is the youngest formation exposed at Tourmaline
Beach. It was deposited on top of an underwater terrace during the
Pleistocene Epoch (.01-1.8 million years ago). Consisting of
cobbles, pebbles, sand, and mud, this formation is weakly cemented
and erodes very easily. It also contains many different types of
fossils.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
San Diego Formation&lt;br /&gt;
N 32° 48.270 W 117° 15.694&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just below the Bay Point Formation is the San Diego Formation. It
was formed in beach environments during the Pliocene Epoch (1.8-5.3
million years ago) and consists of conglomerate (consolidated
rocks) overlain by friable sandstone. At the coordinates you can
see the friable sandstone. The reason it’s friable is because
it’s geologically young and not old enough to be compacted
and cemented into hard rock. It also contains an abundance of
fossils such as scallops (Patinopecten healeyi, Flabellipecten
sternsii, Argopecten invalidus, Argopecten subdolus, and Pecten
bellus), oysters (Ostrea vespertina), sand dollars (Dendraster
ashleyi), and snail shells (Opalia varicostata). There have been 24
different species of scallops documented in the San Diego
Formation. The first logging requirement is that you find a fossil,
take a picture of it, and measure it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At N 32° 48.350 W 117° 15.771, north of the parking lot, the
conglomerate is visible. The conglomerate is composed of rhyolite,
breccias, and metamorphic rocks. The tilting of the conglomerate
compared to the formation below it is due to the Rose Canyon Fault.
There is also an unconformity between the conglomerate and the
underlying Mt. Soledad Formation that spans 43 million years. An
unconformity is a discontinuity in a rock sequence indicating an
interruption of sedimentation, commonly accompanied by erosion of
rocks below the break. The second logging requirement is to take a
picture with you and/or your gps at the unconformity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Scripps Formation&lt;br /&gt;
N 32° 48.370 W 117° 15.785&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Below the conglomerate and at the coordinates is the Scripps
Formation which was formed in submarine fan and tidal flat
environments during the Eocene Epoch (33.7-54.8 million years ago).
It is composed of sandstone, mudstone, and siltstone. This
formation as well as the Mt. Soledad Formation contains gypsum.
This gypsum formed from groundwater leaching the soluble parts of
the rock and precipitating in the numerous cracks in the formation.
The third logging requirement is to find some gypsum, take a
picture of it, and measure its width.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mt. Soledad Formation&lt;br /&gt;
N 32° 48.444 W 117° 15.850&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the coordinates is the Mt. Soledad Formation. It was formed
during the Eocene Epoch as channel fill in beach environments. It
is composed of conglomerate and sandstone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cabrillo Formation&lt;br /&gt;
N 32° 48.484 W 117° 15.928&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the coordinates is the conglomerate and sandstone of the
Cabrillo Formation which formed during the Cretaceous Period
(65-144 million years ago) in shallow marine conditions. The dip in
the conglomerate is caused by a submarine fan filling a submarine
canyon. In this formation, the conglomerate is overlain by
sandstone. The fourth logging requirement is to find a conglomerate
in the Cabrillo Formation in the cliffs, take a picture of it, and
measure it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, there are exposures of the shale of the Point Loma Formation
which formed during the Cretaceous Period near the tip of False
Point.&lt;br /&gt;

See my note as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highly amenitized, 19-acre San Elijo Hills Park fronts on the town square. Built into the hillside on several levels, the city of San Marcos park includes a lighted soccer field, two lighted baseball diamonds that meet the specifications for adult league play, picnic/barbecue areas for large and small groups, tot lots, a children’s water “sprayground,” an enclosed dog park, jogging paths, acres of rolling lawn, and a plaza for community-wide events. Located in the center of the 1,920-acre community, the park is also the main trailhead for the network of 18 miles (29 km) of trails that wind through 1,115 acres of open space. The park’s 6,500-square-foot (600 m2) Community Center, operated by the city of San Marcos, has facilities for classes, parties and special events. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As you go after this cache, be sure to carefully watch for the
American Prurient Owl. Although the owl was originally discovered
only recently in Florida in 1983, watchers now have documented an
amazingly fast profusion of the species and sightings are now
common across the United States and in 20 other countries.
&lt;p&gt;The plumage of this owl has been the source of much controversy
as some tradesmen find it extremely appealing and the birds
themselves have been considered victims of salacious
objectification. Grassroots organizations around the country, even
here in Oceanside, have worked to prevent these owls from taking up
residence in local habitat areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the American Prurient Owl is generally an exception, owls
are birds of prey, have large forward-facing eyes and ears, a
hawk-like beak, and usually a conspicuous circle of feathers around
each eye called a facial disc. Although owls have binocular vision,
their large eyes are fixed in their sockets, as with other birds,
and they must turn their entire head to change views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smallest owl is the Elf Owl (Micrathene whitneyi), at as
little as 31 g (1.1 oz) and 13.5 cm (5.3 inches). Some of the pygmy
owls are scarcely larger. The largest owls are the two of the eagle
owls, the Eurasian Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo) and Blanston's Fish Owl
(Bubo blanstoni), which may reach a size of 76.2 cm (30 in) long,

&lt;strong&gt;Winter Olympics 2012 #7: Bobsleigh&lt;/strong&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a new series of geocaches honoring the winter olympics which sadly aren't being conducted this winter. Fortunately we have geocaching to fill in the void. There will be medals given out for each cache in the series, and the team with the highest medal count will be the overall winner for the series.&lt;/p&gt;











&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bobsleigh&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;bobsled&lt;/b&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_sport&quot;&gt;winter sport&lt;/a&gt; in which teams of two or four make timed runs down narrow, twisting, banked, iced tracks in a gravity-powered &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sled&quot;&gt;sled&lt;/a&gt;. The timed runs are combined to calculate the final score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various types of sleds came several years before the first tracks were built in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Moritz&quot;&gt;St. Moritz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland&quot;&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, where the original bobsleds were adapted upsized &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luge&quot;&gt;luge&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_%28sport%29&quot;&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; sleds designed by the adventurously wealthy to carry passengers. All three types were adapted from boys delivery sleds and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toboggan&quot;&gt;toboggans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition naturally followed, and to protect the working class and rich visitors in the streets and byways of St Moritz, hotel owner &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Badrutt&quot;&gt;Caspar Badrutt&lt;/a&gt;, owner of the historic &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krup_Hotel&quot;&gt;Krup Hotel&lt;/a&gt; and the later &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badrutt%27s_Palace_Hotel&quot;&gt;Palace Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, built the first familiarly configured 'half-pipe' track circa 1870. It has hosted the sports during two Olympics and is still in use today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobsleigh&quot;&gt;Bobsleigh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; has been contested at the &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympic_Games&quot;&gt;Winter Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; since the first Winter Games in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1924_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1924&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1960 games&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaw_Valley_Ski_Resort&quot;&gt;Squaw Valley&lt;/a&gt; when the organizing committee decided not to build a track in order to reduce expenses. Other than that exception, the four-man competition has been competed at every other games (in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobsleigh_at_the_1928_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1928&lt;/a&gt;, it was a five-man competition). The two-man event was introduced at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1932_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1932 games&lt;/a&gt; and a two-woman event was first contested at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;2002 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;Winter Olympics 2012 #3:
Alpine Skiing&lt;/strong&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a new series of geocaches
honoring the winter olympics which sadly aren't being conducted
this winter. Fortunately we have geocaching to fill in the void.
There will be medals given out for each cache in the series, and
the team with the highest medal count will be the overall winner
for the series.&lt;/p&gt;










&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_skiing&quot;&gt;Alpine skiing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; has been contested at every
&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympic_Games&quot;&gt;Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; since &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1936&lt;/a&gt;, when a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_skiing_combined&quot;&gt;combined&lt;/a&gt; event was held in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garmisch-Partenkirchen&quot;&gt;Garmisch-Partenkirchen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;.
From &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_skiing_at_the_1948_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_skiing_at_the_1980_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;80&lt;/a&gt;, the
Winter Olympics also served as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIS_Alpine_World_Ski_Championships&quot;&gt;World Championships&lt;/a&gt;
in Olympic years (with separate competitions held in even-numbered
non-Olympic years). During 1956-80, extra World Championships
medals were awarded in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_skiing_combined&quot;&gt;combined&lt;/a&gt; using the results of the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slalom_skiing&quot;&gt;slalom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downhill&quot;&gt;downhill&lt;/a&gt;, since the combined event was absent from
the Winter Olympics from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_skiing_at_the_1952_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1952&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_skiing_at_the_1984_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;84&lt;/a&gt;, returning
in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_skiing_at_the_1988_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;. Since
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIS_Alpine_World_Ski_Championships_1985&quot;&gt;1985&lt;/a&gt;, the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIS_Alpine_World_Ski_Championships&quot;&gt;World Championships&lt;/a&gt;
have been scheduled every odd-numbered year, independent of the
Winter Olympics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alpine &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiing&quot;&gt;skiing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport&quot;&gt;sport&lt;/a&gt; of
sliding down &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow&quot;&gt;snow&lt;/a&gt;-covered hills on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski&quot;&gt;skis&lt;/a&gt; with
fixed-heel &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_binding&quot;&gt;bindings&lt;/a&gt;. It is also commonly known as
&lt;b&gt;downhill skiing&lt;/b&gt;, although that also incorporates different
styles. Alpine skiing can be contrasted with skiing using free-heel
bindings; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_mountaineering&quot;&gt;ski mountaineering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_skiing&quot;&gt;nordic skiing&lt;/a&gt; – such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-country_skiing&quot;&gt;cross-country&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_jumping&quot;&gt;ski
jumping&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemark_skiing&quot;&gt;Telemark&lt;/a&gt;. Alpine skiing is popular wherever
the combination of snow, mountain slopes, and a sufficient &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourist&quot;&gt;tourist&lt;/a&gt; infrastructure can be built up, including
parts of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe&quot;&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America&quot;&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand&quot;&gt;New
Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America&quot;&gt;South American&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes&quot;&gt;Andes&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia&quot;&gt;East Asia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpine skiing began as a club sport 1861 at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiandra,_New_South_Wales&quot;&gt;Kiandra&lt;/a&gt; in Australia and a number of
similar clubs in North America and the Swiss Alps. Today, most
alpine skiing occurs at a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_resort&quot;&gt;ski
resort&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_lift&quot;&gt;ski lifts&lt;/a&gt; that transport skiers up the
mountain. The snow is groomed, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanches&quot;&gt;avalanches&lt;/a&gt; are controlled and trees are cut to
create trails. Many resorts also include snow making equipment to
provide skiing when the weather would otherwise not allow it.
Alternatively, alpine skiers may pursue the sport in less
controlled environments; this practice is variously referred to as
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_touring&quot;&gt;ski touring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backcountry_skiing&quot;&gt;backcountry skiing&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_skiing&quot;&gt;extreme skiing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In competitive alpine skiing races four disciplines exist:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slalom&quot;&gt;slalom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_slalom_skiing&quot;&gt;giant slalom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Giant_Slalom_skiing&quot;&gt;super giant slalom&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downhill_skiing&quot;&gt;downhill&lt;/a&gt;. Slalom ski
races have courses that require short tight turns, whereas
giant-slalom races have courses which are set with more widely
spaced turns. Super-giant slalom and downhill have few turns, the
courses have gates spaced widely apart and skiers often reach
100km/h.&lt;/p&gt;

Games is limited by a quota set by the International Olympic
Committee. There are 30 participants in each singles events (ladies
and men), 24 couples in ice dance and 20 in pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skaters qualify for the Olympic Games by belonging to a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Figure_Skating&quot;&gt;Member
nation&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Skating_Union&quot;&gt;International
Skating Union&lt;/a&gt;. 80% of the alloted places (24 men/ladies, 19
dance couples, 16 pairs) are determined by the results of the
previous year's &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Figure_Skating_Championships&quot;&gt;World
Figure Skating Championships&lt;/a&gt;. The most entries a country can
have in a single discipline is three. Countries earn two or three
entries by earning points through their skater placement. The
points are equal to the sum of the placements of the country's
skaters (top two if they have three). If a country only has one
skater/team, that skater/team must place in the top ten to earn two
entries and in the top two to earn three entries. If a country has
two skaters/teams, the combined placement of those teams must be 13
or less to qualify 3 entries, and 28 or less to qualify two
entries. The remaining places are awarded to one skater/team each
from countries that failed to get multiple places, in order of
their skaters' placement in the world championships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries that have yet to qualify skater(s) in particular
events at the world championships get a second chance in an
international competition held in the fall prior to the Olympic
Games. From that competition qualify 6 men and women, 5 dance
couples and 4 pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host country of the Olympic Games is entitled to one entry
in each event, if it failed to qualify otherwise. In that case,
there's one fewer place available in the fall qualifying
competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which skaters from each country attend the Olympic Games is at
the national governing body's discretion. Some countries rely on
the results of their national championships while others have more
varied criteria based on international success at competitions such
as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Figure_Skating_Championships&quot;&gt;
European Figure Skating Championships&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Continents_Figure_Skating_Championships&quot;&gt;
Four Continents Figure Skating Championships&lt;/a&gt;. Selections vary
by country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skaters must be older than fifteen as of July 1 the previous
year and be a citizen of the country they represent to be eligible
for the Olympic Games. Nationality rules are less strict for the
ISU Championships and therefore sometimes skaters who have competed
at World or European championships are not eligible for the
Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEDAL WINNERS FOR THIS ROUND AND
MEDAL COUNT FOR THE SERIES&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Winter Olympics 2012 #1:
Ice Hockey&lt;/strong&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a new series of geocaches
honoring the winter olympics which sadly aren't being conducted
this winter. Fortunately we have geocaching to fill in the void.
There will be medals given out for each cache in the series, and
the team with the highest medal count will be the overall winner
for the series.&lt;/p&gt;














&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey&quot;&gt;Ice hockey&lt;/a&gt; tournaments have been staged at the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games&quot;&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; since 1920. The men's tournament
was introduced at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_Summer_Olympics&quot;&gt;1920 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; and was transferred
permanently to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympic_Games&quot;&gt;Winter Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; programme in 1924.
The women's tournament was first held at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1998 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;. The Olympic Games
were originally intended for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_sports&quot;&gt;amateur athletes&lt;/a&gt; until 1988, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League&quot;&gt;National Hockey League&lt;/a&gt; (NHL) did not
allow its players to compete until 1998. From 1924 to 1988, the
tournament started with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament&quot;&gt;round-robin&lt;/a&gt; series of games and ended
with the medal round. Medals were awarded based on points
accumulated during that round. The games of the tournament follow
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_rules&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Ice_Hockey_Federation&quot;&gt;International Ice
Hockey Federation&lt;/a&gt; (IIHF), which differ slightly from the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League_rules&quot;&gt;rules used in the NHL&lt;/a&gt;. The
tournament follows the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency&quot;&gt;World Anti-Doping Agency&lt;/a&gt;'s (WADA)
rules on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_performance_enhancing_drugs_in_sport&quot;&gt;performance enhancing drugs&lt;/a&gt; and the IIHF
maintains a Registered Testing Pool, a list of top players who are
subjected to random in-competition and out-of-competition drug
tests. Several players have tested positive for banned substances
since the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1972 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the men's tournament, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_at_the_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; was the most successful
team of the first three decades, winning six of seven gold medals.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia_at_the_Olympics&quot;&gt;Czechoslovakia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_at_the_Olympics&quot;&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_Olympics&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; were also
competitive during this period and won multiple medals. Between
1920 and 1968, the Olympic hockey tournament was also counted as
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Hockey_World_Championships&quot;&gt;Ice Hockey World
Championship&lt;/a&gt; for that year. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union_at_the_Olympics&quot;&gt;Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; first participated
in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_1956_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1956&lt;/a&gt; and
overtook Canada as the dominant international team, winning seven
of the nine tournaments in which they participated. The United
States won gold medals in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_1960_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1960&lt;/a&gt; and in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_1980_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1980&lt;/a&gt;, which
included their &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_on_Ice&quot;&gt;Miracle on Ice&lt;/a&gt;&quot; upset of the Soviet Union.
Canada went 50 years without a gold medal, before winning one in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_2002_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;2002&lt;/a&gt;, and
following it up with another in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_2010_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;. Other
nations to win gold include &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain_at_the_Olympics&quot;&gt;Great Britain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_1936_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1936&lt;/a&gt;, the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Team_at_the_Olympics&quot;&gt;Unified Team&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_1992_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, Sweden in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_1994_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1994&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_2006_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt; and the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic_at_the_Olympics&quot;&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt; in
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_1998_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1998&lt;/a&gt;. Other
medal-winning nations include &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland_at_the_Olympics&quot;&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_at_the_Olympics&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland_at_the_Olympics&quot;&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_at_the_Olympics&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1986, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee&quot;&gt;International Olympic
Committee&lt;/a&gt; (IOC) voted to allow all athletes to compete in
Olympic Games held after 1988. The NHL was initially reluctant to
allow its players to compete because the Olympics are held in the
middle of the NHL season, and the league would have to halt play if
many of its players participated. However, NHL players were allowed
to compete starting in 1998. The format of the tournament was
adjusted to accommodate the NHL schedule; a preliminary round was
played without NHL players or the top six teams—Canada, the
Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United
States—followed by a final round which included them. The
tournament format was changed again in 2006; every team played five
preliminary games with the full use of NHL players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 1992, the IOC voted to approve women's hockey as an
Olympic event; it was first held at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1998 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in Nagano. The
Nagano Organizing Committee was hesitant to include the event
because of the additional costs of staging the tournament, but an
agreement was reached that limited the field to six teams, and
ensured that no additional facilities would be built. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_women%27s_national_ice_hockey_team&quot;&gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_women%27s_national_ice_hockey_team&quot;&gt;American&lt;/a&gt;
teams have dominated the event, typically losing only to each
other. The United States won the first tournament in 1998, while
Canada won in 2002, 2006 and 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Winter Olympics 2012 #4: Ski Jumping&lt;/strong&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a new series of geocaches honoring the winter olympics which sadly aren't being conducted this winter. Fortunately we have geocaching to fill in the void. There will be medals given out for each cache in the series, and the team with the highest medal count will be the overall winner for the series.&lt;/p&gt;










&lt;b&gt;Ski jumping&lt;/b&gt; is a sport in which skiers go down a take-off ramp, jump and attempt to land as far as possible down the hill below. In addition to the length of the jump, judges give points for style. The skis used for ski jumping are wide and long (260 to 275 centimetres (100 to 108 in)). Ski jumping is predominantly a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_sport&quot;&gt;winter sport&lt;/a&gt;, performed on snow, and is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympic_Games&quot;&gt;Winter Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;, but can also be performed in summer on artificial surfaces – porcelain or frost rail track on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inrun&quot;&gt;inrun&lt;/a&gt;, plastic on the landing hill.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_jumping&quot;&gt;Ski jumping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; has been included in the program of every &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympic_Games&quot;&gt;Winter Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. From &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1924_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1924&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1956_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1956&lt;/a&gt;, the competition involved jumping from one hill whose length varied from each edition games to the next. Most historians have placed this length at 70 meters and have classified this as the &lt;i&gt;large hill&lt;/i&gt;. (Recent information from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Ski_Federation&quot;&gt;FIS&lt;/a&gt; offices in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland&quot;&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; have had the K-points from 1924 to 1956 determined as shown below). In 1960, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_jump&quot;&gt;ski jump&lt;/a&gt; hill was standardized to 80 meters. In 1964, a second ski jump, the &lt;i&gt;normal hill&lt;/i&gt; at 70 meters (K90) was added along with the 80 meters (K120) large hill. The length of the large hill run in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968&quot;&gt;1968&lt;/a&gt; increased from 80 meters to 90 meters (K120). The team large hill event was added in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988&quot;&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;. By &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992&quot;&gt;1992&lt;/a&gt;, the ski jumping competitions were referred by their K-point distances rather than their run length prior to launching from the ski jump (90 meters for the normal hill and 120 meters for the large hill, respectively) and have been that way ever since. For the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;2006 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, the normal hill was designated as HS106 (K95) while the large hill was designated as HS140 (K125).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 6, 2011 the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee&quot;&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; officially accepted women ski jumping into the official Olympic program for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Winter Olympics 2012 #5: Speed Skating&lt;/strong&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a new series of geocaches honoring the winter olympics which sadly aren't being conducted this winter. Fortunately we have geocaching to fill in the void. There will be medals given out for each cache in the series, and the team with the highest medal count will be the overall winner for the series.&lt;/p&gt;










&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_skating&quot;&gt;Speed skating&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; has been featured as a sport in the &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; since the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1924_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;first winter games&lt;/a&gt; in 1924. Women's events were added to the Olympic program for the first time in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1960&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_International_Sport_Federations&quot;&gt;governing body&lt;/a&gt; for speed skating &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Skating_Union&quot;&gt;International Skating Union&lt;/a&gt; (ISU), was included in the list of recognized federations when the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee&quot;&gt;International Olympic Committee&lt;/a&gt; was founded, but was first discussed seriously for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1908_Summer_Olympics&quot;&gt;1908 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London&quot;&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;. No speed skating events were contested, although figure skating – also governed by the ISU – was on the programme. The preliminary calendar for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1916_Summer_Olympics&quot;&gt;1916 Summer Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, to be held in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin&quot;&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, listed a 3-event allround competition&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_skating_at_the_Winter_Olympics#cite_note-Kluge_1994.2C_page-0&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, but these Games were cancelled because of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I&quot;&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Winter Sports Week in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamonix&quot;&gt;Chamonix&lt;/a&gt;, retro-actively dubbed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1924_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1924 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, contained five speed skating events. Uncommon for the time, it not only included an all-round competition, but also awarded medals for the individual distances: 500 m, 1500 m, 5000 m and 10000 m. The all-round event was dropped before the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1928_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1928 Games&lt;/a&gt;, even though it remained the only &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Speed_Skating_Championships&quot;&gt;World Championship format&lt;/a&gt; in the sport until the 1970s; single distance World Championships were not established until 1996.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_skating_at_the_1932_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1932 speed skating events&lt;/a&gt; were held according to the rules of the American speed skating federation, meaning the skaters competed in small packs of skaters (similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_track_speed_skating&quot;&gt;short track speed skating&lt;/a&gt;), instead of the common against-the-clock format. These Games in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Placid,_New_York&quot;&gt;Lake Placid, New York&lt;/a&gt; also saw the first female speed skaters at the Olympics, although their events were only demonstration events. Women's events were also set to be held at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1940_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1940 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_skating_at_the_Winter_Olympics#cite_note-Kluge_1994.2C_page-0&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, which were cancelled. After the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II&quot;&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;, they were withdrawn again until 1960, when the women skated 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m and 3000 m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the introduction of World Sprint Championships in the early 1970s, the 1000 m for men was added in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;Innsbruck 1976&lt;/a&gt;, while the women's 5000 m, reinstated by the ISU as an official distance in 1981, made its Olympic debut in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;1988&lt;/a&gt;. The latest addition to the Olympic speed skating programme is the team pursuit, which was added for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;2006 Turin Games&lt;/a&gt;. Its inclusion was remarkable as it had not yet been contested at a senior World Championship in the form skated at the Olympics at the time of inclusion. It is not true that it had not yet been contested at a senior World Championship, the Dutch team won the 2005 title in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisstadion_Inzell&quot;&gt;Inzell&lt;/a&gt;, but in that form they only had to skate once and be the fastest, while the Olympic form required three starts.&lt;/p&gt;
At the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;2010 Winter Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haralds_Silovs&quot;&gt;Haralds Silovs&lt;/a&gt; became the first athlete in Olympic history to participate in both &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_track_speed_skating_at_the_2010_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;short track&lt;/a&gt; (1500m) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_skating_at_the_2010_Winter_Olympics&quot;&gt;long track&lt;/a&gt; (5000m) speed skating, and the first to compete in two different disciplines on the same day.

restaurants, fishing, and a good place to watch the surfers and the
sunset.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hard to believe there's no cache out here. Not that anybody needs
an excuse to visit the end of the pier, but now you have one. The
cache used to be a magnetic nano, but kept disappearing. The
replacement is not camouflaged, but placed so it's not easily seen.
It may be a bit of a challenge with all the muggles around.</groundspeak:long_description>

Not recommended for young children to do alone but it can be done with an adult.  My 7 year old boy made it up and down on his own (a little scared but he did it).  This is actually his cache.  You can not see this cache from ground/trail level but once you go up it will be obvious.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is our first hide so let us know what you think about the terrain and difficulty ratings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please hide very well when found. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is plenty of parking on the roadside and different trails lead you to the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please hide very well when found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: I am adding this note for others like KOVLJ: may not be good for 70 years olds that have had a complete hip replacement.

You're looking for a cache along a popular, semi-challenging trail. A simple hide? I dunno, you be the judge. With any luck, you'll spot &lt;b&gt;Under a Bench&lt;/b&gt; and think, &quot;Okay, sure. Yeah, I get it now.&quot; Something like that. Note the terrain rating; you definitely don't wanna try this one in flip-flops. ;-) Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This time around, Boddy planned a swanky dinner party for all his
&quot;friends.&quot; For the most part, everything went according to plan. The guests made small talk, ate dinner, and then went to their various rooms. One devious do-badder did something diabolical, however. He or she lingered after the meal, then bumped off Boddy in a rather violent manner. The corpse was discovered in the dining room, so you already know the location of the crime. Your task, as always, is to uncover the killer and weapon. Look for a clue at GZ left behind by Boddy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With your knack for finding things, you'll locate &lt;b&gt;Clue Investigation #3: Table for None&lt;/b&gt; in no time. Although not required, feel free to e-mail your solution to the cache owner. Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;

The brat is fantastic, as was the lemonade with free refills.  Perhaps I was somewhat dehydrated after this little warm up trail. [:D]

The cache was hard to spot and was the last find of the four traditional caches on the trail.  It was well hidden and blends in well. Awesome ride here and really enjoyed coasting down to this one as I came up on a different trail! [;)]

&lt;br /&gt;
When hidden back in May of '08, this cache contained a bunch of Euro coins, collected on a trip to Europe. Since you really can't use 'em over here.. what to do, what to do? I know! I'll put a bunch of the small coins in a cache. If you haven't seen the Euro coins before, they're pretty cool. With a common front, it's easy to tell what each coin is worth. The reverse designs are pretty cool, especially the Irish ones. (Three guesses as to my ancestry.) Finally, the money exchange process is greatly simplified by using a common currency.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You're smart. I'm guessing you already knew the answer to the question, &lt;b&gt;Whad'Ya Do in a Rowboat?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The &quot;G&quot; in JJG is actually a significant name in the history of Ireland. Over the centuries, my ancestors pieced together quite a bit of land, and by 1600 A.D. owned several thousand acres. Alas, they supported the wrong king, and when he was removed from power, their wealth disappeared almost overnight. Today, if you visit St. Canice's Cathedral in Kilkenny, you'll spot a memorial to a knight whose full name I share. The brave knight occupies a place of honor, and rightly so. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before replacing the cache, you are required to give the traditional greeting to the royal. Anything less would be an insult. I trust you'll enjoy your &lt;b&gt;Royal Encounter.&lt;/b&gt; Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Like all the best families, we have our share of eccentricities, of impetuous and wayward youngsters, and of family disagreements.&quot;--Queen Elizabeth II&lt;br /&gt;

want with me--Clue. It's far and away the best, although there are
several other titles that would finish a close second. It's a safe
bet you've either played the game or know how it works. Mr. Boddy
is dead, but as the detective, you need to figure out the killer,
weapon, and room associated with the murder. Move around the board
making suggestions, jotting down entries in your detective notepad
as you go. But don't waste time, you need to determine whodunit
before another detective gets the collar. Was it Colonel Mustard
with the knife in the kitchen? Could it have been Miss Scarlet with
the candlestick in the conservatory? Only you can crack the case
and bring the killer to justice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For &lt;b&gt;Clue Investigation #1: By the
Book,&lt;/b&gt; I'll give you the location; the murder took place
&lt;b&gt;in the library.&lt;/b&gt; You just need to determine the suspect and
the weapon. When you get to GZ, you'll figure it out. Don't put the
solution in your log, however; send me a message if you think you
know what happened. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;

Ah, the joys of living in southern California. Great people, wonderful weather, and terrific geocaching. Most of the time, you can go caching without a car full of coins or a wallet full of bills. Unlike certain big cities, paying for a parking space is the exception rather than the rule. Personally, I'm a big fan of &lt;b&gt;Free Parking.&lt;/b&gt; Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A tribute to a game that inspired the economic domination embedded in the fragile psyche of every baby boomer, MONOPOLY!  HAL showed how the reliance on technology can make us slaves to it.  OK, my GPSr pointed down the trail and like a docile and good little human drone, followed it blindly from the FREE PARKING area to a well designed creative cache.  There is still a glimmer of hope for mankind.  

Made this memorable as it marks a numerical accomplishment; the first OC Cacher to reach Find Number 10101 ... and that is significant in a binary way to JJG, this hider.

So thank you fellow podcacher for all the positive things you do to keep this game fun!

As you descend your view will change, looking at the coast to the south, a very deep canyon to the east, and a deadly right hand turn that could send a mountain biker on a very long flight if you go too fast!, slow down here, and you will find an Amo can very close by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Filled with some cool swag, and a log book, bring your trades and trackables, there is plenty of room for both.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the hike and scenery and post photos of your journey!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lottery Ticket for the FTF&lt;br/&gt;And I pose a challenge to the FTF or any finder of this cache to continue down this trail, check out the next cool view point and leave a new cache behind and contribute to this scenic and out of the way location for cachers to enjoy even more!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;TH1DHDX - Parking here&lt;br/&gt;N 33° 35.982 W 117° 48.934&lt;br/&gt;Start Here</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On November 24, 1971, a man walked up to a Northwest Orient
Airlines counter in Portland, Oregon and bought a one-way ticket to
Seattle. During the flight, he opened a briefcase in front of a
flight attendant, displayed what he claimed was a bomb, and
demanded a ransom. After landing in Seattle, the airline delivered
$200,000 in cash to the hijacker. The plane then took off from
Seattle bound for Mexico City but soon diverted to Reno, Nevada.
Somewhere between Seattle and Reno, the man lowered the rear
airstair on the Boeing 727 and jumped from the plane. To this day,
the fugitive known as D.B. Cooper has never been found.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On December 31, 2007, the FBI released photographs and data sheets in a renewed
attempt to find the most famous skydiver in history. You just
received the following e-mail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;From:&lt;/b&gt; coopercase@fbi.gov&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Date:&lt;/b&gt; March 11, 2008&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;To:&lt;/b&gt; agent@socalteam.gov&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Subject:&lt;/b&gt; New lead&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Attention all agents,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Cooper case is getting hot again. A phone call to our Santa Ana
office yesterday claimed that new evidence can be found in a place
called Rancho Santa Margarita, California. This town didn't even
exist when Cooper jumped; in those days, the only residents were
mountain lions, coyotes, and a handful of birds. Today, it's a
small city of about 50,000.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Head down there and see what you can find. Use one of the new
Garmin Colorado units distributed last week. I don't have to tell
you how famous you'd be if you actually find the guy. I firmly
believe we're &lt;b&gt;Closing In on D.B.
Cooper!&lt;/b&gt; Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is &lt;b&gt;not at the posted coordinates.&lt;/b&gt; In order to find
it, you'll need to complete a Wherigo cartridge of the same name.
Click here to go to the cartridge page on the
   Wherigo.com site. Be sure to bring a GPS unit with you (and not
   just a PocketPC/Bluetooth combo) when you go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Basic research is what I am doing when I don't know what I am
doing.&quot;--Wernher von Braun&lt;br /&gt;

When we get to the area the sprinkers are going but that is not going to stop us. We have to find D.B. At night it was a lot easier to look at the PocketPC screen. I tought the jogger was cute myself. Great story and very well done cart. Really enjoyed it. Thanks JJG or Mr. Director :)</groundspeak:text>

Do open cachers buy them at large discount warehouses by the gross, choose them in the bargain baskets at garage sales and swap meets, or do they just evolve from the bowels of the earth and crawl out of a CAVE like SPAWN???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking for a regular sized ammo box container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cache contains replacement baggies that help preserve log sheets from moisture and other trade items. There is also some micro spawn containers with log sheets to take, hide, and list on the OpenCaching Website. If you do, please include in the cache title the word SPAWN and reference this cache in the description (OXZTXRE).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If OpenCachers have fun with the theme, more SPAWN will be encouraged to grow and evolve over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy OpenCaching!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">With kitchen pass stamped, headed to Newport to meet up with TBC and JCAZ, visiting from AZ.  Having just cached with them one month ago in Washington in between the GW8 events, there was LOTS and LOTS to talk about and catch up.  They hit a few local events in the SoCal area and so there was much to chat about.  Apparently, there is no such thing as more than too much geo-drama and trauma in the geocaching game we all love to play in SoCal  At least we can agree on this one point! 	[;)]  

Our geocaching teams cover a lot of ground in this game, so 6 weeks time means collectively about ~15 states, 1 foreign country and over a thousand finds for three different geocaching handles!  We're not focused solely on numbers, so avoid that snap judgement, for caching a lot causes this outcome.  We are ardent geocachers that enjoy [b]geo-ranging[/b], whether it is to find a cache in a new county or delorme page, to keep a daily find streak going, or to replace a tattered log sheet to help out a fellow cache hider!  

If none of that is your preference, don't sweat it, to each their own.  Carve out your own niche.  Do go have fun hiding and finding caches, based on your preferences, as time permits.  If group caching floats your boat, go for it.    

Nothing that another geocacher does in this sport is worth getting one's panties in a twist, because it is all good!  It is advisable to abide by the geocaching guidelines, since this game is called geocaching and not terracaching, opencaching, or some other copy cat listing service.  Geocaching does reward creativity so if you come up with a crazy challenge, get it published so others can give it a go too?!  There are not too many gaming endeavors where you can influence how others play the game, and do so on such a massive scale.  It's pretty cool to know that your goal may be the same as someone else who you never met and/or will ever meet!   Connecting with other geocachers is part of the journey, so embrace it and enjoy it.             

It is ok to have preferences in the caches one seeks and hides.  If others recognize and appreciate how you do it, they will emulate your style.  If not, don't sweat it.  Not every cache is made for every geocacher, whether one caches with a spreadsheet with itemized decrypted hints in a large Borgish group to rack up numbers for a day's effort or if you go solo as a GDI (Gosh Darn Independent) and revel in the thrill of the hunt and find less, resorting to hints and prior logs only as a last resort.  It's your time and enjoyment playing this game, so  you own the decision on how best to spend it.  

We sure enjoyed getting [i]Down in Balboa[/i] tonight.  After a few 12 ounce curls, it was time to work out other muscles, so this became our target cache.  

Arrived at GZ and started looking for something that matched the title.  JCAZ spotted it first.  TGR's flashlight confirmed a proper target ID.  SInce TGR kidnapped the Arizonans and took them to this cache, it was up to TGR to produce the right TOTT.  No sweatski, this CO has provided much excellent training in the fine arts of cache retrieval and so went back to the GUV, brought back the item and handed the TOTT to JCAZ to do the honors, afterall, he spotted it first!  Next, handed him the space pen, which writes upside down and on wet log sheets, to sign all of our cache handle initials (initials preserve log space and provide the least impact to the physical log sheet).  It's fun to practice conservation in the parks we CITO and in how we handle the little things in the game, like signing physical logs.  

Your cache is greatly appreciated (all of them are)!  [:D]

[b]Life is what you make of it - so let's make it fun! [/b] [^] [^]

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is part of a continuing
     series of caches along the Aliso Creek Trail starting at
     Cook’s Corner and going all the way to the ocean. Aliso Creek
     rises in Cleveland National Forest and runs roughly south 13
     miles to the ocean. The trail is paved and very popular in
     some sections, so please be aware of muggles zooming by.&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;As you sit comfortably in the dentist's chair getting your teeth
cleaned, the dental hygienist is looking for cavities. If any are
found, you make another appointment to get it filled. Excitement
awaits as you count down the days to get the hole in your tooth
filled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If, by chance, you were ever a convicted felon, the cache title may
bring back other unpleasant memories. Hopefully you'll have more
fun finding this cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In placing this 'filling', I was the dentist. I found a cavity and
went back later to fill it. Let's hope that only excitement abounds
when searching for this 'filling'. After you remove the tooth from
the bridgework, push up from the bottom to remove the filling.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Had found the trail entrance cache some time ago, but lacked time to do the rest on this power trail.  Arrived early with the mountain bike and got them all!  Not supposed to labor on labor day, and that is one long gradual climb to the top!  This was the fourth cache found and a great hide.

Muggles are sure to be around during busy times in the harbor.  There is even an infra-red camera in this general area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I was attending the Newport Beach annual Christmas Boat Parade tonight and was walking along Via Lido among the various restaurants on the harbor.  People were enjoying dinner, cocktails and the view of the colorfully lighted boats on the water.  The brisk cool air and the reflection of the lights on the water made the evening feel romantic.  I had a cache in my pocket and was ready to use it.  I found a sweet little place to slip it into.  GPS was acting up a bit in this area so please let me know if my coords are on.  Enjoy!  ~EUA</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>This cache is not actually located at the Lido Deck restaurant.  It is located nearby,  close to the water just off of Via Lido.If you are looking at the infra-red camera, the cache is practically looking at you. You finding the cache hinges on you looking around about eye level.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boogers are great stuff...well, at least they are made of great
stuff. I'm sure many of you may disagree, but it is true.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The main ingredient for a booger is snot; and although it is
another unpleasant thing to talk about, it is responsible for
keeping bacteria, from the air we breath, from entering our lungs.
Snot lines the tubes from our nose to our lungs and filters out all
the nasties that fly by. Cilia, little hairs in those tubes, move
the bacteria laden snot away from our lungs to our esophagus where
it gets dumped into our stomachs...ewww!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of that snot drips back out our nose and dries...along with
hoards of crud from the air we breath. And behold, we have a
booger.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Apparently, 70% of the population admits to picking their nose;
however, only 3% of those admit to eating the fruits of their
labors. My question now is, what happens to the other 97% of those
picked boogers? At GZ, I think I know.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It goes without saying, but some things are more frightening than others. A guy in a hockey mask, holding a chainsaw? Scary. A three-headed dog, suddenly roused from sleep? Also scary. The idea of Mick Jagger singing &quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot; during the Rolling Stones 2023 world tour? Scary beyond all measure. Fair warning: when you find this cache, &lt;b&gt;Don't Scream.&lt;/b&gt; Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;A scream is always just that: a noise and not music.&quot;--Carl Jung&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Me and my 14 brothers entered the State Fair's Pie Eating
Contest. Why? Why not! As Freddy, the yougest, would put it,
&quot;Mmmmm, Pie!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With only 50 contestants, we were sure place. And considering how
often it is we get pie, we'd be sure to yum it up! Mom just can't
make that many pies to feed us all.&lt;br /&gt;
So as it was, there was myself, Stan, Milton, Joshua, Frank, Elton
(yes, mom is a big fan), Elvis (that's my dad's doing), Cameron,
Derrik, Zack, Timmothy, Charles, George, Kirk (I suggested that
name), and lastly, Freddy. We all got our bibs and positions and we
got to choose our favorite pie. I chose Chocolate cause it's easy
to suck up. At the &quot;go&quot; we dug in with our hands behind our backs.
I slurped mine down as Freddy, sitting next to me, was having
problems breathing with berry pie filling up his nose. Cameron was
doing pretty good as I could see him in the corner of my eye. I
wasn't sure how I was doing, but I was attempting to beat him at
least. In short order, victory was mine and Cameron came in a close
2nd. Elton came in 3rd, Derrik 4th, Elvis 8th, Stan 10th, Joshua
14th, Milton 16th, Timmothy 18th, Frank 30th, Charles 31st, George
39th, Zack 40th, Freddy 43rd, and Kirk 48th. At least Kirk didn't
come in last. He had difficulty with his braces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was fun and I won the &quot;Pie of the Month&quot; for the next year from
Phylis' Bakery and Pawn Shop.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The word 'Fork' has so
     many meanings. Only in the context of its usage can one
     determine its true meaning; and even that could be a stretch
     for someone not familiar with English phrases. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Fork&lt;/b&gt;: Relating to utensils used in food consumption and
serving...of which there are many.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Fork&lt;/b&gt;: Supports the front wheel of a bicycle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pitch fork&lt;/b&gt;: Tool used to move hay.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;fork()&lt;/b&gt;: A divergent point in software.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tuning Fork&lt;/b&gt;: An instrument, when stuck, produces a constant
audio frequency.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A fork in the road&lt;/b&gt;: A point where one road becomes two.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Fork it over&lt;/b&gt;: To pay or give something owed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the most part, the word refers to or resembles a bifurcation or
separation of something.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is nicely camo'd and shouldn't be to difficult to
find...at least for me. Good luck.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is enough space for small items, coins, bugs, etc.  While this cache is wheelchair accessible, it is typically a busy parking lot and I would emphasize caution.  Please note:  A few people have listed different coords in the log for this cache and none are the same.  Maybe the satellites just don't like this spot? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; -----This cache is a tribute to the animal who provided my dinner tonight.  It is New Years Eve 2010 and I just came to the Newport Mesa area to buy Prime Aged Filet Mignon at $27.99/lb.  While expensive, prime cuts of tenderloin perfectly prepared can be beyond delicious.   It will be prepared with a special gorgonzola sauce and accompanied by a secret creamed corn recipe and a caesar salad with homemade dressing from a recipe that I learned in a culinary class. &lt;br/&gt;Happy New Year 2011 to all and a special thanks to the great volunteer groundspeak reviewers!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is part of a continuing
     series of caches along the Aliso Creek Trail starting at
     Cook’s Corner and going all the way to the ocean. Aliso Creek
     rises in Cleveland National Forest and runs roughly south 13
     miles to the ocean. The trail is paved and very popular in
     some sections, so please be aware of muggles zooming by.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've all done it; dropped a few white lies here and there for
the sake of the game. That sudden errand you need to run when a
cache pops up in the middle of your work day. Or the one at 11pm
and you're scrambling for an excuse to tell your spouse. And don't
forget those log entries. Like the 45min search for the 'Cache and
Dash' you logged. Or maybe a cache you logged twice or didn't even
find at all. Maybe you're not completely dishonest, but, well,
stretching it a little sometimes to make your situation look a
little better. And maybe you're completely honest in your dealings
with caching; in which cache, the world needs more people like
you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So in honor of those who've had to drop a little white lie here and
there, this cache is for you. And even if you are one of those
outstanding pillars of society, here's your chance to have a little
fun...you might even enjoy it and lie a little now and then...but
please, not on your taxes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
IMPORTANT: Everything below the line must be a lie with exception
to the fact that you need to have found the cache. Otherwise,
please leave the truth out of this. Fake logs are fun to read.
Please be creative and, as always, have fun with it. And leave
other geocachers out of it unless you get their permission. We
don't want hurt feelings in the event they can't tell if you're
telling a lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the cache. It is heavily camo'd and out in the open.
Might need several TOTTs to locate and retrieve. The Cache type,
Difficulty, and Terrain are absolutely correct and appropriate
planning is required. Muggles are all around, so you might need a
clown suite to blend in. And because the cache is so large, I've
included a pen. There is plenty of room for swag or anything else
you might want to drop off. Good Luck, you'll really need it.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Interesting placement for a well concealed container.  Used a jet pack to search on high to no avail.  Landed and then quickly found it where it was not originally intended to be so restored it with the jet pack.  Received some strange looks from muggles, but our team is used to such awkward glances.

[b]Best of luck to the next cacher![/b]

Parking isn't too close, but
the walk is easy and enjoyable. Closest leagal parking is probably
Sundowner Park on the SE side of El Toro Rd. Or, better yet, start
at the beginning of the bike trail and work your way down. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Want S'mores or do you want S'more cache? Although S'mores date
back to at least 1927 as a recipe in the Girl Scout Handbook, the
name S'more is still up for debate. Is that the original name, or
is it because after eating one, the inverntors mouth was too full
to correctly pronounce 'some' when requesting more of the dessert;
thus the abbreviation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache shouldn't be too hard to find; and once you've found it, you
just might want to go out and find S'more. And don't forget
national S'More day every August 10th.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please replace the container appropriately for the cammo. </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gardening&lt;/b&gt; is the art of growing plants with the goal of
crafting a purposeful landscape. Although a garden typically is
located on the land near a residence, it may also be located in a
roof, in an atrium, on a balcony, in a windowbox, or on a patio or
vivarium.&lt;br /&gt;
 Gardening also takes place in non-residential green areas, such as
parks, public or semi-public gardens (botanical gardens or
zoological gardens), amusement and theme parks, along
transportation corridors, and around tourist attractions and
hotels. In these situations, a staff of gardeners or groundskeepers
maintains the gardens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Indoor gardening&lt;/b&gt; is concerned with the growing of
houseplants within a residence or building, in a conservatory, or
in a greenhouse. Indoor gardens are sometimes incorporated as part
of air conditioning or heating systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Water gardening&lt;/b&gt; is concerned with growing plants adapted to
pools and ponds. Bog gardens are also considered a type of water
garden. These all require special conditions and considerations. A
simple water garden may consist solely of a tub containing the
water and plant(s).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Container gardening&lt;/b&gt; is concerned with growing plants in any
type of container either indoors or outdoors. Common containers are
pots, hanging baskets, planters, and match stick containers.
Container gardening is usually used in atriums and on balconies,
patios, and roof tops.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The cache is not totally destroyed but heavily damaged. As I was just on a trip from Switzerland I didn't have all the repair stuff with me. I did a emergency repair, put a small paper as a log in a thin plastic bag and placed everything where it - in my opinion - should belong. PM to the owner follows...</groundspeak:text>

Thanks for hiding this cache!

&lt;p&gt;Lockets are generally worn on chains around the
neck and often hold a photo of the person who gave the locket. They
come in many shapes such as ovals, hearts and circles and are
usually made of precious materials.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Lockets usually hold only one or two photographs, but some can
hold items such as locks of hair or even cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This isn't quite a cache and dash; however retrieval isn't too
difficult. There is access to the cache close by, but the terrain
rating would be considered one whole number more difficult. The
parking coords given are where I parked; just watch the signs so
you know where legal parking is. From that parking location, you
should also be able to see the path up to the cache. Use the hint
for a quicker find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK113BA - Parking and start of trail&lt;br /&gt;N 33° 39.039 W 117° 40.900&lt;br /&gt;Parking and the start of the trail (across the street)...short walk...really.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Larger than a Nano, but Log only.  Not much room for other items.   BYOP.  This one is EXTREMELY muggly.  Absolute stealth required. Placing the cache in the EXACT same spot is crucial so that it does not get muggled.  Rated 2.5 for camo and muggle factor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***Congrats to &quot;tvchick&quot; for the FTF on this somewhat challenging cache and the great movie quote*** &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A full spectrum of fun can be had at this location.

Anyone? Anyone?... the Great Depression, passed the... Anyone? Anyone? The tariff bill? The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act? Which, anyone? Raised or lowered?... raised tariffs, in an effort to collect more revenue for the federal government. Did it work? Anyone? Anyone know the effects? It did not work, and the United States sank deeper into the Great Depression. Today we have a similar debate over this. Anyone know what this is? Class? Anyone? Anyone? Anyone seen this before? The Laffer Curve. Anyone know what this says? It says that at this point on the revenue curve, you will get exactly the same amount of revenue as at this point. This is very controversial. Does anyone know what Vice President Bush called this in 1980? Anyone? Something-d-o-o economics. &quot;Voodoo&quot; economics.&quot;   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bueller?  Bueller?

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Cork comes from the &lt;i&gt;Quercus suber&lt;/i&gt; tree. It is a variation
of oak that grows primarily in Portugal and Spain. Cork comes from
the bark of the tree and is harvested by hand once the tree is 9-12
years old. Removal of the bark does not harm the tree and can be
re-harvested every year thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cork is soaked and pressed then cut into sheets and then
stips to form &lt;i&gt;corks&lt;/i&gt;. In the 1600s a French monk, Dom
Pérignon, paved the way for the most widespread use of cork — as a
wine closure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As for the cache, retrieval will require a TOTT; sort of like
getting the cork out of a wine bottle. I used a 3&quot; deck screw, but
other things might work. As for what to do with it, I'll leave that
up to you.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

     series of caches along the Aliso Creek Trail starting at
     Cook’s Corner and going all the way to the ocean. Aliso Creek
     rises in Cleveland National Forest and runs roughly south 13
     miles to the ocean. The trail is paved and very popular in
     some sections, so please be aware of muggles zooming by. 
&lt;p&gt;ArmadillidiumVulgare, Pill Bug, or as referenced by most kids,
Rollie Pollie. These are actually not insects, but rather Crustacea
under the order of Isopoda. You find them under logs or other dark
damp places. They actually need moisture because they breath
through gills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are quite a few of these around here. This is a forgotten
area with decaying leaves, decaying picnic table, and decaying
chain link fence; although the rollie pollies won't eat the
fence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a custom black container with little
resemblance to the rollie pollie itself.&lt;/p&gt;

Very well done container and placement.  This is a really fun trail.  Took nothing and left a signature item.

I put the batteries into my pocket and followed him out to his car. I watched at he got in then hit his head against the steering wheel. He was hurting bad, he needed a fix. Then what I saw I could not believe. John reached down and brought up a new package of AA batteries. As he opened the package he sniffed them like opening a new bag of coffee. I knew then I had to do something. Being his sponsor is hard. So I e-mailed Elias as Geocaching and asked that on Sunday all insta-notifys be turned off until 10:00am. Knowing that John goes out at 5:00am to 8:30am on weekends he did not have a chance to slip and grab this new cache. I watched gc.com and saw this cache publish. I drove out to GZ and grabbed the cache at 8:30am. I grabbed the coin too. 

John this is not going to be easy but you can do it I know you can. You really need to work on your 12 steps.

These last few years have been a real shock to the system for everyone, especially anyone in construction or real estate! This whole economy is going down the tubes! Still, some new construction of homes is going on near here? These empty lots and hillsides are still being built out with homes. The company I work for is one of the sub-contractors on a nearby tract home development. The builder told us in a conference, as long as there is land in Irvine &amp; Tustin, the homes keep selling as fast as we build them! I need to meet more of these new home buyers in this economy and find out where the cash flow and credit approval they are getting is coming from!

You're looking for a small cache on a slope surrounding the park.
After you find it, it's entirely possible you might exclaim,

FOUND IT!  Brilliant hide.  

Signed the log, no time to trade, got the heck out of there!

Maybe she was Mrs CIP messing with TGR?

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When ripe, the pumpkin can be boiled, baked, steamed, or roasted. In its native North America, it is a very important, traditional part of the autumn harvest, eaten mashed and making its way into soups and purees. In Mexico and the U.S., the seeds are often roasted and eaten as a snack. Often, it is made into pie, various kinds of which are a traditional staple of the Canadian and American Thanksgiving holiday. Pumpkins that are still small and green may be eaten in the same way as squash or zucchini. Pumpkins can also be mashed (similar to mashed potatoes) or incorporated into soup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;East China Normal University research on type-1 diabetic rats, published in July 2007, suggests that chemical compounds found in pumpkin promote regeneration of damaged pancreatic cells, resulting in increased bloodstream insulin levels. According to the research team leader, pumpkin extract may be &quot;a very good product for pre-diabetic people, as well as those who already have diabetes,&quot; possibly reducing or eliminating the need for insulin injections for some type-1 diabetics. It is unknown whether pumpkin extract has any effect on diabetes mellitus type 2, as it was not the subject of the study.&lt;br/&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

find this Bonus cache, way into The Mouth That
Devours&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;b&gt;Start your Journey at the Posted

until you have reached GC1RYKM, from that point continue into the
&quot;Mouth&quot; until you can &quot;see the light&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
You will see &quot;The Buck Stops Here&quot; painted on the wall, look up at
the &quot;light&quot; to grab the Cache.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;b&gt;This cache can be dangerous, and
should not be undertaken by the weak of heart. DO NOT attempt this
cache if it is raining, or is about to rain.&lt;br /&gt;
As always, use common sense while finding this cache and don't take
any unnecessary risks.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache is neither of these things; yet, it probably wouldn't
be too much of a stretch at to what you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is just a little bit off trail but shouldn't be hard to
get to. I tagged this cache as being near poison plants; yet there
is no poison oak immediately around the cache or on the way to it
from the trail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good Luck and have fun..&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It seemed to be among over grown shrubs and bushes that would not allow access to the exact GPS point. There are now three roads around it. There is a paved bike trail running along the Santa Ana River, that is just feet from two dirt roads separated by a fence. It seems that the cache point is somewhere by the fence among the dense shrubbery.

Potentially a nice adventure to get there, but it was disappointing for new GeoCachers to have some validation that we had arrived.</groundspeak:text>

I dunno, in my book, genius exists in many shapes and forms. Among
others, I'd suggest that Miles Davis, Bill Gates, and Frank Lloyd
Wright fall into the &quot;G&quot; category. You've probably got your own
list.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some folks think it's a numbers thing. Get a high score on a MENSA
test, and you're in the club. Others (like me) believe you really
can't measure creativity. Try applying some sort of formula to &quot;The
Marriage of Figaro.&quot; I can't see how that would ever work. Anyhoo,
the following questions are designed to test the mental abilities
of a very specific demographic: children. If you can solve
&lt;b&gt;G is for Genius,&lt;/b&gt; you are very
likely smarter than a 5th grader. ;-) Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;

[b]TGR SHALL FIND IT![/b]

But a prayer is in order first, per the cache namesake:

[i]The Admin is my confidant; I shall not DNF.
He maketh me maintain those muggled caches and JJG leadeth me beside the still waters here.
He unarchives my caches; he leadeth me in ways that are all good for the game's greatness.
Yeah, though I trespass through the valley of Irvine and tough hides, I will fear no evil: for Garmin is with me; my receiver and smart phone, they comfort me.
JJG camo's this cache before me, in the presence of bushes: to make me search and toil; my confidence runneth over.
Surely goodness and prowess shall follow me all the finds of my life: and I will dwell in the house of GroundSpeak for ever.  AMEN![/i]

My favorite is Raspberry Lemonade.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Raspberry Lemonade&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3/4 cup sugar&lt;br /&gt;
1/2 cup water&lt;br /&gt;
1 cup fresh lemon juice (about 4 lemons)&lt;br /&gt;
3 1/2 cups water&lt;br /&gt;
1 container (10 ounces) frozen raspberries in syrup, thawed&lt;br /&gt;
3/4 cup water 1.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mix sugar and 1/2 cup water in 1-quart saucepan. Cook over medium
heat, stirring once, until sugar is dissolved. Cool to room
temperature. 2. Mix cooled sugar syrup, the lemon juice and 3 1/2
cups water in 2-quart nonmetal pitcher. Place raspberries in
strainer over small bowl to drain (do not press berries through
strainer). Reserve berries for making ice cubes. Stir raspberry
liquid into lemon mixture; refrigerate. 3. Spoon raspberries evenly
into 12 sections of ice-cube tray. Divide 3/4 cup water evenly
among sections with raspberries. Freeze about 2 hours or until
firm. Serve lemonade over ice cubes.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Was it open fields for miles and miles growing beans and some citrus or was it fields and fields concentrated with oil rigs?  Have seen a few pictures documenting the latter in the early history of Huntington Beach so one wonders ... thanks for the historic point out!  Just think, one hundred years from now, someone may stand at this park to read a plaque honoring those HB geocachers who came before, to network communities through the placement of hidden geocaches!  Why should there only be one plaque in Oregon - every city is important ... it can happen!  [;)]

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">After performing some maintenance and camo swap on a nearby placement, I left with extra cache in my pocket.  I decided to do a quick easy hide on my way home.  This is a very easy 1/1 if you have seen this type of hide before.  It is a wheelchair accessible PnG.  Don't get booted out.  Smaller than a micro, larger than a nano. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; History&lt;br/&gt;•Leather boots have a 5,000-year history. The first leather foot coverings were stuffed with straw and served as protection against the rough terrain and severe climate of the Bronze Age. The ancient Mesopotamians, starting in 3000 B.C., were the first innovators of laced-up leather boots; their boots were calf-high and made from goat leather. In 1616, leather boots began to be used for everyday and high fashion wear. &lt;br/&gt;Function&lt;br/&gt;•Initially, leather boots were used to protect the feet and legs of military personnel and horseback riders. When different styles of leather boots began to appear, simple functionality began to give way to elegant design. &lt;br/&gt;Size&lt;br/&gt;•Leather boots are cut in differing lengths that range from the ankle to mid-thigh. Boots for men are usually flat or have a one-inch heel; the heels on women's leather boots are made as high as five inches. &lt;br/&gt;Types&lt;br/&gt;•The varying types of leather boots include: thigh-highs, gusset, half boots, Hessian, Wellington, short ankle, cowboy and the biker's. &lt;br/&gt;Thigh-high boots were the predominant style of the 16th and 17th centuries; they were fastened with laces and protected the knees and lower legs of horseback riders and soldiers. Gusset boots were elasticized and provided faster wear and removal than boots fastened with laces, hooks or buttons. Half boots can either be elasticized or laced, and only come up to the knee. Hessian boots, also called Souvaroffs, are a man's knee-high boot that has a V shape cut in the front; these boots were introduced into England from Germany and were popular in the 19th century, until they were replaced by the Wellington style. Wellington boots, named after the Duke of Wellington, who defeated Napoleon, are characterized by their form-fitting design, waterproof nature and thick soles; they replaced the Hessian style since they were easier to wear underneath trousers. Short ankle boots became popular in the early 20th century, are usually elasticized or fastened with a zipper, and only come up to the ankle. Cowboy boots have a higher heel, rise to the mid-calf, are usually for men, and are often ornately designed or two toned. Biker's boots provide traction and protection against motorcycle engine heat. &lt;br/&gt;Geography&lt;br/&gt;•Leather boots originated in ancient Mesopotamia but are found worldwide. Designs for the various types of leather boots come from countries such as Italy, Germany, England, France and the United States&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though I find most country music painful to my ears, I do love wearing boots from time to time. </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
You're looking for a micro that's been camouflaged to blend in. I suppose that's a bit redundant; I can't think of camo that wouldn't. This one is located on a public trail within shouting distance of a gated community. It's positioned a couple of steps from the pavement, so there's no bushwhacking required. Despite the name and big build-up, &lt;b&gt;Residential Evil&lt;/b&gt; shouldn't be too hard to find. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;As the strong man exults in his physical ability, delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories the analyst in that moral activity which disentangles. He derives pleasure from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talents into play. He is fond of enigmas, of conundrums, of hieroglyphics; exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of acumen which appears to the ordinary apprehension preternatural.&quot;--Edgar Allan Poe, from The Murders in the Rue Morgue&lt;br /&gt;

Or could this be the entrance to a new kingdom at Disneyland? [;)]

Looked where the cache was found before and got it very quickly, not needing to consult the GPSr.

As for the 1/2 million for a bridge instead of a less expensive stop sign and crosswalk that accomplishes the same purpose, it is what it is.  One wonders if they could have raised that money privately for this bridge, rather than seeking money from the state?    Don't taxpayers make those grants possible?  Hmmmm

So there's a park in Irvine without a cache. It happens. Actually, there's none in the &quot;Great Park&quot; yet, but when that thing opens, I'll wager that dozens of new ones will pop up. How many geocaches can this planet hold? I dunno, &lt;b&gt;The Sky's the Limit,&lt;/b&gt; I guess.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.&quot;--Dennis Miller&lt;br /&gt;

The at sign (@, read aloud in English as &quot;at&quot;) is a typographic symbol most commonly used as an abbreviation in accounting and commercial invoices, in statements such as &quot;7 widgets @ $2 ea. = $14&quot;. More recently, the at symbol has become ubiquitous due to its use in email addresses.

It is often referred to informally as the at symbol, the at sign, or just at. In Israel @ is often referred to as a &quot;strudel;&quot; in Dutch, a &quot;apenstaart;&quot; in Italian a &quot;chiocciola;&quot; in French, &quot;arrobase&quot; or &quot;a commercial&quot;. Sometimes it is called a monkey because it looks like a monkey with its tail wrapped around it. It has the official name commercial at in the ANSI/CCITT/Unicode character encoding standards and can also be used has a cache holder.

Not intended to be a cache and dash, but who knows, you might get
lucky. It isn't buried, but it will take a sharp eye to recognize
it for what it is. Although it is hard, go ahead and use the hints.
When you find the container, squeeze the sides of the uncamouflaged
part and pull to get the log.</groundspeak:long_description>

Based on the time of the find, 5:11PM, was not the first to look for this cache.  Great description and added up the clues to make this find.  Spectral discrimination is the key.  Great evil hide!  It took 11 minutes to find.

They do perform a valuable beta testing service that verifies cache placements, accurate coordinates, and observations to whet one's caching appetite with their on-line logs.  IWILLFINDIT is now world reknown thanks to this week's podcacher podcast so props for the deserved notoriety and cute cache contributions to the local scene.  This was a nice C&amp;D and recall several prior visits to this area to park and hit the nearby bike trail access.

&lt;br /&gt;
Thomas Jonathan Jackson, a general in the Confederate Army during the Civil War, is often considered one of the greatest battlefield leaders in U.S. history. His Valley Campaign in 1862 and the way he surrounded the Union troops at Chancellorsville are frequently cited as innovative tactical maneuvers. Jackson died on May 10, 1863 of complications from an amputated arm and pneumonia after being accidentally shot by his own men.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hey! What's up with the name of the cache? Well, it's safe to say that Jackson was a &quot;subordinate&quot; of General Lee, at least according to most history books. ;-) You're looking for a micro that's been carefully placed with a rather simple attachment device. I'm guessing you'll find &lt;b&gt;Generally Subordinate&lt;/b&gt; without any major problems. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;

Looks like this is the one where fire shot out the top. Won't happen anymore unless you want a big fiery torch. Looked all over for a history on this, but none I could find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make sure you re-hide well out of view, but please keep it in the same spot. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park near N33 40.723 W117 39.735. The cache is 3ft or so off the ground in a 'geo hole' within inches of a pipe covered in baby blue.</groundspeak:long_description>

     series of caches along the Aliso Creek Trail starting at
     Cook’s Corner and going all the way to the ocean. Aliso Creek
     rises in Cleveland National Forest and runs roughly south 13
     miles to the ocean. The trail is paved and very popular in
     some sections, so please be aware of muggles zooming by. 
&lt;p&gt;Being the first cache of this new series of caches, you're
progress to the beach will not be quick as there are caches to
find. And therefore, your speed down this trail will be at a
snail's pace in comparison to the other walkers, runners, and
cyclists who frequent this trail. TOTT not required. Please be
careful with the camo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And although the area seems almost urban, please be careful of the
area and wildlife.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Had a strong suspicion of what it was that we were looking for having recently seen this hide in Placentia and the first done by the same hider on another bike trail in Irvine.

Lots to do: playground, hockey, volleyball,&lt;br /&gt;baseball, tennis, and basket ball. The containers' container&lt;br /&gt;shouldn't be hard to find, but it might leave you scratching your&lt;br /&gt;head. Just know that retrieval is from the middle, not the top&lt;br /&gt;(that's for returning)...it will make sense when you see it. Be&lt;br /&gt;sure to leave everything as you found it. Oh, the pennies in the&lt;br /&gt;cache are for weight...they help make it work so be sure to put&lt;br /&gt;them on top. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, bring a small tool (small flathead screwdriver)...to fully appreciate the cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my note posted September 10, 2008 ...from the park above, go down the slope to the opening in the [chain link] fence. 2nd fence post on the right. Coords are just approximate for now since I didn't anticipate moving it. If you like to give me better coords, I welcome it; however, following the directions in this note should get you to the cache just fine....

&lt;br /&gt;
You're looking for a micro that's been painted. Actually, it was spray-painted (camo-style), then covered with a layer or two of clearcoat. Here's hoping it lasts; even the best geocache is subject to the elements, muggle intervention, and other unforeseen circumstances. I wonder if a cache container has ever been hit by lightning. Anybody heard of such a thing? Perhaps &lt;b&gt;Inigo Might Know.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

changed much. Sure, the racquets are made from graphite and other
modern materials now, but the object is still the same: hit the
ball over the net until your opponent goofs up. A few other rules
apply, I suppose. Anyway, relax a bit, practice your
&lt;b&gt;Backhand,&lt;/b&gt; and have fun!&lt;br /&gt;

Did it move into the evil clutches of a gardener?  You bageled me on this one!

The Geo-Ranger is a former college and ranked SCTA play'r, pre-geocaching. Junior geo-rangers are following in dad's footsteps.  There have been some subtle changes to the game.  For instance, the NCAA college game has changed a bit as there is no &quot;Let&quot; on a serve. A rule change to speed up the game. The equipment has certainly evolved too as you attest. The Prince Pro was one of the first oversize raquets that helped revolutionize that aspect of the game. More emphasis on the serve &amp; volley power game today with the new raquets versus the classical back-court style game that used to be popular and dominated women's tennis. Serena and the other big hitters certainly changed that too. It's looks more like the men's game now.

resides, her and many elderly, fantastic folks live out there days.
When she was young, she loved to climb trees, She can't do that
anymore but loves to talk about it still. I told her about
Geocaching, and she loves to hear about it, but because of
Alzheimer's disease she wont remember it, but the visits offer her
enjoyment just the same.

Happy changed her username and moved up to Central CA and still caches, just not in our area anymore, and less often.  Skippy kept the original H&amp;S name and am not sure if he is still active?  They put out many many hides in the OC and Riverside County and their considerable creativity is greatly appreciated and missed!  Dropped a geocoin.

Thanks for the cache!

I moved over against my car to review the logs as a lot of traffic was hooting for Happy Hour. Then a nice car with a female pulled up and at first I thought it might have been a worker, til she got out and I saw how she was dressed. Then she asked me if I was a geocacher and I asked her the same. It turned out to be IWillFindIt!!. She pulled out her TOTT and was able to locate the cache where I thought I had looked, but didn't see. Then I made the reach and claimed the cache and a new caching friend. TNSL.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This multi begins at the posted coords and makes its way through several waypoints and different styles of caches. As listed in the attributes: &quot;UV Required&quot;. It is best if you do this one in the dark. You should have glowing results! You may even find the sun in the dark and the place the itsy bitsy spider went. The final stage of this multi is almost large enough to fit a football in, if the the opening was a bit larger. Another TOTT you will need for this cache is a small step stool. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Free TGIF Appetizer or Dessert and other goodies for FTF. This cache is roomy so if you have large items to swap into it, bring them with you. Unfortunately I had to place all of the waypoints for this multi with my phone without my supplemental GPSr so please let me know if any coords are off. I apologize in advance if any are. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A black light, also referred to as a UV light (Ultra Violet Light), is a lamp that emits electromagnetic radiation almost exclusively in the soft near ultraviolet range that is only partially visible.[citation needed] Black light sources may be made from specially designed fluorescent lamps, mercury vapor lamps, light-emitting diodes, or incandescent lamps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The place on the edge of the visible spectrum gives black light its notable characteristics. It is mainly seen by humans using the low-light receptors in the eye, because the low-light receptors are the most sensitive to near ultra-violet.[citation needed] The low-light receptors however also have the distinctive feature that they are more accurate in the peripheral vision, this means black light always will look out of focus when looked at directly.[citation needed]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black light sources have many uses. They may be employed for decorative and artistic lighting effects, for diagnostic and therapeutic uses in medicine, for the eradication of microorganisms, for the observation or detection of substances tagged with other substances that exhibit a fluorescent effect, for the curing of plastic resins and for attracting insects. Strong sources of long-wave ultraviolet light are used in tanning beds. Black light lamps are used for the detection of counterfeit money. Most artificial ultraviolet sources are low power. Powerful ultraviolet sources present a hazard to eyes and skin; apparatus using these sources requires personal protective equipment&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;HB's First Night Cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;A cool type of fire fly has arrived in HB, they are hiding out
in a dark and creepy place, and can only bee seen after dark.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;They have lined up in a path that leads to the rare queen
fire fly, she is bright red, and shines bright when the light of a
cachers flashlight shines on her.&lt;br /&gt;
I have hidden my cache within 10 feet of the rare Red Firefly,
there you will find the cache, and the coordinates of 3 more Bonus
caches that you can find on your return trip to the starting
point.&lt;br /&gt;
The Bonus caches are: Bonus1
GC2HE1D Bonus2 GC2HE1H
Bonus3 GC2HE1W&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AT the starting point, use your light to find the first fire
fly, then follow there twinkling path.&lt;br /&gt;
This is best done with just a 2 cell led flashlight, to bright a
light will make them harder to see, hold your light next to your
head at eye level and scan the horizon as you walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Have fun hunting these caches in The dark!, and don't go
alone!&lt;/b&gt;

Found the guardian and a can of paint left behind by a tagger, before finding this cache.

Saving the bonus caches for searching with daylight.

Enjoyed how you set this up with the street sign numbers and kept everything in the same area!  Good job ... on to the wild side multi!

After much planning, I have prepared a new and exciting challenge
for you. Called &lt;b&gt;Around the World in 80
Caches!&lt;/b&gt;, it requires patience, ingenuity, and the
ability to handle the unexpected. In this journey, you will be
venturing into several countries, 80 in all, in search of concealed
artifacts. The countries will lead you to continents, and the
continents will lead you to the ultimate prize, hereafter known as
&quot;The World.&quot; Based on your experience and past adventures, I am
confident you will succeed. As always, travel safe and be sure to
document your findings. I look forward to hearing all about your
grand expedition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your great admirer,&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; Information in this cache will help you

&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Mexico&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The United Mexican States commonly known as Mexico s a
federal constitutional republic in North America. It is bordered on
the north by the United States; on the south and west by the
Pacific Ocean; on the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the
Caribbean Sea; and on the east by the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;
Mexico is a federation comprising thirty-one states and a federal
district, the capital Mexico City, whose metropolitan area is one
of the world's most populous.&lt;br /&gt;
The war of Mexican independence was one of the longest in America
that ended in 1821, which eventually led to the independence and
creation of the ephemeral First Mexican Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

My GPS on second read showed 33 42.107 N 117.45.173 &lt;br/&gt;I think it was because I was trying to stay covered from the rain and log at the same time. If FTF could confirm coords, I would appreciate it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; My family is Italian and I love cooking with different seasonings and spices.  One that I really enjoy a light touch of is fresh Rosemary. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you visit this cache site there is more fresh Rosemary here than you could possibly cook with in many lifetimes.  You may even wish to bring a ziplock bag with you so you can take some home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was here at night and this covered location has huge wood tables inside and made me wish I had a candle, dinner and a bottle of red wine with me.

Good thing when I did cause I was lucky this time and found a blank log. No sooner had I replaced the container and started to head toward my car that TVChick pulled up. I tucked into the shadows to let her look for it some before I stepped out and we started chatting. We both agreed that we enjoyed this hide. If you've enjoyed EUA's nicely trimmed bush, then you may remember how he described himself and bring your TOTTs as needed. Thanks for the night time fun EUA, even if I didn't get to enjoy the Lunar Eclipse tonight.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">June, 1928. The &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot; are in full swing. Calvin
Coolidge is in the White House, rolling back taxes and managing a
booming economy. Mae West is taking Broadway by storm with a daring
new play called &quot;Diamond Lil,&quot; and in Hollywood, a young Walt
Disney is putting the finishing touches on something called
&quot;Steamboat Willie.&quot; It is, for many Americans, a time of prosperity
and excess.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You're a private eye with a bottle for a best friend. One day, a
looker by the name of Monica Powell opens the door to your office.
She saunters across the room and drops a file on your desk. You
consider asking how she obtained a confidential police file about
her famous father, but then you eyeball her dress; she's got more
curves than a roller coaster in an earthquake. You thumb through
the paperwork and pick up the summary, written by a Sergeant Duffy.
It reads:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;G. Harold Powell was a smart cookie. With a master's degree from
Cornell, he advised Orange County citrus farmers on topics ranging
from cold storage to disease eradication. As general manager of the
Irvine Valencia Growers Exchange, he advised the cooperative to
build a packing house, and even went so far as to recommend a
contractor, F.S. Bishop Construction. Harry was not without his
enemies, however. One of the competing bids, submitted by Walter
Shepherd, was considered the front-runner until Powell convinced
the growers that the bid was fixed. In a rage, Shepherd cornered
Powell in a dark alley, and rubbed him out.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You close the file and look Monica square in the eye. &quot;So Daddy
took a slug for double-crossing Shepherd? Seems like a done deal to
me,&quot; you conclude. Monica takes a deep breath, then responds,
&quot;Although the case was closed, I don't believe Shepherd was the
trigger man. Before he died, my father wrote a letter that fingered
the real killer. Find it, and I'd be so very grateful.&quot; You open a
drawer, but instead of reaching for the whiskey, you grab a Smith

Luckily though I was taking pics of all material since I had grabbed a wrong number at my 1st stop and didn't notice til the end. So I just looked at my pics and corrected my math and on my way to find the cache I was. In the dark, at 2:30am it was harder to see than if I had come during the daytime, but still a nice multi.

This service is quite necessary for newbie hiders, but not veteran cachers like [b]bajatym[/b].  The coordinates for his hides are always right on, the camo is above average or excellent, and sometimes he garners extra style points, like this one!  For a nanosecond, thought this might become the second oldest hide ever found by our team!  HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN CACHING ANYWAY???!!!!  [;)]

Good one and other geocachers will smile too at ground zero, so come on down to [b][blue]HB[/b][/blue] and pick yourself a [i][green]nano booger[/i][/green]!  

Your cache is greatly appreciated!  [:D]

Easy PnG &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I remember growing up in Irvine years ago when the Tustin Air Base was still operational.  The sound of military helicopters was often in the air near the two huge hangars across the street from this little retail strip center.  Today a shopping center and homes have been built over the area next to where two retired mammoth military monoliths still stand.  I was over in this little center today and stopped to get an iced tea. I thought about how Irvine and Tustin have changed and grown and I wanted to pay tribute to men and women who flew over this area and served our country in the military green whirlybirds once upon a time.</groundspeak:long_description>

We couldn't beat their speed to a new cache in the early days, prior to that 1st FTF, so the best opportunity was with a new cache that they placed!  Ahhhh, one never forgets their FIRST blank log. Many local guppies that have earned their razor sharp teeth know what this is all about!

As for the hide locale, it has all the indications of a twopoms-esque site, however the placement is excellent and a good container too.

Good job on this one and TFTC!

However, lots of evidence left from the activity of the eve prior.  The area looks like the entire guppy and gull nation participated in an [b]FTF[/b] dance around GZ all night long!

Not to worry, the worked over area provided reassurance that one never has to look at the GPS to comprehend what this one entails!  [^]

Tactic Number 1 failed. [B)] Tactic Number 2 met the same disappointing outcome. [B)] Improvised a third TOTT but that also failed. [B)]  Hmmm, this one [i]is[/i] good!    Back to the all terrain prius for a fourth TOTT.  Hmmm, nope, that one won't work either, but how about this?  

Went back to GZ another time, and tried again, and something slipped and uh, oh, missing part of the TOTT. [:I] 

Regroup, let's get TOTT Tactic Number 1 and see if the other TOTT can be retrieved?   Great, got the TOTT back, but what's this, there's something else now ...  

[red][b]GOTCHA!!![/b][/red] [:P]

Man those guppies can be slippery ...

Great decoration on this cache!

Thanks for another fun cache and all you do to keep the game novel and fresh [b]Bajatym[/b]!   [^]

secured cache container&lt;br /&gt;
Then you will need to need to do a Combination of things to access
the log.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
Obey the Flashing signs near by,
and follow the directions on the graph below on this
page
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 




Walk East to
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
 

 

Walk South to
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
 


 
 

 


 Walk North
to
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 


 

Walk West to
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
Look carefully at all 4 spots,
save what you find in order and you will have&lt;br /&gt;
what you Need to do The Deed!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
This will test your skills at
performing in front of muggles&lt;br /&gt;
Just be confident in your actions and you will be
fine.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
Best to sign the log away from GZ,
then return it with confidence, there is nothing&lt;br /&gt;
they can do about anyway :)
&lt;br /&gt;

Gathered the necessary info, then went directly to the final, did not pass &quot;Go&quot;. The container took a little strong-armin' to get open, but it finally cooperated. T-small football, L-trading cards and a small pipe wrench. ;-) Nice job on this one, baja. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Have found the cache that is referenced in the cache description as well as others that emulate it in the Downey and South OC areas.  Glad to see that we now have a hide like it in our area too.  Very clever with the cache page and clues as to the ancillary info needed to sign the log.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Steven Spielberg actually applied to the USC film school, but they
turned him down. Three times. D'oh! I seem to remember reading the
school responded years later with a &quot;had-we-known&quot; type of
statement. It's been well-documented that Steven, the son of an
engineer and a concert pianist, started playing around with movie
cameras at a young age. Today, well.. he's a legendary director,
what more can you say?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You're looking for a micro that's got a cinematic theme. Lots of
folks saw Spielberg's 1975 &quot;fish&quot; movie; it had a big finish. It
shouldn't take longer than &lt;b&gt;A Spielberg
Moment&lt;/b&gt; to find this one. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;

hold out the container. &quot;Oh, that's one of those geocache things.
I've seen those before,&quot; she says. &quot;The place you want to hide that
is,&quot; she looks and points, &quot;right... there.&quot; Before I can say
anything she's gone, walking down a path, clutching some sort of
silver book. What an odd encounter, I think to myself. Even now,
several minutes later, it seems odd.&lt;br /&gt;

though he drops the last &quot;B&quot; quite often. The address of 43's

A former cacher and daughter stopped by to offer assistance but they hadn't found it and stopped caching over a year ago, but they knew what I was up to ... should have gone to the hint sooner than ten minutes of searching for devious camo.  They declined to sign the log but hinted that they may return to the game form their leave of absence.  This cache is well hidden and blends in great.  'Camo oblivious' is the diagnosis for the malady temporarily suffered while searching for this nice sized cache!  Thank you sir, may I have another?!

the title of an old Paul McCartney song. After further review (as
they say in the NFL), I went with the name above. Sometimes simpler
is better. Among other things, the term &quot;magneto&quot; refers to a small
alternator, and when capitalized, a recurring character in the
&quot;X-Men&quot; series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Magneat-o&lt;/b&gt; shouldn't be too hard to
find, but I've said that before. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;

If you &quot;rock out&quot; and do the Hokey Pokey you are sure to find this one. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Please be sure to put this back exactly the way I left it so that gardeners do not muggle it.  Also please be sure to paper clip the log tightly after you sign it.  Many thanks and enjoy Peter Cottontail.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Maybe it's the alluring pink bar on my GPSr, but for whatever
reason I like #29 best. She's got a way about her: lurking in the
dark, one eye always open. No one knows her real name or where she
came from, two key facts that people just can't seem to
uncover.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I know, I know. There's plenty of imitators, lots of wannabe-29s.
But in my book, she's original, she's innovative, she's always
there. In your face, Skylab! Here's my prediction: you will find
&lt;b&gt;I Heart 29&lt;/b&gt; without losing your
signal. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Every so often, I like to go to the window, look up, and smile for
a satellite picture.&quot;--Stephen Wright&lt;br /&gt;

As for getting to GZ, that took a little planning. Finding the way in was half the battle. And for the record, the store with the sign missing a few letters sells futons. ;-) Anyhoo, once we parked the car, we hopped out, read the description, and avoided those things it said to avoid. What's up with the truck? Can't say I've ever seen a sandbag-type of window before. I guess that's what happens when thugs bust the glass and you need a low-cost remedy. Searched the cab of the truck for a bit, but the cache wasn't in there, thankfully. Scoured the area a few more times before DD made a significant discovery. Yowzer, that's a toughie! In the end, though, names was added to the log, and the south county party of four headed home. Nice way to finish up the night. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br /&gt;
The domestic dog, Canis familiaris, has been developed into many
fantastically diverse breeds. Let’s find out more about them
and what they were created for. &lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The posted coordinates are not
correct.&lt;/b&gt; They are for for another Dog friendly place
Bailey and I like to visit. To determine where the cache is,
you’ll have to learn more about different breeds of dogs. A
Google search will help you find the answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;What Kind of Dog is That?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. My webbed feet, water-resistant coat, and rudder-like tail
make me an excellent swimmer. I am famous for rescuing drowning
people. Although I am a superior water dog, I have been used and am
still used in my place of origin as a true working dog, dragging
carts, or more often carrying burdens as a pack horse. I am a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0. Newfoundland&lt;br /&gt;
1. Irish Water Spaniel&lt;br /&gt;
2. Portuguese Water Dog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. I was first recorded as a breed around 1700, and have changed
little since then. I got my name from a character in a book written
in 1814 by Sir Walter Scott. I am hardy, long-lived and devoted. I
am a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Parson Russell Terrier&lt;br /&gt;
4. Dandie Dinmont Terrier&lt;br /&gt;
5. Harrier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. I came to be known as an Alsatian at the end of WWII, due to
anti-German sentiment. I have a well-earned reputation as family
companion, guide dog, police dog, and herder. I am a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. German Pinscher&lt;br /&gt;
6. German Shorthair Pointer&lt;br /&gt;
7. German Shepherd Dog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. I originated in Belgium as a guardian of canal barges and to
catch vermin. My name means “little captain of the
boat”. I am a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Schipperke&lt;br /&gt;
6. Belgian Malinois&lt;br /&gt;
7. Brussels Griffon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E. My name means “Badger Dog” but in my homeland I
am known as a Deutsche Teckel. I was bred to hunt badgers, so I am
tough and courageous. I am still used to hunt above and below
ground, and am a popular family pet. I am a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Miniature Pinscher&lt;br /&gt;
2. Dachshund&lt;br /&gt;
3. Schnauzer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F. I have the head of a lamb and the heart of a lion. In
addition to my unique appearance, I am known for my speed,
endurance, and prowess for hunting vermin. I am a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Leonberger&lt;br /&gt;
6. Bedlington Terrier&lt;br /&gt;
7. Bichon Frise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G. My dreadlocks may make you think I’m from Jamaica, but
I am an ancient breed from Hungary. I was bred to guard flocks of
sheep or other livestock against predators such as wolves, coyotes,
feral dogs, or human predators. Maintaining my white coat takes a
massive amount of work! I am a&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
0. Komondor&lt;br /&gt;
1. Vizsla&lt;br /&gt;
2. Kuvasz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H. My roots are in Egypt, but I get my name from one of the
Balearic Islands off the coast of Spain. I have been kept there for
over two thousand years to hunt rabbits. I am even-tempered,
affectionate, and loyal. I clean myself much like a cat. I need a
lot of exercise, and can jump to great heights from a standstill. I
am a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Saluki&lt;br /&gt;
6. Pharaoh Dog&lt;br /&gt;
7. Ibizan Hound&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I. I am one of the few breeds that originated in the USA. I am
lively and intelligent, and my nickname is American Gentleman. I
was originally bred as a pit fighting dog, but now I am the best of
companions. I am a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Boston Terrier&lt;br /&gt;
5. Catahoula Leopard Dog&lt;br /&gt;
6. American Water Spaniel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. I originated in Pre-Renaissance Europe where I was a
companion to ladies of the court. My name means “little
lion”. I am alert, intelligent, and affectionate. I am a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Kyi Leo&lt;br /&gt;
6. Löwchen&lt;br /&gt;
7. Leonberger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache is at N33° IB.EFH W117° DC.JGA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Parking is very close&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is a medium size Tupperware box with a log and some
SWAG&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I'm not really a dog person, although we did have a wonderful German Shepherd when I was growing up. &quot;Clancy&quot; was a great dog, very affectionate and protective. For whatever reason, he didn't like getting a bath. I'm not sure what it was, but the poor guy had a real aversion to water. Sure enough, any time someone grabbed the hose to water the lawn or plants, the dog would assume a bath was coming, and he'd leap the chain-link fence surrounding the yard. That meant calling out the search party, although he'd typically hide near the basement steps. Yep, he really didn't like water.

Holy cow, this is puzzle find #500 for me. That means I can go after the nearby &quot;Half a Kilo&quot; challenge. ;-) Thanks, bajatym! TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

suspension, swing, and so on. If you've been to Tom Sawyer island
at Disneyland, you might've seen the
wooden-planks-on-floating-barrels version. I'm no expert, but the
bridge at this particular GZ seems pretty sound. Kudos to all those
engineers out there that make &lt;b&gt;Spanning the
Globe&lt;/b&gt; possible. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;It is not good to cross the bridge before you get to it.&quot;--Judi

But I was in the wrong place and had to cross a raging river and then scale a mountain side. But I was able to make the grab. I got back to my car and say the other new cache was .39 from here. Well forget the car run Mike run. So off I went. No parking issues. :) Thanks JJG</groundspeak:text>

I found the Desert Plant Poster most interesting. This will also give time to sort out the muggle factor before you make the grab. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plenty of free parking is very near the starting point, depending on time of day. Just after working hours on weekdays can be very busy here. The park is very well lit if you want to search after dark, but bring a flashlight! Absolutely No Bushwhacking or stepping on any plant life needed!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have Fun! and as always watch for muggles when removing and replacing the treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FC19XKZ - Cache Locacion&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Treasure Chest</groundspeak:long_description>

pencil. Bring your TOTT's! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
 One
     lovely summer day in 1948, a Swiss amateur-mountaineer and
     inventor decided to take his dog for a nature hike. The man
     and his faithful companion both returned home covered with
     burrs, the plant seed-sacs that cling to animal fur in order
     to travel to fertile new planting grounds. The man neglected
     his matted dog, and with a burning curiosity ran to his
     microscope and inspected one of the many burrs stuck to his
     pants. He saw all the small hooks that enabled the
     seed-bearing burr to cling so viciously to the tiny loops in
     the fabric of his pants. George de Mestral raised his head
     from the microscope and smiled thinking, &quot;I will design a
     unique, two-sided fastener, one side with stiff hooks like the
     burrs and the other side with soft loops like the fabric of my
     pants. I will call my invention 'velcro' a combination of the
     word velour and crochet. It will rival the zipper in its
     ability to fasten.&quot; 
&lt;p&gt;

Mestral's idea met with resistance and even laughter, but the
inventor 'stuck' by his invention. Together with a weaver from a
textile plant in France, Mestal perfected his hook and loop
fastener. By trial and error, he realized that nylon when sewn
under infrared light, formed tough hooks for the burr side of the
fastener. This finished the design, patented in 1955. The inventor
formed Velcro Industries to manufacture his invention. Mestral was
selling over sixty million yards of Velcro per year. Today it is a
multi-million dollar industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad for an invention
based on Mother Nature.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Thanks for a quickie.  Sunday we opted for non-urban hides and took some scenic mountain trails in the Big Bear area for a change of pace.  After encountering an angry five foot rattle snake near one cache, it made us realize that this type of hide poses less danger and has some redeeming value!  Thanks for placing this cache in a more remote area to search with less muggles watching.

very close!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You have probably played &lt;i&gt;Lamp Post Roulette&lt;/i&gt; before, and this
is like that.&lt;br /&gt;

There are many big pineapples at GZ, the Cache IS in ONE of them,
but which one??&lt;br /&gt;
That is for you to find out, and to decide which one it will be in
when you replace it, pick a Pineapple, any Pineapple.&lt;br /&gt;

Finds! They are a family of three and cache as a family, I first
met them while they were looking for one of my hides for a long
time, I finally had to walk over and ask &quot;cant find it?&quot; After some
chatting at GZ, I realized they had actually &quot;found it&quot; but had not
realized it :) Since that night they have become very avid cache
finders and hiders in the local area, and have become Piranha's on
the FTF hunt. They have just made it to 500 Finds and BTS'08 Mom
has gotten good at solving the Puzzle caches for the team, I think
she will will solve this one fast!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Cache is NOT at the Posted coords, but
within 1 mile or less == Solve the Puzzle clue on this page
and you will find the Cache Location

Signed it and unable to leave swag or trade for the TB.  It appears to be muggled.  Owner needs to check on cache.  Otherwise, a good multi-cache for this area.   This is also why we normally prefer to not hunt multi's as the cache is more likely to have an issue given multiple waypoints and more maintenance is likely. However, thanks for placing it and don't give up in light of this set-back.

&lt;p&gt;Relax, enjoy a nice meal, and grab a quick cache!&lt;br /&gt;
A touch of old Europe awaits cachers at this unique village, built
in the image of a Bavarian village. As you enter this friendly
village, the red tiled roofs beckon you to stroll the cobblestone
walks, past the many fine stores, where the shopkeepers live above
their stores. Sounds of polkas and old time songs, give you this
happy feeling. You will notice the beautiful flowers on many of the
balconies, and 70 murals adorn the walls depicting landscapes of 18
European countries. There is also a beautiful church in the center
of the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be sure you visit from September 24-October 19 for
OKTOBERFEST!&lt;br /&gt;
during this time be extra careful about spies!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Excellent placement and camo.  Found it 30 minutes after the FTF hawk.  Yawn, you snooze you lose.  

Thanks for this cache!  Discovered the Temecula Coin (been there done that) and the travel bug.  Left a signature item and a state quarter to contribute to the plethora of copper coinage in the cache.

It turned out to be the officer that TVChick, InSpaces, and I met a few weeks back during a FTF party. We ended up talking a while and then he headed off and I continued to search some more, but finally gave up. It was very nice up there about 2am this morning. You could see lots of city lights in the distance. The neat thing I really liked was listening to an owl in the trees near the GZ and then hearing a pack of coyotes barking and howling down the road. Wow, that was pretty cool and made up for the DNF. Thanks for bringing me up here Agave and I'll be back.</groundspeak:text>

The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, is a
region of the Atlantic Ocean in which a number of aircraft and
surface vessels have disappeared in what are said to be
circumstances that fall beyond the boundaries of human error or
acts of nature. Some of these disappearances have been attributed
to the paranormal, a suspension of the laws of physics, or activity
by extraterrestrial beings by popular culture.Although a
substantial documentation exists showing numerous incidents to have
been inaccurately reported or embellished by later authors, several
others remain unexplained. &lt;b&gt;History of The

continents will lead you to the ultimate prize, hereafter known as
&quot;The World.&quot; Based on your experience and past adventures, I am
confident you will succeed. As always, travel safe and be sure to
document your findings. I look forward to hearing all about your

&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Vietnam (Socialist Republic of
Vietnam)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Is the easternmost
country on the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia. It is
bordered by China to the north, Laos to the northwest, Cambodia to
the southwest, and the South China Sea to the east. With a
population of over 86 million, Vietnam is the 13th most populous
country in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people of Vietnam regained independence
and broke away from China in 938 AD after their victory at the
Battle of B?ch Ð?ng River (938). Successive dynasties flourished
along with geographic and political expansion deeper into Southeast
Asia, until it was colonized by the French in the mid-19th century.
Efforts to resist the French eventually led to their expulsion from
the country in the mid-20th century, leaving a nation divided
politically into two countries. Fighting between the two sides
continued during the Vietnam War, ending with a Communist victory
in 1975.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vietnam is approximately 331,688 km² (128,066
sq mi) in area, larger than Italy and almost the size of Germany.
The perimeter of the country running along its international
boundaries is 4,639 km (2,883 mi). The topography consists of hills
and densely forested mountains, with level land covering no more
than 20%. Mountains account for 40% of the area, with smaller hills
accounting for 40% and tropical forests 42%. The northern part of
the country consists mostly of highlands and the Red River Delta.
Phan Xi Pang, located in Lào Cai province, is the highest mountain
in Vietnam at 3,143 m (10,312 ft).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About this cache, you are looking for a
Camo'd pill bottle with a log and room for small trades.&lt;br /&gt;
 Replace same or better then found to keep it safe, watch for

Some juvenile delinquent had painted black grafitti on the END sign - wrote war under the word END and put a heart around both words. I felt bad for the city man standing on the guard rail having to clean it up with chemicals and a rag.  He looked trust worthy so explained the game and what had transpired on the prior attempt.  He agreed that a man looks suspicious loitering next to a school site and playground park during the day and understood that it was a game.  The security guy didn't buy it.  The city man tried to help with the search but clearly, no muggle will find this Cardinal Sin; this hide is way out of a non-cachers league.  He did ask me if there's a hint, so I went back to the car to study the NUVI.  The difficulty and terrain rating made me think where and what it could be?  Based on a hunch, started looking again and then found it a wee south of my GZ. The city man was impressed by the whole game and asked how many play it?  [i]3-4 million and rapidly growing daily came the response. [/i] Told him a hand held GPS entry unit costs about $100 so maybe we have a new convert?  I also volunteered something else but will not speak of it here.

Now that this evil cache has been found, it can be stated that it is a legal hide in a residential area with no adjacent parking (red curbs).  The only issue with this cache is that the description should explain that it is next to an active school site with a security guard patrolling the perimeter in a golf cart.  Maybe a woman doesn't look as suspicious as a man, but if you visit at the wrong time, expect to be hassled, so plan your sortie for a weekend or at night.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Little Saigon USA and Asian Garden Mall&lt;br /&gt;
Called Phuoc Loc Tho by Vietnamese, it was the first major
commercial center in Little Saigon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It exudes the serene dignity of a Buddhist temple-green,
pagoda-style tile roof, gleaming white pillars, and fiery red wood
trims that seem to glow in the morning sun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A landscaped courtyard with brilliant flowers, sculpted trees, and
a gushing fountain is dotted with tables and benches often filled
with people chatting, playing Chinese checkers, or reading
newspapers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
On a concrete pedestal near the entrance of the two-story building,
a statue of a Happy Buddha extends its arms in warm welcome. Behind
it are stone statues of the gods of Longevity, Prosperity, and
Fortune.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Asian Garden Mall is a mall like no other. While it projects
spirituality outside, it’s also a monument to commerce,
housing gift shops, hair salons, and some of the largest jewelry
stores in Southern California.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Built in 1987, it’s the center of Little Saigon-a slice of
Vietnam that Vietnamese immigrants and refugees now consider their
cultural home in affluent and conservative Orange County.&lt;br /&gt;
Vietnamese music blares from records stores and shops. In the
evening, Vietnamese Americans, mostly young people, flock to
karaoke bars, where they sing along to popular Vietnamese
ballads.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Little Saigon, which started with a few stores in 1975, now covers
roughly four city-blocks, reaching the edges of nearby Garden Grove
and Santa Ana.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is that short section currently from Norco to Green River Road that you do travel on paved roads you have to share currently with cars till the final section that all three Counties [San Bernardino County, Riverside County, and Orange County]have to complete. The trail is striped for bicyclist to ride almost 2 abreast going either East to West or West to East for the entire route.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Disneyland Park is a theme park located in Anaheim, California, owned and operated by the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts division of the Walt Disney Company. Known as Disneyland when it opened on July 18, 1955, and still colloquially known by that name, it is the only theme park to be designed and built under the direct supervision of Walt Disney. In 1998, the theme park was re-branded &quot;Disneyland Park&quot; to distinguish it from the larger Disneyland Resort complex.&lt;br/&gt;Walt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s. He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit; however, he soon realized that the proposed site was too small. After hiring a consultant to help determine an appropriate site for his project, Walt bought a 160-acre (65 ha) site near Anaheim in 1953. Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on July 17, 1955.&lt;br/&gt;Since its opening, Disneyland has undergone a number of expansions and renovations, including the addition of New Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country (now Critter Country) in 1972, and Mickey's Toontown in 1993. Disney California Adventure Park was built on the site of Disneyland's original parking lot and opened in 2001.&lt;br/&gt;Disneyland has a larger cumulative attendance than any other theme park in the world, with close to 600 million guests since it opened. In 2009, 15.9 million people visited the park, making it the second most visited park in the world that calendar year.&lt;br/&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;To get credit for this cache answer the following: &lt;br/&gt;What is the name of the statue at this location? </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
My dear friend and intrepid traveler,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After much planning, I have prepared a new and exciting challenge
for you. Called &lt;b&gt;Around the World in 80
Caches!&lt;/b&gt;, it requires patience, ingenuity, and the
ability to handle the unexpected. In this journey, you will be
venturing into several countries, 80 in all, in search of concealed
artifacts. The countries will lead you to continents, and the
continents will lead you to the ultimate prize, hereafter known as
&quot;The World.&quot; Based on your experience and past adventures, I am
confident you will succeed. As always, travel safe and be sure to
document your findings. I look forward to hearing all about your
grand expedition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your great admirer,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 Jules Verne&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; Information in this cache will help you
solve &lt;b&gt;Europe: ATW80&lt;/b&gt; (GC1MGAC), a
puzzle cache tied to the European countries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Ireland, the third-largest island in Europe, consists of two parts:
the Republic of Ireland (just over 80% of the landmass), and
Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. Steeped in
history, Ireland is known for its mild climate, rolling hills, and
rich cultural heritage. A well-known Irish blessing:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
May the road rise up to meet you,&lt;br /&gt;
may the wind be always at your back,&lt;br /&gt;
may the warm rays of sun fall upon your home,&lt;br /&gt;
and may the hand of a friend always be near.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache you seek is, quite fittingly, is camouflaged in several
shades of green. It also has a few green items on the inside. ;-)
Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

I looked high and low, through bushes and on the ground and surrounding area. I combed this park so unless it is in the building or buried i don't believe anyone will find it ever. Putting that aside it is just an awful location. Nothing much to see, unless you like looking a relatively small park with an old building and a jungle gym. The building itself seems maintained but the park was littered with trash and a bee hive and the local kids hang out there and give people trouble for just passing through. I would recommend that no one go here.</groundspeak:text>

The concrete gravity structure, completed in 1935, is operated by LACDPW for water conservation. Morris Dam has a storage capacity at spillway crest of 22,551 ac-ft (as of the last survey in November 1983).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This facility is located in the Angeles National Forest, Los Angeles County, about 4.5 miles northeast of the City of Azusa along State Hwy 39. It occupies 20 acres of leased land divided into two parcels: the first parcel is owned by the U.S. Department of Forestry; the second parcel is owned by the Metropolitan Water District (MWD) of Southern California.  The dam was constructed in the 1930s.  Prior ownership of the land is unknown.  The Navy first leased the land from MWD in 1945.  The torpedo testing facility was constructed in 1943 and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) operated the facility from 1943-1950 as an annex to Naval Weapons Station, China Lake.  The facility’s primary research concentrated on the hydrodynamic aspects of torpedoes and a sonar system for detecting underwater objects.</groundspeak:long_description>

Its pretty easy to find if youre looking for it, but I tried to hide it just enough it so the average hiker would not see it right away. it definately stands out as unnatural in vegetation.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Back in the 80's our family used to come up here to go fishing. Of
course, fishing meant me listening to my walkman reading a book, my
brother splashing in the pools, mom sitting on a rock crocheting,
and dad actually trying to catch fish.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Back then the river was smaller and easier to cross. Seeing all the
water here now is amazing. Unfortunately, there's more trash here
now, too. My guess is this area sees a lot of muggle activity
during the summer. It's a great place to fish, swim, hike and
picnic.</groundspeak:long_description>

Springs.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When I first discovered geocaching this was the first place I
looked to see if a cache already existed. This is a natural spring
that is constantly flowing. At some point in the past somebody,
presumably Caltrans, installed a pipe to lift the flow of water up
off the ground. This is an especially nice place to stop in the
middle of summer, as the water is always cold and fresh! 
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Will the Thrill for FTF&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I saw this cache &amp; want to see if it was really there, well I was out in the area today &amp; said it no day like today to find out if it was there.  As I was driving up I saw that there was a road leading right up close to it, as I got on top I was only 70' away.  I made it to GZ &amp; made the grab,
Bad news it the lid is broken &amp; with winter coming on I think it will fill with water. Sorry.

It was placed with four children in tow, the youngest being five years old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are dirt roads that lead up to a large open area, no special vehicle needed to get there but if it's raining or has rained recently 4X4 may be required due to all the mud.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;You will need a form of flotation device to get to this cache.
Then once you are on the south side of the river, it is a
significant climb up to the rock formation. Stay on the back side
of the cache and trust your GPS. You will need to climb up and then
look over the right side (from the back) to find the cache. It is a
plastic &quot;just add water&quot; pancake mix container with some good stuff
inside. Enjoy the view and fishing/hunting or whatever brings you

A &quot;berry&quot; special surprise is in order for all those who choose to visit this cache in mid-August.  This is Umatilla National Forest property open to the public, enjoy your outdoors! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can even secure a permit to cut Christmas trees in this area during the winter, but will only be accessible via ATV or snowmobile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HINT: Since the last couple entries have been DNFs...here are some hints that should help you get the prize within your sites. As you approach the cache location (Cloverland Rd to Umatilla Nat'l forest gate, then take the first left after you enter the forest after the parking lot / bathrooms, stay on this road for approx 1.2 mile) you will encounter a steep skid road rising to the north on your right. Go up the skid road 60 adult paces from the bottom, you'll cross over a downed tree and the cache will be on your left just about 12 feet into the brush behind a small downed tree. I could actually see one of the cans as I approached the cache without even moving anything out of the way. The container is 3 rusty old cans with .22 bullet holes attached to a piece of 1 x 4 lumber. The can on the end...lift it up....then push the prescription bottle out the bottom.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It's an easy hike from the parking area, about 1.2 miles up Cummings Creek road... easily done in a half hour.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache container is a nice roomy .50 caliber ammo box, and we stuffed it full of all sorts of goodies!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, enjoy the drive (very scenic), enjoy the hike (you should continue on for at least another mile after the cache... it gets better and better the higher you go), and enjoy the swag!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking is available with no permit required about 100 feet along Tucannon River Road, on the same side of the road as the Cummings Creek road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK29F72 - Parking for Cummings Creek Road Hike&lt;br/&gt;N 46° 19.945 W 117° 40.544&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I arrived on scene and SWWise was already in persuit.  Just so happens the cache owner, DeepSix, works right next to ground zero and was enjoying the show we put on trying to find the prize.  I didn't actually have my GPS...figured the trusty iPhone would lead me to the promised land...nope!  After downloading the most recent iPhone firmware, the GPS has not been working very good.  While standing near GZ...iPhone says 2.8 miles south so I ain't much help.  Meanwhile, Dr D arrives with junior (I'm calling him the &quot;Concrete Kid&quot;) and all 4 of us are looking.  I had the cache container in my hands twice and still was not first to find...it was the Concrete Kid!  Leave it up to an 11 year old to show us old farts how it's done.  Congrats kid, sign up for your own account now and secure the prize that is rightfully yours...FTF!  Thanks for the fun cache...was nice putting a face to the name (DeepSix)...well done.  FYI - for those to follow...I was a sprinkler guy in a previous life (before computers) and will tell you the Rainbird near ground zero is NOT the cache and please don't remove the head as gravel (lava rock too) can fall into the pipes and make repairs difficult.  Happy hunting [:)]</groundspeak:text>

He loves puzzle caches. He is a concrete contractor. This cache combines the two and therefore like all puzzle caches, the cache is NOT at the above coordinates.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;You will be looking for numbers stamped in concrete at two different locations. You should be able to &quot;drive by&quot; these locations so there is no need to get out of your car on these busy roadways. Once you have obtained the two numbers, use the description below to solve for the correct coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step 1 - Add years B1+B2 = variables ABCD (ie. 7534 is A=7, B=5, C=3, D=4)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Step 2 - Subtract years B1-B2 = variables EF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FINAL COORDS MUST BE DETERMINED USING ABOVE VARIABLES &amp; MISSING VALUES THAT YOU COMPUTE&lt;br/&gt; Step 3 - Last 4 digits of North FINAL coords = A _ _ _&lt;br/&gt; Step 4 - Last 4 digits of West FINAL coords = _ E B C&lt;br/&gt; Step 5 - Last 4 digits FINAL North + Last 4 digits FINAL West = FEAD&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;I really like this location for its remoteness in the middle of town with stunning views of the river and golf course. It is not uncommon to see mule deer roaming in the locals backyards or the hillside. If you hear somebody yelling from above, it is probably a fellow cacher giving words of encouragement!&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Since I started geocaching, I've always had a little more respect for &quot;certain&quot; caches than others. My favorite caches are those requiring rigorous hikes, or caches placed in special locations highlighting a view, architecture, landmarks etc. Then there are the urban micros that are disguised in a manner making them virtually invisible while in plain site. Puzzles are cool too.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Well, I hope this cache combines a little of all three elements mentioned above. If you go in search of this cache, I assure you that you will encounter nice views &amp; good camouflage. Unlike some other puzzles, this cache IS LOCATED at the provided coordinates. It is listed as a puzzle due to the technique / dexterity skills required to retrieve the container.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;FORCE IS NOT REQUIRED TO SECURE THE PRIZE. IF YOU FIND YOURSELF QUESTIONING THIS BIT OF INFORMATION, PLEASE LET ME KNOW AND I WILL PERFORM MAINTENANCE. THIS HAS BEEN TESTED BY AN 8-YR-OLD USING ONLY TWO FINGERS.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We got to the site around 2:45 am, and didn't leave until 3:45am.  We searched high and low, but couldn't find it.  A 1.5 difficulty?  It seems I've been having trouble with 1.5s lately.  I better stick to the harder ones.  I'll be back.</groundspeak:text>

I found out the coordinates within minutes, google street viewed it and confirmed it was the correct location from the hints in the logs.  I didn't even waste my time plugging the coordinates into my phone/gps.  I drove straight to the location after work and had the cache in my hand within seconds.  Awesome puzzle, I may have to check out more of these now.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A multi-cache that visits the many parks in Pullman, WA. The
difficulty is only from the fact you have to travel all over
Pullman.

At first I was going to just make this a massive multi-cache with
23 waypoints (including the final) but figured that only a few
cachers would then try to attempt the cache, so I had to split it
up into three different multi-caches to make it more manageable.
Pullman Parks Run 1, &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC2Y9X9&quot;&gt;Pullman
Parks Run 2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC2YA1C&quot;&gt;Pullman
Parks Run 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The final cache to Pullman Parks Run 1 has an added bonus; a cheat
sheet to the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC2MJ1N&quot;&gt;Diabolical Series&lt;/a&gt;. It will not give
you the answers, but it will contain useful information to help
solve the puzzles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Need another &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC2K1GX&quot;&gt;reason?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will have to visit &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; of the waypoint stages to
obtain the coordinates of the final cache. This multi-cache is not
designed to be hard, but it will take some time, so plan for
it.&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Finally got around to doing this series. I was surprised most of the waypoints were quick drive ups. This entire series could probably completed in about an hour (maybe 2) if you felt like burning up half a tank of gas. I actually skipped a few waypoints. The second day the series was published I just happened to be delivering pizza and drove by a couple of the parks. I snapped some quick pics from the car and kept going. I finally had a chance to drive around town with leelee and baby nut and pick up all but a few of the waypoints. I sat down the next day at the computer and discovered I had all the waypoints for #2 done, and all but 2 for both #1 and #3. I was able to guess on the two for #3 (based off of previous visits) and got the right coords my first shot (using geochecker). #2 was accurate too. I wanted to get all 3 on the same day so I had to wait til I had a chance to visit the last two waypoints for #1. I visited those today and headed out for the finals. We first drove to #2 but their were WAY too many muggles. We moved on to 3, only to DNF it. I sent a text to the CO and headed back to #3. We found it quick and decided to go take another look at #2 and found it (coords off ~40 feet). I headed home to do the math to get #1 and then headed back out solo top retrieve it. I looked around a little bit before finally seeing it with 2 ticks crawling around on it. Being afraid to reach down onto the tick infested ammo can I did the only thing a a guy could think off. I took a piss right on it. After wiping off the pee and opened to sign the log and take a piece of paper that I am anxiously waiting to look into. Thanks for the caches, I really enjoyed them!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A multi-cache that visits the many parks in Pullman, WA. The
difficulty is only from the fact you have to travel all over
Pullman.

At first I was going to just make this a massive multi-cache with
23 waypoints (including the final) but figured that only a few
cachers would then try to attempt the cache, so I had to split it
up into three different multi-caches to make it more manageable.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC2Y6DT&quot;&gt;Pullman Parks Run 1&lt;/a&gt;,
Pullman Parks Run 2, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC2YA1C&quot;&gt;Pullman Parks Run 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Need a reason to do this cache? Go &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC2K1GX&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will have to visit &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; of the waypoint stages to
obtain the coordinates of the final cache. This multi-cache is not
designed to be hard, but it will take some time, so plan for
it.&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Finally got around to doing this series. I was surprised most of the waypoints were quick drive ups. This entire series could probably completed in about an hour (maybe 2) if you felt like burning up half a tank of gas. I actually skipped a few waypoints. The second day the series was published I just happened to be delivering pizza and drove by a couple of the parks. I snapped some quick pics from the car and kept going. I finally had a chance to drive around town with leelee and baby nut and pick up all but a few of the waypoints. I sat down the next day at the computer and discovered I had all the waypoints for #2 done, and all but 2 for both #1 and #3. I was able to guess on the two for #3 (based off of previous visits) and got the right coords my first shot (using geochecker). #2 was accurate too. I wanted to get all 3 on the same day so I had to wait til I had a chance to visit the last two waypoints for #1. I visited those today and headed out for the finals. We first drove to #2 but their were WAY too many muggles. We moved on to 3, only to DNF it. I sent a text to the CO and headed back to #3. We found it quick and decided to go take another look at #2 and found it (coords off ~40 feet). I headed home to do the math to get #1 and then headed back out solo top retrieve it. I looked around a little bit before finally seeing it with 2 ticks crawling around on it. Being afraid to reach down onto the tick infested ammo can I did the only thing a a guy could think off. I took a piss right on it. After wiping off the pee and opened to sign the log and take a piece of paper that I am anxiously waiting to look into. Thanks for the caches, I really enjoyed them!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">this little cache has given me soo much head ache.  when we first looked for it yesterday, we didnt even see the fake cache... which was weird...   today, we were with some other cachers and they looked in the same spot we did and low and behold the fake cache was there, at first i was like no way did we miss this cache, but then they opened it up to discover it was fake... someone in the group has seen a cache like this before and then they walked right up to it.  me never seeing one like it was amazed at how someone even came up with a device like it...  pretty tricky, i must say...  trying to get ahead of the cache machine so we were there pretty early</groundspeak:text>

Maybe I should have looked up el hoyo before attempting this one?</groundspeak:text>

Cache is at the base of a sign just a few feet from parking. Walk another 10 feet up the path to take in the view.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A multi-cache that visits the many parks in Pullman, WA. The
difficulty is only from the fact you have to travel all over
Pullman.

At first I was going to just make this a massive multi-cache with
23 waypoints (including the final) but figured that only a few
cachers would then try to attempt the cache, so I had to split it
up into three different multi-caches to make it more manageable.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC2Y6DT&quot;&gt;Pullman Parks Run 1&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC2Y9X9&quot;&gt;Pullman Parks Run 2&lt;/a&gt;, and
Pullman Parks Run 3.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Need a reason to do this cache? Go &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC2K1GX&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will have to visit &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; of the waypoint stages to
obtain the coordinates of the final cache. This multi-cache is not
designed to be hard, but it will take some time, so plan for
it.&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Finally got around to doing this series. I was surprised most of the waypoints were quick drive ups. This entire series could probably completed in about an hour (maybe 2) if you felt like burning up half a tank of gas. I actually skipped a few waypoints. The second day the series was published I just happened to be delivering pizza and drove by a couple of the parks. I snapped some quick pics from the car and kept going. I finally had a chance to drive around town with leelee and baby nut and pick up all but a few of the waypoints. I sat down the next day at the computer and discovered I had all the waypoints for #2 done, and all but 2 for both #1 and #3. I was able to guess on the two for #3 (based off of previous visits) and got the right coords my first shot (using geochecker). #2 was accurate too. I wanted to get all 3 on the same day so I had to wait til I had a chance to visit the last two waypoints for #1. I visited those today and headed out for the finals. We first drove to #2 but their were WAY too many muggles. We moved on to 3, only to DNF it. I sent a text to the CO and headed back to #3. We found it quick and decided to go take another look at #2 and found it (coords off ~40 feet). I headed home to do the math to get #1 and then headed back out solo top retrieve it. I looked around a little bit before finally seeing it with 2 ticks crawling around on it. Being afraid to reach down onto the tick infested ammo can I did the only thing a a guy could think off. I took a piss right on it. After wiping off the pee and opened to sign the log and take a piece of paper that I am anxiously waiting to look into. Thanks for the caches, I really enjoyed them!</groundspeak:text>

Each waypoint will require you to look at your surroundings to figure out the number needed for the final. Two of the waypoints are located inside the Compton Union Building. This building is open to anyone, for no charge. The hours of operation are usually 6am-2am M-F, 10am-2am Sat/Sun. Holidays, school breaks, and large weekends effect the hours of operation. Check cub.wsu.edu for current hours before heading out. Below is a list of waypoints with a question and math to figure out the number that corresponds with the letter. Go to http://nuttyguy.com/geo/CCP.pdf for a downloadable (and printable) PDF file with all the waypoints and questions. It might make this cache a little easier for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take lots of pictures and enjoy the tour. Cache should take 1-2 hours. Bathrooms, water fountains, atm's, restaurants, gift shops, and coffee shops are all located in the cub. If you like this cache, favorite it, bookmark it, and share it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 46 AB.CDE W 117 FG.HIJ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A: Cougar Etch&lt;br/&gt;N 46 43.946 W 117 09.928&lt;br/&gt;At the bottom right of the etching is the artists name and year.

These 30 foot high columnar basalt outcroppings have climbs a beginner will find enjoyable, as well as difficult routes for more advanced climbers. A Great training crag. The rock is incredibly solid, with sound holds most everywhere. It has Southern exposure, making it good for early and late season climbing. It is also in a nicely forested area with plenty of shade to be found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache does not require you to Climb. Park at the posted parking coords and walk down the alley to get to the trail head. You will find the cache just off the trail. You can see the Rocks from the trail, but will not need to climb them or cross them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking: N 46° 44.011 W 117° 10.787  </groundspeak:long_description>

For those stuck on the first stage keep on it, you're close, but also re-read the clue, it tells you everything you need to know.  The second stage had me stuck forever, but again, I re-read the clue, and then some other people's logs made me think about another cache, within 50 miles that was similar, and BAM! found it!

Went to Pullman/Moscow today to get some caches for the Quad Cities ABC Challenge as well as set myself up for find #1000 coming up soon with the 10th Anniversary of Geocaching event in Lewiston, ID.  I've had my eye on this cache for awhile, but usually when I'm in Pullman it is just passing through and time is of the essence.  Today, I had some time to kill and it worked out perfectly.  I quickly found the first stop and then walked with my dog to the final only to find out dogs are not allowed in this area (might want to add this as an attribute).  I then walked back to the vehicle and drove back to the final and left my dog in the car.  This time I searched and searched for something pertaining to the clue provided for stage 2 and found nothing referring to the red bold text.  I did however use some intuition and after a brief SEARCH found exactly what I was looking for.  Timing was everything regarding my successful hunt and I was able to sign the log and leave my personal pathtag without any muggles wondering what was going on.  I think this cache is one of the best I've ever done, thank you for all your effort and the most excellent caching experience.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Out for a walk with Baby Nut and LeeLee today and we decided to head over to the Petry Natural Area. We had been here once before but didn't have anything to hide as a cache. I got exploring in the trees and found this old wrecked car in the middle of a dense forest. I'm not sure the story behind it but I'm sure it's a good one. The trail to the Petry Natural area is paved and can be accessed from either of the two parking coords listed. Once at the Petry Natural Area (coords listed) you will have to get off the paved trail and onto an old animal trail for a few hundred feet. You will have to climb over and duck under some logs and bushwack a little bit. Cache should be pretty easy to find. BONUS: Bring a trash bag and do some CITO. There is a lot of trash in the small forest and around GZ.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a Letterbox Hybrid Cache. A letterbox is another form oftreasure hunting using clues instead of coordinates. Once a letterbox is found instead of signing a log book, you place your stamp mark in the letterbox's log book and place the letterbox's stamp into your own log book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In some cases such as this, a letterbox hybrid has coordinates, making it a letterbox and a geocache. You can leave your stamp and get the cache's stamp in your own log book as in letterboxing, or you can simply sign the log book as in geocaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache is in the same location as the old WSU Tower (GC14TAV) Cache. It was disabled as the owner was no longer able to maintain it and I thought it was such a great spot so I'm hiding a new one, with a unique twist, in the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT DRIVE UP TO THE CACHE SITE&lt;br /&gt;While there are no signs saying you cannot, we want to make sure we are not upsetting any local officials by driving on what is obviously a rarely used service road. Lets make sure geocachers have a good reputation in this small town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've added a great parking area in the additional waypoints. It is a short, easy walk on a well defined road/trail to the cache. This is the same parking area recommended for the Round Top cache (GC1H2JJ), so go and get it too if you haven't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an amazing view of Pullman and the WSU campus from this spot. Be sure to bring a camera and a jacket, it gets pretty windy up here. 

Second set of coords is for parking.

&lt;p&gt;You must meet the challenge guidelines before you can go look
for this cache. Once the guidelines are met you can find the cache
at final coords listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this challenge you are required to find one cache for every
size in only one day. This means you must find a Nano (1.0-1.5), a Micro (1.6-2.5), a
Small (2.6-3.5)  a Regular (3.6-4.5), and a Large (4.6-5.0) all in the
same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Specifics:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a cache of each size in one day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caches can be from any geocaching website or database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior finds do not count, everybody has a chance for FTF!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caches found may be located anywhere in the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You do not need to find the final on the same day you complete
the challenge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not find/log the final until all cache sizes have been
found.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please post the OC, OX, or GC numbers
and sizes they count for in your found log.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is &lt;i&gt;obviously&lt;/i&gt; not at the posted coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First of all, CONGRATULATIONS for making it this far! However, you
have one more to complete before you are finally finished!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that this puzzle contains elements from
the other puzzles, so do not even attempt this puzzle until you
have completed the other 10! 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This &lt;u&gt;final cache&lt;/u&gt; is like the others, but different. An
example would be instead of using 1's and 0's for binary, I would
use 3's and 7's, or A's and R's; something along those lines. There
will be 11 different steps to solve this puzzle, &lt;b&gt;good luck&lt;/b&gt;!!
You'll need it!&lt;br /&gt;

Puzzle Help: (in no particular order...)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; will help you get started,&lt;br /&gt;
remember that any text is fair game, think why did I write it
so,&lt;br /&gt;
Caesar was useful for something other than trying to take over the
world&lt;br /&gt;
sometimes what you can't see will help you when you get stuck&lt;br /&gt;
the bold get 4 times as many prizes&lt;br /&gt;
if you step over the line, you'll get 2 times the punishment&lt;br /&gt;
look HARDER again!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you combine this last type of cache still findable with an
animal that has black and white stripes, the final answer will be
yours&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do not go to the posted coord's. In order to log this find, you
must find at least one cache on each holiday listed below. Prior
finds count, and holidays do not need to be in the same year. You
may already qualify! All cache types and sizes count for this
challenge. Caches found may be located anywhere in the world and
anybody (not just local cachers) are allowed to work on this
challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you can head out to find the final location, you must
post a public bookmark list that lists each holiday cache you find.
You must post the holiday it counts for plus the day/year found in
the comments for each bookmark. Please also bookmark this cache
page in the bookmark list to make it easier to find for other
cachers. If you are unable to create a bookmark list, please post
the GC numbers and holidays they count for in your found log.&lt;/p&gt;

you try to get to the final from the south or West, you will have
to cross a small river and a couple fences. Final Location is
approximately 500 feet from NE Terre View Rd in Pullman. There are
a few animal trails going from the road down near the cache site. I
saw two eagles while placing the cache. Enjoy the 'short' hike.
Cache is a large ammo can stuffed full of swag from all the
holidays. Lets try to keep it on theme.&lt;/p&gt;

Today I had a chance to explore this wonderful place and left a cache for everyone to find. You can park about .1 miles southwest of the cache where Merman Drive ends. A trail will take you within 30 feet of the cache, it's hard to explain which one though, as the forest is a maze of trails. The cache is located at a very scenic viewpoint of the palouse north of Pullman. Have fun exploring this small, but fun, forest.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;DO NOT LOOK FOR A CACHE AT THE POSTED COORDS!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wireless local area network (WLAN) links two or more devices using some wireless distribution method (typically spread-spectrum or OFDM radio), and usually providing a connection through an access point to the wider internet. This gives users the mobility to move around within a local coverage area and still be connected to the network. Most modern WLANs are based on IEEE 802.11 standards, marketed under the Wi-Fi brand name&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wireless LANs have become popular in the home due to ease of installation, and the increasing to offer wireless access to their customers; often for free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Norman Abramson, a professor at the University of Hawaii, developed the world’s first wireless computer communication network, ALOHAnet, using low-cost ham-like radios. The system included seven computers deployed over four islands to communicate with the central computer on the Oahu Island without using phone lines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WLAN hardware was initially so expensive that it was only used as an alternative to cabled LAN in places where cabling was difficult or impossible. Early development included industry-specific solutions and proprietary protocols, but at the end of the 1990s these were replaced by standards, primarily the various versions of IEEE 802.11 (in products using the Wi-Fi brand name). An alternative ATM-like 5 GHz standardized technology, HiperLAN/2, has so far not succeeded in the market, and with the release of the faster 54 Mbit/s 802.11a (5 GHz) and 802.11g (2.4 GHz) standards, almost certainly never will. A HomeRF group was formed in 1997 to promote a technology aimed for residential use, but disbanded at the end of 2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;TO FIND THIS CACHE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need to travel to the posted coords, but you will not need to leave the car. For this cache you will need some sort of device that can view available wireless networks. Smartphones, Tablet PCs, Laptops, Netbooks, and even some GPS devices can view wireless networks. Once at the posted coords, open up your wireless settings and view the many available wireless networks. One of the strongest networks available will be named the final coordinates. Put those coords in your GPS and go find the final. There will be no need to connect to the wireless network, you will only need to see it's name. The final cache is right off a popular bike trail within feet of a place to park. Be careful of traffic at the final and kids at the posted coords.   </groundspeak:long_description>

This combination of&lt;br/&gt;vegetation provides excellent habitat for an array of birds and&lt;br/&gt;animals, and the high top of the butte offers outstanding views of&lt;br/&gt;the sprawling Palouse country of southeast Washington (and&lt;br/&gt;Idaho).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located at the roadside sign right where you turn&lt;br/&gt;to head into the park. It should be an easy find even for the&lt;br/&gt;newest of cachers. You will be looking for a green soda preform&lt;br/&gt;under a rock. There is enough parking for one vehicle to get safely&lt;br/&gt;off the road. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The butte visible from this sign was first called Pyramid Peak. It was renamed &quot;Steptoe&quot; for a commander in the Indian wars at a battle in 1858 near the present town of Rosalia. In the 1880s James S. Davis built a resort and observatory on the Butte's top. A Powerful telescope stood on the roof. After Davis death the hotel was lost by fire. In 1946 Virgil T. McCroskey donated the land to form Steptoe State Park. A road winds to the summit and offers a panoramic view of the Palouse Country. If you have time, head on up to the top and get the caches located up there. You are looking for a clear soda preform at ground level. This should be a quick roadside grab with a great view.</groundspeak:long_description>

The landowners have given permission to use this area to put in and park. Please do not block any gates with your vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rock creek is a very shallow and narrow creek. Getting to this rock pile will take some skill. You may have to climb out of your boat to find the cache. Be careful not to flip over! If you are up for an adventure, keep heading north on the creek to Bonnie Lake (~2 miles). You will see Washington States only natural rock arch on your left. The lake is magnificent with huge canyon walls and a large island. There is no road, houses, or any other way to this lake, so you will very likely be the only ones. At the time of this posting there is a cache on the bridge where you set off, and 2 more on the island on Bonnie lake. Keep an eye out for turtles, we saw countless.</groundspeak:long_description>

Didn't know too much about the area or lake, the current was killer, esp since im used to going out on lakes without current... any way without knowing too much, we kept on trucking... slowing getting to this one. We were having fun until we got to the cache and then emily slipped off the rocks and hurt herself a little, decided since we werent really prepared to do this we will come back to find the rest later.  Super cool area and a LOT of people, we had to keep getting out of the way for big boats with motors on them. To be honest I would rather go climb/hike a mountain, then go boating, but thats just me.  Will be back, and found an awesome area to hide a cache on the way so...</groundspeak:text>

The rock arch is ~1 mile from the bridge where you can put in. The land around the creek is privately owned so you will have to stay in your boat as you approach the rock arch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can set your boats in and park at the bridge just south of the cache site (Hole in the Ground rd). The landowners have given permission to use this area to put in and park. Please do not block any gates with your vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 'Rock Creek Arch' is the only natural rock arch in all of Washington State. A natural arch or natural bridge is a natural geological formation where a rock arch forms, with an opening underneath. Most natural arches form as a narrow ridge, walled by cliffs, become narrower from erosion, with a softer rock stratum under the cliff-forming stratum gradually eroding out until the rock shelters thus formed meet underneath the ridge, thus forming the arch. Natural arches commonly form where cliffs are subject to erosion from the sea, rivers or weathering (subaerial processes); the processes &quot;find&quot; weaknesses in rocks and work on them, making them larger until they break through. This natural arch resulted from an underground crack which extended to the surface of a rock terrace formed by a resistant lava flow. Once the process was started, erosion did the rest. On the left of this bridge is the beginnings of a second such arch so that you can understand better how it actually happens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are up for an adventure, keep heading north on the creek to Bonnie Lake (~1 miles). The lake is magnificent with huge canyon walls and a large island. There is no road, houses, or any other way to this lake, so you will very likely be the only ones. At the time of this posting there is a cache on the bridge where you set off, and 2 more on the island on Bonnie lake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this virtual, you must travel to the posted coords and fill in the blank:&lt;br/&gt;There is a - - - - to the right and above the natural arch.  </groundspeak:long_description>

Even when I went to order my BBQ Chicken Calzone I got order #12. Well that was pretty cool. &lt;br/&gt;I wanted to hide a cache here so I returned to drop this one off.

It's a small plastic bottle, containing a log and a few small trinkets for trade. You'll need a writing instrument. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plenty of parking. Stealth is required at times, especially when commuters are arriving at, or departing from, nearby businesses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is almost handicachable, but most handicachers will need a bit of help for the final grab. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorry, but it's not snow-friendly, although it's probably obtainable with a light snow cover. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Utopia Mountain Survey Point Cache&lt;/strong&gt; is
located near a mountain summit and requires travel across steep
terrain, with loose rocks and exposed tree roots, and sections of
the trail with significant exposure. Care and attention, along with
a comprehensive list of hiking / scrambling supplies are a must for
this cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;View from the Summit&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Utopia Mountain Survey Point Cache&lt;/strong&gt; is a
regular sized rectangular authentic LnL container with only a cache
note, logbooks, and a few pencils. The cache was placed while
checking out the survey point beside the cache location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ridge from the Summit to the False
Summit&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel to the cache site should only be attempted by experienced
hikers / scramblers with good hiking supplies: heavy duty hiking /
backpacking boots; backpack with sufficient water, snacks and food;
first aid kit; a selection of clothing layers; hat and toque;
sunscreen; and bear spray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not travel alone on this remote hike with steep
ridges.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Scree loaded ridge&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come out and enjoy the many amazing viewpoints along this truly
amazing area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approximate Travel Times and Distance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance:&lt;/strong&gt; 10 - 11 km return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevation gain:&lt;/strong&gt; 1200 metres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 8 - 11 hours return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N.B.&lt;/strong&gt; Visitors are reminded that is bear country - please take the proper precautions when
travelling in bear country by carrying bear spray and making lots
of noise - thanks for being cautious in the backcountry!&lt;/p&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>
