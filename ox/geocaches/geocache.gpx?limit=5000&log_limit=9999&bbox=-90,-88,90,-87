            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a three course dinner (cache).  The terrain is easy, involving some traveling within the city.  Solving the puzzle will hopefully be very challenging.  The final cache is a small camouflaged container containing your invitation to enjoy a meal at a local eating establishment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are cordially invited to attend the first Pensacola Geocaching Banquet.  This banquet is being held to honor all of the local and visiting geocachers and will  be held at the final cache location at whatever time of day you reach it.  Please log in your menu selections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Begin your search by going to the posted coordinates.  The given coordinates will take you to a location where you will be able to go inside and find the answers to this puzzle.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While at this location, please choose from the following menu options:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drinks:&lt;br/&gt;Tropical Smoothie or Fresh Lemonade &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Soups:&lt;br/&gt;Fall Harvest Spice or Loaded Potatoe &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salad:&lt;br/&gt;Oriental Mandarin Orange or Caesar Salad  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entree:&lt;br/&gt;Chopped Steak or Baked Ziti&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vegetable:&lt;br/&gt;Summer Squash or Tender String Beans&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dessert:&lt;br/&gt;Decadent Brownie or Baked Alaska&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2nd course of this cache is located at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 30 (22256 - drink) /1000&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;N 30 (36135 - vegetable) /1000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;W 087 (20925 - soup) /1000 &lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;W 087 (20957 - dessert) /1000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Choose the set of coordinates that puts you in Pensacola.  The second stage is a different type of cache, not normally seen.  Once you find the second stage you will be ready to go to the banquet (final stage).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you hungry yet?  If so, there is an eating establishment at the second stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are looking forward to seeing everyone at the banquet.  FTF will provide you with a sumptuous meal at a local eatery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: AB11Z5W - Cheesecake&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ Â° __ . ___ W/E ___ Â° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Location of the coords for final cache.

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>1.  Think outside of the box. Actually a box won't hold these foods, but cans will.   We don't buy frozen, dried or fresh foods.
2.  Don't bend down.
3.  It's easy to tell when they are serving at this eating establishment.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a night cache to be found only in the dark. Wait until it is completely dark as the reflectors are really only readily visible in the dark.  We believe it is the first in the area of this kind.   Located just off a beautiful nature trail, the ground is relatively flat.  Weâve rated the difficulty a little higher because of having to find your way in the darkness. The coordinates will take you to the trail head from which you will have to follow the glowing reflectors to get to the cache!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be prepared for an exciting time. If possible, bring along something to trade that glows in the dark!!  The cache is designed to be found only at night!  It is located just off of the Edward Ball Nature Trail on the campus of the University of West Florida.  Weâve reserved a parking spot for you, number 628 in Lot âGâ, which is located at 30 33.027N / 087 13.274W.  The spot should be empty, as you will be visiting at night, after classes.  If it's not empty, take your pick of any other close spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a large ammo can.  It is full of items that glow in the dark.  There is a logbook with a pen for you to log your find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coordinates (30.33.142N/087 13.257W) will get you to the trailhead. From there you'll need a flashlight. One of those types you wear on your head works great! Now for those of you who have a 10-gazillion-candle power lamp, leave it at home!  This cache only needs a dime store flashlight. A mini-Mag light will work perfectly. You will only bring unwanted attention to your activities with mega bright searchlights and the bright light will wash out the reflectors, making them hard to see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch your step so you donât trip over branches and brush on the ground.  Be on the watch for alligators and snakesâ¦. They lurk in and near the water you will be crossing! (Don't worry, you shouldn't get  your feet wet here, unless there have been heavy rains.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look for reflectors to mark the trail to the cache. They will only be clearly visible at night. To see them best, hold your flashlight at eye level, they'll glow in different colors. That's why one of those head lights work so well. Make sure you watch your step and take your time. The trail head is marked by small reflectors.  Follow the trail of white and amber reflectors until you get to the 3 green reflectors on the same tree (about .2 of a mile), then turn and pick up the white and amber trail again. Take another turn when you see three more green reflectors.   You will know you're at the end of the trail when you see the orange &quot;smiling&quot; tree.  Once there the cache is within a 40 ft radius of the tree.  Be sure to hide the cache back so the cache won't be seen in the daylight. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding your way back to your vehicle should be relatively easy.  We hope you enjoyed your hunt!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: GLZE34 - Cache Location&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ Â° __ . ___ W/E ___ Â° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Final cache location</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>This is a great cache for kids!    If you see the red &quot;smiling&quot; tree.... ignore it and look for the orange &quot;smiling&quot; tree.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

CLOSE TO A CLIFF AND WATERFALL WITH A 60 FOOT PLUNGE TO THE ROCKS

container for
&lt;u&gt;&amp;gt;
Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The CCCNP series contains 8 caches which must be found in

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Waterfall is about 1/4 mile from cache # 1. The trail
starts at the edge of the woods and is marked by an arrow sign
which can be seen from the parking area. The trail descends
downhill to the top of the waterfall. The falls overlooks Waterfall
Creek gorge about 60 feet below. The short trail passes many native
plants: native azaleas, mountain laurel, trailing arbutus and an
assortment of wildflowers in season.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Waterfall creek flows across a thick, resistant layer of
Hartselle Sandstone. The water plunges 60 feet in two stages into
the water-carved canyon below. The best and safest view of the
falls is from a rock ledge on the far side of the falls and can be
reached by crossing the footbridge. There is a small path on the
far side of the falls that leads down stone steps to a large rock
shelter behind the falls. One may go behind the falls to the other
side of the rock shelter to another path that leads down the ledge
to the pool at the base of the falls.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most of the above information is courtesy of the owners of
this beautiful Preserve. For additional information including
archeology, geology and biology notes, please refer to the
information sheet in the packet you retrieved from Cache #

. Due to the location, the
coordinates (averaged 500 readings) had only about +/- 15 to 20
feet accuracy. You do not have to go more than 2 feet off the trail
to retrieve the cache. In fact, depending on arm length, you may be
able to retrieve the cache while your feet are still on the
trail.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;CAUTION!! THIS CACHE IS VERY CLOSE
TO A CLIFF AND WATERFALL WITH A 60 FOOT PLUNGE TO THE ROCKS BELOW!

Do not log this cache as a team find unless the team is a family
unit registered only as a family unit. If the individual members of
the team are geocaching.com members then each member of the team
must sign the log individually. It is not fair to the geocachers
that hike up to 10 or 12 miles round trip to find the caches in the
Preserve to have âteamâ members log a find without actually going
to the cache site.  Log
entries not meeting these requirements will be
deleted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;CCCNP â The Pancake
Boulders&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Millions of years ago, parts of Alabama were covered by vast
oceans. As the ocean edges lapped upon the ancient shores, layers
of sandy silt were laid down, layer upon layer forming the
interesting âpancakeâ boulders that you will see at this location.
The cache is less than 100 feet from the small sign pointing to the
Pancake Boulders. PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO BUSHWHACK FROM THIS CACHE TO
THE SEDUM BOULDERS. FOLLOW THE TRAIL AROUND UNTIL YOU ARE WITHIN
120 FEET OF THE SEDUM BOULDERS. I promise that you will reach the
Sedum Boulders much faster and safer if you follow the
trail.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cache is a small lock-n-lock container containing a few
trinkets, the log, and the coordinates for&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=45d41b77-49a3-40f0-b990-4a9b76eb9a7c&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CCCNP - The Sedum Boulders&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Do not log this cache as a team find unless the team is a family
unit registered only as a family unit. If the individual members of
the team are geocaching.com members then each member of the team
must sign the log individually. It is not fair to the geocachers
that hike up to 10 or 12 miles round trip to find the caches in the
Preserve to have âteamâ members log a find without actually going
to the cache site.  Log
entries not meeting these requirements will be
deleted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

CCCNP - The Balancing Boulders&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;CCCNP â The Balancing
Boulders&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;These interesting structures were formed by water, wind and
variable density of the rock and or sediments. The process of
formation took many thousands of years. My favorite formations in
this section are the pedestal rocks â large boulders that are
supported over other large rocks by pedestal like structures of
rock. The pedestal rock that is most impressive to me is the one
hiding the cache. You will have to cross a creek to reach this
cache. Usually, this creek is no problem but, depending on
rainfall, may present a minor challenge. The best place to cross is
down the trail from the sign pointing to the Balancing Boulders. Be
careful on the rocks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cache is an ammo can containing a few trinkets and the
logbook and is the last cache in the CCCNP series.&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;There is an
unactivated Lion Courage geocoin for
the FTF. The coin was designed and produced by my daughter,
CornCrazy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note about the D/T rating of this
cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I were rating just this cache, I would rate it at 2.5/3.5.
However, this cache is the final of an eight cache series that
required considerably more time and effort than a typical walk in
the park. You have hiked up and down hills and crossed creeks.
Depending on the time of year, you have been in close proximity to
ticks, mosquitoes and other critters. Also depending on the time of
year, you have passed through many areas of thorny plants and
poisonous plants such as the infamous POISON IVY. Fortunately, not
much bushwhacking was required if you followed the trails. All in
all, I think that the cacher dedicated
enough to the sport to complete this series deserves more than just
a 2.5/3.5. Therefore, I rated this one at 5/5. The Pancake Boulders
and the Sedum Boulders are also rated a little higher than they
would be rated individually for the reasons noted above. The rest
of the caches in the series are rated as I think the D/T level
actually is.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Do not log this cache as a team find unless the team is a family
unit registered only as a family unit. If the individual members of
the team are geocaching.com members then each member of the team
must sign the log individually. It is not fair to the geocachers
that hike up to 10 or 12 miles round trip to find the caches in the
Preserve to have âteamâ members log a find without actually going
to the cache site.  Log
entries not meeting these requirements will be
deleted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is an eight cache series at Cane Creek Canyon Nature
Preserve. The caches in this series were placed with permission of
the owners.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;While the owners of the Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve
welcome visitors to the Preserve and have given permission for this
series of Geocaches as well as the others in the preserve, they
cannot and do not give permission to access any geocache in the Preserve by crossing adjoining
private property except as specifically indicated on the trail
map.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cane&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Creek Canyon Nature Preserve is a 700+ acre
privately-protected scenic natural area located in the Little
Mountains region of Colbert County, Alabama. It was founded to
provide a sanctuary for native plants and animals, as well as
outdoor educational and recreational opportunities for people of
the Shoals area. The preserve is open to the public year-round at
no charge, except on special program and activity days sponsored by
local environmental, civic, or natural history groups.
 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the preserve, there are more than 15 miles of hiking
trails, a picnic area, several waterfalls, beautiful bluffs and a
multitude of flora ranging from common to rare. I have seen
turkeys, snakes (including rattlesnakes), deer, armadillos and
other wildlife in this beautiful preserve and there have been two
Mountain Lion sightings, as well. Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve
is maintained as closely as possible to its natural state, and
visitors are advised that this commitment to
&quot;naturalness&quot; offers many potential hazards that must
be considered in order to be safe while on the
preserve. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Enter this
area at your own risk!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please read each cache description carefully for specific
cache information and warnings.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please use caution at all times. Always monitor children
carefully. Please be sure to take water and snacks along with you.
I don't recommend drinking from the streams you will
encounter nor do I recommend drinking from the Big Spring although
it is probably safe. Please wear good hiking boots or shoes since
the footing is precarious in many places. Please remember, other
than the cache contents, &quot;Leave only footprints and take only
memories and photos&quot;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please do not arrive at the Preserve in late afternoon and
expect to finish this series before dark. The round trip hiking
distance to do just this series is approximately 6 miles with
terrain ranging from 1.5 to 4. To do all 12 of the caches in the
Preserve would require a round trip hiking distance of 10 - 12
miles. A limited number of primitive campsites are available on the
Preserve but arrangements must be made with the property owners,
Jim and Faye Lacefield who may be
contacted by phone at 256-381-6301, or by email at
lacefiel@hiwaay.net&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Camping rules:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Prior approval with at least 24 hours notice is
required.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Follow &quot;Leave No Trace&quot; Outdoor Ethics guidelines.
Please leave no signs of your visit (trash, etc.). Information
about &quot;Leave No Trace&quot; is available from the Lacefields and on several online sites.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Camping is allowed for access to preserve only, therefore all
cautions for hiking visitors must be observed.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Camp in established campsites unless specific request made for
backcountry camping. All rock shelters are considered protected
archeological sites and no camping is permitted in these at any
time.&lt;br /&gt;
5. Campers must arrive a minimum of one
hour before sunset in order to safely set up camp before
dark.&lt;br /&gt;
6. Our driveway is closed at dark. No entering or leaving from dusk
until dawn (vehicles must be parked in yard by dusk and do not
leave until dawn)&lt;br /&gt;
7. No firearms or alcohol permitted.&lt;br /&gt;
8. As of June 1, 2009, campfires are no longer allowed. Exception:
Boy scouts and other organized groups in which campfire skills are
part of training activities.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions to Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Hwy 72 in Tuscumbia, go south on Frankfort Rd. Please
note that Frankfort Rd. runs under Hwy 72. The ramp to Frankfort
Rd. (N34 42.711, W87 43.236) is immediately west of the Co-op. At
the end of the ramp, turn left onto Frankfort Rd at N34 42.676,
W087 43.378. Go 7.5 miles to Loop Rd. (N34 37.391, W87 46.974).
About 700 feet after turning west onto Loop Rd., the road forks
with the paved road curving to the right and a gravel road veering
off to the left. Take the gravel road. Follow the gravel road about
2500 feet to the entrance to Cane Creek Nature Preserve. Hold your

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; One can have a wonderful day or two enjoying nature, hiking and looking
for the caches in this series as well as the other
ones.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the
seriesâ¦.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The series is made up of eight separate caches and a find may
be logged for each one. However, only the first one, OX1XHGF (GC1XHGF on geocaching.com), &quot;Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve&quot; is at the posted
coordinates. The coordinates for #2 are in cache #1; the
coordinates for #3 are in cache #2; the coordinates for #4 are in
cache #3 and so on through the series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The CCCNP
Series: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.
&lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;ane &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;reek &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;anyon &lt;u&gt;N&lt;/u&gt;ature
&lt;u&gt;P&lt;/u&gt;reserve&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. 
CCCNP - The
Waterfall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.

&lt;p&gt;Begin your journey through Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve
at the owner's home. Please sign-in using the registration book on
the front porch so that the Preserve owners can have a record of
your visit. After you sign the registration book, look under the
little desk for the first cache of the 8 cache series. In the
cache, you will find an information sheet and a copy of the trail
map for Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve which you may keep. There
are larger, higher quality vinyl maps in the mail boxes on the
porch. You are welcome to use these while at the Preserve but
please return the vinyl maps to the mailboxes upon leaving. The
links, &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.comcast.net/%7Etlmartinsr/pwpimages/Top.png&quot;&gt;top&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.comcast.net/%7Etlmartinsr/pwpimages/Bottom.png&quot;&gt;bottom&lt;/a&gt;,
will take you to online maps, top and bottom, which may be copied
and printed. Also in the cache, you will find a logbook to record
your find and the coordinates for the next cache in the series,






&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do not log this cache as a team find unless the team
is a family unit registered only as a family unit. If the
individual members of the team are geocaching.com members then each
member of the team must sign the log individually. It is not fair
to the geocachers that hike up to 10 or 12 miles round trip to find
the caches in the Preserve to have &quot;team&quot; members log a
find without actually going to the cache site.  Log entries not meeting these
requirements will be deleted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We've been meaning to check this area out for some time and deeply regret putting it out as long as we did. Thanks for placing the caches out here and for highlighting this location. This is one impressive place to take a hike and the amenities along the trail are top notch. 

I had managed to not load this entire series into the GPSr before leaving out this morning for some reason or another, but the owners mentioned it during a conversation about the caches on the property as they were giving us an introduction to via the maps and resources near the parking area. They asked if I was going to do this specific series and I told them that I had seen it but somehow not loaded it and they said, &quot;well you're in luck because you only need the first one to start and it's right over here!&quot;

I signed the log, discovered the TB, and took note of the coordinates to the next cache. We were so busy looking at the falls and taking pictures that I didn't find the cache at #2. We will be back and I do plan to continue the series and see all the really cool spots that you've picked to draw attention to.

Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Lion Rock at Cane Creek Canyon Nature
Preserve&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This
cache is located on Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve and is placed
with the owner's permission. At the request of the owners and
for your safety, please remain on the marked trails until you reach
the cache location. The actual hiding place is visible from the
trail and is very close to the &quot;snail&quot; in the picture
above. The hike to the cache by the shortest route is about 1.75
miles and the elevation change is approximately 200 feet. There are
currently 14 other caches in the preserve. If you plan your route
to get all of them, you will have to hike 12 to 14 miles total.
Wear good hiking footwear, take water and snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please read this important message from the
property owner before hunting for this geocache or any of the many
geocaches in this excellent nature preserve.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Please don't cross ridges
to get to the geocaches in the Preserve. Begin at the Preserve
entrance at the house and use trail maps provided to determine the
best route to the Geocache location. There have been
'seekers' crossing adjoining properties to get to the
Geocaches on Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve. This has been a
problem especially with the Karen's Falls cache because of
its location.&quot; As responsible Geocachers, we should never go
on private property without the owner's permission. While the
owners of the Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve welcome visitors to
the Preserve and have given permission for this Geocache as well as
the others in the preserve, they cannot and do not give permission
to enter the Preserve by crossing adjoining private
property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note:
the trail maps are located in mailboxes on the front porch and are
available for use &lt;u&gt;while on the preserve&lt;/u&gt;. Please return the
maps to the mailboxes after use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About
this cacheâ¦.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First,
the cache is a very large ammo can that was placed in the Boulder
Garden area of Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve but was never
published on geocaching.com. It is fortunate since it was placed in
an area containing some rare and unusual plants that the preserve
owners do not want disturbed. So, the preserve owners gave me
permission to place the cache in another area. I chose the Lion
Rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now,
why would I call a rock and tree that more closely resemble a snail
&quot;Lion Rock&quot;? Well, one day while the preserve owners
where walking along the Shelf Trail, they looked up and saw a
mountain lion, yes, a mountain lion standing on this rock. The
magnificent animal paced back and forth across the rock a couple of
times before disappearing into the forest never to be seen again on
the preserve. Since that momentous day, this rock has been known as
the &quot;Lion Rock&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There
is an unactivated Lion Courage geocoin in the cache for the FTF.
The coin was designed by my daughter, CornCrazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions to Cane Creek Canyon Nature
Preserve: From Hwy 72 in Tuscumbia, go south on Frankfort Rd.
Please note that Frankfort Rd. runs under Hwy 72. The ramp to
Frankfort Rd. (N34 42.711, W87 43.236) is immediately west of the
Co-op. At the end of the ramp, turn left onto Frankfort Rd at N34
42.676, W087 43.378. Go 7.5 miles to Loop Rd. (N34 37.391, W87
46.974). About 700 feet after turning west onto Loop Rd., the road
forks with the paved road curving to the right and a gravel road
veering off to the left. Take the gravel road. Follow the gravel
road about 2500 feet to the entrance to Cane Creek Nature Preserve.
Hold your breath as you pass the chicken houses on the left if you
want to avoid the odor. Continue on into the Nature Preserve and
park in the designated area at N34 37.335, W87 47.662.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please park only in the designated area.   &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We all previously conquered the CCCNP1-8 series, but had a few loose ends to tie up!  While these were last, they were definitely not least!  This day would end up taking us 11.6 miles around one of my favorite places!
To get this cache, we passed the &quot;West Face&quot; along the Shelf Trail.  We didn't get a mountain lion siting, but were just happy to be a potential meal.  None the less, we enjoyed the older large ammo can cache!  TNLS, SL #547!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Citadel is just one of the many beautiful
locations in the Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do not enter the Cane Creek Canyon

the Behel Lane North Entrance. Entering

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Cane Creek

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;CAUTION!! Enter this area at
your own risk!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Wear good hiking footwear, take

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cane&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Creek&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Canyon&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Nature Preserve is
maintained as closely as possible to its natural state, and
visitors are advised that this commitment to
&quot;naturalness&quot; offers many potential hazards that must
be considered in order to be safe while on the preserve. In the
700+ acre Preserve, there are about 15 miles of trails, numerous
waterfalls and bluffs, rock shelters and other hazardous areas.
Please use caution at all times. Always monitor children carefully.
Please remember, other than the cache contents, &quot;Leave only
footprints. Take only memories and photos&quot;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
Citadel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The &quot;Citadel&quot; is an overlook in the northwest
part of Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve and is accessible by two
main routes. There are also route variations that will put you near
other caches in the Preserve.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Route #1 starts at the main entrance to the Preserve. The
parking area for the main entrance is at N34 37.335, W87
47.662. This route, if you go only to the Citadel and back, is
about a 6 mile round trip. It is longer than the other main route
but the hike is somewhat easier. Trail maps are available in the
mail boxes on the porch of the Lacefield's home or can be downloaded and
printed in two sections from:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://home.comcast.net/~tlmartinsr/pwpimages/Top.png&quot;&gt;Map of Cane

Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve â South section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Downloading the maps is especially recommended if the north
entrance off Behel Lane is
used.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;
&amp;lt;![if !vml]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;View from an Overlook near the
Citadel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Route #2 starts at the end of Behel Lane (see directions below). There is a small
parking area at N 34 38.561, W087 48.315. The trail is a narrow
track that is currently marked only with yellow ribbons on trees
and it starts almost due south of the parking area.  This
route is about 1.5 miles shorter if you go only to the Citadel and
back. However, the first part of the trail is harder to follow and
there are several creek crossings that could be a problem at times.
Also, the trail crosses over the top of the Northeast Falls and the
footing can be treacherous. Shortly after you cross the creek above
the waterfall and CAREFULLY climb down beside the falls and rock
shelters, you will reach the intersection of Devil's Hollow
Trail to the south and North Devil's Hollow Trail to the
west. To reach the Citadel, take the North Devil's Hollow
Trail. The trail significantly improves at this point.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;At N 34 38.306, W087 48.727, you will find another
intersection. Going south down the hill at this intersection will
take you within feet of The Old Homestead cache then on to the
Citadel trail. Going west will take you to the trail to The Fin and
another cache, CCCNP â The Fin. The Fin is only about 0.2
mile STRAIGHT LINE from this intersection but unless you have bluff
climbing skills and appropriate equipment, DO NOT attempt the
direct approach. By the much safer trail, the Fin cache is a little
more than 0.5 mile.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now on to the
Citadel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The final trail leading to the cache has a couple of steep
hills and is fairly strenuous. The final segment is common to all
of the approaches to the cache and starts at N34Â° 38.157', W87Â°
49.016'. At this point, you will be approximately 0.75 of a TRAIL
mile from the Citadel cache.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stay on the trail until you reach the
Citadel. The trail ends very close to the geocache. Approaching the
Citadel by the direct route would be quite
dangerous.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
Cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache container is the gold ammo can that I received for
my 1000 find milestone. In turn, I used it to present a combination
1K and 2K award to my bride of 36 years, Lady Gem. It contains the
usual log book, pen and small trade items. It also contains an
unactivated Lion Courage geocoin that
was designed by my daughter, CornCrazy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache is very close to the end of the Citadel trail. The
cache should be fairly easy to find although the less experienced
cacher may have a little difficulty. All of my geocaches in the
Preserve are fairly easy to find since my goal is getting
cachers and hikers to the beautiful
areas of  the Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve rather than
placing a tricky, hard to find geocache. The terrain using the
trails from the main entrance is a 3 to 3.5 because of the distance
and several steep hills. However, the terrain using the north
entrance is closer to a 4 largely because of the first 1500 to 2000
feet.&lt;a href=&quot;http://home.comcast.net/%7Etlmartinsr/pwpimages/Bottom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cache, as well as all of the other caches in the
Preserve, was placed with permission from the Preserve
owners. &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.comcast.net/%7Etlmartinsr/pwpimages/Bottom.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions to Cane Creek Canyon
Nature Preserve Main Entrance:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Hwy 72 in Tuscumbia, go south on Frankfort Rd. Please
note that Frankfort Rd. runs under Hwy 72. The ramp to Frankfort
Rd. (N34 42.711, W87 43.236) is immediately west of the Co-op. At
the end of the ramp, turn left onto Frankfort Rd at N34 42.676,
W087 43.378. Go 7.5 miles to Loop Rd. (N34 37.391, W87 46.974).
About 700 feet after turning west onto Loop Rd., the road forks
with the paved road curving to the right and a gravel road veering
off to the left. Take the gravel road. Follow the gravel road about
2500 feet to the entrance to Cane Creek Nature Preserve. Hold your
breath as you pass the chicken houses on the left if you want to
avoid the odor. Continue on into the Nature Preserve and park in
the designated area at N34 37.335, W87 47.662. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions to Cane Creek Canyon
Nature Preserve North Entrance:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: I recommend going to the main
entrance first especially if this is your first trip to the
Preserve. At the main entrance, you will find information about the
preserve, trail maps to use while on the preserve and cache #1 of
the CCCNP series. If you are fortunate, you may have the
opportunity to meet Jim and Faye Lacefield, the Preserve owners.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A. From the main entrance, go back to
Loop Rd and turn left at N34Â° 37.393', W87Â°
47.127'. Go 1.7 miles then turn left at the junction of Loop
Rd with New Bethel Rd / Hawk Pride Mountain Rd at N34Â° 38.704',
W87Â° 47.751' . Go northwest 0.75 miles
to Behel Rd at N34Â° 39.088', W87Â°
48.357' and turn left. Proceed to the end of the pavement and park
at N 34 38.561, W087 48.315.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;B. If you are coming from east of Frankfort Rd, follow the
directions for the main entrance until you get to Loop Rd. Instead
of bearing left onto the gravel road to the main entrance, stay to
the right on Loop Rd then follow the directions in 'A'
above.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;C. If you are coming from west of Frankfort Rd, take Hwy 72
to Hawk Pride Mountain Rd at N34Â° 42.740', W87Â° 46.554' and turn
south. Travel 5.2 miles to Behel Rd at
N34Â° 39.088', W87Â° 48.357' and turn right. Proceed to the end of
the pavement and park at N 34 38.561, W087 48.315.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

We all previously conquered the CCCNP1-8 series, but had a few loose ends to tie up!  While these were last, they were definitely not least!  This day would end up taking us 11.6 miles around one of my favorite places!
We saved this for the final cache of the day.  Yes, after all day of hiking, we managed to make the cache with the most elevation change the one to tackle with the least amount of energy left!  Took a little while to get to the right path, but we were on our way.  Many times it was tempting to take a b-line, but took heed to the the cache page warning.  This was a very nice spot. Coords were right on!  Great hide spot and very akin to another nearby cache. Was happy to see a golden ammo can. This was C84's birthday cache, so photo op ensued.

Aside from the colder-than-advertised night in the woods it was our first successful hike-in camping for the whole family. Everybody in the family had about 20 lbs of gear on their back and we all made it in and out with no problems. The King are Queen and very proud of the Princes and Princess of the castle.

After soaking up some of the morning sun we headed out and up (and up... and up some more...) to the Citadel. For some reason I hadn't noticed that we would be only the second finders of this wonderfully located cache. We were very fortunate to find and take home (after leaving a handful of swag) the unactivated geocoin. How cool to have a coin designed by the CO's daughter! 

Saw a couple of turkey vultures at the scenic overlook on the way up. One made a large &quot;THUD&quot; as it dropped out of the trees and I made a rather unmanly noise of surprise.

Thanks Rubicon and Lady Gem for another great cache in an outstanding area!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CCCNP: The Under Bluff
Trail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Malone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Branch Falls&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;  
&amp;lt;![if !vml]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Along the Under
Bluff Trail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Under Bluff Trail is one of my favorite trails in the
Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve. The rock bluffs are beautiful
and one can see evidence along the trail that the area was once
covered by the ocean. This trail is one of the more difficult
trails in the Preserve.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of the most beautiful spots along this trail is the
Malone Branch Falls. Malone Branch Falls (not shown in the picture
above) is not a large waterfall and the flow is dependent on the
time of year and the recent rainfall. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Although there is a short cut to the falls and the
geocache, I
recommend following the entire Under Bluff Trail which, along with
the Devilâs Hollow Trail, forms a loop from map point 7 to map
point 8. From map point 8, it is only a short distance to
Keymakerâs
cache, Karen's
Falls
(GCZGNG).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Malone Branch Falls
geocache
is, of course, near the falls. You will have a beautiful view of
the falls from the
geocache
location. Hopefully, the flow will be as good as it was when I
placed the cache. It was beautiful.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
geocache is
an ammo can which I won at an event earlier this year. Other than
the usual log book and small trade items, the cache contains an
unactivated 9/11 memorial
geocoin for
the FTF. Because of the bluffs and the tree cover, the estimated
accuracy of the coordinates is no better than +/- 20 feet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Including the CCCNP 8 cache series and this one, there are 14
geocaches in the Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Maps of the
Preserve:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Maps of the Preserve are available in the mailboxes on the
front porch. These vinyl maps may be used while at the preserve but
are to be returned to the mailboxes when you leave.  An
information sheet and a paper version of the Preserve map can be
found in stage one of the CCCNP series and are yours to keep. In
addition, the links,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://home.comcast.net/%7Etlmartinsr/pwpimages/Top.png&quot;&gt;top&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://home.comcast.net/%7Etlmartinsr/pwpimages/Bottom.png&quot;&gt;
bottom&lt;/a&gt;, will take you to online maps, top and bottom, which may
be copied and printed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do not log this cache as a team
find unless the team is a family unit registered only as a family
unit. If the individual members of the team are geocaching.com
members then each member of the team must sign the log
individually. It is not fair to the geocachers that hike 7 or more
miles round trip to get this cache to have âteamâ members log a
find without actually going to the cache
site.  Log entries not
meeting these requirements will be deleted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To get this cache, we did indeed take the full Underbluff trail.  The ammo can was familiar from the Annual Celebrate Summer event.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located on Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve. Placed with
permission of the owner. Please see important note below. The hike
to the cache by the shortest route is about 2.5 miles. The
elevation change is approximately 250 feet. If you stay on the
trails, no bushwhacking will be required. Wear good hiking
footwear, take water and snacks.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please read this important message from the property owner
before proceeding to the âOld Homesteadâ Geocache information.
âPlease donât cross ridges to get to Karenâs Falls. Begin at the
Preserve entrance at the house and use trail maps provided to
determine the best route to the Geocache location.â Note: the trail
maps are located in a mailbox on the front porch. The link,
http://home.comcast.net/~tlmartinsr/CaneCreekGeocache.html , will
take you to an online version which may be copied and printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been âseekersâ crossing adjoining properties to get
to the Geocaches on Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve. This has
been a problem especially with the Karenâs Falls cache because of
its location. As responsible Geocachers, we should never go on
private property without the ownerâs permission. While the owners
of the Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve welcome visitors to the
Preserve and have given permission for this Geocache as well as the
other three, they cannot and do not give permission to enter the
Preserve by crossing adjoining private property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Old Homestead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remains of the chimney are all that is left of this house in
the woods. According to relatives of the family that used to live
there, the house was abandoned in 1917 or 1918 because of Typhoid
fever. There is a natural spring close by and this may have been
the source of the typhoid. Many years later, the property came into
the hands of loggers and much damage was done to the land. The last
logging in the area was in the early 1990âs. The property was
purchased by the current owners in 2000 and became part of the Cane
Creek Canyon Nature Preserve. Now, most of the scars of logging
have disappeared and the area is returning to the way nature
intended it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve is more than 700
acres and is open to the public. There are more than 15 miles of
hiking trails, a picnic area, several waterfalls, beautiful bluffs
and a multitude of flora ranging from common to rare. I have seen
turkeys, snakes, deer, armadillos and other wildlife in this
beautiful preserve. There have been two sightings of a Mountain
Lion on this property. There are several Geocaches on the property
other than this one. All have been placed with permission from the
owners. One is at Karenâs Falls â about a 7 mile round trip hike
from the parking area. Another is at the scenic Point and a third
is near the Linden Meadows picnic area. One can have a wonderful
day enjoying nature, hiking and looking for the Geocaches. The main
purpose of this Geocache is to enjoy nature and the beauty along
the trail to the Old Homestead. Therefore, I placed the Old
Homestead Geocache at the old chimney where it should be easy to
find once one reaches its location. If you find JS, just to the
right of the old chimney, you will know you that you are in the
right place. It is about a 4 Â½ - 5 mile roundtrip to the Old
Homestead cache. If you do go all the way to Karenâs Falls, I
recommend that you take the Under Bluff trail on your return. There
are maps of the Cane Creek Nature Preserve in the mailbox on the
front porch and I recommend using one. Please return the map to the
mailbox when you leave. Also, please be sure to take water and
snacks along with you. I donât recommend drinking from the streams
you will encounter nor do I recommend drinking from the Big Spring
although it is probably safe. Please remember, other than the cache
contents, âLeave only footprints and take only memories and
photosâ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directions to Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve: From Hwy 72 in
Tuscumbia, go south on Frankfort Rd. Please note that Frankfort Rd.
runs under Hwy 72. The ramp to Frankfort Rd. (N34 42.711, W87
43.236) is immediately west of the Co-op. At the end of the ramp,
turn left onto Frankfort Rd at N34 42.676, W087 43.378. Go 7.5
miles to Loop Rd. (N34 37.391, W87 46.974). About 700 feet after
turning west onto Loop Rd., the road forks with the paved road
curving to the right and a gravel road veering off to the left.
Take the gravel road. Follow the gravel road about 2500 feet to the
entrance to Cane Creek Nature Preserve. Hold your breath as you
pass the chicken houses on the left if you want to avoid the odor.
Continue on into the Nature Preserve and park in the designated
area at N34 37.335, W87 47.662. Initial cache contents: 1. Mini
Maglite 2. Tonka bulldozer 3. Camouflage cord 4. Emergency blanket
5. Darleena White Jeep TB 6. 2 - Bottle opener keyrings 7. Log book

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CCCNP: The
&quot;Fin&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;  
&amp;lt;![if !vml]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Along the Trail to
the Fin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The âFinâ is a large fin shaped structure with a nice view at
its point. Perhaps a better way to describe this structure would be
to liken it to the bow of a ship. The walls of the fin are bluffs
converging at a point just like the sides of the ship converge at
the bow. Just as it would be very difficult to reach the deck of
the ship by climbing up the sides, it would be extremely difficult
to reach the âdeckâ of the fin without special bluff and rock
climbing equipment and skills. &lt;u&gt;Please
do not attempt a direct approach.&lt;/u&gt; The trail to the fin
leaves the main trail just before the Pancake boulder area at
approximately N34Â° 38.2420', W87Â° 48.922'. Although the straight
line distance from the main trail to the âbowâ of the fin is only
about 520 feet, the only safe access to the top of the fin is via a
0.53 mile trail that parallels the bluff and climbs upward to the
base of the fin then back along the top of the fin to the point.
From the main trail, the fin trail climbs about 225 feet over the
first 1900 feet of the trail to an elevation of about 750 feet at
the highest point at the base of the fin. The trail along the top
of the fin gradually descends to about 640 feet over the last 900
feet or so of the trail to the point or âbowâ of the fin. At a
point approximately 1500 feet from the main trail, you will come to
a gate. This gate is on the Preserve and you may pass through it
without fear of trespassing. Just past the gate is a marker for the
trail to the top of the fin. Turn left at the marker and proceed to
the top of the fin. Once at the top, just follow your
GPSr to the cache which is placed about
85 feet back from the point. After you find the cache, I recommend
proceeding on to the point of the fin. Be extremely careful at the
point as it is about a 50 or 60 foot drop to the base of the bluff
below.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The geocache is a one liter
Rubbermaid type lock-n-lock camouflaged container. Other than the
usual log book and small trade items, the cache contains an
unactivated 9/11 memorial geocoin for
the FTF.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Including the CCCNP 8 cache series and this one, there are 14
geocaches in the Cane Creek Canyon Nature Preserve all placed with
permission from the Preserve owners.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Maps of the
Preserve:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Maps of the Preserve are available in the mailboxes on the
front porch. These vinyl maps may be used while at the preserve but
are to be returned to the mailboxes when you leave.  An
information sheet and a paper version of the Preserve map can be
found in stage one of the CCCNP series and are yours to keep. In
addition, the links,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://home.comcast.net/%7Etlmartinsr/pwpimages/Top.png&quot;&gt;top&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://home.comcast.net/%7Etlmartinsr/pwpimages/Bottom.png&quot;&gt;
bottom&lt;/a&gt;, will take you to online maps, top and bottom, which may
be copied and printed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do not log this cache as a team
find unless the team is a family unit registered only as a family
unit. If the individual members of the team are geocaching.com
members then each member of the team must sign the log
individually. It is not fair to the geocachers that hike 7 or more
miles round trip to get this cache to have âteamâ members log a
find without actually going to the cache
site.  Log entries not
meeting these requirements will be deleted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I did finally phone a friend who did read the cache page and that helped me get to the right spot!  The climb is challenging, but the view was excellent!  If you like this cache, you will like GCHAZR.
The CCCNP is awesome.  This is my 3rd trip here to finish the series of 8 and the others including this cool cache. Thanks for the challenge!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A Micro Cache at the  Dr. T. F. (Whitey) Hall Memorial Garden. There is a paved, wheelchair accessible trail through the garden. The cache is only about 2.5 feet from the trail edge. However, I am making this a 1.5 because it might be difficult for someone in a wheelchair to retrieve the cache. There is no need to go off the paved trail except the final 2 or 3 feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This lovely garden is located on the TVA reservation, Muscle Shoals, Alabama near the trail head for the TVA Nature Trails. The garden is maintained by the Shoals Wildflower Society, a chapter of the Alabama Wildflower Society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the time this cache was placed, there were not very many flowers in bloom. However, during the spring, the floral display is absolutely beautiful. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main reason for this cache is to lead you to the wildflower garden and the TVA Nature Trails. I have very little information about Dr. Hall; I am still searching. I think that Dr. T. F. (Whitey) Hall was an outstanding biologist for the TVA for many years. I will add more information about him as I find it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shoals Wildflower Society focuses on the fellowship of shared interest in wildflowers, seeks to promote knowledge, appreciation and use of native plants, and preserve areas of significant interest because of their native flora. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be aware that no plants or plant parts may be removed from federal property without specific permission. There has been a problem with people helping themselves to the native wildflowers in the garden and on the reservation. The area is now posted to insure that the public knows this rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: I used an average of 520 readings for the coordinates. I went back to the cache site this morning and the coordinates led me directly to a spot about 35 feet from the cache! So I did another set of 500+ readings and those coordinates worked fine this morning. Because of the heavy tree cover and the difficulty getting good coordinates, I will post a hint ... no, it is a spoiler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to TechBlazer for FTF!! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geocaching.com code: GC1DGWE</groundspeak:long_description>

An archived cache, âForever Wild â GCPFVJâ was nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shoal Creek Preserve is located in Lauderdale County, Alabama, and is part of the âForever Wildâ program. The âForever Wildâ purchases lands for general recreation, nature preserves, and additions to Wildlife Management Areas and state parks.&lt;br/&gt;Shoal Creek Preserve is approximately 298 acres and has 4.5 miles of hiking trails and 2 miles of horse trails. The Shoal Creek Preserve has beautiful streams with cascades and small waterfalls. The Preserve has a wide variety of beautiful wildflowers, hardwood stands, and a variety of wildlife. Access to Shoal Creek Preserve is via an unimproved road off Lauderdale County Road 61.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache has been replaced and is now a camouflaged lock-n-lock container. When placed, the cache contained a variety of trade items. If you take an item, please leave an item of equal or greater value. Since this is not intended to be a Travel Bug Hotel, you are welcome to take a geocoin or travel bug item without leaving one. &lt;br/&gt;PLEASE â donât take a Geocoin or Travel Bug  if you donât intend to move it to another cache. Geocoins and Travel Bugs are actually private property placed in caches with the intent of traveling from cache to cache. If you take a trackable item, please record it on the appropriate website and move the item to another cache as soon as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The new container is about 10 feet from the previous hiding place. At the new location, my GPSr reading drifted from 0 to about 20 feet from GZ. Since my accuracy was only about +/- 20 feet, I am not changing the posted coordinates. I have added a hint, however. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geocaching.com code: GC1FV73 </groundspeak:long_description>

I have another cache in a somewhat similar location I named the
Gnome hole because it struck me as the kind of place you might just
find such a creacher. Any Gnome living here has a much nicer view
but is harder to get to. If you decide to drop by for a visit be
sure to bring a light as Gnomes tend not to pay their power bills.
Also take note of some of the logs from before this was a cache
location. Some are standard scrawls but a few clearly took time and
skill. To reach the correct area DO NOT FOLLOW THE TRAIL THAT LEADS
UP ALONG THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS, though I do have a cache up there
and the view is lovely. The container is about 3 ft long and about
8in in diameter so if you can, bring long swag to trade. Please
make sure the Gnomes vault is replaced fully in his home.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK31QYT - GC31QYT Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 36Â° 15.370 W 087Â° 04.337&lt;br /&gt;This is the best place to park&lt;br /&gt;TR31QYT - Stay on Level Ground&lt;br /&gt;N 36Â° 15.565 W 087Â° 04.466&lt;br /&gt;Don't follow the Trail up.

Greet Event on June 14th 2008 as like a Door Prize. I painted &amp;
Camo Tape the Container up the next morning. There is a Log
Book,Pencil (Still might need to have 1 or a Pen on Hand anyway's)
There is a few Tradeable Items that came with this &amp; We added a
few too &amp; a TB. If you take something, Please leave something.
Thx's! This Cache is near a Cemetery that has many Headstones
dating back to the early 1800's. Some Civil War Stones here too.
This should be a pretty easy find &amp; sign. Would be a Good one
for the Kids to Finds. Please replace the Cache as you found it.
Thank You! Please Trash out any you see &amp; Please, Respect

&lt;p&gt;YOU MUST FIND &amp; LOG ALL 6 POST OFFICE
CACHES OF THIS SERIES TO LOG THIS AS A FIND&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The listed coordinates above are to the main parking lot for the
Green River Forest, owned and maintained by the Kentucky Divsion of
Forestry. Those coordinates are NOT to the actual cache, which is a
half-mile walk from the parking lot. Once you've figured out the
coordinates and walked the half-mile, you are looking for a
large,camo-taped container that shouldn't be too tough to find.
Thanks to MadBee for the containers! To find the actual
coordinates, you must first find all 6 of the Return to Sender
caches hidden near the 6 rural post offices in Henderson County.
Written in the lid of 6 different film cans will be a single digit.
These 6 digits work together to form the final cache coordinates.
Here is the formula: RETURN TO SENDER-FINAL N37 52.ABC W087 29.DEF
A=Return to Sender-Smith Mills (OX107TA) B=Return to Sender-Baskett
(OX1D09A) C=Return to Sender-Robards (OX108WJ) D=Return to
Sender-Spottsville (OX10D3A) E=Return to Sender-Corydon (OX107TF)
F=Return to Sender-Reed (OX10D3E) One last note: to log the cache,
you must also type in your log what type of trash you carry out
with you. This is a really neat forest preserve, but it has
obviously been a dumping ground in years past. On your way to the
cache, you'll see a significant pile of old plastic jugs. Please
carry out some and throw them away. Maybe if we all do this, a
little CITO action will actually clean this area up! Cache was
placed with permission of the KY Div. of Forestry, Madisonville
office.

There is Tree cover all around.

Scuffletown got its start in 1800 when Jonathan Thomas
Stott-(Scott)-(Fox)he was Full Blood Shawnee.He married Mary Polly
Cooper a full blood Cherokee. They had two sons Jonathan Stott and
Thomas Scott during the Cherokee removal there father was shot and
died in shawneetown illinois 1838 He ran a tavern in the area that
passing river traffic could easily access. Scuffletown got its name
from the flatboat people coming down the Ohio River the Cherokee
played stick ball and had wrestling matches right out side the
tavern/trading post. The white people seen this as scuffling.
According to the Annals and Scandals of Henderson County by Maralea
Arnett, &quot;Since he kept a good supply of liquor, it became a
rendezvous for flatboatmen and others on the river. Often a general
fight developed after several hours of drinking and the place
received the name of Scuffletown.&quot; A school was built there
sometime around 1817. The first church was built in 1830 at the
Vanada farm. A tobacco stemmery was built in 1860 and shipped 400
to 450 hogsheads per year to Europe. A steam gristmill and
blacksmith shop soon followed. In addition to crops of tobacco and
corn, Scuffletown was noted for its large number of pecan trees.
The site witnessed numerous Civil War-era activities. It may have
been the intended target of a raid by a handful of Confederate
cavalrymen from Tennessee led by Captain Jake Bennett. It was
Colonel's Johnson set up his cannon a few miles below Scuffletown
to take Newburgh. The Silver Lake No. 2, a sternwheel packet
(steamboat) weighing some 129 tons and outfitted with six cannons
capable of firing 24 pound shot, stopped at Scuffletown during its
patrols of the Ohio. In 1863, eight Union companies of infantry and
one company of artillery were stationed at Scuffletown to protect
the area of Confederate raiders. Scuffletown is mentioned in the
Civil War account &quot;Operations of the Mississippi Squadron during
Morgan's Raid.&quot; In 1893 the Southern Cherokee Nation were Welcomed
to Kentucky in Scufflown and recognized as an Indian tribe by
Governor John Y. Brown. The Southern Cherokee is still living on
the Green River today. According to an atlas originally printed and
copy written in 1895 by the Rand McNally Corporation, downtown
Scuffletown had a population of 71. In 1868, Scuffletown got a post
office, which remained in operation until after the 1913 flood,
closing in January 1914. A larger flood in 1937 destroyed all that
remained of the town. The area is now referred to as the
Scuffletown Bottoms. There is parking off the Main Road. Your
looking for a Camo Painted (Grey &amp; Black) Pill Bottle with a
Log Only, So Please BYOP &amp; Replace as you found it. Thank You!

This area is best known as Newburgh Beach. If you have ever travel
from downtown Newburgh,In. toward the Dam along the river on 662
&amp; saw a Beach area across the Ohio River &amp; wondered where
that is. Well, Your Question has been Answered. The farmer which
owns the farm land near here &amp; part of the beach area has asked
Henderson County to start dumping Dirt,Bricks,Concrete &amp; other
Debri so No Travel can be made down to the beach area from Land.

hardly blame him. Ski Day was held here the last few years. Please
take the time to take Picture here &amp; of the Dam. You can get
this Cache by Auto or Boat. Car would be a easy step out &amp;
found &amp; sign. By boat, you would have to walk abit to get to it
(Be sure to wear something on feet either case, because of Broken
Glass!!) Please, No Parking in the Farmers Fields!! Your looking
for a Camo Taped 35mm film can. Log Only so BYOP! Please,Replace as

So we decided to set out a few caches based on books, movies and TV shows with &quot;Family&quot; in the title or about families. The inaugural cache is based on one of my favorite childhood books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; by Johann David Wyss is the story of a family shipwrecked on an island they name &quot;New Switzerland.&quot; Even though there is no phone, no lights, no motorcars, (oops sorry wrong island!), the family through resourcefulness, hard work and devotion to one another not only survive but thrive in their new home. &lt;br/&gt;As a young boy I loved the book for the adventure and exotic locals it described. It was exciting to read of the family's struggle to find food, build a home and defend themselves from wild animals.The Robinson boys have many fine exploits, and several times throughout the book one person risks life and limb to come to the aid of another.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now though its appeal to me lies mainly with the relationships of the family members who unselfishly care for one another. Many times the author takes pains to illustrate the familyâs mutual love and respect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find the cache solve this puzzle and plug the numbers in to the coordinates below. The related web page will help:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;38.00.0X&lt;br/&gt;087.36.3Y&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of sons in the Robinson family plus 66 equals X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sum of the digits in the authorâs birth year plus 77 equal Y&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now I don't want your little adventurers to be disappointed, please feel free to email me to check your answer if you would like. So after you collect this cache stop by the local library and pick up a copy of this book and then read it with your family. A good time will be had by all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache was placed in a location that may be considered substandard as its use has mostly been replaced by smaller versions of itself which everyone seems to have.  The original location got up and left one day, so a new container has been placed in a location that may be considered more standard.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If this is your first time in Marshall, have a look around town.

I've driven by here several times and noticed the scenic view and thought there needed to be a cache here.  Last week I noticed that they were setting up an information shack and decided this would be the perfect spot for a cache.  It's a nice place to stop and check out the view and see how it evolves over the next few months/years.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a waterproof match container.  Please try to place it back exactly as you found it.  Please check that it is not visible when you're standing in the doorway.  Be sure to bring your own pen. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Unfortunately, I don't think I was loud enough to prevent them from looking farther then they needed to. Luckily my instincts were correct and we made the find pretty quickly.
I've seen your name on quite a few logs before (probably in the Lake Monroe/Bloomington area), so it was fun to see your name as the owner of a cache that we found while we were in your area!
This was a really gorgeous place to visit. Lots of snowy egrets and pretty scenery to check out as we drove away. Wish it hadn't been so hot, or we probably would have stayed longer to check out more of the scenery.</groundspeak:text>

It took us a little while to find and was a little awkward since we had to listen to your neighbor yelling at their kids for something silly. While we were signing the log, she decided to change her focus at yell at us instead. She accepted our explanation of geocaching and went on to something else. Nothing like weird social interactions to make you want to get back in the car and drive away! Thanks for a very clever cache!</groundspeak:text>

Easy terrain and shouldn't be a difficult micro to find. This cache is placed to bring you to a piece of history. BYOP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Newport Covered Bridge (also known as the Morehead Covered Bridge) crosses the Little Vermillion River on County Road 50 North, just west of State Road 63, in Vermillion County. This single span Burr Arch Truss structure has a length of 180 feet, or 206 feet including the 13-foot overhang at each end, with a portal clearance 16 feet wide by 14 feet high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where the covered bridges now stands was the Morehead Ford, so named for Samuel Morehead who owned the land adjoining for many years and at the time the bridge was built. It was an important ford in its day as it was on the road to Shaw's Mill and on to Quaker Point, as Quaker was then known. When the Commissioners decided in 1885 to build a bridge there, quite a difference of opinion arose among them as to whether it should be an iron bridge or a covered wooden bridge. The advocates of the covered bridge won out and the contract was given to Joseph J. Daniels of Rockville for $6,800.00. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This small cemetery is one of the few remaining savanna remnants left in Illinois. For the last several years prescribed burns have been conducted here with encouraging results. Daniel Fairchild and his wife ( whom the cemetery is named) is buried in the center of the cemetery. Berry briars surrounding both stones. Some of the predominant plants of this savanna are big bluestem, Indian grass, New Jersey tea, showy goldenrod, drooping coneflower, and prairie rose. Over 35 other herbaceous species of prairie plants are known to occur at this site. If you have time while you are here you should check out all the old headstones.</groundspeak:long_description>

This park has a large softball complex with 6 fields and a&lt;br /&gt;
pavilion, perfect for a company picnic. The park also has a&lt;br /&gt;

The cache is not at the listed coordinates. The coordinates will
bring you to one of the parking areas for the main trails!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Chirpy left directions to his new hiding spot, but it will take a
little work to find it and unlock the door. Chirpy said to walk the
main trails and listen for two Chirp messages. One for the
coordinates and one for the code to unlock his door. He really
enjoys hopping by the river and always slows down around benches
and picnic tables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Finally, I have found the right spot. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, I need you fellow cachers' help to make this work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Please park your vehicles in the parking lot, not on the street. Coordinates provided as a waypoint, below.&lt;br/&gt;2) To get to Stage One, STAY ON THE GRAVEL TRAIL!!!  (Stage Two rules will be intuitive to most geocachers with more than 10 finds.)&lt;br/&gt;3) Observe all &quot;Private Property&quot; or &quot;No Trespassing&quot; signs. MapQuest and the other mapping websites are incorrect about entire area being part of the park. If you stay on the gravel trail (Rule #2), there will not be a problem.  http://www.krvfpd.org/aromamap.html This link is a more accurate map of the preserve.&lt;br/&gt;4) Leave at least 1.5 hours to complete the cache AND observe the closing times of the park (5:30 p.m. Oct-Mar and 8:00 p.m. Apr-Sept)&lt;br/&gt;5) This is a DVD&amp;CD exchange type cache.  Please trade appropriately.  No bootlegs or homemade copies.&lt;br/&gt;6) There are a few normal trade items, just in case you forgot.  Travel Bugs and Geocoins are always welcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage One is a micro leading to the main cache.  Please return Stage One to its original hiding spot.  Thank you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I enjoyed the hike while trying to place this cache, and I think bird lovers will be thrilled with it.  I found not only the normal songbirds, but a good variety of waterfowl (including a heron keeping a close eye on me), a couple of well-fed raptors, and a small woodpecker I am not familiar with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 41Â° 06.024 W 087Â° 45.502 </groundspeak:long_description>

This&lt;br/&gt;Theater was a big hit and at one time had 2 screens going. People&lt;br/&gt;would be lined up down the road to get in. They also had a&lt;br/&gt;playground for the kids as well as the big metal speakers you had&lt;br/&gt;to drive up to and hang on your window. (Oh and don't forget to&lt;br/&gt;take it off the window before you leave!! ) I used to live right&lt;br/&gt;across the field from the Theater and spent many nights there. For&lt;br/&gt;more history on Drive-In Theaters go to&lt;br/&gt;http://www.driveintheater.com/index.htm Currently the Starlight&lt;br/&gt;Theater site is used for composting and yard waste management by&lt;br/&gt;the city of Kankakee, but you can still see the original main&lt;br/&gt;screen from the cache location. The Cache is a Cammo Match&lt;br/&gt;Container and is easy to find. You should be able to drive right up&lt;br/&gt;to the cache off the frontage road. Bring your own pencil. Please&lt;br/&gt;make sure you cover it well as it is kind of in the open.</groundspeak:long_description>

It says &quot;hanging&quot; but what is hanging? I saw garbage bags hanging in a tree but it was empty. I found a piece of wrapper stuck in a tree. There was some stuff in a tree but nothing resembling a cache. plus the edge was way too steep to try to get to anything.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">With rain pouring down in Downers Grove heading out to find some caches was questionable but as I headed down 294 the sky to the south was only partly cloudy. The line of storms was right along 294 though and I came in and out of the rain as I drove on. As luck would have it when I arrived in the area of the cache the ground was bone dry.

I found parking and made the quarter mile hike to ground zero. Neat old rusty car, I sure was glad you didn't place the cache in the car. 

Second to find as  Mcdanny3 was here on 7/14/2011.

After finding this cache I headed over to '11K Diversion' and made the route in such a pattern as to leave another cache for opencaching.com in a sea of tall grass.

Thanks for placing a cache on opencaching.com

Boy has the area changed since I helped place this cache 2 years ago.  :)  The hidey log has been reduced to a pile of rubble.

I was searching a bit down hill when Badlands came up with the find. It was good to visit my old friend again. Same logbook too.

Good to see it is holding up all this while.

Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

I'm unsure if I'm the FTF because the log sheet had writing on it (different ways to ask someone to the prom). 212 of my 366 Day Challenge. SL TNLN TFTC

approaching I thought a little walk would be just the thing that
you need.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 To make it somewhat easy park as recommended, head up the hill and
walk along the ridge, if you haven't already, stop and visit
   The Prey Series: The White-footed Mouse,
   then stay to the high ground to the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 A few thorns, ravines and plenty of those things that like to
stick to your clothes. Just the way we like it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 This would also be awesome to visit at night! :) But be careful as
the preserves close at sunset.&lt;br /&gt;

   Treasure's; The Bobcat Cache; and The Coyote Cache.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 On one of a several trips to grab caches in this area I was
heading back to the car and on a branch over the trail, chattering
furiously away was a pure white squirrel. Not an albino as his eyes
were dark but bright white fur. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 I hurried back to the car to grab my camera but by the time I got
back, he was gone. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Upon returning to my car, there was an older gentleman with his
dog getting ready to get into his truck and I approached him to
tell him about what I had seen and he spent a good amount of time
telling me how the white squirrels had been common in the Lemont
area but development had pushed them into the canal/quarry area.
Afterwards I found out he was a leading naturalist of information
of the area. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 For more (related) information, click here. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 I have seen jet black squirrels in the Fox Lake area and then
later have seen GeoPics from Fallen Faery and SpEd about their
encounter with The White Squirrels in Effingham, IL. &lt;br /&gt;
Update 10-6-06 nitro2002 has reported that they have been spotted
in nearby Romeoville!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 I have stopped by on several occasions to attempt to get a photo
of this little rascal but he has never been seen again. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 If you could, please have your camera at hand to get a picture of
this guy so I will not think it was a dream. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Have fun!</groundspeak:long_description>

I parked in the parking lot and headed to the trail.  1st I forgot to get the answer to another cache that is on the OTHER side of the canal.  We found this cache easy enough. She just love it.  Signed log and headed out. Next thing you know, she spots a snake in the middle of the path. Well, she was screaming and crying. That was the end of our caching day. I am glad we made it to the car.

 Several years ago Torus and I were hunting a very nice series by
Special Ed in these woods. We had a great time! Our only regret was
that the series was not longer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 When we found and logged the cache at this spot and upon Torus
replacing it, the container was rejected and tossed onto the
ground.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Torus thinking he had replaced the cache in an unstable manner
replaced it again only to have it rejected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Upon a more detailed inspection of the hidey hole a White-footed
Mouse had other ideas about the front entrance to his abode
obstructed. We found another good hole nearby and placed the cache
there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Keep a sharp eye out for this little critter and if spotted try to
grab a photo if you can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

   sure to bring your camera.&lt;br /&gt;

sea more than 425 million years ago and later brought to the
surface.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Erosion of water in the stream gradually and slowly created the
canyon you see today exposing the limestone walls.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Please note that this is an Illinois Registered Reserve and
&lt;b&gt;free hiking is not allowed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

 The Camp Sagawau Environmental Education Center is open for canyon
tours from April thru July and in October.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Canyon Tour Days for 2008:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 April - Saturdays at noon starting on April 12th (please call to
confirm)&lt;br /&gt;
 May - Sundays at noon&lt;br /&gt;
 June - Saturdays at noon&lt;br /&gt;
 July - Sundays at noon&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 October - Saturdays and Sundays at noon&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Time: 12:00 noon (please arrive 10 minutes to a half hour ahead of
time).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Cost: Free&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Footware: Please wear waterproof boots as the tour will take you
into the canyon and into the shallow stream&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;For Verification: Measure the depth of the canyon (take a
picture of a person of known height and then count how many
'persons' deep the canyon is) and divide by the age of the canyon
(ask the tour guide) to see how slowly the canyon is being
created.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Not the canyon but an example on how you might measure the
depth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Special Group Tours: If you can get a group of 10 to 15 people
together call (630) 257-2045 and they can schedule a special tour
almost anytime. School and Scout groups welcome.&lt;br /&gt;

listed below which is the recommended parking for 'The Red Gate'
series. The choice of trails comes automatically. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you get near, early finders of this cache will have a clue
where to enter the thicket as the blaze we left on the trail (a
piece of notebook paper skewered on a branch) was left in place but
donât expect it to last long after the first rain. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also you stand a chance of finding the trail that philroi and I
(and my trip in and out later) bushwhacked to get thru. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There might be another way to approach this cache but be prepared
to make your own path. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
-------------------------- &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Story &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While on a Geocaching outing with philroi, we had finished hunting
the nearby, fantastic 'The Red Gate' Series by TheLoneRanger...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=d1d56b45-1eb4-445f-b7f1-e47ade46255b&amp;log=y&amp;decrypt=
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
and we decided to get one more for the day. The cache we decided on
was 'hill never find it cache' by dave and eric.. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=5c672f04-15e6-4246-91da-8d737efc83c7&amp;log=y&amp;decrypt=
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
and armed with topo maps and advanced map skills we decided to
avoid the ravine. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a long and arduous trip... &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
http://www.geocaching.com/seek/log.aspx?LUID=5ac15b20-9fcd-4991-80b6-ce3296e9c372
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
and on the way out, in the middle of this thicket I dropped my
phone. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not having another phone with us we decided to head back and get
another phone. 2 hours later, I was back and at the spot where we
rejoined the trail I gave my phone a call ... Soft ringing in the
distance ... closer and another call... &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On and on until it was found. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Dedication: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To TheLoneRanger. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who we (Steinie and I) had met while on the way to place the cache.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His dedication to making this wonderful Forest Preserve one of the
finest Geocaching spots in the Chicagoland area (giving the
Bachelors Grove area a run for their money). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After doing his 'Pumping Iron' series last week and 'The Red Gate'
this week, I (and my friends) are just amazed at the consistently
high quality level of cache container and placement &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His caches embody some of the best principals of geocaching,
History, Fitness and just plain beautiful areas in which you are
taken to. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Wow, I did not realize this cache was that new. From the logs on GC, we were a group 2TF!! Not bad for not living in the area, huh?

&lt;br /&gt;
Clue from âDodge the Polaraâ â¦ &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
âTo find this cache,&lt;br /&gt;
you must act like a troll,&lt;br /&gt;
so go under the bridge,&lt;br /&gt;
and look for a hole.â&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache will lead you to a stone bridge constructed by the
Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930's. When the bridge was
built it was wide enough for only foot traffic one way, as time
progressed, and the bike path was constructed, the path was
diverted around the bridge. The diversion of the bike path is
clearly evident. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The I &amp; M Canal was used as a towpath where barges were towed
by horses or mules down the canal. After other methods were used to
transport materials and goods the canal fell into disuse. The CCC
worked to turn this area into a recreational parkway. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have biked and hiked in these woods with my family and there are
many structures I would like to show you. Since these structures
were constructed outside of local jurisdictions many have been
neglected and have fallen into serious disrepair but this one has
held up surprisingly well, as a testament to its solid
construction. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 This is the another in a series which will include many different
structures. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a public works program
that put over three million young men and adults to work during the
Great Depression of the 1930's and 1940's in the United States.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &quot;I propose to create a Civilian Conservation Corps to be used in
simple workâ¦ more important, however, than the material gains will
be the moral and spiritual value of such work.&quot; Franklin D.
Roosevelt March 9, 1933 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 You are looking for a 1 quart Tupperware container painted flat
black with a log book, pencil and sharpener inside. This cache also
contains the usual trinkets for trade. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Dedication: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 To Grandpa (whom I have never met but hope to someday), one of the
first geocachers in the area and a true master of the hobby. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 There are several examples of his caches nearby which show the art
of hiding. I felt it was only fitting to dedicate this cache to
him. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Be sure to visit his nearby caches I&amp;M canal cache GC417
(geocache #417 which was placed on March 7, 2001!) and Blarney
Stone GC3BC9 (which I am sure will amuse and amaze you with the
method used to hide). These are examples of how great caches should
be.&lt;br /&gt;

After finding 417 this one we could not pass up. After figuring out where to park, which I think was the wrong area, which made it a 2 mile round trip we headed down the path. A little windy and chilly we had a nice walk. Talked about our last night festivies. Once at GZ Xyval made the decent and I sat on top and looked pretty!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Some memories about Fairyland Park and the Gypsies.&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I remember the big neon sign at the entrance had a clown on it
and they had one of those live pony rides featuring about 5 or 6
that went around in a circle.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Around it's perimeter a RR track, maybe 15&quot; gauge (between
rails), or even 24&quot;, ran which carried people-occupied cars. During
busy times, they had a real STEAM LOCOMOTIVE pulling the train,
miniarure, of course, and I remember gazing at the amazing linkage
which drove it's valves. The track ran through a tunnel in a
&quot;mountain&quot;; the train was stored over winter in it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fairlyland was a gypsy camp before it was an amusement park. My
grandparents used to threaten my mom and my uncles when they
misbehaved that they'd be left with the gypsies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When I was REAL small, there was a group of real Gypsies, with
horses &amp; wagons, encamped near of the Park.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Al Miller found an antique fire engine for sale in Tennessee.
He brought the truck to Fairyland where it became a favorite
attraction. Kids clamored aboard the engine's back for slow,
screaming rides through the park. Drivers whipped the siren into a
frenzy while a blinding flasher splashed crimson through the trees.
When the engine wasn't making a spectacle of itself at Fairyland
proper, it was ringing its way through small town parades and
picnicsâon lease from Alâwith the renter's advertisement riding
high in the rear.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fairyland was never much trouble,&quot; Georgia Miller insists. &quot;We
had the usual small problemsâkids hopping on and off the carousel
or trying to sneak into the park. The only crime I remember
happened one day at our novelty stand. We had a novelty stand where
we sold balloons and airplanes and fireman hats, and, one day,
while my sister was tending it, a lady stole a little fur monkey.
But that worked out okay, too, because my sister chased her, and we
did get our monkey back.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fairyland Park where people paid to ride the Whoopee Coaster.
No, actually, it was just a bunch of timbers to drive your car
over.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is an offset cache. Located east of Bemis Woods North not far from the Salt Creek River. Easily accessed by the Salt Creek Bicycle Trail. From the parking area walk south until just before the bridge. This is where you pick up the trail. The walk along the trail is easy. The path from the shelter to the cache is easy. No bushwacking required. Once at the shelter take a path north 100 feet to find the cache. &lt;p&gt;

Be careful as the hint is a giveaway.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While you are here log the letterbox cache half the distance to the
cache under a rock.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache will lead you to a fine example in good condition of a
hiking shelter constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in
the 1930's.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have biked and hiked in these woods for a while and there are
many structures I would like to show you. Since these structures
were constructed outside of local jurisdictions many have been
neglected unlike this one which has held up rather well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To visit another shelter where time has taken itâs toll visit
CCC - Hiking Shelter - Hobo's Hideout (GCJWDN)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is another in a series which will include many different
structures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a public works program
that put over three million young men and adults to work during the
Great Depression of the 1930's and 1940's in the United
States.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;I propose to create a Civilian Conservation Corps to be used in
simple workâ¦ more important, however, than the material
gains will be the moral and spiritual value of such work.&quot; Franklin
D. Roosevelt March 9, 1933&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a good spot to stop, rest and perhaps have a lunch. Be sure
to check out the rest of the trail as it is a nice walk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Be sure to hike on the left, facing traffic as many of the bike
riders might not see you coming around a corner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for is a pretty big camoed Lock-N-Lock container
that should have enough room for most trade items and travel
bugs.&lt;br /&gt;

Update 7-16-04 Lowered difficulty rating.&lt;br /&gt;
Update 7-18-04 Added info to indicate this is an offset
cache.&lt;br /&gt;
Visit 8-20-04 Replaced container (only one test plug now), replaced
ziplock for logbook and placed back in it's original hiding spot
(more concealed). All is well with the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
Visit 5-4-06 Replaced PVC with tupperware as contents kept getting
wet.&lt;br /&gt;
8-10-07 Upgraded the container to a Lock-N-Lock. That should keep
the water out! :)&lt;br /&gt;

well traveled, non-major trail. If it has rained or the snow is
melting, it will be a muddy approach. Kid friendly but not ideal
for strollers. 

The Mayslake Forest Preserve is a great spot in Eastern DuPage
County. I've given bike access and two car parking options as
waypoints below. (Including @ the adjacent dog park.) Easy access
to the preserve by bike. Make a day of it and visit historic
Mayslake Mansion. (http://www.dupageforest.com/preserves/mayslake.html)

Also a terrific starting point for a bike ride on the extensive Oak
Brook Bike Path (http://www.obparks.org/pdf/bike_paths.pdf)

You can't bike right to the cache, but trails leading there take you along the lake.  It's a .3 mile hike to GZ from the chapel.  (To bike to within .03 miles, use &quot;Parking Area 2&quot; waypoint).

Bike trail extends along 31st Street east/west from here.  If approaching from the North, a traffic signal with pedestrian crossing is just to the Northeast at Regent Drive.&lt;br /&gt;PG1D7FE - Parking Area 2&lt;br /&gt;N 41Â° 49.718 W 087Â° 57.297&lt;br /&gt;Quick Park 'n Grab parking.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Family-friendly cache area is very accessible by bicycle or on
foot. Parking will be an issue - easy parking waypoint provided.
Last few yards are by foot on non-paved, sometimes muddy, uneven
terrain. &lt;br /&gt; Oak Brookâs extensive bike/walking trail system
(www.obparks.org/pdf/bike_paths.pdf) makes for a terrific family
cache outing. (Itâs a fairly easy lunchtime grab-a-cache too).
Container is a small âofficialâ geocaching.com lock 'n lock with
only room for smaller travel bugs/exchange items. Parking on York
Road is illegal. Parking on Dover Lane is a BAD idea; lots of
traffic, none of which is expecting a parked car. Instead, BIKE or
WALK here or park at the Oak Brook Golf Course (see additional
waypoint info) or behind the Drake Hotel. Take care in returning
the cache to its hiding spot please. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK1B0CM - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 41Â° 50.435 W 087Â° 55.810&lt;br /&gt;Park in this lot and follow the bike path (East of the 1st tee) North to the pedestrian underpass.

DO NOT PARK ON YORK!!! This would be VERY dangerous any time of day or night.  This is a nice little walk; enjoy it!</groundspeak:long_description>

It was rainy out so no fun faces.
One after another I hunted them down.
The rain couldn't bother me...
I never frown.

I did 17 miles
Found lots of gold.
Caching makes me smile.
It never gets old!

If you care here is my ride.
Click the link and go inside.
Next time I go you should come too.
Caching is more fun, when there is at least two.

Did not rad all of the data on the cache page but knowing Jeff I knew it would be a nice walk without too many issues. Walking over I regaled j3y with stories about how I got FTF on Jeff's first cache, have an unfinished multi (with a surprise visit from the owner), how nicely crafted his caches have been.

Guess I gave too much away as j3y walked right up to the cache.  :)

Another nicely crafted cache and great stroll! Keep up the good work!

Last few yards are by foot&lt;br/&gt;on non-paved, sometimes muddy, thickly wooded terrain. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Oak Brookâs extensive bike/walking trail system makes for a&lt;br/&gt;terrific family cache outing. (Itâs an easy lunchtime grab-a-cache&lt;br/&gt;too). Container is medium âofficialâ geocache container large&lt;br/&gt;enough for smaller travel bugs. Parking on Dover Lane is a BAD&lt;br/&gt;idea; lots of traffic, none of which is expecting a parked car.&lt;br/&gt;Instead, BIKE or WALK here or park behind the Drake. Take care in&lt;br/&gt;returning the cache to its hiding spot please. Muggles shouldnât be&lt;br/&gt;an issue except the evening of the Independence Day&lt;br/&gt;fireworks!!(This is near a VERY popular spot to watch the&lt;br/&gt;fireworks!)</groundspeak:long_description>

I bet I forgot to write the date with my log.  :)  I did write the time though...

Perfect timing! I was just mulling over what to do during lunch. Go on a maint run? Take another stab at research for Lemont Confidential? Just sit and surf?

Check my email right before I head out and what do you know. There are two new caches published about 5 to 12.

Distance? Errr... A little far from Lemont but it is such a beautiful day and I have been working thru lunch a few times last week.

Took my time and let the GPS route. This way and that... Closer... Mmmm... Parking? How about right here? After all it was just a scant few 100 feet away.

Dash over... Look left and right... Back left... Mmmm... That is tidy.  :)  A quick check and Bingo! The cache! Another quick check of the logbook and Bingo! FTF!  :)

Logged, accepted the FTF trophy and the Winners medallion. Thanks!

Replaced exactly as found.

Nicely done! Godda love these tiny pocket woods.

Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

The weekday workers in the nearby buildings use his spot a LOT during the summer months.  So, an early or late cache dash or a patient picnic is in order.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although I LOVE all of your signiture items, thanks in advance for simply signing the log.  Let's leave what little room there is in the container for the smallest of small travel bugs and other trackables.  Thanks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Handicap Cacher note: There is a fairly gentle, but somewhat uneven slope from the parking lot to GZ.  Alternatively, the main path goes down 6 very long steps.  Take a peak at the first picture in the gallery to see both.

I felt like I was going to the dentist. His office was in the nearby building. Nope...was are a caching!!  I headed down, Xyval took the high road. Woah, some rocks gave and I almost was swimming with the ducks.  However my angle I was able to find the cache and Xyval was able to retrieve it.  Things always happen for a reason.

The lots were mostly cleared of snow and I was able to park within 10's of feet from the cache. A quick look around and the cache was in hand.

This one could be tough during some parts of the week!

The office building to the West houses a number of businesses with 24/7 operations, so the lot can be pretty full at just about any time. Plus, many of the employees use the parking lot when they take walks. This shouldn't keep you from attempting the find, just be aware the area can be muggly at times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are a PEZ fan, this is a great cache; please be courteous to other finders and follow the &quot;trade for equal or greater value&quot; guidelines. If PEZ aren't your thing, please trade for some of the other swag in the cache. Thanks!!</groundspeak:long_description>

location. Coordinates changed, new hint added.
&lt;p&gt;No matter if you come by car or public transportation, this
cache is the opposite of a drive-up. The terrain rating is for the
length of the walk in an urban setting. The park closes at
dusk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the last 250 feet to the cache are definitely not
wheelchairs friendly at all, the rest of the way seems to be ideal
for wheelchairs and strollers. It would make a good cache for a
mixed group of disabled cachers and at least one who can manage the
final stretch through moderate vegetation and over rocks. So I
added the wheelchair symbol to the cache description for visitors
who scan for suitable caches by PQ. If anyone feels offended
because a successful hunt DOES require some assistance, please let
me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park has changed a lot since my last visit in summer 2007.
Still, it remains an oasis of peace and remoteness right in the
heart of Chicago. And the views near the cache site are great both
north- and southwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neighboring GCJNQ2 on your way has plenty of information about
the history of the peninsula. However, it's unsure if the cache
still exists. But most importantly, make sure to visit the
wonderful Little Travel Bug Hotel on the Prairie on your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The island seems to be closed during concerts at the pavilion.
If you plan to come during the evening, check out the concert schedule before your visit.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Out with PGal for some downtown caching and we needed a nice walk after a bunch of close to the car ones.

After first grabbing the TB motel we continued our stroll on this nice day.

Birds a plenty and a lot of nice flowers.

Soon we were in the final approach and the terrain was turned up a notch and after making sure the nearby fishermen and passerbys on the boats we otherwise occupied we made our move.

Nicely hidden with great views!

There is NO direct access to the cache from I-88 nor the I-294
spur! &lt;br /&gt; The hide isn't terribly difficult, and the container isn't anything
special. Finding where to park may be another story. A bicycle
approach makes things a bit easier. Terrain rating reflects the
impact of just about any rain or other precipitation. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can be grabbed at lunch, but 15ft. of bushwacking can mess up a
pair of dress shoes pretty quickly if it has rained recently.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Family friendly location and cache contents.&lt;br /&gt;

you can return it the same way.</groundspeak:long_description>

The terrain rating had me a touch worried but once at GZ we discovered it was no more than a 2.

I checked a few spots and WG some others and the cache was soon in hand.

There is a bike path near here? I'll have to check it out.  :)

A bit tricky to get to but the GPS took us right to parking. If we only didn't miss the entrance off of York.

Strolled over hoping for a path along the highway and there was a little used one. After making the find and signing in we took the park route out.

Not too bad at all!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale&lt;br /&gt;
a tale of a fateful trip,&lt;br /&gt;
that started from this tropic port,&lt;br /&gt;
aboard this tiny ship.&lt;br /&gt;
The mate was a mighty sailin' man,&lt;br /&gt;
the Skipper brave and sure,&lt;br /&gt;
five passengers set sail that day,&lt;br /&gt;
for a three hour tour,&lt;br /&gt;
a three hour tour.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The weather started getting rough,&lt;br /&gt;
the tiny ship was tossed.&lt;br /&gt;
If not for the courage of the fearless crew&lt;br /&gt;
the Minnow would be lost.&lt;br /&gt;
The Minnow would be lost.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ship aground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle&lt;br /&gt;
with Gilligan,&lt;br /&gt;
the Skipper too.&lt;br /&gt;
A millionaire and his wife,&lt;br /&gt;
a movie star,&lt;br /&gt;
the proffessor and Mary Ann,&lt;br /&gt;
here on Gilligan's Isle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(Ending verse)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So this is the tale of our castaways,&lt;br /&gt;
there here for a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;
They'll have to make the best of things,&lt;br /&gt;
it's an uphill climb.&lt;br /&gt;
The first mate and his Skipper too&lt;br /&gt;
will do their very best,&lt;br /&gt;
to make the others comf'terble&lt;br /&gt;
in their tropic island nest.&lt;br /&gt;
No phone ,no lights, no motor car,&lt;br /&gt;
not a single luxury&lt;br /&gt;
like Robinson Crusoe&lt;br /&gt;
it's primitive as can be.&lt;br /&gt;
So join us here each week my friends,&lt;br /&gt;
you're sure to get a smile,&lt;br /&gt;
from seven stranded castaways&lt;br /&gt;
here on Gilligan's Isle!&lt;br /&gt;

The break into the scene. Grabbing caches left and right.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No hide too tough, no terrain unsurmountable (for the minivan
either :) ).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
... and they have fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome to the sport gals. You make it fun. :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Keep on cachin'. :)

The small strait between the island and the mainland is about 2 feet deep at the most so its crossable. Also in the winter when the water is frozen. Other than that the walk isn't to bad but there is a whole lot of bushes even in the winter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is an ammo can. Please cover your footprints if snow is on the ground.

The deep snow...

... plus a few extra inches...

... cold, windy...

... limited time...

How about just one cache and then lunch. Sounded good all around.

I heard there was a warmup coming in the next week and we needed to get this one off the list before the hard water was made soft.

Once at the entrance of the preserve, we were not there more than a few minutes and the FP plow wanted to clean things up for us. Cool. We drove off a bit, chatted and by the time we made it back the lot was clear.

I had been to this preserve several times and knew the parking, trails (my beloved cypress grove) and we even had checked out the approaches to this cache before.

Strolling thru the deep snow, across the ice, up the hill...

Great view! Took a few pics and we were headed back to warm our tootsies.  :)

Thanks for placing this one out there. It was fun!</groundspeak:text>

According to them, in the&lt;br/&gt;1960's, the S&amp;H catalog became the largest publication in the&lt;br/&gt;country and S&amp;H printed three times as many stamps as the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;Post Office. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pretty typical hide (with a minor twist).&lt;br/&gt;I'm pretty sure my dad got our first Weber kettle grill from the&lt;br/&gt;S&amp;H catalog.

This one has been calling to me since I often drive the nearby highways and I even know how to access as I have a storage space nearby. What I didn't know that there was access all the way back to the area of the cache.

Made the grab and didn't even get out of the car.  :)  Godda Love It!

I also remember when the S&amp;H Green Stamp warehouse used to be here. I had even collected a few books of their stamps.  :)

Construction in the area is completed, but they haven't put
everything back the way it was before. It is unclear if this is a
permanant or temporary situation. None the less, I have redeployed
the cache in the same way as before, but in a new location
aproximately 90 Ft. from where it was before. I have updated the
coordinates. BE ADVISED!!! It is now MUCH more difficult to obtain
this container without being scrutinized by muggles!! Choose your
search time accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;
++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This urban cache is in a high traffic spot, especially during
commuting times.

Accurate satellite reception is impossible here which means you
really have to rely on your 'geo-sense', so:

a) I bumped up the difficulty .5
b) I'll give you a little more information below than might be
absolutely necessary, and
c) the hint, while not a complete spoiler, should tip it in if you
are having trouble.

The cache is EAST OF Canal and NEAR the River, North side of Adams.
No plants are involved. No corporate logos are involved. No
advertising is involved.

High Muggle Concentration in This Area! Stealth Required!

While I appreciate all of your signature items, this is a small
enough cache as it is; would it be ok if you simply let your log
entry be the proof that you visited the cache? Thanks! Oh, and
please take care to return the container where you found it, as you
found it so the fun can continue for others.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is no one around at 7:20 pm in the winter.  Makes for an easy grab.  Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

FTF at ... Mmmm.. between 2:30 and 3. Put the exact time in the logbook.

Short on sleep last night, got up early, took a late morning nap. Saw the notice and thought... &quot;No way. One of the other hounds would of gotten to it my now.&quot;

Tried to get out quick but this and that got in the way.. Finally on my way.

GPS said &quot;Take lower Wacker&quot; Mmmm... Never tried that before and even though I was down below the GPS kept signal and before I could react I was past the exit.

&quot;I'll never get it now!&quot;

OK, this way, that, around the block, finally on Adams...

My memory of the map was faulty and I overshot the cache by a block.

&quot;Man!&quot;

Around again... Pull over near by... No legal parking...

Guy in a Chicago tow truck looking at me...

&quot;Grrrr....&quot;

Drive down a little way... and alley! Cars parked... Pull in.

Strolling towards the cache. The tow truck on the move. &quot;Wonder if he was watching and saw me pull into the alley?&quot;

&quot;Boy, oh boy.&quot;

&quot;Nah. You are just paranoid&quot;

Keeping one eye on the alley I start to search. Don't look there. ... or there...

That looks like a good spot, or there, or there...

Here it is.  :)

Sit, relax, guy waiting for a bus, looks away...

&quot;Hey! This is fun! (Wonder if the car is still there?)&quot;

Log, replace, car is still there (Yay!) and I start thinking about McD's on the route home.

Thanks for the Double McD's and for the cache!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">UPDATE: New and probably more secure final hide. Hint and formula have changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Garfield Park Conservatory is one of the largest and most impressive conservatories in the United States. Often referred to as &quot;landscape art under glass,&quot; it occupies approximately 4.5 acres (18,000 mÂ²) inside and out and contains a number of permanent plant exhibits incorporating specimens from around the world (including some ferns that are over 300 years old). Additionally, thousands of plants are grown there each year for displays in Chicago parks and public spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History:&lt;br/&gt;In the late 19th century, each of the three large Westside parks (Garfield, Humbold, Douglas) had its own small conservatory and propagation greenhouses. After 20 years of use, these conservatories fell into a state of disrepair and became obsolete.&lt;br/&gt;In 1905, Chicago's West Park Commission's general superintendent and chief landscape architect, Jens Jensen, demolished the three smaller greenhouses to create what was intended as &quot;the largest publicly owned conservatory under one roof in the world&quot; in Garfield Park. Many of the original plantings came from the three smaller Westside conservatories.&lt;br/&gt;Constructed between 1906 and 1907, the Garfield Park Conservatory was designed by Jensen in collaboration with Prairie School architects Schmidt, Garden and Martin and the New York engineering firm of Hitchings and Company. It represents a unique collaboration of architects, engineers, landscape architects, sculptors and artisans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jensen conceived the Conservatory as a series of naturalistic landscapes under glass, a revolutionary idea at the time. The simple yet strong shape of the structure, which is meant to emulate the haystacks of the Midwest, complements the collection of plants and foliage that it houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(source: Wikipedia)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conservatory is open to the public 9 am - 5 pm daily, 9 am - 8 pm on Thursday. Entry is free. The El Green Line Conservatory stop is only steps away. Free parking available just south of the main entrance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The above coordinates point right into the center of the greenhouses. To get the coordinates for the final cache, just enjoy the conservatory and answer the questions in each part of the collection. You donât have to follow a certain route. I have listed the collections alphabetically â finding out where you are is part of the challenge. No calculator required. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NEW final coordinates are &lt;br/&gt;N 41Â° 5 [U - P1] . [SH1 - A1] [H - F1 - 1] [D2 - C + 4] &lt;br/&gt;W 87Â° 4 [SU2 - SH2] .

Steinie and I came out yesterday and spent a few hours gathering data and just enjoying the rooms. At the first stage I had a preconceived notion of what we were looking for for one item and overlooked the other and had to make 2 circuits of the room but after that all went well and the clues were easy to locate.

Stopped by the entrance and did the number crunching and stepped outside to get a fix. Started walking and Doh!  :)

After a course correction we were bearing down on GZ... The security guard reminded us that the conservatory closes in 10 minutes... and we started the hunt.

Mmmm...

Quickly double check the math...

A quick email to the owner discovered the error and today I strolled over to the correct GZ and made the quick find.

The Conservatory looks great and the City Garden out back is shaping up very nicely. I cannot wait until it is complete and in full bloom.

Had a great time!

Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

further with a light wind out of the north. :)

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flood Plain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A floodplain, or flood plain, is flat or nearly flat land
adjacent to a stream or river that experiences occasional or
periodic flooding. It includes the floodway, which consists of the
stream channel and adjacent areas that carry flood flows, and the
flood fringe, which are areas covered by the flood, but which do
not experience a strong current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blah, blah, blah. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flood plain has an immense value to communities bordering
various waterways. It has the ability to take in the vast amounts
of water during periodic flooding. The water comes rushing through
sweeping away most of the debris laying around but also deposits
things brought along from upriver often clustered around the bases
of trees or against larger debris that happens to get wedged in
it's journey down stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: AC28421 - Actual location of the cache

We found the misplaced general but didn't see a plaque so we thought we were in the wring spot so we walked away. Then we went back and CurlyNN spotted it. We went to where the GPS said to go but it seemed to be inside the closed nesting area so we walked around it to see and then we walked back which is when I realized I'd punched the wrong coords into the GPS. We then found very quickly. This was my 300 find and it sure was memorable. :)</groundspeak:text>

A very cool spot and when I had visited the blade assembly had been blown off of the mill and was laying stuck on the ground. Since then the blades have been repaired onto the mill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description as first written by Geofool&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****************************************************************************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located Mt. Emblem Cemetery in Elmhurst. Established in 1925, Mt. Emblem is perhaps best known for the 1850 windmill on the grounds. The property, previously a farm, was founded as a Masonic Cemetery. When I was growing up in the area, this windmill was open to the public. Its inner workings were a sight to see. Unfortunately, public access is no longer available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****************************************************************************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a little history on windmills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since ancient times, man has harnessed the power of the wind to provide motive power for transportation. Likewise, the technique of grinding grain between stones to produce flour is similarly ancient, and widespread. Quite where and when these two came together in the first windmill is unknown, but a likely scenario suggests a Persian origin, from where (tradition has it) the knowledge spread back into Northern Europe as a result of the Crusades. (Of course wind was not the first non-human power source applied to the task of grinding corn - it was preceded by both animal power, and in all probability by water power).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;European millwrights became highly skilled craftsmen, developing the technology tremendously and as Europeans set off colonizing the rest of the globe, windmills spread throughout the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pinnacles of windmill design include those built by the Dutch (who used windmills extensively to pump water as well grind flour) and the British, who developed many advanced &quot;automatic control&quot; mechanisms over the centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As steam power developed, the uncertain power of the wind became less and less economic and we are left today with a tiny fraction of the elegant structures that once extracted power from the wind. These remaining windmills, scattered throughout the world, are a historic and certainly very photogenic reminder of a past technological age.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****************************************************************************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find the final&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North coordinate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take the first 3 numbers and divide by three&lt;br/&gt;Subtract 12&lt;br/&gt;Add the result to the decimal portion of the posted north coordinate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;West coordinate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take the next 3 numbers and divide by three&lt;br/&gt;Subtract 5&lt;br/&gt;Subtract the result from the decimal portion of the posted west coordinate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go find the final and Have Fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN26DZF - GC26DZF Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ Â° __ . ___ W/E ___ Â° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is not at the posted coordinates, but is a stones throw away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is in honor of stones. There has been so much talk about Stones lately, I just needed to put a Stones cache out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you can see, the coordinates are almost entirely Stones. There are cachers who honor stones by putting them in their name. There are also bands who have Stones in their name. Others honor stones by wanting to put them in their mouths. Depending on the situation, some stones can be rather colorful too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many uses for stones. They can be used as building blocks or used for destruction. They can be whole or crushed. They can be hot or cold when they are used. They come in all sizes. Some people just like to hold stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stones can be large or small, but a stone always weighs the same. This puzzle will require that you know your stones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get the decimal portion of the North coordinates of the cache, You will need to convert 11158 pounds to its equivalent measurement in Stone. N 41 59.(???) Stone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get the decimal portion of the West coordinates of the cache, you will need to convert 5250 pounds to its equivalent measurement in Stone. W 88 00.(???)

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True"> A simple hide to celebrate the first 100 caches and the first year of caching of CurlyNN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would have waited until CurlyNN hit a more grand milestone, such as the usual 1000, but at the rate she is going that may not be for another nine years. ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been almost a whole year since I first introduced CurlyNN to the wonderful world of Geocaching and since then she has become a very good caching partner. Whenever I can't find a cache she is the one I call because she seems to have a sixth sense which helps her locate caches. I stole her away from her husband so many times that he finally made a rule that whenever I take his wife Geocaching if she finds that cache first I owe her a drink (meaning I have to drink it not her... but that's another story for another time).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I chose the spot because this is where CurlyNN grew up, where her now husband lived before the wedding, and close to where she adopted her kitty. The only problem you may have with the location is finding parking. The coordinates the GPS gave me showed up in the middle of the street after entering them so I updated them using Google Earth.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True"> This is a night cache. It is meant to be hunted after dark with the use of a flashlight. There is nothing at the posted coordinates, follow the directions below to find the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After hunting our first night cache back in March CurlyNN and I have loved night caches. I had the pleasure of hunting for a few more up in West Bend in August but CNN has only had the one experience. I was out one day in this park and I decided that it would be a great spot for a night cache and with no trouble I convinced CNN to help me with it. I hope you enjoy the third cache placed by the P^2 cachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The cache is not hidden at the posted coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;- You will need a flashlight to navigate to each stage.&lt;br/&gt;- Go to the posted coordinates to start your journey. You will know you are in the right spot if there is a good place to sit down.&lt;br/&gt;- The park is open until 11pm please respect the park hours.&lt;br/&gt;- Stay aware of your surroundings, there may be quite a few muggles walking around the park at night.&lt;br/&gt;-At the starting coordinates use your flashlight to scan the trees for a glowing orange dot - all of the reflectors are orange and are on trees.&lt;br/&gt;- The reflectors are not on private property so you don't need to shine your light on fences or into the residents yards or windows.&lt;br/&gt;- Once you see a reflector move to that location.&lt;br/&gt;- Standing within three feet of the tree scan in all directions with your flashlight looking for the next reflector.&lt;br/&gt;- Don't be deterred by tree branches (we tried to make sure there were none blocking the reflectors but trees to grow).&lt;br/&gt;- As you spot each reflector move to that location and search for the next reflector.&lt;br/&gt;- There are fifteen stages - some closer together than others, so be persistent if you don't see the next stage right away.&lt;br/&gt;- When you are at stage fifteen stand with your back to these final reflectors and look down, you should see the host.&lt;br/&gt;- You are looking for a small sized cache that may be a little difficult to remove but it can be done.&lt;br/&gt;- The cache has been placed quite far into the host so as not to be seen by any muggles, please replace it as found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache title comes from a song by The Platters called Twilight Time:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heavenly shades of night are falling&lt;br/&gt;It's twilight time&lt;br/&gt;Out of the mist your voice is calling&lt;br/&gt;It's twilight time&lt;br/&gt;When purple colored curtains&lt;br/&gt;Mark the end of the day&lt;br/&gt;I hear you my dear at twilight time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deepening shadows gather splendor&lt;br/&gt;As day is done&lt;br/&gt;Fingers of night will soon surrender&lt;br/&gt;The setting sun&lt;br/&gt;I count the moments darling&lt;br/&gt;Till you're here with me&lt;br/&gt;Together at last at twilight time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here in the after-glow of day&lt;br/&gt;We keep our rendez-vous beneath the blue&lt;br/&gt;Here in the sweet and same old way&lt;br/&gt;I fall in love again as I did then&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me&lt;br/&gt;Like days of old&lt;br/&gt;Lighting the spark of love that fills me&lt;br/&gt;With dreams untold&lt;br/&gt;Each day I pray for evening just&lt;br/&gt;To be with you&lt;br/&gt;Together at last at twilight time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Together at last at twilight time </groundspeak:long_description>

I also just happened to have a cache that I had prepped in the car so I put it in my pocket just in case I found a good spot. What do you know? I found a spot! :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was nobody around except for a couple of kids on the day I hid this cache but considering the location it looks like it has the potential to be a high muggle area so please be careful. You are looking for a magnetic bison. Now, this style of hide usually takes me longer to find than it should so hopefully anybody hunting this cache doesn't have the same troubles I usually do. It really isn't all that hard of a hide, I more just wanted to bring you to the location. </groundspeak:long_description>

Be sure to replace carefully so it won't get muggled!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maps can be fascinating, they can be boring, they can be pretty, they can be incorrect, they can be illuminating, they can be fun, and they can also help you out a lot. But they can't be any of this is you don't have a map. That's where Tachoknight came to my rescue recently so I dedicate this cache to him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As to the location of the cache, I had never been here before, but the map on my GPSr suggested there was a park here so I thought I'd check it out. My map was correct, yay! This park seems like a nice quiet spot and conveniently has plenty of parking nearby. As luck would have it, it even has a fine feature suitable for a cache. But do be careful in how you replace it, it has the potential to get muggled if you're not careful.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Chameleons are very cool creatures. This is one creature who can blend in with their environment and virtually disappear. So I named this cache for that wonderful creature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back in 1999 I moved from South Texas to Illinois and lived in Des Plaines for 3 years. During that time my newborn boy and I would visit this park frequently. By the time he was 3 we moved from Des Plaines, but this park holds the memories of my &quot;little boy&quot; and our cherished time at this park. &lt;br/&gt;The cache container is my favorite type. An ultra-nano! Yes Dinaworks your favorite! ;) The park is Winneabago Park hidden in a residential neighborhood. Please use stealth because this park can be filled with lots of Micro and Mini Muggles. And with many parks this one closes at sunset.&lt;br/&gt;If you cannot replace as I have hid it, then don't get it. This spot is necessary for the cache to blend in!&lt;br/&gt;The easiest way to get to the park is to take Lee St to Van Buren. Park on the allowed side of the street.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now off and find my little chameleon!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*** Congrats to Wheels00 for the FTF!! ***</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True"> You are looking for a nano that is an easy park and go in a suburban neighborhood. It is not located on private property and the people who live in the house it is front of know it is there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLEASE KEEP YOUR SIGNATURE SMALL. :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When my grandmother was young it was her dream to move into this house and at the time it had no close neighbors. Eventually her dream did come true and she and her family moved in when my mother was nine years old. My mother moved out when she got married and when I was twelve we swapped houses with my grandfather (he moved into our small house and we moved into this house). I went to the school that is right down the alley so I was able to visit my grandparents every day after school and we were always over here on weekends. So, even though I didn't move in till I was twelve I really did grow up in this house. Even now I didn't want to leave the neighborhood so I only live two blocks away and I am over here all the time visiting my parents. If you see either my mother (webby2) or father working on the garden don't let it deter you in looking for this cache and feel free to say hi.  I have also moved back in for the time being so I may be around as well.  :)</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>1) To check that you are in front of the right house subtract the second digit in the house number from the first and you will get the third number.  2) I hope you are driving the right kind of vehicle to park here.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

He searched and searched and finally found a great new home. It was all natural, rather large, and there was plenty of room to stretch. The best part was that he could invite his family to visit and there would still be room so nobody would feel crowded. He had so much room that he decided to change things up and not even build a web, he had one strand to help him climb out of his new home. He didn't think anybody would ever bother him again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your mission is to be super observant and... bother him. It won't be busy but his home is out there. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Elliot Park is right next to Lake Michigan with beautiful views of both the lake and in good weather, downtown Chicago. It is located just north of Lee St. beach.  At the northern tip of the beach at Lee St. starts a series of Timber Form Fitness Events. These are meant for both young and old and are a great way to add a little something extra to a walk. The cache is located in between the second and third parts of this fitness series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winter advisory: this cache will be hard to hunt when snow covers the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on the time of day, street parking may be hard (easy on a weekday morning, difficult on a weekend afternoon). It should not be hard to find free parking on side streets though, regardless of the time and day. &lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;Bring a pen. Although this is not a micro cache, itâs just small enough that I couldnât fit a small pencil inside. Look for a small silver-camo-covered container (or if you find the replacement one then a small glass container).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A token of turtle appreciation and a little something extra awaited the first to find the cache. Congrats on RheS and Bean Scene on the co-FTF!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You should only log this cache online if you've signed the paper log. If you encountered problems with accessing the paper log then include the problem in your online log and preferably email turtlefan with a photo of the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Logs stating nothing more than &quot;TFTC&quot; may find themselves deleted. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Amidst the rocks is a three-arm tree,
Sit on the fourth that used to be.
Although the lakeâs a much prettier sight,
Look below your feet and find a cache, you might.

Updated Sept 11, â09 due to some changes introduced by cachers:
As part of your exercise,
Lift a rock or two to find the prize.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I am sure there was another cache here. I did look through my 455 DNF's and couldn't find it. Grrr... Didn't find it then but we found this one this time.

We covered it much better as it was exposed.

I told you we would get up to find a few of yours someday.  :)

Thanks for the cache!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True"> Once you solve the puzzle you are looking for a camo'ed micro container.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is not located at the posted coordinates. When I was down by this area a few months ago I saw a fox roaming around. I made a point to return to this spot at the same time of day a week later and it was there again, and again the week after that. I love animals, and a fox is not one that you see too often around here, so I decided to place a cache in celebration of this cute little guy. If you happen to see this cute little guy while you are here looking for this cache please donât bother him, let him go about his business in peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I decided that a cache about a fox needed to be something other than a traditional cache. One of the definitions of fox in the dictionary is âa cunning or crafty personâ so a puzzle cache seemed the most appropriate option. I have not included a GeoChecker because that would make solving this puzzle way too easy â not to mention that once you figure out how to solve it a checker will not be necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing that you have read so far has anything to do with the puzzleâ¦ the puzzling part starts now:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.591 W 087Â° 40.354&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.631 W 087Â° 40.357&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.587 W 087Â° 40.334&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.610 W 087Â° 40.314&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.610 W 087Â° 40.346&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.601 W 087Â° 40.340&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.585 W 087Â° 40.343&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.647 W 087Â° 40.365&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.582 W 087Â° 40.330&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.599 W 087Â° 40.318&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.619 W 087Â° 40.351&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.592 W 087Â° 40.336&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.595 W 087Â° 40.360&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.573 W 087Â° 40.322&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.605 W 087Â° 40.316&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.642 W 087Â° 40.363&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.588 W 087Â° 40.348&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.625 W 087Â° 40.354&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.593 W 087Â° 40.320&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.637 W 087Â° 40.361&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.597 W 087Â° 40.337&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.587 W 087Â° 40.323&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.598 W 087Â° 40.366&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.605 W 087Â° 40.342&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.614 W 087Â° 40.348 </groundspeak:long_description>

Weber center was named after him to thank him for all the years of service. I wanted to place a cache here because of my family history. </groundspeak:long_description>

Not because it is a particularly grand location but because I found the statue here to be quite interesting. The way it is put together and because of the material that was used it looks like it could easily start walking around - I found this to be quite interesting and at the same time just a little bit creepy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There wasnât a spot to hide the cache right by the statue so you will have to use the plaque at the posted coordinates to figure out where the cache is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N HDÂ° GC.G2G W GFEÂ° HG.FBC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A = Number of letters in the second word on the third line&lt;br/&gt;B = Third number in the year&lt;br/&gt;C = Number of words on the last line&lt;br/&gt;D = Number of letters in the first word on the third line&lt;br/&gt;E = Fourth number in the year&lt;br/&gt;F = Number of words in the fifth line&lt;br/&gt;G = Number of letters in the artistâs middle name&lt;br/&gt;H = Number of letters in the artworkâs title&lt;br/&gt;I = Number of letters in the executorâs first name&lt;br/&gt;J = Number of words in the title of the artwork&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coordinates were determined using a combination of GPS and Google Earth and the aerial view looks correct but the street view looks off so feel free to use the hint to make finding easier.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is located at a spot that will give you a great view of downtown Chicago (weather permitting).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area gets more muggles than most other TaW hides so be careful. Please be stealthy while retrieving and replacing this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be sure not to do anything that you're not supposed to do around here as per the signs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A note on parking and accessing campus: While Northwesternâs parks are private property, they are open to the public between sunrise and 10pm. Nearest street parking is at N 42Â° 02.930 W 087Â° 40.465. Please take care with on-campus parking as you are likely to get ticketed if you donât follow the rules. Parking on campus lots is free between 4pm-7am on weekdays and all day on weekends. The closest on campus lot is at N 42Â° 03.100 W 087Â° 40.320.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No room even for my usual turtle trinket so the FTF will find a congratulatory sticker instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONGRATS to halizwein on the FTF and also EMHopper for braving the cold and being less than 10 minutes late to FTF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PA21WZF - Nearest street parking&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 02.930 W 087Â° 40.465&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PB21WZF - Nearest on-campus parking&lt;br/&gt;N 42Â° 03.100 W 087Â° 40.320&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Talk about luck on this one.  I had just bought some new five finger shoes, the ones that allow you to feel like you are walking barefoot.  You really do feel everything under your feet.   I got off of the bike and narrowed down my search area.  30 seconds into my search, I stepped on something.  There it was, laying on the grass underneath my big toe.  I put it back where I assume it belongs.  
Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the second in the Turtle among Wildcats series . Although very close to Sheridan Rd, once you find the spot, youâll think youâre miles away from the city. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This garden was rededicated in 2007 after extensive landscaping. The garden was a gift by the three sons of Marjorie Weinberg in memory of their mother who is an alumna of what is now called the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences at Northwestern University. A sign from a more central and trafficked path in the middle of campus points in its direction. You can read more about the garden on NU's site:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2007/10/weinberg0.html .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The closest access points to this part of campus are on the corner of Sheridan and Chicago (where Sheridan turns north, at the Northwestern arch), at another point going north from that corner on Sheridan or where Foster meets Sheridan (the building there houses the Kellogg School of Management).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A note on accessing campus: While Northwesternâs parks are private property, they are open to the public between sunrise and 10pm. Please take care with on-campus parking as you are likely to get ticketed if you donât follow the rules. Parking is free after 4pm on weekdays and all day on weekends in all campus lots. (The closest lot to this one is just north of this area to the right just off of Sheridan.) To park off campus, look for spots on nearby streets, they usually have 2 hr limits, which is plenty of time to find the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You should only log this cache online if you've signed the paper log. If you encountered problems with accessing the paper log then include the problem in your online log and preferably email turtlefan with a photo of the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Logs stating more than simply &quot;TFTC&quot; are much appreciated. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">First in a series of caches I've placed on campus. Accessing the cache will require leaving your car behind (although not your bike or dog).  You can approach it either from the north or from the south. Both walks are beautiful and will take you along Lake Michigan. (Whichever way you come, I recommend then leaving the other way to see more of campus.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although much of the park near the lake is rather open, there are a few groups of trees here and there. Youâre looking for a group of trees whose leaves will stay through the winter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the most part, the area is calm, but lots of people do use it for strolls or jogging. While I was working on hiding the cache, about a dozen muggles walked or jogged by. Although youâll need to take some care, as noted above, so few people realize this part of the park that I doubt youâll have much trouble staying under the radar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please place the cache back carefully as you found it including the loop.  Otherwise, Iâm concerned that either the wind or squirrels will move it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Youâre looking for a small camoâd tubular container with a twist-off top. Bring your own pen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A token of turtle appreciation awaits the first three to find this cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A note on accessing campus: While Northwesternâs parks are private property, they are open to the public between sunrise and 10pm. Please take care with on-campus parking as you are likely to get ticketed if you donât follow the rules. Parking is free after 4pm on weekdays and all day on weekends in all campus lots.  To park off campus, look for spots on nearby streets, they usually have 2 hr limits, which is plenty of time to find the cache. The streets north of campus tend to have room even mid-week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You should only log this cache online if you've signed the paper log. If you encountered problems with accessing the paper log then include the problem in your online log and preferably email turtlefan with a photo of the cache.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Whether to hide or to opine,
This spot a few feet up is mighty fine.
The southwest corner of this mini forest,
Is for geocachers by far the coolest.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;p&gt;
At this year's (2011) Holiday Coffee House Social and Gift Exchange hosted by PiD and Steinie, Santa gave out ready-made cache containers with the request that we hide them soon. Thus this cache was born.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people in the area seem to like puzzles, right? Okay, I can
play along. I have no idea how difficult this one is (feel free to
suggest altered ratings), I just came up with it one day. As long
as you follow the directions correctly and don't let the
challenging parts of it get you down, you should be fine. On that
note, all the information you need is right here on this page. I
suspect this one may be tough and I'll consider adding hints after
FTF. Enjoy!

Have you ever had a crappy day? You know, the kind of day where it seems to come in threes? Perhaps you get a flat tire. Or you brake too quickly and you spill your coffee. Maybe you're on time for work but get caught by a long freight train. You're sooo close, but so far away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And then things get back on track. But something happens â you get a run in your pantyhose before the big meeting or you get your favorite tie caught in the paper shredder just before you're about to close a major deal. Maybe you forget to pay the mortgage and the bank's on the phone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So you take a deep breath, you calm down and all is well. But then you're driving and it seems like it's taking forever just to accomplish anything. You go to the park but you can't relax. So you go to the forest preserve but it's too hot or maybe too cold or it's raining. Maybe a different forest preserve will be better. Who knows? One thing's for sure, crap always comes in threes.

It's a great place to go in the evening for a quiet walk. I hope that you like it, too. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is accessible from Kenilworth Lane or from Cole Park, with entry from Glen Oak Acres. The terrain is mostly flat and the park itself is not terribly large. This would be a great cache for small children to help find.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you come at dusk in the summer, you may find deer or fireflies. </groundspeak:long_description>

to my two friends, Phil and Jen, who are currently engaged and are
soon to be married this November.  I am happy to be a witness
to such an amazing relationship.  Their love for each other is
quite admirable.  I like to wish them a lifetime of happiness
together and many great memories in their lovely new home!&lt;/p&gt;

Well, those dogs may not, but rest assured, Snoopy is there. Once you see him, youâre close.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A note on parking. The most immediate parking lot seems to be restricted to special permit holders so be careful. Elder Lane Park just north of Centennial Park has a lot with fewer restrictions. There may also be street parking options although these seem to have some constraints during school hours (the park is located close to some schools). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If youâre up for a longer walk (15 minutes), I recommend parking south of here at Plaza del Lago (and near some other caches) and taking a stroll along Sheridan Dr up to Centennial Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring a pen, this is a very small cache with no room for a pencil. You're looking for a small gray container.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Tired from walking? Youâve come to the right place.
Sitting on some rocks offers a slower pace.
Snoopy to your right, look below to your left.
There youâll find a hole that dogs may leave to rest.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I always pull my bike off into the woods so no one can see it.  But because I never know what direction I am going to wander, I have to take a waypoint where I left my bike.  So it is my own little multi-cache.  Thanks for contributing to my exercise for the day.!!</groundspeak:text>

At least we decided to break out our wet weather gear.

Approaching the cache area we made a quick check at the obvious sopt but the GPSr didn't agree so we went to ground zero and the cache was soon in hand.

A touch difficult signing the log with the downpour but teamwork came into play and the job was done without any leakage.

Always great to meet you at events and I am glad we could head north to hunt some of your caches.

Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

The trail can be muddy after a rainfall and the area near the cache itself was very wet when the cache was placed.  We've set the terrain rating at 3 because we had to wade a bit through some shallow water (just a couple of inches) to get to the cache site (which is on dry ground).  There may be a dry route to the cache, but maybe not.  During the summer the entire area may be dry and the terrain rating would then be a 1.5 or 2. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It was a great day! Warm enough to be comfortable but cold enough that we didn't need a canoe to tackle our primary goal of the island in the Skokie Lagoons. :) Not that we would of minded canoeing! After a great lunch at Red Hen in the nearby Glencoe we decided to return to grab a few south of where we were hunting.

Just when you think you have found all the LBJ's you happen across another. Great way to lead us to the bridge to area's beyond too.  :)

What a great place to cache and a very nice cluster of caches.

It was a great day! Warm enough to be comfortable but cold enough that we didn't need a canoe to tackle our primary goal of the island in the Skokie Lagoons. :) Not that we would of minded canoeing! After lunch and cleaning out the caches on both islands and then some we decided to clean out what was left in the area.

Deer? Didn't see one but come down along the Des Plaines River in my hood and the deer will eat out of your hand. Another fun and quick side trip.

What a great place to cache and a very nice cluster of caches.

Just continue past the cache to the water's edge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We had originally planned to place a full-size cache here but the lack of good hiding spots and the occasional muggle presence caused us to down-size to a 4&quot;-tall screw-top container which will hold small trade items only.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE 6/2/07:  After several recent dnfs we went out to check on the cache and found it to still be in place. However the area has greened up considerably since the cache was placed.  We couldn't get good satellite coverage and we realized why it has been so difficult to find.  So here's a clue--find the old picnic table.  The cache is located about 50 feet west of the table. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun! &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Godda love clearing up a dangling DNF.  :)  The Fogies can be tricky. It did take a few minutes to find but find it we did. Hid it much better (Sorry ESI)  :) .

I godda come back sometime to dip a paddle.

We had also completed the KU Jayhawk's wonderful trifecta of hiking caches before making our way to this one. Nothing like a great day of hiking. After hunting this cache we started thinking about lunch but decided for one more in the island before heading back across.

A micro in the woods, I hate those, but this one was an easy find for us.  We were thankful that we were doing this one with ground being frozen.  I imagine this one is trickier when the ground is wet.  Thanks for the cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A velodrome is a track designed for cycling and this one is a real beauty.  It was the dream of Ed Rudolph, a Northbrook resident who trained some of the greatest speed skaters in US history and who was a significant force in the development of the Northbrook Park District.  Cycling is the summer training sport for speed skaters so a velodrome seemed a natural for this village.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original track opened in 1960 with an oiled, compacted-earth surface which served cyclists for decades.  We lived in the city when we first came out here for the Thursday night races in the early â70s (that was before we became âfogiesâ).  It was a cheap date and lots of fun.  In the winter the infield was flooded and used as an ice rink for speed skating.  Over the years many Olympic bike racers and speed skaters trained here and many other local kids and adults had a great time in the âcitizen races.â&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By 2003 the velodrome was badly in need of repairs and resurfacing but the $400,000 needed to do the work was beyond the reach of the park district.  The Northbrook Cycle Committee, a volunteer organization of riders, fans, and officials launched a campaign and raised $230,000.  The park district put up the rest of the money and the track was closed for the 2004 season while the facility was rebuilt.  The velodrome reopened for the 2005 season and a schedule of events can be found at www.northbrookvelodrome.org. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come out for an evening of racing if you canâitâs still a cheap date.  There are Thursday night races and Friday night development races.  At the Friday night races you can sign up as a Citizen Racer and try the track yourself.  See the velodrome website for details. If you canât make it for the events, be sure to take a look at the track and imagine the Olympic hopefuls on those banked turns. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I found the GC easy enough but it took me a few minutes before I spotted the cache and then another few minutes to figure out how to get the cache into my hands. I managed to figure out a way that allowed me to do it quickly and move on to my second babysitting job of the day.</groundspeak:text>

Wow! A bit late seeing as you have just passed 3K but Congrats!

Great hides and a very nice hunter. It is good to know you.  :)

Didn't have too much trouble getting to ground zero just the usual geo stuff. Once at the spot we were lucky and made the find quickly. Good thing I wqas along.  :)

Here is a toast (clink) to your milestones. A hearty wish for many more.

One of her favorite activities was taking us for walks in this forest preserve area.  This place has everything a dog could want: wide-open spaces to run in, shaded woods, graceful deer, and fabulous smells (if youâre a dog thatâs a very important factor).  We often think of Chelsea when weâre geocaching (she would have loved this activity) and this seemed like just the right location for a hide.  The cache is a small ammo box that we have initially stocked with dog toys and accessories.  Bring a four-legged friend if you can, have fun, and enjoy a walk in the field and woods. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We parked nearby and was a little worried about the water we saw but we have patience and was rewarded.  :)

I do not think many people picnic at this micro grove.  :)

A quick dash into the woods and we were chuckling at the clever container. Even Steinie made the trip to visit.

Great job! The log a touch damp and if we don't get anymore rain it should be fine.

Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

We had missed the parking for the last cache and lo and behold we managed to park right between that one and this.

A nice walk thru the closed and overgrown parking area and a short bushwhack.

The cache was found in a few minutes and after doing the deed we attempted to cover it better. Hard to camo in it's spot.

Nice little preserve!

&quot;If I only had a brain.&quot;  :)

Parked close and stumbled across the path heading in.

We has spotted someone in the woods as we drove up, kneeling next to downed trees, and thought he might of been a fellow geocacher. I decided to hold off on hailing him until I check if there were footprints near the cache...

Nope. I left him to his own solitude.

I checked one spot, then another... went around to the other side for a better look and Bingo! ... the cleverly crafted container came into view.  :)

Logged, replaced (for maximum effect) and had a nice hike back to the car.

Once back in the car we drove to the end of the preserve road and spotted the fellow once again in the woods and it turned out he was taking photos on this beautiful (if bright) sunny day.

The other caches will have to wait for another day.

Thanks for the fun cache!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You're looking for an ammo can hidden in the woods. We think Geocaching is all about &quot;paying it forward.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Pay it forward or paying it forward refers to repaying the good deeds one has received by doing good things for other unrelated people.&quot; -Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pay It Forward concept:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You find this cache and in return place a &quot;pay it forward&quot; cache of your own --easy huh? When somebody finds your cache they do the same, and so on and so on. Maybe you can bring a stocked cache container with you and place it on your way home, or maybe you already know of a good location, either way this series has the potential to grow very fast. Once you place your cache simply name it &quot;Pay it Forward&quot; with your team name attached, example ---Pay it Forward/Team Joe Smoe. ----I would love to see this series reach the far corners of the earth while giving back to the Geocaching community at the same time. Feel free to cut and paste this description if you decide to participate by placing your own PIF cache. You DO NOT have to place a cache if you don't want to, but it would be appreciated and hiding one PIF cache per team will be enough to make this happen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope you enjoy the walk in the woods. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We found both the first and second stage. but we got stuck. By then, my seven year old was thirsty and the water was in the car.  Had a couple of ideas, but they were not the right ones.  I plan to keep on thinking.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I can't believe I'll never have another spinning salad here . . . sigh!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;History&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Otto Roth opened The Blackhawk on December 27, 1920 at 139 N. Wabash in Chicago. In September 1926, The Blackhawk began featuring a dance orchestra, Carlton Coon-Joe Sanders and their Kansas City Nighthawks. In addition to providing dance music for the local diners, the music from the Blackhawk was broadcast nationally as &quot;Live! From the Blackhawk!&quot; over WGN Radio and the Mutual Network.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
By the time Coon-Sanders moved on from the Blackhawk in 1931, the broadcasts from the Blackhawk were so popular that a telegraph machine was installed so they could take remote requests. The Coon-Sanders band was followed by a rotating crop of musicians which, over the years, included Kay Kyser, Chico Marx, Louis Prima, Ish Kabibble and many more. Mel Torme, whose first paying performance occurred at the Blackhawk in 1929, also became a frequent performer at the Blackhawk. In 1938, Bob Haggart of Bob Crosby and the Bobcats composed &quot;Big Noise from Winnetka&quot; at the Blackhawk.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In 1944, Don Roth (1913-2003) inherited the Blackhawk upon the death of his father. Roth used his experience as a theatrical booker to increase the restaurant's reputation in and outside Chicago.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When the Blackhawk stopped featuring orchestras in 1952 and removed the bandstand and the dance floor, Don Roth declared the restaurant's theme was &quot;The Food's the Show&quot; and focused on the house specialty of prime rib served from carts brought to the tables and its &quot;spinning salad bowl.&quot; Waiters would bring a large bowl of greens set into a larger bowl of ice. As they spun it, the waiters would add ingredients and describe what they were doing to the diners. Roth borrowed these concepts from Lawry's in Beverly Hills, California.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Blackhawk remained open until August 31, 1984.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Don Roth's Blackhawk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In 1969, Don Roth opened a second restaurant, Don Roth's Blackhawk, in the northwest Chicago suburb of Wheeling, Illinois. This location, which was later decorated with photos and memorabilia from the original Blackhawk, remained in business until December 31, 2009, when Roth's widow, Ann, nearing 90, elected to close the restaurant. Don Roth's Blackhawk continued to feaure the &quot;Spinning Salad Bowl&quot; and prime rib.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Don Roth's Blackhawk Spinning Bowl Dressing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The signature spinning salad featured two kinds of dressing, one of which the restaurant had specially bottled.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From diningchicago.com:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From 1952 until the restaurant closed its doors, servers would pour dressing over a whirling bowl of greens, reciting:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;This is our famous Blackhawk spinning salad bowl consisting of 21 ingredients, including a variety of fresh pulled greens. First we spin the bowl and apply the basic dressing. Next we add a bit of special seasoning, and then some chopped egg. We mix the salad a total of six times only, very gently, three now and three times later in order not to bruise the tender greens. Next we add some freshly ground pepper and our special blue cheese dressing. We now mix the salad three more times. And serve â topped with anchovies or shrimp.&lt;/i&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

So I decided grab the family and the dog and hit Somme woods.  We had been here last winter, but the snow cover made the hunts too difficult.  

This one made us walk in circles for awhile, almost giving up, but my 7 year old Molly came up with the find.  Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

We saw this interesting location that was really calling for a cache but we had already hidden the one larger container we had with us so we dropped off a micro (as of 9/09 it's a camo-covered preform).  There's a lot of places to look here so we'll tell you that the cache is not on the ground but you don't have to climb to get it.

His plan called for 2300 apartments in 12-story high rises.  Northbrook opposed the plan and the developer, fearing a time-consuming court battle offered Northbrook an alternative.  His proposal to build a shopping center and small office complex resulted in Northbrookâs annexation of the land.  The 150 homeowners in the subdivision southeast of the development were against the change from residential to commercial zoning, so the developer donated a parcel of land to the Northbrook Park District as a buffer zone.  The mall opened in 1976 and the buffer zone became Williamsburg Square Park. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Let my GPS do the routing... Rats! Creek!

Hey! Lets drive around!  :)  Driving along, looking at the houses across the green space...

Hey! Where did the creek go!  :)

Screech!!! (backup, backup, backup) Hey! A gate!  Cool!

Walk, walk, walk...

...

Did you ever notice how the cross bars and uprights on the tennis fence cause the snow to melt in that pattern. ridges in the shadows.

Cool!

...

At the spot...

&quot;No, I don't want to check there!&quot; Read the hint, interpret... Whew!  :)

Check a very likely spot... Mmmm... Think again about the hint...

I check again. This time, wiping away the snow and revealing container.

Tricky!

Log, replace...

Next?

After the last find I punched up what was near and this sounded good.

First stage is in place and in good shape. ]Maybe if Gil climbed up on Ruby's back.[  :)

Punched in the coords for the second stage and made my way over and near the entrance to the final there was a mild looking woman pulled over by two police SUV's. Maybe she was dangerous?  :)

Had a nice walk into the woods and as I got to the area a hidey spot caught my eye and as I approached I spotted the container on the ground intact.

Logged, grabbed the TB and found that the cache nestled nicely out of sight. Cool!

Didn't I come back to find this one after my DNF? Maybe in a dream.  :)

Well I came back and found it again today.  :)  Got out of the car and walked right up to it. Eerie!

Nicely hidden in a nicely prepared container!

Routing took me right in and after a short walk I was at ground zero.

After a quick look around I knelt in the center to give a 360Âº scan and the container was soon in hand.

Very nice park!

The elevated difficulty is due to the location of the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Lame Joke Series has decided to hit the road and check out a few new locales, the first of them being Kewaunee.  This is a quaint little park located in said town.  I love visiting this town!  Every time I do, it reminds me of the tiny, little town I grew up in, called Abercrombie (Fort Abercrombie to those that care) way out west in North Dakota.  If you ask me, I have all kinds of useless knowledge about my hometown and state.  I don't know why, but I'm a great party favor...  Okeeeey!

3. The first explorer named on the sign has how many letters in his
last name? = S&lt;br /&gt;
4. Sawmills were established in the ABCD and EFGH. A + B + C + D +
E + F + G + H = PM&lt;br /&gt;
5. Outrageous prices were paid for (Z). # of letters in Z + 1 =
TN&lt;br /&gt;
6. In the mid 1790's (P) erected a trading post near here. (p = #
of letters in first and last name). P - 4 = U&lt;br /&gt;

meaning &quot;praire hen,&quot; &quot;wild duck,&quot; or &quot;to go around.&quot; You just
might see a praire hen or wild duck here. Short hike on a level and
groomed trail. 20 feet off the trail. No real bushwhacking. Look
for a grouping of 6 fairly large trees.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Quick and easy. Keep walking past the cache out onto the point and
look down at the last large rock. Depending on what your into, you
just might find a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;

I placed this cache because of a certain event going down.  Don't worry though, it's going to be a permanant cache.  Please feel free to grab a seed cache from the container (I left several in there) after you sign the log.  Most of the seeds that are in there are ones that need to be used to make caches - as I'm sure many of you have realized that I'm a big fan of making some different caches.

&lt;p&gt;The parking coordinates will bring you to where
Moon Valley Drive meets Baird Creek Road. Find parking and head
south on Moon Valley Drive. Enter the trail to the south side of
the bridge and follow the creek until you come to a small cascade.
About 350 feet. Mother nature has created an ice sculpture at this
point. Hurry to see it before mother natures handiwork disappears.
From there you are on your own to the cache. Enjoy the view of the
ice sculture and the surrouding area of Baird Creek.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is a bison tube.&lt;/p&gt;

Just bear with me for a moment while I explain my motivation for this joke.  I've had to hear this joke every year, on Easter, since I was about 5 years old.  Yep, every year my dad busts out this old chestnut and makes us all double over with laughter.  I don't think Easter would be the same without this knee slapper:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q: Why does the Easter Bunny hide his eggs?</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>A: Because he doesn't want anyone to know he's been fooling around with a chicken!

My best friend told it to me, and for some reason I found it to be one of the funnies jokes I had ever heard (&amp; I've heard a lot of jokes).  It was so funny at the time that I hit the floor laughing.  It is, to this day, my all time favorite joke:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q: What do you call a fish with no eyes?</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Welcome to the neighborhood. Travel along the roads from
Start to Finish obeying all traffic signs. At each intersection
follow one of the arrows. That is, you can turn in a certain
direction only when there is a curved line in that direction, and
you can go straight only when there is a straight line. You can
leave an intersection only at the head of an arrow. U-turns are not
allowed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So: At the first intersection, you can only go straight(move #1).
At the second intersection you can again only go straight(move #2).
At the third intersection you could go straight or turn north(move
#3). Suppose you go north. At the next intersection you can only
turn east(move #4). Itâs true thereâs a line that
curves to the west, but there is no arrowhead pointing west, making
this an illegal move.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Find the shortest route from start to finish and count your moves.
Your answer = XY.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
X + Y = A&lt;br /&gt;
X + Y - 1 = B&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Nyrikki's path (a night cache)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This night-time geocache is based upon the Finnish Kalevala. Ancient Mythology and Christian Faith Old Finnish mythology survived as oral tradition well into 19th century. Although the oral poetry goes back to the prehistoric times, it was first compiled by Elias LÃ¶nnrot in 1835, when Kalevala, the national epic of Finland, was published. LÃ¶nnrot collected the songs of unlettered folk singers and joined them into a long narrative poem, centered around cultural heroes and great magicians like VÃ¤inÃ¤mÃ¶inen, LemminkÃ¤inen and Louhi. Stories by JRR Tolkien, mainly The Lord of the Rings, were heavily influenced by the stories in it. It has been compared to such works as the Iliad, and Homerâs The Odyssey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of the Gods of ancient Finland, the forest deities are held in very high regard. Highest among them is Tapio, âThe Forest-Friend,â âThe Gracious God of the Woodlands.â He is depicted as a very tall and slender divinity, wearing a long, brown beard, a coat of tree-moss, and a high-crowned hat of fir-leaves. His consort is Mielikki, âThe Honey-rich Mother of the Woodland,â âThe Hostess of the Glen and Forest.â When the hunters were successful she was represented as beautiful and gracious, her hands glittering with gold and silver ornaments, wearing ear-rings and garlands of gold, with hair bands silver-tinseled, on her forehead strings of pearls, and with blue stockings on her feet, and red strings in her shoes. But if the game-bag came back empty, she was described as a hateful, hideous thing, robed in untidy rags, and shod with straw. She carries the keys to the treasury of Metsola, her husbandâs abode, and her bountiful chest of honey, the food of all the forest-deities, is earnestly sought for by all the weary hunters of Suomi (Finland). These deities are invariably described as gracious and tender-hearted, probably because they are all females with the exception of Tapio and his son, Nyrikki, a tall and stately youth who is engaged in building bridges over marshes and forest-streams, through which the herds must pass on their way to the woodland-pastures. Nyrikki also busies himself in blazing the rocks and the trees to guide the heroes to their favorite hunting-grounds. Sima-suu (honey-mouth), one of the tiny daughters of Tapio, by playing on her Sima-pilli (honey-flute), also acts as guide to the deserving hunters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nyrikki's challenge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long has it been. Hundreds of winters have since past that the Gods of ancient Finland were regularly honored and remembered. Nyrikki has taken on a challenge. Fearing that the hunter spirit has left all mankind, Tapio has charged his son to prove to him that this spirit still lives. Prove to him that the hunter in man has not been lost forever.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nyrikki has taken it upon himself to place a treasure within the forest of this great land. A small portion of the treasures of Metsola. To find it, one must posses the courage, strength of will and mind of a hunter to complete. For only in the darkest of the night will this treasure be found. Only by the light of the torch can this path be illuminated. One must dwell within the darkness, among the night creatures of the northern forest to succeed. One must show great respect for the land. One must honor those creatures that walk the forest trails and pathways and those Gods that create them. Walk among the bear, coyote, and wolf. Even the bat, and flying squirrel. For the forest their home, their playground, and their hunting ground too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your objective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a two stage geocache located in the area of the Anderson Lake pathways and consists of a microcache leading you to a regular cache. Take note of the maps marking the trails. These will be helpful as you will mainly be following along loop 1. You begin here: N 46Â° 13.493 W 087Â° 29.638 at the water pump. I just park off to the side of the road. Not blocking the pump. The coordinates of the final cache are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N46 13.___â W87 29.___ â&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note also that they are missing the final digits. To acquire those missing digits or keys to the treasure, a hidden pathway must be traveled and will be visible only to the most adventurous having great strength of character and spirit of the hunter. And a good flashlight or headlamp. The starting point of the pathway is near:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N46 13.701â W87 29.912â&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have seen Nyrikkiâs path. Look around these coordinates. The path will appear to you like a trail of stars winding through the forest. You may hear, if the night is quiet enough, the howl of coyotes or the blow of a startled deer bounding through the brush. You may hear the roar of distant mining operations to the NNW, or the horn of a distant train to the NNE. But do not be distracted from your path. The micro cache is marked like a glowing star and should be easily located. Take the numbers you find within and insert them into their corresponding latitude and longitude. Lastly, don't forget to log your find at: geocaching.com</groundspeak:long_description>

series of pretty waterfalls.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Be prepared for a workout when you go to find this cache since the
hike from the parking area (near N 46 44.007, W 87 58.498) to the
cache is at least 1.8 miles, one way! The terrain isn't too bad;
just a couple of small hills. If you go for this cache in the
spring BRING BUG DOPE!!! as there are plenty of mosquitos and black
flies. The falls are nice anytime of the year but have a lot more
water in the spring making the hike more worthwhile. Bring a camera
to get some pictures of the falls. Simplified directions to the
parking area: 510 to AAA Rd., West at Anderson Corners, follow AAA
straight then South. Go 1.9 miles then left on a small two track
road.</groundspeak:long_description>
