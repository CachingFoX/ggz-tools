The mention of the term in an 1881 British Golf Museum indicates that the term was in use at least as early as that period. The term means &quot;look ahead&quot;, and it is believed to come from the military &quot;beware before&quot;, which an artilleryman about to fire would yell alerting nearby infantrymen to drop to the ground to avoid the shells overhead. &lt;br/&gt;Other possible origins include the term being derived from the term &quot;fore-caddy&quot;, a caddy waiting down range from the golfer to find where the ball lands. These caddies were often warned about oncoming golf balls by a shout of the term &quot;fore-caddy&quot; which was eventually shortened to just &quot;fore!&quot;.</groundspeak:long_description>

My first Sunday back at church an old friend introduced me to the most amazing woman. We started dating a few weeks later and married on June 2, 2001. We spent many hours here playing ping-pong, attending classes, hanging out with friends. We came back to town to play in our favorite river and she suggested hiding a cache to mark the day. We happened to have a couple containers ready to go and found a fairly easy spot for the hide. Make sure to close the bag with the log to keep it dry. Bring your own pen. Plenty of parking but may be very busy especially during the day. Don't park long, they do tow. </groundspeak:long_description>

During dry weather this pond is completely dry, but after a good
rain it fills up nicely. Either way, there are interesting rocks
and trees along the trail, as well as excellent chances to see some
wildlife. We hope you enjoy your walk through this nice and
well-hidden area.

I've found three caches in this area recently but never turned left rather than right from the trail head. It was odd to find myself, according to my GPS, searching for this cache in the middle of a lake. Nothing but blue for yards around apparently! [:)]

I'll have to come back here after a big rainstorm to see if Mapsource is correct.

Two new caches in this new greenbelt this week - one either side of the creek. The roads look like they are coming very close to the creek on this side - don't know how much greenbelt will be left in the end.

I agree the adjacent large natural feature does look old. At least a couple of hundred years, likely more.

Nice straightforward find and I didn't get lost - both plus points!

Checked it again at 10:00 when the rain had stopped and as nobody had logged it yet thought I'd give it a go. The trails to the cache site are well drained and it was easy to avoid the muddy spots; but it was cold - particularly the wind chill! Took my hands 15 minutes to thaw out when I got back to the car. Very nice cache and good location. Looks like new entrances are opening up to this greenbelt although I got completely Mapsourced (again) on my way here and had to back track all the way to Slaughter.

Wasn't surprised to see Ed's name in the log and anybody who came out in that rain deserves the FTF! [:)]

Not surprisingly the adjacent creek was in full flow and the whole area is looking very verdant.

&lt;p&gt;It is a fairly large container with lot's of goodies for the
kids. Start at the trail-head coordinates and follow the
double-track trail all the way to the end. Update: It is getting a
little more difficult to discern the double-track, so follow the
path of least resistance. When you get about 250 ft. away, you may
be tempted to veer left, but it is better to veer right along the
rock pile. There is also a nice playground and picnic area to enjoy
near the trail-head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please note:&lt;/b&gt; There is a bee-hive in the area along the
trail, so it's probably a good idea to not let your dogs or kids
run loose off the trail.&lt;/p&gt;

This cache was the complete opposite of that one - it's a long time since I've seen such a large container.

Area which is located near the east runway at Austin-Bergstrom
International Airport. Nearly one acre has been set aside to
provide a vantage point for watching planes land and take off on
the airport's 9,000 foot east runway. This viewing spot offers a
paved parking area and picnic tables, so take a snack or meal and
enjoy the view. The Family Viewing Area is at the end of Golf
Course Road, which is on the south side of Hwy 71 East and just
east of the airport's entrance. Recommended viewing times when the
most flights are landing and taking off include mornings from 6-11
a.m., afternoons from 1:30-3 p.m., and evenings beginning around
7:30 p.m. If there are muggles present, you will need to use
extreme stealth while searching for and replacing the cache. If you
have a scanning radio or other air band radio, you can listen to
the flight controllers and pilots on the following frequencies:
&lt;p&gt;Tower (East): 121.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tower (West): 118.225&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ground: 121.7 and/or 121.9&lt;/p&gt;

Picking up my son from the airport, arrived a little early, so I decided to grab this cache. No muggles to speak of, although a couple of cars came and went from the TxDOT Avaition facility across the street while I was in the area. The most difficult aspect of this cache was crossing over Hwy 71 to get back to the airport.
Just catching up on some cross posted caches.

Our nearby cache &quot;Coming and Going&quot; used to be a travel bug hotel,
but due to landscaping changes we had to make it a micro. But we
thought to ourselves, there's a Hilton near the airport for people,
so there ought to be a Hilton near the airport for travel bugs. So
this is that cache. It may not be as fancy as the other Hilton, but
it is a convenient stopover place for those traveling bugs. When
you're in the area, be sure to drive to the end of the road and
check out the airport viewing area. Nearly one acre has been set
aside to provide a vantage point for watching planes land and take
off on the airport's 9,000 foot east runway.

    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes being so far from home I really miss having family around, but over the years I have learned to make my own 'family'. Good friends can be hard to find, so I consider myself lucky to have a new friend named Wayne. Thanks to Wayne and Candy, I stuck with Geocaching long enough to love it AND meet a lot of new friends!&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Wayne is one of the really special people in this world who would 'give you the shirt off his back' and he has, literally!!! Some really special moments for me are the time he called me to go to a newly posted cache, way out in the middle of nowhere, that was posted by an 'unknown' cacher. He personally drove over 100 miles out of his way so he could escort Julie and I to that cache and make sure we would be safe being the 'firsts to find it'. Another time, he took me caching all day in San Antonio and made sure to open the car door for me EVERY TIME when I got in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wayne is an awesome role model in my life as he dotes on his wife candy, too. It's obvious to all of us how much they adore one another. They are just plain 'good people' and I am so happy to add them to my list of family. Wayne, I salute you and thank you, thank you, thank you!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanya&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have made friends who you love like (or better than) family, write about someone who has changed your life for the better, by being your friend! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: There is a bonus cache for this series, GCJQG8. Be sure to read about it before you hunt this one!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

name from the noise they make when caching.  The name itself
means first finders in Geo-slang.  Tsetse range in size from a
6-16, are robust in form and can cause severe frustration to other
wannabe first finders.  A tsetse sister can find twice as many
caches in a single day as regular male cachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The name tsetse is derived
from the noise these flies make when flying. The name itself means
&quot;fly&quot; in Tswana.  Tsetse range in size from 6-14mm and are
robust in form and can cause sleeping sickness in humans.  A
tsetse fly can drink twice its weight in blood at every
meal.)&lt;/p&gt;

Was out and about picking up Queen Zelda's latest cache when this popped up. It was right on my route home - so what could I do? I had no option but to go for FTF...

Just one more of the Tsetse caches to get. Hasn't shown up yet - Prime Approver is building the suspense...

Thanks to Tanya and Lori for this great mini series!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you have stumpled upon the &quot;Go Log

&lt;p&gt;We are NOT sure how many
caches are in this series, yet!  As we are in the process of
placing them all now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our series begins in Dick
Nichols Park in SW Austin.  We parked there for the first
seven caches, even though you may notice some appear to be OUT of
the park, the first 7 are accessible from the park!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TSETSE SISTERS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsetse Sisters derive their
name from the noise they make when caching.  The name itself
means first finders in Geo-slang.  Tsetse range in size from a
6-16, are robust in form and can cause severe frustration to other
wannabe first finders.  A tsetse sister can find twice as many
caches in a single day as regular male cachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The name tsetse is derived
from the noise these flies make when flying. The name itself means
&quot;fly&quot; in Tswana.  Tsetse range in size from 6-14mm and are
robust in form and can cause sleeping sickness in humans.  A
tsetse fly can drink twice its weight in blood at every
meal.)&lt;/p&gt;

My strategy paid off (well - a little bit) managed to head the Tushes off at the pass by heading round the loop in the wrong direction and cutting across to this one before they got there.

Thanks to Gadget Girl and Sis for a great little series of sneaky hides!

It is a night time only cache that requires a bright flashlight for each adventurer. Once you reach the coordinates, shine your light around until you spot the first Lightning Bug that will guide you along the correct path. All the Lightning Bugs will be the same color, until you reach the site you seek. At that point you should see three Lightning Bugs of a different color, guiding you to your final destination. It can be tricky to find your way back out of the forest at night, so be sure to turn on your gps unit's tracking function before you head out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FI2HEHE - final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;TSETSE SISTERS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsetse Sisters derive their
name from the noise they make when caching.  The name itself
means first finders in Geo-slang.  Tsetse range in size from a
6-16, are robust in form and can cause severe frustration to other
wannabe first finders.  A tsetse sister can find twice as many
caches in a single day as regular male cachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The name tsetse is derived
from the noise these flies make when flying. The name itself means
&quot;fly&quot; in Tswana.  Tsetse range in size from 6-14mm and are
robust in form and can cause sleeping sickness in humans.  A
tsetse fly can drink twice its weight in blood at every
meal.)&lt;/p&gt;

container from small medicine container to quart size bottle. All
containers are camo-painted green or brown. All caches have a log,
most have a pencil, but you should bring your own pen or pencil
just to be safe.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you have stumpled upon the &quot;Go Log
   Yourself!&quot; Cache Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are NOT sure how many
caches are in this series, yet!  As we are in the process of
placing them all now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our series begins in Dick
Nichols Park in SW Austin.  We parked there for the first
seven caches, even though you may notice some appear to be OUT of
the park, the first 7 are accessible from the park!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TSETSE SISTERS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsetse Sisters derive their
name from the noise they make when caching.  The name itself
means first finders in Geo-slang.  Tsetse range in size from a
6-16, are robust in form and can cause severe frustration to other
wannabe first finders.  A tsetse sister can find twice as many
caches in a single day as regular male cachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The name tsetse is derived
from the noise these flies make when flying. The name itself means
&quot;fly&quot; in Tswana.  Tsetse range in size from 6-14mm and are
robust in form and can cause sleeping sickness in humans.  A
tsetse fly can drink twice its weight in blood at every
meal.)&lt;/p&gt;

They had the advantage of two people - I was sitting in the parking lot at Dick Nichols typing in coordinates from my Blackberry while they were already on the trail.

Saw they'd logged this one first so headed in the opposite direction hoping to go round the loop the other way!

Cool series Gadget Girl and Sis - thanks!

If the square root of Pythagoras is x and the train is traveling at y mph towards a station where a boy who had z crumpets for tea last February is standing facing due West then what is the probability of me finding a cache on a Tuesday morning in September?

Well, I worked this out by experimentation and, as it turns out, after some trial and error the answer is 100% - Yeah!!

This brightened up an otherwise dull morning. Had a mega conference call and wasn't sure I was going to get off it soon enough to beat Inspector Gadget to the cache! (Sorry Dan)

Yet another part of this 'Yet another greenbelt' that I hadn't seen before. How much more of this is there? I assume this is the other side of the creek from the exercise trail leading to Dick Nichols park. Certainly didn't know there was an entrance here.

Coordinates needed some creative cache finding! I bushwhacked WAY more than I needed to of course.

machines that have had a tremendous impact on our entire lives, and
without which Geocaching probably would not exist. We are talking
about the IBM PC, which is 25 years old this year, and the Apple
Computer, which will be 30 years old next year. (See the link above
for more information.) The cache is starting off with all computer
related items such as memory, modems, cables, a router, etc.,
(they're not brand new, but they work) and we would like to keep
that theme going, so if you trade, please leave a similar item.
(Birthday cards and Travel Bugs are OK, too.) 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: As of 02/23/08 someone took our large container and all
it's computer swag, so we decided to replace it with a small
Rubbermaid container in hopes that it will be left alone. It now
only has room for very small items.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The posted coordinates are for parking. There is a nice trail
into the woods from here. If a computer were to tell you where to
find the cash, it might say:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

8:10am on a Saturday!
Ah, the age of technology. Did it really begin with the IBM PC and Bill Gates? I think I'm going to have to go back to bed, lie down and pull the sheets over my head until the panic attacks calm down...

You can blame my kids for this FTF - it posted after I'd powered down last night and I wouldn't expect to surface until MUCH later than 8:00am. However, I had a secret weapon, the kids got up early to go help a friend move house and, being kids, weren't quite as quiet as church mice when they left. As a Brit, once I'm woken in the morning I have to get a cup of tea [i]immediately[/i] and just thought I'd check the computer.... 

An email from gc.com? Tea is immediately forgotten and, as they say, the rest is history.

Thanks for bringing me here, the parking spot was about a quarter of a mile from the house but, even though we've lived here over 11 years, I didn't know this trail existed.

It's interesting how it starts off as a rough trail and then suddenly you stumble across some very neat and tidy walking trails, presumably created by the nearby homeowners. Then reverts to rough trail again. Saw no birds but, to be honest, I wasn't really looking - just had the cache on my mind....

T - Green Jeep TB (I was just thinking last night that I hadn't seen one of these in the wild yet)

L - Signature carabiner (right on top of the cache so you see it straight away, must have been feeling cruel this morning [:)] )

Neat quick cache - about as close to a park-n-grab as a multi can be...

If you've done a few Austin caches then you'll walk up to these immediately - however if you are newbie a couple will have you scratching your head!

Neat hides - TFTC!

PS - News 8 slot looked good too! Good job everyone - got the point across without giving too much away.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a Stargate Cache that can be used to transport Travel Bugs
from Central Texas to another Stargate Port listed on this page.
Parking coords are: N 30 12.931 W 097 51.783 or you can park at
Dick Nichols lot across the street. All cachers welcome!!! Cache is
.15 miles from parking coords. Stay on trail till 70 feet from
cache. Container is an ammo can.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
Put simply, any travel bug
arriving at a Stargate TB Cache is rapidly transported via WORMHOLE
at WARP speed to another Stargate TB Cache for eventual pickup.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a TB is left
at this cache (ammo can) with a valid Stargate address, the TB will
be transported to that specified Stargate TB
Cache (for example: if
“P3898” is included in the log entry or on a physical
note attached to the TB, that TB will arrive at the Stargate P3898
TB Cache). If the TB is left without a
valid Stargate address, or has an invalid address, it will be
transported to a cache that best advances its goal (in the cache
owner’s opinion).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyone interested in establishing a Stargate TB Cache that’s
at least 500 miles from any other Stargate TB Cache please
contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:devin.ross@verizon.net&quot;&gt;drossdross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(*) TBs traveling overseas, or to other countries, may
require multiple wormhole trips to intermediate Stargates to
complete their mission. Additionally, a Zero Point Module (ZPM) may
be required. Logistics to arrange multiple trips and/or to secure a
ZPM may take several weeks or more. If the TB’s Commanding
Officer (i.e., owner) does not want the TB to volunteer for such a
lengthy, long-distance mission, just quickly contact the owner of
originating Stargate TB Cache (me, drossdross, for P4079) and they
will revoke the TB’s travel orders - and reassign the TB to
local support duties (i.e., redirect the TB to local
caches).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this cache is themed to
Travel Bugs, there is also a log and trading goodies in order to
welcome all
geocachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you encountered any problems with this cache, please
contact the cache owner:  &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:tanyamp@austin.rr.com&quot;&gt;Gadget Girl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I hate how fast Austin is growing. Paving parking lots everywhere
we look! 
&lt;p&gt;One cool thing about South Austin is that in spite of it all,
these really cool little greenbelt, walking parks are popping up
everywhere! Even where you least expect them. I caught this one out
of the corner of my eye on the South Mopac flyover heading home and
thought, &quot;Hey look there's a place for a new cache!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

More than one way into this area - and I picked the wrong one through some incredibly sticky mud. Took me longer to get the mud off my shoes (had to do it - it made me too tall to get into the car) than to find the cache.

&lt;p&gt;The treasure chest is starting out with the following trade
items: sidewalk chalk, a wind-up helicopter, a magnifying glass,
needle-nose pliers, 2 small race cars, glow-in-the-dark shoe-laces,
a magnetic locker mirror, a locker organizer, and for the
first-to-find, an aluminun beverage container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an easy walk, but it gets a little tricky right near the
cache, so watch the little ones. Enjoy the area, and please re-hide
the treasure well.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway, for once 'X' really did mark the spot and the treasure chest willingly gave up its booty.

Met Golden Bear at the cache site - chatted for a while and warned her about my difficulties with Sunset View. I'm sure she didn't need any help as everyone else but me seems to have found it easily! I'm just having a bad-cache day I think (not enough hair for a bad hair day anymore)...

This is a small cylinder with camo tape, well hidden in a cute little unknown park in SW Austin/Oak Hill.

 
&lt;p&gt;

The park is in need of some TLC as you will see when you get there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

There are very few trails and lots of ups and downs to traverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  This is an old limestone quarry from way back when. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Prisoners cut limestone from here that was later used to build the Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

I would love to nominate this park for a Trash in Trash Out event this spring! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Have fun!!! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tanya &lt;/p&gt;

Took a while to spot - there are a million possible hiding places!

I can confirm that there are some dirty scratches in the log in the FTF slot which could be interpreted as TXBigfoot's if you squint and use your imagination! [:)]

Also found your TC cache in the same park Tanya - thanks!</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE LISTED COORDINATES ARE
BOGUS&lt;/b&gt;. To find the cache, you've got to turn your attention
northward and put your thinking cap on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; AND  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We're bringing a little of Washington right here to Austin, Texas!
This is a two-stage Texas geocache working in tandem with a
two-stage Washington geocache. To find Stage 1, you must learn a
few things about our neighbors to the north. To find Stage 2, you
must partner with them online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;b&gt;STAGE ONE&lt;/b&gt;



&lt;br /&gt;
 In order to find this cache, you need to answer the quiz
below about Washington State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;The Quiz&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  What is the state capital?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  What is the state tree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  What is the state bird? (hint, American
is NOT in the answer, answer is 2 words)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.  What is the state fruit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.  What is the state song?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.  What is the state fish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;The Coordinates&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
OK, now here's how you turn these answers into your Stage 1
coordinates:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;use the key below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Stage 1 latitude is &lt;b&gt;N 30°&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;14.&lt;/b&gt; (#
of letters in answer 1 minus 7)  (# of letters in answer 2
minus 7)  (# of letters in answer 3 minus 7)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Stage 1 longitude is: &lt;b&gt;W 097° 54.&lt;/b&gt; (# of
letters in answer 4)  (# of letters in answer 5 minus
12)  (# of letters in answer 6 minus 10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Stage 1 cache is a redirector containing only one piece of
information- the longitude and latitude of Stage 2. Just one
problem: While the longitude is for the Texas second stage, the
latitude is for the second stage in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;b&gt;STAGE TWO&lt;/b&gt;



&lt;br /&gt;
All right, Texans- now it's time to team up with your fellow
geocachers in the north. You're going to have to trade latitudes to
find Stage 2. Here's how you do it:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Take a look below for notes anyone in Washington may have posted
to this website requesting a partner to exchange latitudes with. If
you find someone, click on their user name to get to their profile
page, then email them via geocaching.com and arrange the trade
between yourselves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. If you fail to find any such notes, you can post one yourself on
our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OXZTVY&quot;&gt;counterpart cache page in Washington&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully,
someone in Washington who needs an Texan partner will read your
note and contact you via geocaching.com. You may have to wait a bit
for this, of course.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. If you've waited more than three weeks without finding a
partner, please contact the Washington cache owner, and she will
give you the second-stage latitude. (Of course, we could give you
the number ourselves, but that wouldn't be in keeping with the
spirit of this 'partner' geocache!)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;



&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT
NOTES&lt;/b&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please do not post premature &quot;found it!&quot; notes. If you post a
&quot;found it!&quot; note before completing Stage 2, your note will be
deleted (after fair warning, of course).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, please remove any partner-seeking notes you post on the
Washington cache page after you've found a partner. Otherwise,
you'll keep getting contacted, and folks up there will be
frustrated by the clutter of old notes. Whenever we find outdated
notes on these two cache pages, we will remove them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, please don't post any coordinates on either of these cache
pages. Posts that include coordinates will be deleted as soon as
they are discovered. The cache is a standard ammo can, stocked full
of all kinds of Washington goodies, sent directly from our caching
counterparts. In order to keep the cache fully loaded -- &lt;b&gt;please
try and bring TEXAS (or Austin) items to trade&lt;/b&gt;, so that we can
keep their cache loaded with just as much cool stuff from the Lone
Star State! There is a ziploc bag for placing your Texas items
into; please do not remove any items from that bag- only take the
(very cool) Washington items in trade.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please also take care to replace it (and its camo) exactly as you
found it, so that we can avoid detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Initial contents of the Washington
cache include:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;key chains, stickers,
postcards, playing cards, magnets, whistles, etc.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Initial contents of the Texas
cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;key chains, stickers,
postcards, magnets, etc.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Please give credit to the
idea behind the creation of this cache to TEXAS GAL, where ever she
may be, we miss you, darlin, and would love to have you back in
Texas soon!]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I have to admit that this is NOT my kind of hide location and I likely wouldn't have gone if I'd known what it was. Once I was there though I couldn't chicken out and had to try it. It wasn't the finding that was the problem - it was getting away from the cache site afterwards that I found really difficult. Even though he sniped the coordinate trading Stratman deserves the FTF. There's NO way I'd have attempted this in the dark and/or wet. Curtis - you are truly insane! (and I mean that in the nicest way...[;)]

Also, Curtis, how did you manage to park 300ft away? Nearest parking I could find was 0.25 mile. Off-roading, heh? [:)]

Be sure to go check out the view after finding the cache. The terrain level reflects &quot;Ground Zero&quot; and not the trail itself. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a camoed match container. You do not have to remove the cache from it's hiding spot. Please, just remove the lid. The cache is log only. You will need to bring your own pen. Remember the log is pretty small, so please sign the pages front AND back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We chose this spot after we stumbled upon it by accident. It was sunset and the view was gorgeous with a nice breeze. We figured we should share it with more people. Its a shame that there aren't more people frequenting this park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area seems like a good place to launch a kayak or canoe.&lt;br/&gt;You do not have to enter the private property nearby&lt;br/&gt;Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to FireMonkey0 on the FTF!&lt;br/&gt;And also congrats to djdiggla on a very epic STF!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...and please remember to log your DNFs.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This little peninsula serves as a nice little section of the hike and bike trail that doesn't get enough use. The cache itself should be easy to find for an experienced cacher. Getting to it requires going off trail, but not very far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache itself is a small &quot;peanut butter jar&quot; style container that has been rinsed with bleach and camoed. The camo in this case, however, is really just for fun and less for camo. Please replace the cache exactly as you found it. The log is inside a pill container within the cache for a little added protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really like this section of the hike and bike trail, but it doesn't see much use. The area around GZ frequently could use a little CITO, but the only muggle trouble you'll likely find is a random person catching fish or jogging past. There is normally plenty of parking in the area, but we reccomend the coordinates below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... and please remember to log your DNFs. They are a big help to everyone and not a mark of shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrats to FireMonkey0 on being FTF! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
iiiiPLEASE LOG TRAVEL BUGS PROPERLY OR DON'T TAKE THEM AT ALL!!!!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;h2&gt;CONSTRUCTION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The First Street Bridge was designed by UT School of Engineering
graduate Julian P. Montgomery with 4 lanes and 4 ft sidewalks. The
plan was to help relieve the traffic load on both Lamar Street and
Congress Ave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first steel span was placed on its concrete piers on June
22, 1953 with completion projected for late August, 1953. Well,
that didn't quite work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bridge was completed February 1, 1954 (at a cost of
$510,000) and the opening/dedication ceremony was held on February
11. The High point of the dedication was when Mayor A. C. McFadden
described the bridge as being symbolic of a link between &quot;two
segments of the finest people in the United States, those who live
in south Austin and those who live in north Austin.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first person to cross the bridge was 78 year-old E. R. Noe
who, in 1912, was the first person to officially cross the then new
Congress Avenue Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 19, 1956, the Austin City Council voted to rename the
bridge as The Drake Bridge in honor of William Sherman Drake, Jr.
(1909-1967) who had been the Mayor of Austin at the time the bridge
was built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NAMESAKE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor Drake's father, William Drake, Sr. (1864-1934), had come
from Connecticut to Austin with his brother Carl where, in 1883,
they founded the Drake Brothers Store. The store was located at 2nd
and Guadalupe; a point where wagon trains entered Austin. Shortly
thereafter, William Sr. bought out his brother and changed the name
of the store to Calcasieu Lumber Company and eventually became the
last Treasurer of the Republic of Texas and the first Treasurer of
the State of Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Jr.'s first real job came at the age of 21 as a
switchboard operator at the lumber yard. He took over as President
of Calcasieu Lumber 4 years later when his father died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drake's political career started when he was first elected to
the Austin City Council in 1949. He served as Mayor Pro Tem from
1949-1950. He was then reelected to the Council in 1951 and was
immediately and unanimously selected by the City Council to serve
as Mayor, replacing Taylor Glass who was stepping down to turn his
attention to running his ice cream factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mayor (1951-1952), two of Drake's primary interests were
fixing the growing traffic problems that were coming with a growing
Austin and promoting good, clean city government. He was
instrumental in establishing the current pattern of downtown Austin
one-way streets and being sure they, at the time, were synchronized
with lights in and just beyond the downtown Austin area to improve
traffic flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EXPANSION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 29, 1989, The Austin City Council gave approval for the
expansion of The Drake Bridge to it's current 6 lanes with 10 ft
sunken hike/bike paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;THE CACHE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, now that you know a little of the story behind this bridge,
head out and go find the cache placed there. Watch out for the
muggles (the reason for the high difficulty rating) and be careful
not to drop the cache! If you get lucky and don't have to worry
about muggles, the difficulty drops to a 1. Be sure to bring your
own pen, pencil, crayon, or other writing device of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a nano type container hidden on the Pfluger Pedestrian-Bicycle Bridge just downstream from the Lamar Boulevard Bridge.  Parking is much better on the south side of the river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also note that both Google and Yahoo maps show the cache to be in the lake.  It is not, it is only accessible by walking/riding out onto the bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bridge is perfect for riding your bike, strolling, sitting on one of the many benches, watching the sunset, and sometimes catching a free concert.  There are no cars allowed in the area, so it is a great place for pets, children, and wandering adults!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The difficulty rating is based mostly upon the size of the cache, it's camo, and the difficulty you will likely have in handling it.  **Note: there is no need to venture into the 'garden' for this one.  You can reach it while standing on the bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring your own pen and don't drop it in the water!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache was placed to point out an unusual building in
West-Central Austin. The cache only has room for very small items. 
&lt;p&gt;Please be discreet and keep an eye out for muggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a little history on the building:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Military Institute started out as the Bastrop Military
Institute in the 1850's. Bastrop lies about 40-50 miles east of
Austin. The school ceased operations during the Civil War. After
the war, the occupying Union commander initially denied a request
to resume classes. However, in 1868 General Sheridan allowed the
school to reopen in Bastrop. Administrators quickly realized the
Bastrop facilities were inadequate. Austin then raised a $10,000
building fund (in gold!) and enticed TMI to relocate. The
castellated building was constructed in 1870 on a bluff overlooking
Shoal Creek, the original western boundary of the city. Original
plans called for an enclosed square with towers at each corner.
However, only two of the planned towers were built. In 1879 the
state established Texas A&amp;M as a military-style school and
hired TMI's president and entire faculty, forcing the private
school's closure. The building was used by Bickler's Academy
between 1884-1887. Thereafter it was a private residence for
several decades. The south end of the building (including one of
the towers) was removed sometime after 1887. In 2001 developer Gary
Bradley bought the castle for his office. Bradley had developed
Circle C Ranch in southwest Austin which led directly to a local
ordinance aimed at preserving water quality in the underlying
aquifer and Barton Creek. In response, Bradley's cronies in the
state legislature passed a law forbidding cities to make such
ordinances, and Austin's law was struck down. Well, that has
nothing to do with the castle but it has made for hot politics (and
dirty water) in Austin. Currently it is an office building in a
residential neighborhood. The area is still known as Castle Hill,
now also the name of a popular local restaurant. Most Austinites,
however, do not know the origin of the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another nice castle/home located at N30 17.525, W097
45.288 that is easily visible from your car if you care to check it
out, but I wasn't able to find a suitable location to place a cache
there.&lt;/p&gt;

There are also some very incongruous structures still standing around it - a couple of bus shelters that used to be in front of the terminal and the large overhead gantry sign that used to direct you to Departures, Arrivals and parking. I can't count how many times I drove under that gantry in the past.

I have fond memories of this airport in a pre 911 world where you could just wander up to the gates to meet your friends or family as they came off a flight and the tiny bar and Taco Bell that was just about all that was available at the American gates at the end of the concourse.

However I also remember the rugby scrum that passed for the baggage carousel! Tiny carousels with no room and people 6 deep all around them. Yikes!

Bring your own pen. &lt;br/&gt;This cache is being placed to draw your attention to a cool feature of this new walking path. Being touted as &quot;the biggest public art project in Austin’s history&quot;, you will be looking at a series of 18- to 20-foot tall flower-shaped sculptures that collect the sun’s rays and convert them into solar energy to light the structures at night. So they will provide shade during the day, and a neat light show at night, as well as lighting the walking path after dark. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

N30 21.234  W097 49.949
Cache is about .14 miles from parking coordinates down some cool mountain biking trails!  Have Fun!  Don't forget to bring a recipe!!!
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 



&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I really love good
  recipes &lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; I really wanted to create a nice theme cache, too.  So
  here it is, now you have both!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a
  regular cache in a smaller ammo box.  Contents include 4 different
  recipes on nice colored cardstock for your files.  I have placed
  approximately 25 of each in the cache to start you off.  I will re-stock
  my recipes and add new ones as supplies grow low.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pasta e fagioli
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No Bake
      Chocolate Cookies
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choc-Oat-Chip
      Cookies
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best Pecan
      Sandies (old family recipe, so yummy)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your mission,
  should you choose to accept it, is to take one or two of &lt;u&gt;my recipes&lt;/u&gt; for
  yourself and add one or two of your favorite recipes to share!  I will
  check on the cache periodically to collect the new recipes and either scan
  them or re-type them and post them as pictures on the cache website for all to
  share.&lt;/p&gt; I will work to post some recipes on my new cache site, soon.  Currently under construction.
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itscaching.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.itscaching.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Please only
  remove my recipe cards&lt;/u&gt;,
  so that I have time to scan the new ones for everyone.  Post a note
  whenever you log the cache find as to which recipe you took and which you
  leave, so I can keep count for re-stocking.  If you forget to bring a
  recipe, please email me one or add it to your log later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Please
  keep this a theme cache for recipes only&lt;/u&gt;.
   Please do not place
  toys and other cache stuff, there will not be room.  The only exception
  is Travel Bugs and/or other traveling items.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cache on!!! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Love, Gadget Girl&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">To reach the park from Ranch Road 620 in Lakeway, turn west onto
Lakeway Blvd. After about half a mile, turn right on Duck Lake Dr.
Go about a quarter mile and turn right on Palos Verdes Dr. The
trailhead is located at N30°21.821' W97°58.145'. (You &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt;
access the trail system by going to N30°22.066' W97°57.835' and
following the arrows painted on the pavement, but if you do, you
will bypass much of the scenic beauty this area has to offer, and
to share that beauty is the whole reason behind placing this
cache.) 
&lt;p&gt;The trails are well marked and maintained, but I recommend that
you click here for more information and for a trail
map that you can print and carry with you on the trail. (Use a
color printer if possible and set to landscape.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you look at the map, you will see that there are several
possible routes to the cache. I prefer the “primitive” trails, but
they are all nice, so try different ways out and back, and see
which is your favorite. The hike is about 1.7 miles round trip with
some ups and downs no matter which way you go, so take some
drinking water and maybe even a picnic, as there is a nice place
for one at your destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please resist the urge to take any off-trail shortcuts, both to
preserve the environment, and so that you won’t miss any of the
scenic views along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache is located within 40 feet of the trail, so please
stay on the trail until you are within this distance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your hike!&lt;/p&gt;

I'd been looking for a scenic cache to make find #1,000 and Emmy-n-Sapphie recommended this one.

Good call! This is the kind of cache that explains why a lot of us enjoy this hobby. I've never been a fan of exercise for its own sake and you'd never get me in a gym - it bores me to tears like most sports. What I need is an excuse to get exercise, a scenic hike with a purpose so that I get some hiking in without even noticing it.

Beautiful hike with just enough 'up and down' to make you feel like you've done something but not too much that it makes you feel ill, and some great views and scenery along the way. What could be better? (Well - maybe some water in the lake? :-) )

Thank you Banda for cache # 1,000!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Okay, since this is “My First Dam Cache Ever” I wanted it to be
mostly easy, but make you work a little bit. This Cache is located
near the Mansfield Dam Park near Austin, TX. Terrain is steep and
lots of tall plants around the trail.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Mansfield Dam (formerly Marshall Ford Dam) is a dam located on Lake
Travis across a canyon at Marshall Ford on the Colorado River, 13
miles (21 km) northwest of Austin, Texas. Construction of the dam
began in 1937 and was completed in 1941 as a joint project by the
Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) and the United States Bureau
of Reclamation. Originally called Marshall Ford Dam, the name was
changed in 1941 in honor of United States Representative J.J.
Mansfield. The reservoir behind Mansfield Dam is named Lake Travis.
The dam is owned and operated by the LCRA. 
&lt;p&gt;Mansfield Dam is 278 feet (85 m) high, 7,089 feet (2 km) long,
and 213 feet (65 m) thick at the base. The concrete gravity dam
with embankment wings and saddle dikes was designed to control
flooding; to store 1.4 km³ (369 billion US gallons) of water; and
to generate hydroelectric power (102 megawatts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-lane highway crossed the top of the dam, but traffic
congestion brought on by the growth of the city of Austin and
expanded popularity of recreation at Lake Travis forced the state
to build a four-lane highway bridge on the downstream side of the
dam. Traffic is no longer allowed on the road across the dam,
except for service vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

Cache is a little the worse for wear after 6 years in the wild but still serviceable and I was pleased to finally sign that logbook!

What a FANTASTIC spot for a cache, though! The owner may need to change out the container for a more water proof version.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;After Semper Questio's injury in January, we
had to give Semper Fi back to the Greyhound Pets America. He was
having troubles we just could not handle while SQ was laid up.
Since then, we have been told that this gentle soul has succumbed
to bone cancer. We are so grateful that God brought Semper Fi into
our lives and that we were able to provide him a home and a
comfortable life for several years after his racing career was
over. He will be missed terribly. Good dogs NEVER live long
enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This
BYOP micro was placed near the spot where we had a fun time with
our dogs and, in particular, our Greyhound, Semper Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We brought the dogs out one day for some caching and just
walking around the park. There had been a good bit of rain recently
and there was a decent amount of water in this little creek feeding
the park's lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greyhounds are generally very graceful, but Semper Fi doesn't
swim. However, he does like to wade in water, as long as it is not
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; deep. About halfway up his legs is fine. So on
this day, he stepped up to the bank, looked at the water, and
decided it was a good time and place to get his feet wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stepped off, stepped in, and plunged into water all the way
over his shoulders! I don't know who was more surprised...him, or
us! But let me tell you, a Greyhound's eyes can get pretty darn
wide in certain circumstances and this was one of those! Keep in
mind I told you that &lt;b&gt;he does not swim&lt;/b&gt; but he was sure giving
it one heck of a try that day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we got him out all safe and sound and had (and still have
from time-to-time) a good, long laugh at his expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while you're in the area, take a break at the nearby bridge
and try to visualize a graceful, skinny, wide-eyed, 75 pound racing
dog flailing about in the water while you go bag this cache. Maybe
it'll give you a bit of a chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please do not park along the road. There is plenty of parking in
the nearby lot. Also, please do a little CITO along the way.
Finally, if the water is low, the Terrain rating drops to a 1.5 and
don't forget your own writing instrument of choice! Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

Doing some after dark caching, there were critters jumping into the pool in the creek, but it was too dark to see what they were. I decided that since they were jumping into the pool they were not going to attack me.
I looked right at the spot where this was hidden a couple of times before poking around and realizing that foraging insects had covered it with natural camouflage.
Due to the foraging insects this hiding spot has a limited shelf life, so to speak.
I was poking around on this site and saw that I had found this one so I decided to log it.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">TFTC SL TNLN There were muggles in the area when I arrived but they seemed to be busy fishing so I ignored them until one of the them got up and came walking toward me then I recognized him. It was a family that I know that lives not far from here, so I chatted with them for a while, went and found the cache then chatted a bit more before we all left. The father caught a sunfish while I was chatting with him. He said that he likes to come fishing here quite a bit. There is PI in the area but I did not see any along the route that I took to/from the cache. My friend said that he saw water moccasins in the river earlier as they were fishing. I did not see any wildlife except the barn swallows that are building nests under the bridge deck and the fish that he caught. This cache will not survive if another flood comes through here like the one that happened in September 2010 when tropical storm Hermine came through here. Right now there does not seem to be much danger of that due to the drought we are in. Driftwood can be seen hanging from the beams that support the bridge. The young man said that water was over the the bridge, which is a good 20 feet above the location of the cache. This is the 1st cache I have found that is listed only on opencaching.com and the 4th that I have found that is listed on opencaching.com. 1105301655Z</groundspeak:text>

I was out today checking on my own cache just a few yards from here (listed on geocaching.com) and decided to see if I could find this one.  Sure enough, there it is!

Took the Garmin coin.  Not quite sure yet if it is trackable anywhere or just collectible.

Not at all sure about this opencaching.com thing....  

TFTC anyway!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This Cache is a Delight be it Day or
Night&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you approach this area, you will see a LOT of construction.  So far it does not appear that it will affect this specific cache but use care and let me know if you could not access it due to the construction.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a night cache that could be found in the
daytime. In fact, I will give you the alternatives in the
hints.&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout this state, there are many rest areas that have been
closed down and are basically a cacher’s ready-made dream. This is
one of those places. In fact, there used to be a cache here called
&quot;Forgotten Rest Area&quot; that was only recently archived.&lt;br /&gt;
When I arrived here around midnight, the State Constabulary was
observing traffic in darkness. I walked up to his vehicle and asked
him if he had heard of geocaching. I got the stock answer so I
basically told him that it was a treasure hunt with a GPSr and that
I wanted to hide one here. I asked if there would be a problem with
that and he said that was fine with him; in fact, he would move his
vehicle so that I could park safer. And that is what he did; he
moved off down the highway and left me to do my thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can park safely off of the main thoroughfare
and the cache can be obtained quite quickly.&lt;br /&gt;
For Night Cachers: When you get to the primary coordinates, stop,
and read the marker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;
 Because it is there to be read.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Won't help you find the cache though except you know that you are
at the starting point.&lt;br /&gt;
After you have read the plaque, hold your flashlight out in front
of your eyes and look around for White #1.&lt;br /&gt;
Go to White #1 and look for White #2.&lt;br /&gt;
Go to White #2 and look for White #3.&lt;br /&gt;
When you have found White #3, look for Red #1.&lt;br /&gt;
Go to Red #1 and look for Orange and Green for the cache is just in
between the two off them.&lt;br /&gt;
The shorter you are the better chance you have of locating it.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>[For Day Cachers Only] Add decimal.zero one six to the north coordinate; add decimal.zero two three to the west coordinate and it should take you directly to the cache.  Orange and Green are about seven feet up the tree.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Not really sure if you log it twice if already found or what, but wanted to get the chance to put the 1st one out in Killeen, lol. This system is still in beta but it gave the option to list my caches from other websites but do not see where it tells the geocacher yet so I mention it here.____Description:___&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a bear up in them woods, I tell ya! Peeking up around the trees a little while caching nearby, we came upon the extremely rare Texan green-eyed brown bear, thought to be exinct many years ago! If you can find him, he may surrender to you a cache as the reward. I would not recommend driving too far up to it, especially during or after a good rain. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I work just a few yards away so maybe I just might be watching during school hours. High muggle potential. Park in approved parking lots only. No bushwhacking required. Stay on the path.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;In small towns (Oglesby has a population less than 500) it is
amazing that they can find enough people to have a baseball field.
The Oglesby Little League Park and Recreation Area is on the
eastern side of town. I was led here by accident when attempting to
find another cache. My TomTom in-car navigator was determined to
send me via this road through a few fields to my final destination.
Well the road ends here by the Little League field. I imagine that
this place may have random fits of intense muggle activity but
generally this place appears quiet. They have toilets but I don't
know if they are open 24/7. The cache itself is a small Geocache
Lock-and-Lock knockoff container held in place with a common
suspension system. Coordinates are pretty durned close. There is a
log and a pen and some small tradeables. It is not a roomy cache.
Please put the container back exactly where you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one other small note: Any road shown going EAST from the
cache site is a figment of someone's imagination. You cannot get
there from here!&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Now it's my turn to give back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of this road are two companies that use lumber as a raw material.  Well, kinda!  Imperial Wood Works creates beautiful church furniture including pews, baptismal fonts and, of course, altars.  Central Texas Corrugated brings in large rolls of virgin and recycled paper to create corrugated sheets.  These sheets are used to make boxes, displays and various containers of all shapes and sizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next time you're sitting in a church pew or walking around the grocery store displays I hope you stop and wonder if it might have orginated here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now on to the cache!  A match container hidden in a tree.  Because this area is industrial they run pretty much six days a week so watch out for the muggles!  BYOP and enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A log-only cache in a unique container.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache is dedicated to a couple of geocaching legends. Back
in the 70s there was a geocaching couple named &lt;i&gt;Denny and
Sandy&lt;/i&gt; who geocached under the name &lt;i&gt;The Geo-A-Go-Gos&lt;/i&gt;
because they were inveterate cachers and &lt;i&gt;dancing fools&lt;/i&gt;. They
were a part of everything that was geocaching. They had more finds
than practically anybody, and so many hides that you couldn't be a
geocacher for very long without finding one of their caches. Any
time you found a &lt;i&gt;really creative&lt;/i&gt; hide you'd think to
yourself &quot;This must be a Denny and Sandy cache,&quot; or &quot;This guy must
have learned this technique from Denny and Sandy.&quot; Not only that,
they were the center of the local geocaching social scene, with
picnics in the park, soirees at their &quot;cottage&quot; by the lake, dinner
parties at their palatial home. If you threw a party, they were
sure to be there. You name it, they were part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one day they just disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was like they had vanished off the face of the earth. Some
suspected the worst, but there were curious hints that they were
still alive and well &lt;i&gt;somewhere&lt;/i&gt;. There were occasional
garbled messages on the answering machines of local cachers. Now
and then there was a familiar sounding, but anonymous, post on a
geocaching message board. Some people reported finding barely
readable scribbled messages in cache log books. But no one ever
actually saw them. They left a big hole in the local geocaching
scene that was never completely filled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there were rumors about what had happened. Some say
they moved to New York City where Sandy sings and dances on
Broadway and Denny plays guitar in a jazz club on the lower East
Side. Others say they were shot down and captured by the
Sandanistas while fighting communism in Central America. Still
others say that they perished while trying to set up a 1000 cache
power-trail in Antarctica. As for me, I think they are off
somewhere fighting for Truth, Justice, and the American Way, and
that one day they will dance back into our lives with a chest full
of medals and a heroic tale to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is dedicated to you, Denny and Sandy, wherever you
are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located near the first stage of an old Denny and
Sandy multi-cache called &quot;Tweet, Tweet, Little Pete&quot; or something
like that. It is a container that is in keeping with that former
cache. It is log-only so bring your own pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck, Denny and Sandy, and may the geo-force be with
you.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Turtle Angel suggested this area as a hiding spot. We found the specific location together. I averaged the coordinates for over 5 minutes, and also correlated them to a Google Maps satellite overlay, so hopefully they're spot on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This can be a muggle-heavy area, so please use stealth.&lt;br /&gt;

Tennessee, and Central Texas -- at one of our favorite on-the-road
eateries.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The challenge here is to figure out where you need to be in
order to nab the cache without arousing curiosity or suspicion. If
a muggle sees you nab it, it will be history in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So pull up one of these nice rockin' chairs, set yourself down,
enjoy a game of checkers if you have a hankerin', and grab yourself
a smiley!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unusual pointer here is that although the cache may be
available pretty much around the clock, daylight hours may provide
better stealth cover. A night trip during opening hours may expose
you far more than you desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Although this is marked 24/7, be prepared to explain what
you are doing to the local constabulary if you are there after
hours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FINAL NOTE: Someone took the time to place this cache for your
enjoyment. That someone derives great pleasure in know that folk
appreciate the efforts taken to watch, monitor, and maintain. So,
please take the time to make a reasonable on-line log entry. Blank
on-line logs will be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

In addition to being one of the most important paleontological sites in the world, we have geocaching too!  This Tic-Tac box cache contains a log, a smushed penny, a custom path tag, and REAL FOSSILS!  Please be aware that all Mammoth Site caches are accessible without crossing the front gate or perimeter fence; no trespassing after hours.  If you visit while we're open, however, please stop and pay your respects to the mammoths.

Nelson. Grab a 35 cent coke and wave to the locals!
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://countrymusic.about.com/blwilliebio.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The great singer - songwriter &lt;a href=&quot;http://countrymusic.about.com/blwilliebio.htm&quot;&gt;Willie Nelson&lt;/a&gt; was born in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/view/AA/hla1.html&quot;&gt;Abbott&lt;/a&gt; in 1933.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like the Greatful Dead and Jimmy Buffett, these days
Willie's &quot;scene&quot; is probably more popular than this music. This
cache pays homage to the man, his music, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; his
&quot;scene&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inmusicwetrust.com/articles/33c09.html&quot;&gt;Red Headed Stranger&lt;/a&gt; album which was recorded
for under $20,000 and financed solely by Nelson and it became his
first double platinum release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Abbott is a living ghost town. It seems to wither away as
you drive through it. On the road into town there are several
abandonded dwellings (and I use that term loosely).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a 3&quot; diameter round container that holds a
round log book and a round pencil.&lt;/p&gt;

We thought that we would leave our mark on this location. Also, while we were caching at the SP, we met another family from the Ft. Worth area, who was leading a class on geocaching in the state park. The container is a camo milk bottle. This cache is titled after a cacher from Lampasas, Boogers58&amp;Mrs., who always put their hint as it's not in the cedar tree.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;WE SUPPORT OUR STATE PARKS! In our strong desire to show our continuing support for our state parks, ALL geocachers must pay the entrance fee or show your Texas State Parks Pass in order to log this cache! By doing so, we will help geocaching continue to be a readily accepted use of Texas State Parks by parks management. This cache has been approved by the San Angelo State Park Management for placement in the park, with the typed permit on file at the Main Gate.</groundspeak:long_description>

We had a great time.  Initially, the cache was a little hard to find, but we didn't really know what we were looking for so it was actually probably about perfect.  The hike was nice and not too far.  The park is really nice and clean. Only thing we had any real confusion about is the 'butterflys'.  There was a &quot;butterfly trail&quot; but the signs are aged.

We're definitely hooked on this sport.</groundspeak:text>

We had a fun and big day of caching. Started out @8 am and finished up 4:30 pm. A great day out in the wild open country. 

My experience with the US broadens every time  I get out and see a little more of the country. 

Great with a variety of hiding the caches, this makes it fun.

Loved to be out on a day like that.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A new park in Arlington, how exciting is that? No magic FTF items, only the thrill of being the FTF our FTH (First To Hide) in the metroplex. Once you get off of the trail not much chance of running into muggles, but be careful of them until you get beyond the brush. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have to walk through water to get to this after a rain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a can that was made to hold explosive trace detection swabs In a dry area. It is easy to cross thread. It will also rust together if the lid is put on too tightly. If this should happen you do not need tools, But rather rock lid back and forth and at the same time unscrew. These cans take roughly a week of work to put together, please help me by not cross threading or over tightening. Thank you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BYOP &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>If the lid is stuck use some force and rock the lid back and forth at the same time turn counter clockwise. Remember if it doesn't go back on easy then it is going on wrong. Let me know if the edges start getting rusty and I will resand and resilicone.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Got to the park to see the group standing looking at their phones so figured it had to be a caching group. Walked up and asked if they had found it yet and when they said they couldn't I said well come on lets go look again so they did. On the way in I saw the spot I would have put it but was still 52 feet off so hollered out well that looks like a good spot but gz is over there. I knew I should have taken my own advice.... LOL.... Might wanna go check the coords we all had different ways of looking and both my Garmin and Blackberry had it off over 50 foot. If you are going out to find this one just look for the spot you would put it.  Thanks for the cache....</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Green can in a big bush! Coming from the west side you need to walk past the storm drain with the hand rail. Then start counting the cuts in the concrete and when you get to the 4th take a half step more so that you are between the 4th and 5th cut. It is an Emerald Nut can and it does blend very well. Took me a minute to spot it and I put it there. GPSr was hovering at about the 2 foot mark. I couldn't get it to 0 when I went back tonight but I did mark this one in the rain.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Okay, so I admit that the eve of Christmas Eve is probably not the best time to do this series but, other than security at #2, this was the only &quot;muggle rich environment&quot; of the 4. I unsuccessfully attempted to park close enough to snag this one but after 6 trips around, I decided that I could actually pick up a couple of things from inside. Once that task was completed, I returned to my vehicle and observed many open spots where I had previously attempted to park. So I moved to the &quot;best&quot; spot &amp; found the cache. It was larger than I expected and the outside was wet. Log was nice and dry. tftc</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As I was walking along to the area that I was going to put the cache in I found a trail head and decided what the heck. It is a well used trail. I don't have any idea where it goes to. It follows along a creek. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walked along it for 15 minutes or so then turned back and found the spot I wanted. If you make the bend in the trail and see the log jam in the creek look back down at the GPSr because you went to far. The hide is not jammed into a log but the name will help you some. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did wonder where the other end of this trail is, might have to walk it some day. Feel free to post if you know or if you want to guess. I couldn't really tell on google earth.

sometimes enjoy doing, this one is fairly easy. At the time I put
this out, there were no over grown areas, but that could change.

This one is named based on the location names that it is related to
(hint, hint). You should be able to get to both stages fairly easy,
but neither are going to be friendly to wheel chair bound
individuals. I'm hoping that this one will at least become a
TB/GCoin bed and breakfast, if not full on hotel. LOL

That cammo job is pretty tight though took me a few to spot it. Every thing was spot on too. Stage one has a pretty cool &quot;container&quot; to get you to stage two also. It was a nice walk from stage one to stage to but not to far. Glad I decided to go down a little further and avoid the beggar lice. I hate that little plant so much. It is so annoying. Thanks for the cool cache my Friend keep up the good work. </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In 1993 The Chameleon got his name. At that time the high tech hide and seek game was called rabbit. It involved CB radios. The Chameleon played this game in his home town under the name “The Wild Horse.” The Chameleon moved to a new town where there was someone else who used the handle “The Wild Horse.” It was decide that being the new kid in town he would voluntarily change his handle, but what to change it to? While drinking coffee with a few other CB’ers, two things were noticed about the Chameleon. Number one his eyes are gray and as such reflect the colors around him, two he found a way of blending in anywhere. The Chameleon name was born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the internet became more and more popular the Chameleon used his name to start a business building web sites. The name of the business was “The Chameleon Design.” As the internet began to expand the handle “Chameleon” became harder and harder to get, so the Chameleon took the initials from his business to create TCDChameleon. This one is never taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2003 The Chameleon married “Jay’sBarbieDoll” Shortly after “Buda” was born. In 2008 the final member to team TCDChameleon “The Captain” was born. TCDChameleon started Geocaching in March of 2011 after being told about it by Ninja R. The first cache they found was hidden by Hikeaday in Vandergriff Park (visit link) The family has been hooked since. The last name of the team is Cooper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge is to come up with something more interesting for TCD. Write a story in the form of a comment on this note that comes up with Three words that fits our initials and our team. In your story explain how you came to this. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you search for this find, help us fix our name.  Log your story when you find the cache.  Thanks and good luck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to TXDiva on the FTF! &lt;br/&gt;Her story is below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;&quot;It's time for a team meeting.&quot; These words are usually met with groans and major rolling of eyes. This meeting was not called to discuss the disarray of bedrooms though, nor was it called to talk about chores. T...he meeting was called to discuss the very important geo-moniker. It was time for the letters to have meaning. It was time for this meaning to relate to the whole family unit, and not just the head honcho. Mom raised her eyebrows because we all know who really is in charge! Phrases were thrown out, thrown together, and tossed out! Anacronyms were assembled and disassembled. It was getting late, tempers were flaring, candles were burning out, and the milk and cookies were almost gone! These were desperate times, and creating a new geocaching name was just...out...of...the question. Finally, one member of the family (I won't name names in this story,but YOU know who you are) took a final look at their gc profile. In a tired voice, the person said.....&quot;Tribbles, Cow, Dark Night, Chameleon. We have so many interests that we'll never find anything that we can all agree on.&quot; The other family members became silent, and came over to look at their profile also. &quot;Tribbles.....I like that.&quot; stated one. &quot;You know I like Cows,&quot; said a second one. &quot;Dark Night...too cool for words&quot; smiled the third one. &quot;And that leaves me, the Chameleon,&quot; sighed the final family member. On that fateful night, the 'tcd' no longer stood for one person. It stood for the entire family.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another story that the family liked a lot was by MIMKU, his story is as follows.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Lost and Found&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He looked at the coordinates again.  &quot;Yep, this is just about it&quot;, he thought as the lights on the dash flickered wildly for a moment.  &quot;Hope my battery's ok,&quot; he worried.  It hadn't been checked for a long time he knew.  This was as close as he could get from off the new Interstate.  There was no access road for miles in either direction. He would have to park here.  He put on his directional and glided to a stop as far off the highway as he could get.  &quot;It's on foot from here!&quot; he thought.  He grabbed his backpack and reached for the coil of rope he just bought.   &quot;Oh darn!  I just put it here on the front seat!&quot;  He looked on the floorboard and in the back but it wasn't there. &quot;   “I'm losin it!&quot; he thought.  &quot;A brand new jar of jam the other day, and now this!”  &quot;Can't keep track of anything lately!”  He thought of his father’s missing ring again as he climbed out of his car.  He checked his current location once more.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He was a little over a quarter mile from the cache as far as he could tell and started down the hill deftly sidestepping the many small cacti in his way.  After a while he reached the bottom and stood on an old double-lane highway cracked and overgrown.  He started down it, careful not to trip and fall.  He should be back before the hour he thought, long before twilight's end.  It was a good thing too as he glanced around in the dimming light.  All along the old road huge road graders, bulldozers and assorted construction equipment stood like impossible insects, their legs and pinchers frozen to the sky.  For some reason the hairs on his neck began to stand as he slowly passed between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a short eternity, he saw it.  Off to his right a rutted-up dirt road veered down on his right into an open space with what looked like some buildings way in the back.  As he neared he thought it strange he hadn't noticed this area of town before.  It was old...very old.  A crumbling strip mall stood dark in the back of the asphalt parking lot, dimly lit by the one lamp post that still worked.  He could barely see as the twilight was quickly turning to night.  &quot;A little early for summertime&quot; he thought.  His watch showed it was only 7:00pm.  &quot;Probably cause it's down so low off the highway&quot; he thought as he looked out over the uneven lot and began to slowly walk toward the light.  It had begun to flicker and even though he had a great flashlight, he didn't want to be here without this added illumination to guide him.  It was a longer way back than he originally thought, or so it seemed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He looked at his GPSr.  He was close.  The old lamp post looked like it was at ground zero.  He looked up at the old mall again.  The jagged and broken buildings curved slightly around the parking lot reminding him of a snarling mouth.  &quot;Ugh, this place is giving me the creeps!&quot; he thought and began to pick up the pace.  He stood directly under the light but could see nowhere on the post where anything could possibly be hid.  &quot; I'm not gonna climb up this post to look even for a Million dollars!&quot; he fumed.  Out here at night?  &quot;No way!&quot; he mumbled and kicked a large piece of asphalt in disgust.  He looked down at his toe and hoped it wasn't broken.  &quot;Oh crap!  What a waste!&quot; he thought and knelt down to feel it.  As he did, something caught his eye...a glint...something metal from under the piece of asphalt he just moved.  He looked closer.  It was a small metal box, half buried.  He dug it out with his knife and held it up to the faint light. It was covered with strange raised markings, none of which he recognized.  It had no compartment that he could see, only a button, a small metal button.  He took out his cell phone and turned on his flashlight.  As he gently turned it over in his hand, he took several pictures of each side.  When he got back, he'd look at these markings more carefully.  The pain in his foot now forgotten, he pushed the button.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing happened.  He waited a full minute it seemed but , still nothing.  He looked at the box again , then , pressed the button once more.  &quot;Might as well take this with me he figured.  &quot;No use leaving it here out in the open&quot; he thought and put it in his pocket.  As he started to stand, it hit him.  All the air was sucked out around him.  The pressure popped his ears like he was at 30,000ft as he fell back on his knees in pain.  Then, just as suddenly, it was gone.  He held his head in his hands and closed his eyes for a moment.  He felt numb and his head sounded like a seashell.  After a while he opened his eyes and looked up at the lamppost.  The dim light was flickering wildly.  It looked like it was ready to go out at any moment.  It was getting noticeably darker.  He'd better start back now.   Head throbbing he got to his feet, wobbled for a moment and started back toward the car.  After a dozen steps or so, he flicked on his flashlight.  He looked back at the lamppost light.  It had all but disappeared in this heavy night air.  The beam from his flashlight barely showed ten feet out.  &quot;Next time I'll come out at noon!&quot; he thought, knowing he probably would not come back here again.  Still though, he would like to get a better look at things when it was light.  It was then he heard a sound behind him.  &lt;br/&gt;He quickly turned back around.  He saw shapes, or thought he did, moving, rustling in the background, just beyond his flashlight beam.  He quickened his pace up the dirt road to the old highway and through the gauntlet of construction machinery.  Finally, he saw car blinkers about forty feet up the hill on his right.  Parked just off the Interstate was his car, his beautiful car.  He scrambled up the hill, falling, imaginary fingers clutching at his ankles and reached the top in a panic.  He jumped in the car and locked the doors.  He threw his gear in the backseat and leaned his head back and took a long breath, his heart pounding.  &quot;Man that was crazy! Spooky!&quot; he thought.  He sat there for a while, thinking of that whole episode and gradually began to calm down.  He needed a stiff drink to clear his head.  &lt;br/&gt;He reached for his keys in his jeans and felt the small box in his front pocket.  He would have to take it out to get to the car keys.  The jeans were too tight.  Instead, he reached under the passenger side floor mat for the spare keys.  They weren't there.  They're always there!  He groped around some more but, could not feel them.  Then he felt something cold brush against his elbow...very cold and his neck began to tingle again.  Between the seat and door was the coil of rope he had put on the front seat next to him.  It must have slid down there making a turn.  &quot;I looked there!&quot;  he thought.  &quot;What a night!&quot;  He pulled it back up on the seat next to him and shook his hand.  &quot;Man that's cold!&quot;  Too cold for a hot summer night he mused as he took out both the box and the car keys.  He put the strange box back into his pocket, started up the car and eased back out on the highway his dash lights blinking erratically.  He needed to get home.&lt;br/&gt;He parked the car outside the liquor store and sat there for a moment, still shaken from the experience.  After a while, he went in and bought a six pack of cold beer and headed on home. Sitting in the driveway he inhaled the first beer.  It momentarily froze his brain.  It felt good.  He cracked open another and laid his head back to think.  &quot;Man,&quot; he thought, &quot;That was so weird !&quot;  He was always so level-headed.  That had never happened to him before.  He just wasn't superstitious!  Then he thought of that party a few months back and what his friend Johnny had said.  He remembered everyone had a lot to drink that night but, this was just too ridiculous.  Johnny wasn't making any sense, as was often the case.  He seemed a little on edge.  His eyes were nervous.  He suggested that there were perhaps parallel universes that sometimes touched or maybe crossed paths.  Everyone had a good laugh about it and continued partying.  &lt;br/&gt;Later that night after everyone left, Johnny stayed and helped him clean up.  He continued on with his &quot;theory.”  &quot;I know you think I'm nuts but, I've been seeing things lately; shapes moving just beyond where I can make them out.  Not all the time but every once in a while and I've been losing things too.  Things I put in the same place all the time.  Then they reappear, in places where I've already looked before!  And, don't tell me I just misplaced them.  I didn't!&quot;  They continued on for several hours before he put Johnny on the couch and covered him up.  He'd let him sleep it off.  He was a good guy and had a good heart but he was worried about him.  He'd been a little off ever since his dog ran away.  It was strange though.  That dog never left his side.  They were inseparable.  He wondered now if tonight's experience was influenced by Johnny's story. &quot;Probably was&quot; he thought and opened the car door.  He got his gear and went inside leaving the beer and rope inside on the front seat.&lt;br/&gt;It was still early so he put away his gear, cleaned off the kitchen table and sat down to look at the metal box a little closer.  The markings were something he had never seen before.  They reminded him of some kind of Egyptian or Navaho designs.  And, they rotated.  They lined up with one of the other sides no matter which way you turned them.  He turned them back to the way he found them after double- checking his cell phone pictures from the cache site.  Something was nagging at him, but what?  Then it hit him.  He stood up and walked to the fridge and opened it.  There it was; the jar of jam, unopened and still cold!  It had been sitting on the table along with everything else this whole time!  Everything else from off that table was still warm!  He abruptly went to the bedroom, turned on the light and walked to the dresser.  On the floor next to it lay his father's ring.  He had just vacuumed there the day before!  It was very cold.&lt;br/&gt;He took it back to the kitchen, sat back down and placed it next to the jar.  He picked up the box again. Turning it absentmindedly in his hand he thought of what his friend had said that night.  &quot;What if , if things that are misplaced or lost aren't really lost or misplaced?  What if they're right there but we can't see them?&quot; he asked.&quot;  Like they can't go into the other dimension but can't get back either.  Like they're waiting for some event to return them.  You know, to be found sort of.&quot;    He had gently scoffed at his friend's notion but now, he was not so sure.  Things were happening tonight that he had no answer for.&lt;br/&gt;After looking at the markings on the box for a long time he began to see some similarities between the sides.  Some it seemed were depictions of living things and some were of objects.  He turned them and joined the living things head to head.  He sat and stared for a long time.  Then he pushed the button.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was written by a dear friend MIMKU who has ALS.  He thinks your name should be&lt;br/&gt;Tiny (or Texas) Cactus Dancer.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is going to be really hard to do better than Texas Cactus Dancing Chameleons.  My family is absolutely in love with all things Texas, so this fits pretty well.  However, I know that there is a lot of creativity out there, so I have faith that you can do it.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a can that was made to hold explosive trace detection swabs In a dry area. It is easy to cross thread. It will also rust together if the lid is put on too tightly. If this should happen you do not need tools, But rather rock lid back and forth and at the same time unscrew. If you should notice a lot of rust on the lid let me know and I will come out and regrease. Please help me by not cross threading or over tightening. Thank you. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This neighborhood was developed in the late sixties and is known as Arkansas Heights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the fifties GM came to Arlington, in the sixties we got six flags, and in the early seventies we obtained a baseball team. With all of that growth Arlington needed a place to put all of the people. Arkansas Heights was thus born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would recommend parking at N 32° 42.148 W 097° 05.390  in front of the school.  This will keep you from getting a ticket for blocking a driveway or drawing a lot of attention to yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a walk through that neighborhood. The total walk is about a half of a mile. So it should not take long. This cache is available 24 hours, but it is in a residential neighborhood, so I probably would not recommend a night cache for this one. Chances are pretty good that someone would call you in for suspicious activity if you go poking around looking for things in the middle of the night here. On that note, not one piece of this cache is in anyone's yard. All of the stages can be reached from the public area. I anticipate stage 1 to be the hardest to find, but I'm sure you will figure it out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muggles are going to be everywhere most of the time especially at stages, 1, 3, and 4 please ensure care to hide as well as you found it. Try to use a lot of stealth muggle traffic will be highest between 3 and 5 in the evening. &lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

You can park much nearer this time (if you're about that sorta thing ;-)   and while it's still paved trail the whole way, it goes down &amp; up again thru the creek...so don't bother coming the day after heavy thunderstorms!&lt;br/&gt;  In the late spring thru late summer if you loiter around this area you have a great chance of seeing the kites fly over; as they appear to highly favor the adjacent Interlochen neighborhood trees for their summer nesting.

Odd because of location and size.  The cache is accessible without climbing any walls or opening any gates. It's not in the street either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is one of those tiny little magnetic buttons, so if you're not interested in this type of cache, please don't even try. The log is difficult to remove, so if you have some tweezers or a knife, that would speed things up. Difficulty is for the size of the container; terrain is probably wheelchair accessible if you can reach high enough.&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

To find the cache add together all the numbers in the year Daniel Arwine came to the area and add them to the north coordinates.  EX. 2+0+1+2= 5; N12 34.567+5= N 12 34.572. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a small camouflaged cache with log only so bring a pen. Though this is basically a park and grab take some time to read the various markers and have a look around the cemetery. This site is significant to the founding of the HEB area and you might be surprised at some of the names on markers. It has a personal significance to me as I have many ancestors, by blood or marriage, buried here.</groundspeak:long_description>

The length of your walk will really depend on where you start. If from McCormick, it's short.... Eden, though, it's long. Ha! See how that works ?!!?&lt;br/&gt;  The set of parks strung along Bear Creek and connected the whole way by paved path/ sidewalk really has something for everyone. From beach volleyball at one end thru playgrounds, tennis, picnic shelters, a signed tree- identification path, parcourse, fishing pond &amp; even off-leash dog run area. The cache hide is similar to the first two; even wheelchair accessibile again- but the actual grab would be quite a stretch from a regular seated position. </groundspeak:long_description>

But not that hard, it's funny you can say something is Evil and it Totally scares away the geocaching community... are you Scared ?&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have mostly done easy one's and this one is going to be let's say, Evil . If you have done any of these you'll know what to look for. Some of you will get it when you arrive( the cache name described a smashed in guardrail, which has now been replaced ), and as for the others... &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
BYOP and Please ... Date &amp; Initials ONLY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A Gold coin for FTF !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Watch out for traffic on the road.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Keep having Too much Fun with this Great Game !&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I found a remnant cache tube with no lid lying on open ground, filled with dirt up to the bottom of the log sheet... which was mostly rotted away. No written info was discernable. Or85
 EDITED 09NOV. Folks: a bit more familiarity with MedicMan's hides elsewhere &amp; a trip back here make it obvious why what I observed in October is the case... as well as why this particular hide is no longer a candidate for a rehide.

Lots of little critters in the area and the cache will be well guarded by some ants so watch where you place your hands. BYOP</groundspeak:long_description>

Rock Slide Hide (GC2A3EH) is at one end and Double Barrel Blast (GC2DWEK) is at the other end of this creek. So, I decided to place a easy Pitstop cache in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a small hanging camoed container, log only, no room for swag, BYOP. It is attached to it's hiding spot but the larger of the 2 rings opens easily to access the cache better. It's only about 10 feet off of the sidewalk. The bottom just pops off, so please make sure you recap it well or the log will fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun and be sure to check out the other caches while your in the creek.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is a creek near by but no reason to go into it. Parking is not far away and is separated by a brick wall that is not going to be an obstacle. The container is large enough for a log book (BYOP) and small items to be traded inside. Each member of the family placed a little item inside to get things started. Plus, we have put a small gift inside for the FTF. Have fun and please post pictures of your find as we are very excited about starting this hobby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to auctnr, Kman, and Hogtrackers for FTF.</groundspeak:long_description>

The location was found while out caching with my daughter and she helped me hide it as well, so I thought the name was appropriate. It is located in a very popular park in Lewisville, TX that has a playground and Frisbee golf course. Muggles are everywhere so it might be better to hunt during non-peek hours of play time. Its a small plastic container that has a log book and plenty of room for small trading items. Be aware of the ants. Please be sure to hide it well and to use the camo provided. Have fun and pictures are always appreciated.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the location of a hide I placed called &quot;Mobile Home For Rent&quot;. It was one of my favorite hides because of the unique container that I had used. It was a turtle shell that I had found while out geocaching with a friend. I turned it into a cache and hid it here with the following description.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mobile home for rent: Nice little 1 bedroom and no bath mobile home available for immediate move in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last resident of this home had to vacate on short notice so I relocated it to this location and decided to rent the space out. It's not very large but will be nice for a single person who is always on the go. You may come and check out the home and location whenever you like. Remember that it is a older home so please treat it gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interested Geocachers only please. Post your offers in the log......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well as it turns out, someone decided to take my turtle shell and left only the log behind....MUGGLED!!!! I still like the location so I went ahead and replaced the muggled cache with a plain, ordinary,run of the mill and nothing special cache. Please be sure to re-hide it well to avoid any more unwanted visitors.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Making memories with my son and trying to get him excited about the geocaching experience was the motivation for this hide. We used a plastic orange Mentos candy container for the cache. Log only, BYOP. It is located near one of Lewisville's lesser known parks that is actually kinda nice for smaller children. It has a little gazebo with benches to sit (or stand) on while the kids play and run around. Picnic tables and a grill makes it a good spot to just hang around at on any given weekend. The cache is not in plain site nor is it reachable from the ground. Some agility is required to reach this cache, but if my 12 year old can reach it then its not that hard. This would make for a good night hunt. Good luck and as always we would like to see pictures posted.</groundspeak:long_description>

In my family it is normally done through humor or a helping hand. Today was a very nice mixture of both. After helping my brother (HossinTx) hide some new caches in the area he came with me to help with this one. We had a great time enjoying each others company and sharing a lot of laughs. He helped me with every stage of this multi and even gets the credit for placing the ammo can in its final location. I am very impressed with the hard work he put in on my cache hide. Even when he got his feet wet we were able to keep laughing and having a good time. I owe him a very big &quot;Thank You&quot; because I don't think I would have done this hide on my own today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the redirectors are of the same style although the colors may be different. The final is a nice size ammo can with log book and swag. Please do your best to re-hide it as well or better than you found it.

This is a pretty easy find so I am not going to go into great detail about the cache. Its camouflaged and about the size of a 35 millimeter film can is about all you need to know.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This single lane bridge looks to have been built before WWII, but I couldn't find a plaque or anything. It's a classic steel truss bridge when rivets were king. Between I-35 and US 177, it is the only other river crossing. While it is rusting, it appears to be quite solidly built with its three segments suspending the road bed above the Canadian. Other than the 4 wheeler tracks, I don't imagine this shoreline has changed much in the last 200 years! Spend a little time looking across the river and imagine trying to drive a couple hundred cows to the other side or getting your wagon over without swamping the contents. Parking is limited to 1 spot unless you’ve got the vehicle to get down off the road. There is quite a nice beach area and don't forget the fishing pole. You're looking for a camoed plastic quart jar with a few trade items. Knowledge of the native Oklahoma flora might help confirm the cache location. But, by then you'll have to be looking right at it. PI is heavy away from the water. Follow the 4 wheeler trail, it leads right to the cache. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This historical marker is a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;tribute to Irving&lt;/b&gt; where&lt;br /&gt;his party camped along the union of&lt;br /&gt;Little river and Hog creek in the fall of 1832.  He wrote about&lt;br /&gt;his expedition from Ft. Gibson in A Tour of the Prairies.  It is constructed with local rose rock and quartz as decoration. Although this is a good picnic spot with room to stretch yours or a dogs legs there are no trash cans, picnic tables or restrooms.  I did find the electricity on at the pole, so you could recharge something.  There is a small grill across the street. I've been told by some cachers that is serves a good breakfast. The cache is less than 200 feet from the marker.  Bushwhacking should be minimal as you can use the highline as a path to get close to the cache.  The container has my typical camo and is in a good hide.  It’s got a few trade items for kids and will hold medium travel bugs.  Please replace as you found it and enjoy this little piece of Oklahoma history.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We were in Norman to eat breakfast at our favorite vegetarian restaurant, and took the opportunity to come find the nearby cache. This is a great location for a cache: no crowds, a nice place to pull over and stretch, and a Daughters of the American Revolution marker to boot! But I sure wouldn't want to be here when the tornado siren is tested. I got snagged a couple of times and lost my shoe while searching for the container, and was very worried about having to say I couldn't find it (it took some time!) Only a RedSky cache would get me out here with the ticks! The cache was eventually found, but I am sorry to say it is in very bad shape. There are holes in the container, the baggie that holds the logbook is VERY wet and yucky, and when I took the log book out of the baggie, some pieces crumbled and blew away in the wind.  I did manage to sign our name, but the cache needs urgent maintenance. 
Thank you for bringing us out here to a cool spot near the lake. Great place for a cache!</groundspeak:text>

Parking is at an old, overgrown boat access point on public land about .13 of a mile from the hide. Walk in along the fence line to the east and you'll avoid most of the brier and tangles. Remember, you're going on a duck hunt; long pants, sleaves and boots are recommended! The only thing you won't have to do is wade water. There is no need to cross any fences. When you get done digging thru the 50 cal ammo can, you'll have a good view from the south shore. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the unique feature of these lakes. A deep channel was cut in 1962 to connect them allowing water and boats to flow between each. You can motor your favorite cabin cruiser (no more than a 3 ft draft) back and forth all day long. If you've got a boat, it will allow you to get 5 or 6 caches without all the driving around. A city permit is required to go boating at $4 a day. The cache is near the edge. It's best to keep the kids in the car or well away from the cache for this one. I certainly don't want to hear of any unplanned splashes. Small splashes from rocks are okay as long as there aren't any boats about. Body sized splashes are prohibited. But, getting wet isn't required for this cache. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">For central Oklahoma, this is the quintessential prairie landscape. A lot of people think of the big Bluestem at 7 or 8 feet tall, I think of the more modest  Little bluestem with it's coppery fall color.  Parking is at the end of the road and approved by the local LE as is access.  You may see coyote, cottontail rabbit, turtle, armadillo and a myriad of birds anywhere in this field of mixed grass prairie. Bring the kids for this one. You're going after an ammo can with lots of kid goodies. There&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;is a bit of green briar around the cache, but I didn't find any grass burrs. Other than the lake, I doubt this area has changed much in the last 100 years. If you're in the area at sunset, you should have a great view. </groundspeak:long_description>

It's off the beaten path and still picking burrs off of our cloths to prove it.  We did take a couple trinkets but we left several also.  Thanks.  We had a great time and will definately do it again.  Maybe we'll hide one of our own.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;h2&gt;Onions!!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;worst thing in the
world&lt;/i&gt; is the taste of onions. Some things (like hazel nuts), I
can taste and think, &quot;You know what? This doesn't taste very good.
When I'm done with this, I'm not going to have anymore.&quot; With
onions, however, my body has a reflex to expell the contents of my
mouth as a speeding projectile whenever I taste onions. Then it's
more like, &quot;I just spit something out of my mouth! What's going on?
It happened so quickly! What happened? Oh, okay; it was the taste
of onions. Now I know what happened.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trauma Avoidance.&lt;/i&gt; One
day, my sweetie saw me &quot;preparing&quot; a hamburger. It had some diced
onions even when I asked for no onions on my burger. I took a
french fry and scraped away the onions off of my burger. Then I
scraped off a layer of bread from the bun to de-onion-ify it. Then,
since the french fry was contaminated with disgusting onion-matter,
I had to discard that french fry into the pile of toxic waste. She
asked what I was going to do with that french fry. &quot;Isn't it
obvious?&quot; I thought to myself. I told her that the french fry
touched onions and was now dead to me, being of no further use as
an edible french fry. She loves onions; and she loves potatoes, of
which french fries are a tasty version to her. So she took that
awful french fry and ate it. That's when she saw that I avoid
eating onions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Discovery.&lt;/i&gt; Did you
know that chives taste nearly as bad as onions? One day, my sweetie
pulled a fresh piece of something that looked like grass to me. She
said that it was chives and was edible. Okay, I had never seen or
tasted chives before, so now she wants me to eat grass with her.
Hmmm. I thought I'd entertain her by taking a bite of this
grass-stuff. I bit down and &lt;i&gt;Projectile!&lt;/i&gt; there it goes out of
my mouth. Awful! Just like the taste of onions!!! She laughed,
saying that she knew I didn't like onions (and chives!), but she
didn't know how bad. Now she knew that it was real. I told her that
the taste of onions was as bad as the smell of a thick, strong
stench of skunk; and the smell of fresh onions is physically
sickening to me. Since then, there have been lots of other
unexpected &quot;incidents of projection&quot; that make for good stories.
Bad experiences often make for good stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Believer.&lt;/i&gt; There was
an incident where we were driving down the road and came upon the
dreaded stench of fresh road-kill skunk. We all made the usual
noises of disgust, but then my sweetie declared, &quot;It's true! Your
face is wrinkled up so bad with disgust and looks just like the
face you have when you taste onions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Relief.&lt;/i&gt; My ability to
taste things in general is severely lacking. My sweetie loves the
taste of onions and has figured out how much onion she can cook
into the food &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; I begin to taste it. I don't mind
&lt;i&gt;eating&lt;/i&gt; onions; I just can't stand &lt;i&gt;tasting&lt;/i&gt; onions. So
she can eat her scrumptious onions, and I don't have to taste
poison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a black
ammo box with a cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides.
Original contents include a Guide to Geocaching, a Sacagawea gold dollar
coin, a Kansas quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, one of
those new-Lincoln-image-on-the-back pennies, an old wheat penny,
and lots of other miscellaneous trade items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See
waypoint OXQBCQ for the next
Heartland Geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.opencaching.com/en/#!geocache/OXQBCQ&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found
it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment —
always.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams
come true.

&lt;h2&gt;Piter Payne&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my son was a little
toddler, one of his favorite books was &lt;i&gt;Peter Pan&lt;/i&gt; from the
Little Golden Books. He always wanted me to read it, but he always
wanted me to read it correctly; I never did. He would bring me the
book and sit on my leg so I could show him the pictures as I read
it out loud to him. He loved the story of little boys running
around being in trouble all the time on purpose. At &lt;b&gt;every&lt;/b&gt;
instance of the words &lt;i&gt;Peter Pan&lt;/i&gt;, I would read it out loud as
&lt;i&gt;Piter Payne&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would always interrupt my
reading with, &quot;Daddy! It's &lt;i&gt;Peter Pan&lt;/i&gt;!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ohhh...Okay,&quot; I would

&lt;h2&gt;Nifty Nut House&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a &lt;i&gt;sucker&lt;/i&gt; for
candy, especially lemon heads. But one year, I went to the candy shop and bought some sweeties for
my sweetie. I got her a container packed with chocolate covered
hazel nuts. I don't like the taste of hazel nuts, but it's one of
her favorites. Those treats sat around for quite a while and slowly
dwindled away &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; piece at a time, but I never sneaked away
any of them; yuck. She called it &quot;savoring&quot;. To me, savoring is
putting LOTS of yummy candy in your mouth so you get LOTS of taste;
the more you have in your mouth, the longer you get to taste them.
That's &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; idea of savoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Quoting Shakespeare&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you open up a fortune
cookie, what does the piece of paper say that your fortune is? For
years, I would open up a fortune cookie, take out the paper and
stare at it for a few seconds. When someone asked me what it said,
I would always reply, &quot;I don't know, something about 'Beware the
Ides of March', whatever that means.&quot; For those who were educated
enough, they might get caught off guard and ask with a bit of
worried shock to see the piece of paper for themselves. It's just a
joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, I was eating
Chinese food with my daughter and I did the fortune cookie thing,
just out of habit. She didn't understand and asked me about the
meaning of my joke. So I explained it to her. &quot;Beware the Ides of March&quot; is a very famous
quote from &lt;i&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/i&gt;, a play by William Shakespeare. In
the play, a fortune teller, or &lt;i&gt;soothsayer&lt;/i&gt;, warns Caesar to
beware the Ides of March. He brushes off the prophesy. The Ides of
March is the half-way point through March, being March 15. The
fortune teller was warning Caesar about the day that he was going
to be assassinated, March 15, 44 BC. So if you know that, then it
makes for a good joke when related with the fortune
cookie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time (months or years,
I don't remember) after that explanation, my daughter had some
exciting news to tell me. During a scholars bowl competition at
school, the question came up: &quot;What play has the quote, 'Beware the
Ides of ...'&quot;, and she immediately buzzed in with the correct
answer. She was a sophomore on the varsity team and the seniors
asked her, &quot;How did you know that?! You haven't even had Senior
English yet!&quot; I was proud of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the geocache, you
need to go to the following coordinates:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;14 S 0652549&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
     &lt;b&gt;4115574&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A word of caution with
puzzle-caches. When posting your log, do not include spoiler
answers in your log, lest you risk the unfortunate deletion of your
valuable log. It is such a sad tragedy when an inappropriate log
brings upon the inevitable destruction of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mozart was a metalhead.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my kiddos were tiny, we would go to
the swimming pool at the city park. We had a &quot;tradition&quot; when it
came to going to the swimming pool. They climbed into the sports
car. We checked that everyone had their necessary equipment -
towels, goggles, money. Then I started up the car and put in some
awesome rock music...Symphony Number 25, by Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart! (Appropriate for young kids too.) They listened to Mozart
on every trip to the swimming pool. Once we got to the pool parking
lot, they got to get out of the car by climbing out of the sun
roof. Trips to the swimming pool were the ONLY times they got to
climb out of the sun roof so those were a treat. Now that the kids
are grown up, they still recognize Mozart's Symphony Number 25 as
&quot;the swimming pool song&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

the nearby Kansas Heartland geocaches. This geocache is sort of
accessible from Highway I-35. There is a pull-off barely on the
south side of the overpass, one for the southbound lane and another
one for the northbound lane. You probably have to stop at the gate
and walk the rest of the way which, for northbounders, includes
walking over the overpass to the west end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a 50-cal

Original contents include a Sacagawea gold dollar coin, a Kansas
quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, one of those

&lt;h2&gt;Road Block&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While traveling through
Yellowstone we saw a line of cars coming from the opposite
direction, slowly driving behind a bison that was leading the cars,
blocking the lane. With us being the oncoming traffic for them,
they had no choice but to follow the bison as it walked down the
center of that lane. Right behind the bison was a bright yellow
sports car that couldn't go around; poor guy. That looked funny. We
got a picture of the moving road block as we drove by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We passed the bison and the
line of cars and drove over the next hill to discover that right
there in front of &lt;b&gt;us&lt;/b&gt; was another bison, blocking both lanes
of traffic. We had to wait on the bison until he decided to trot
off and be the lead bison in front of our car. Now &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; were
the car stuck behind the bison that walked down the lane. After a
bit, it crossed the yellow centerline and walked down the other
lane as the line of cars passed the bison with us in the
lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Look how much I ate!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my daughter was a tiny
toddler, we would keep an eye on how much she ate to make sure she
was eating a healthy diet. They have a tendency to not want to eat
the nutritious stuff, then feel like eating snacks later because
they're hungry from not eating the nutritious stuff. She was a
smart one though. She would show us her plate and say, &quot;Look how
much I ate!&quot; Being parents trying to use positive reinforcement, we
would praise her for eating what she did. But that was a cover-up.
Just a minute after she presented her excellent progress toward
finishing the food on her plate, she would quietly say, &quot;I'm full.
I don't want anymore.&quot; Now how can you get after her for not eating
when you just praised her for eating? At first, she had us fooled;
we didn't see it coming. Later on, however, we knew the plan and
when she said, &quot;Look how much I ate,&quot; we would tell her to keep
eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the geocache, solve
this puzzle: &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Make today manage — big deer
ridden.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A word of caution with
puzzle-caches. When posting your log, do not include spoiler
answers in your log, lest you risk the unfortunate deletion of your
valuable log. It is such a sad tragedy when an inappropriate log
brings upon the inevitable destruction of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a black
ammo box with a cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides.
Original contents include a Guide to Geocaching, a Sacagawea gold dollar
coin, a Kansas quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, one of
those new-Lincoln-image-on-the-back pennies, an old wheat penny,
and lots of other miscellaneous trade items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hérigone's Mnemonic
System&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pierre
Hérigone (1580-1643) was a French mathematician, astronomer and
geocacher (probably). He devised a memorization system by
substituting letters for numbers, which can be combined to form
words and associated together in a sentence or in a narrative,
allowing the numbers to be memorized more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herigone's System:&lt;br /&gt;
0 z,s, soft c&lt;br /&gt;
1 t,d,th&lt;br /&gt;
2 n&lt;br /&gt;
3 m&lt;br /&gt;
4 r&lt;br /&gt;
5 l&lt;br /&gt;
6 j,ch,sh,dge,zh soft g&lt;br /&gt;
7 k, hard g&lt;br /&gt;
8 f,ph,v&lt;br /&gt;
9 p,b&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This
Mnemonic system is based on phonemes. The groups of consonant
sounds have similar sounds. Some are voiced and others are not,
such as T and D. They make the same sound except for one is voiced
(D) and the other (T) is not. The phonemes are used to form words
by adding vowels and vowel sounds. Not all letters are used, for
instance the vowels and the letters W,H and Y (spelling &quot;why&quot;) are
not. W, H and Y, although being consonants, make vowel sounds
rather than consonant sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is
easier to remember qualitatively different objects than to recall
different numeric quantities. Using this system, the number 10
could be represented by any one of the following words:&lt;br /&gt;
toes, tease, toss, tazz, taze, ties, twos, Tessa, tiz, twas, doze,
does, deuce, daze, dice, daisy, dizzy, doozy, DOS, dues, dasia,
dis, these, those, thighs, this, thus, odessy, Odessa, idiosy,
eddies, odious, adios, Otis, ethos, Athos, tahoes, wheaties. Or you
could use more than one word, such as wet ace, at Oz, Yetti Zoo. So
next time you see &quot;10&quot;, think of visiting a place called Yetti
Zoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most
people it would be easier to remember the number pi to seven places
past the decimal (3.1415927) by remembering three words: &quot;meteor
tail pink&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
MeTeoR (314) TaiL (15) PiNK (927)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire code is given
by&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Pseudonumerology, I give up!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 = &quot;pSeuDoNuMeRoLoGy, i GiVe
uP!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the
way, I personally use this system on a regular basis. I used it to
create 100 peg words. I made a story out of the 100 words so I
could tell an off-the-wall story to my kids. They have known this
story since they were tiny tikes; it's called &lt;i&gt;The Hot Sauce
Story&lt;/i&gt;. Notice that &lt;i&gt;sauce&lt;/i&gt; is 00, the beginning of the
story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or
perhaps you'd like to know pi to 500 places past the decimal. You
could memorize a mental chain of these words and be able to recite
the numbers forwards, backwards, or starting at 200 or 300. I did
about a year ago. (I don't know if I &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; can do it though
without some warm up practice.) These are the words I used to
memorize pi to 500 places. If they don't work for you, come up with
your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turtle, bungee, lime,
laugh, book, bomb, gnome, fridge,&lt;br /&gt;
New chair, mummy, foaming plus, one favorite bucket,&lt;br /&gt;
Chip, map, up mug, lettuce leaf, noose, biker, prayer,&lt;br /&gt;
Lip, numb, sky vet, jersey, chain vision, safe baby,&lt;br /&gt;
Fish, knife, summer, vinyl, marine, eat tacos, shock pi&lt;br /&gt;
(100)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fainter of savage lead
men, venomous shoe jerky,&lt;br /&gt;
Zap mover, rush-spill, lazy eleven, nomad coin,&lt;br /&gt;
Loom, leprosy foot, never fight Toto, curly sign,&lt;br /&gt;
Fort, snake, stop, hum, violin, toad, sign, lullaby,&lt;br /&gt;
Shore roach, nun, bravo bowler, puma same foot, patch&lt;br /&gt;
(200)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oar, rain, off, voodoo,
spackle, choo choo, lobo, moo moo, rah Ra, jet,&lt;br /&gt;
Never call giraffe, new mummy cuff, ash coffee, mead- jail,&lt;br /&gt;
New kitten is top speed, rule, jar full, Judge Bone,&lt;br /&gt;
Mirage, same, roof, shed, cereal roman, itchy itchy raven,&lt;br /&gt;
Time, mob, macho, skin, wash, snore, bed ridden coma&lt;br /&gt;
(300)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canary love kiss, sage
chase, chew metal loaf, photo key,&lt;br /&gt;
Revive, talon, spin, speech, one-van panelers,&lt;br /&gt;
Pit, kettle, major magic, ivy, bone, elbow smudges,&lt;br /&gt;
Sit at home, missile-missile, ruff!, phone search, shell in,&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sand dollars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While driving through the
state of Washington, we took a side trip to a park. The July
weather was great. The whole family checked out the tiny little
crabs near the water's edge where the sand and gravel were still
damp. They were everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The tide started rising
which sent my wife and me back towards drier land. My son and
daughter, however, walked deeper into the water. They didn't get
very deep when they came across a spot that they said was covered
with a dense gathering of sand dollars. They picked one up and
brought it to us to examine. None of us had ever seen a live sand
dollar. After watching it wiggle around for a bit, they took the
sand dollar away to put it back with all the others. That was an
awesome experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Kids and Apples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my daughter was a
toddler, she was a very picky eater. I remember one day when she
was sitting on my shoulders with her hands hanging on my forehead
as I walked around outside. &quot;Can I have an apple?&quot; She wanted one
of those delicious red apples. I grabbed the apple and handed it up
to her feeling like I was an elephant nose. She grabbed the apple
from my hand and looked it over. She handed it back out in front of
my face. &quot;Will you peel it for me?&quot; She was so picky. Not having a
knife on hand to peel the apple, I just did like I often did
countless other times before. I took the apple and ate all the
outside skin off of the apple and gave it back to her. She was
satisfied and ate that apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tortillas to the seagulls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While in Seattle, we took a
ride to Bainbridge on the car ferry. Alongside the ferry flew sea
gulls begging for food scraps from the tourists. Why not? I grabbed
some bread and threw a piece high into the air. One sea gull flew
over and caught my piece of bread. As soon as it touched the aerial
offering, it jerked its head sideways and threw the bread aside as
if to show me that my piece of bread was not worthy for their
tastes. I threw a second piece of bread into the air. Only one
other sea gull flinched in the direction of my bread, but they all
just let it fall to the water, unworthy. Obviously, these sea gulls
knew that better offerings were available. The group of sea gulls
gathered above a person offering them delicious and cheesy Doritos
corn chips, treats much tastier than bland slices of plain white
bread. I didn't have any Doritos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our return trip, we
decided not to try to feed the picky sea gulls and enjoy other
parts of the car ferry ride. I was telling my family about an old
memory of mine. When I was about three years old, I was walking on
a beach at the Gulf of Mexico with my arm full of flour tortillas.
I remember pulling away pieces of tortilla and throwing them up
into the air. I remember watching as the flock of sea gulls went
crazy to steal the bait away from each other. I walked the beach
throwing pieces of tortilla up into the air and the pieces never
came back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it hit me - tortillas!
I did have some flour tortillas in the minivan that we rented for
the road trip. What if...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave everyone in the
family some tortillas. I threw one tortilla piece into the air and
a sea gull swooped down to take it. It gobbled it up and waited for
more. The kids threw out more and more pieces of tortilla to the
gulls. They were loving it! The rest of them came over to gather
tightly beside the boat right beside us. One gull flew after an
offering. Another gull flew to the first and pulled on its tail
feathers to distract it. It worked; the first gull turned back to
nip at whatever pulled on its feathers as the second gull accepted
the nip in order to fly ahead and steal the treat. I got lots of
pictures of the experience. To see my children enjoying themselves
as a result of a memory of mine from when I was three years old -
that was one of the best moments of the whole vacation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To find the geocache, you need to go to
these coordinates:&lt;br /&gt;
North &lt;b&gt;XXXVII ° XII . CCIII '&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
West &lt;b&gt;XCVII ° XVIII . CCLXV '&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A word of caution with
puzzle-caches. When posting your log, do not include spoiler
answers in your log, lest you risk the unfortunate deletion of your
valuable log. It is such a sad tragedy when an inappropriate log
brings upon the inevitable destruction of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Jemez Caldera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started out as an
up-coming trip to west of Seattle, Washington, for a wedding in the
family. Then we considered driving instead of flying. Then, the
thought that if we drove that far, why don't we swing through New
Mexico &quot;on the way back&quot; and visit some good friends from old
times. And then the trip plans just went crazy. We visited every
state west of Kansas within a timespan of A WEEK AND A HALF, except
for Utah, and that was because forest fires were killing people
driving through on the highway that we initially planned on
taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our visit with good
friends in New Mexico, they took us on a tour of the Jemez
Mountains. We visited a spot in the middle of the Jemez
Caldera, the largest supervolcano in the United States. When at
the site, the place looks like a grassy plain with wildlife and
some hills off in the distance, except that the hills way out there
in the distance are actually the rim of the top of an ancient
volcano. That was an awesome site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also hiked the Las
Conchas Canyon trails. That was one of the most beautiful sites any
of us had ever seen. I pictured New Mexico to be a desert state,
and here we find paradise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;HEARTLAND
GEOCACHES&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These geocaches were placed
as a tribute to my sweetheart, Mrs. cantuland. I could treat her with a gift of a bag
of those candy hearts but I love candy too much and I would end up
eating them all up myself without even reading what's on them. So
instead of eating all of her candy hearts, I'm placing these
geocaches. Each geocache represents a fond memory that we share,
memories of vacations, family, various things that make us both
smile when the stories come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was a long time
in the making, since December of 2008. Now that these are
published, I can stop worrying if anyone else had submitted
geocaches that would interfere with the synergy of these geocaches.
It's time to let this one finally run on its own and start on
another project (or two).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often go back and read all
of these over and over. And to my wife: Happy Birthday; Happy
Mother's Day; Happy Valentine's Day; Merry Christmas; and all the
other holidays that this project was going to be for but took too
long. &lt;b&gt;Happy Kansas Heartland Day!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find this geocache, look
on the back of each of the logbooks and/or in the yellow boxes on
the laminated &quot;You Found It&quot; cards for each of the other Heartland
Geocaches. There, you will find part of the key, but not all
geocaches will have one. One letter equals a number. Plug those
numbers into the following and you have the completed key for the
coordinates for this geocache. Your log will not be deleted if you
happen to stumble across this geocache without having previously
logged all of the others. &lt;i&gt;A word of caution, though, when
posting your log for this cache, do not include spoiler answers or
final coordinates in your log, lest you risk the unfortunate
deletion of your valuable log. It is such a sad tragedy when an
inappropriate log brings upon the inevitable destruction of
itself.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;COORDINATES:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latitude North 37° ( &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; )
&lt;b&gt;. D&lt;/b&gt;, ( &lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt; ) &lt;b&gt;'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Longitude West 97° ( &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;Q&lt;/b&gt; ) &lt;b&gt;. T&lt;/b&gt;, ( &lt;b&gt;V&lt;/b&gt; +
&lt;b&gt;Y&lt;/b&gt; ) &lt;b&gt;'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a
&lt;b&gt;HUGE&lt;/b&gt; black ammo box with cantuland-geocache-logos painted
all over it. Original contents include a Guide to Geocaching, a Sacagawea gold dollar
coin, a Kansas quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, one of
those new-Lincoln-image-on-the-back pennies, an old wheat penny,
and LOTS of other miscellaneous trade items. That thing is
&lt;b&gt;HUGE&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See
waypoint GCQAQT for the next
Heartland Geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.opencaching.com/en/#!geocache/OXQAQT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all
of these geocaches are Traditionals. There are also a few Multies
and a few Puzzles mixed into the bunch. You may notice that the
locations of all of the Heartland Geocaches are centrally located
in the heart of the nation, in the great plains of Kansas. They
form a big heart across the land, spanning over six miles
wide!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In
preparation for tracking down these geocaches, you should know a
few things so you can make it back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load up your GPS
receiver with some fresh good batteries, and have some back up
batteries with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cell phone signals
are spotty out here. How charged up is your cell phone battery?
Dead phones don't seem to work out here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dirt roads become
muddy roads when wet. Almost all of these are on dirt roads. Don't
try these when the roads are wet, and for those who do try out the
muddy roads (Some of you will.) make sure you have a phone number
handy for a towing service. See the previous
note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's lots of
driving; fill up your car with fuel. The nearest two gas stations
to the NORTH in Belle Plaine are at a convenience store
(N37*23.560' W97*16.532') and at Mike's fuel &lt;b&gt;and towing&lt;/b&gt;
(N37*23.532' W97*16.897'). To the NORTHEAST is Casey's General
Store in Oxford (N37*16.477' W97*10.324').&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every now and then
you may spot a bright green contraption attached to a power pole or
a fence post. There is a government study of the types of insects
that reside in the vicinity. Please do not disturb them; they are
not geocaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And also . .
.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found
it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment —
always.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams
come true.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I do!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;You may now kiss the
bride.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was anticipating the
moment so much. I was so happy when it was official. And then I did
something that I would regret for the rest of my life. In the
overwhelming excitement, I gave my new wife a really quick peck on
the lips and gave her a big strong squeeze of a hug because I was
so happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;You may now kiss the
bride.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What kind of a kiss was
that?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Did you get a picture of
it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, it went too fast. How
about you?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;No I didn't get a picture
of it either.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody got a picture. Even
my wife was wondering what just happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, everytime there is a
scene where the newly married bride gets to receive her kiss, my
wife looks over at me with a smirk on her face. I know what she's
thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear me out. This is good
advice. When the moment comes for you to kiss your bride, you
better make the most of it and make sure you put some time into it.
Otherwise, you'll be spending time hearing jokes about it for the
rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every now and then, I go on
an expenses-paid plane ride to go talk to other states about
&lt;i&gt;geocaching&lt;/i&gt;! Now isn't that just awesome. My sweetie gets to
go with me too. I give her the window seat so she can see the
landscape. Take-off is my favorite part. I like to watch the
constellations of city lights below getting closer and closer when
we come in for a night-time landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One time, I was lucky enough
to be over a familiar area of land just as we came out of the
clouds above. Down below was the city of Oxford with an awesome
view of land farther off to the southwest of the town. I knew that
I would be placing some geocaches there soon (these &lt;i&gt;Heartland
Geocaches&lt;/i&gt;), so I took a picture of the view, even though we
were supposed to have all electronic devices shut off in
preparation for the descent for a Wichita flight
landing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Good Night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my children were tiny
toddlers, I would tuck them in at night and finish off by telling
them, &quot;Good night. Dream about butterflies and
rainbows.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one night, I told my
daughter, &quot;Dream about butterflies and rainbows.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;And rabbits,&quot; she said. So
it was changed to add the rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dream about butterflies and
rainbows and rabbits,&quot; I would say then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about a week or two,
my son told me, &quot;And flowers.&quot; So it was changed again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It settled with that. I
would tuck my children in and tell them, &quot;Good night...Dream about
butterflies and rainbows...and rabbits and flowers,&quot; and they would
smile, and close their eyes...sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Venus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venus is the Roman goddess
of love. The Greek goddess Aprhodite is the same as the Roman
goddess Venus. The Roman month of Aprilis is named after the Greek
goddess Aphrodite. In Ovid's Fasti, Ovid said
“I have come to the fourth month, full of honor for you;
Venus, you know both the poet and the month are
yours.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the geocache, you
need to go to the following coordinates. Watch those units!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;N 37.23228°&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;W 97° 19' 15.8&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A word of caution with
puzzle-caches. When posting your log, do not include spoiler
answers in your log, lest you risk the unfortunate deletion of your
valuable log. It is such a sad tragedy when an inappropriate log
brings upon the inevitable destruction of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a black
ammo box with a cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides.
Original contents include a Guide to Geocaching, a Sacagawea gold dollar
coin, a Kansas quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, one of
those new-Lincoln-image-on-the-back pennies, an old wheat penny,
and lots of other miscellaneous trade items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See
waypoint GCQCKG for the next
Heartland Geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.opencaching.com/en/#!geocache/OXQCKG&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found
it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment —
always.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams
come true.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in Las Vegas one day with my wife and kids. We left Vegas to go over Hoover Dam, except once we got to within two miles of Hoover Dam, we were told that the road was closed due to construction because of 9/11 security issues. If we came back the next day, we would be able to see Hoover Dam. Well, we were on a tight time schedule, so we didn't camp out for the return trip. Instead, we went south then east to the city of Laughlin. We showed up at night and saw that the area was thick with casino marketing. We found a hotel not too far off the path where we would stay and head out in the morning. It was a place called the &lt;i&gt;Aquarius&lt;/i&gt;. (Now I have that 1979 song playing in my head again.) I parked the car in the parking garage and told my family that I would go in and make arrangements for the stay and then come back so we could all go in together carrying all of our stuff (and it was a lot of stuff).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked into the lobby on the way to the front desks and saw all of the slot machines; the Aquarius was decked out with fancy dancing lights and gambling machines from wall to wall. When I asked the gentleman behind the desk about the cost of getting rooms, he told me something like 79 and 9-99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't sure what he was talking about, so I calmly asked him, &quot;How much for one night? A thousand dollars?&quot; I had no idea what kind of a place this was. It was so much fancier than any other place we had stayed, and we had been to lots of places on our tour of the western half of the United States. I knew that he didn't mean 9 dollars and 99 cents, so I was trying to get clarification. I figured that if he was asking for nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars for a room, I would kindly ask where the nearest roach motel was and take my family to somewhere more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't have been more wrong. My demeanor is always to remain calm when others would otherwise blow their tops, so he was very surprised to hear that I misunderstood him and that I &quot;nonchalontly&quot; was ready to pay a thousand dollars for a room. No, instead, the max charge was 99 dollars for a luxury suite, almost 100 dollars, not almost 1000 dollars! When he said 9-99, he had just stuttered a bit and said too many nines. This was a place that catered to gamblers. The stay was cheap so that they could get all your money from gambling it away. So now I was being treated as if I had too much money and was going to offer everyone big tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that he didn't know was that I was paying about 100 dollars for each night that we stayed at a hotel. Sometimes it was a little less than 100 dollars, but most of the time it was around 130 dollars a night for generic hotel rooms. So when he said it was just 100 dollars for the luxury suite, I saw a really good bargain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since he thought I was filthy rich, he wanted to &quot;set me up right.&quot; I asked if he had anything available on the top floor. He said &quot;no&quot; at first, but then made some tweaks here and there and came up with a room available on the 18th floor, the top floor of the Aquarius. What a bargain. He offered to help me take my things up. I noticed that he didn't do that for other customers; he told some &quot;doorman-looking type guy&quot; to take care of the previous customer. He was some kind of manager but he was offering to follow me out with a cart to load up all my luggage. How impressive. I politely told him that I didn't need any help and thanked him for the offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back and told my family what happened. Awesome! Top floor; also awesome! We stayed in the suite that had separate rooms for a full kitchen, living room with couches, decked-out master bedroom, a gigantic bathroom, and awesome views (note: plural) from the 18th floor through windows that were so large that they took up the entire wall where they were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never did spend any money on the gambling downstairs. The Aquarius was the best hotel stay on the whole tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get coordinates to the geocache and find this one, you must add one minute to EITHER the latitude OR the longitude of the posted coordinates, but not to both of them. Which one? Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A word of caution with puzzle-caches. When posting your log, do not include spoiler answers in your log, lest you risk the unfortunate deletion of your valuable log. It is such a sad tragedy when an inappropriate log brings upon the inevitable destruction of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a black ammo box with a cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides. Original contents include a Guide to Geocaching, a Sacagawea gold dollar coin, a Kansas quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, one of those new-Lincoln-image-on-the-back pennies, an old wheat penny, and lots of other miscellaneous trade items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;First date&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to the movies but we
didn't have anything in particular that we were going to see. At
one point on the way there, I drove under Kellogg. I know I checked
the intersection to see that the intersection was clear, so I kept
driving. As I passed through the intersection, my date told me that
I ran a red light! No I didn't. I looked in the rear-view mirror.
Sure enough, there was the red traffic light looking back at
me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we got to the theatre
we checked out the selections available. We went in to see the
Disney movie Aladdin knowing that it had already started. We walked
in right as Genii came out of the lamp, so it seemed to us like the
plot of the movie had just started and we didn't think we had
missed anything. It wasn't until Aladdin came out on VHS tape that
we saw the beginning. To this day, everytime I see the Disney video
logo at the beginning of a movie, my mind plays the melody that was
played at the beginning of Aladdin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way home I was
heading south on West Street and wanted to turn east on Pawnee
Avenue. It was dark and I knew I was close to the intersection, so
I turned just before the intended intersection and found myself
driving in the wrong direction on Southwest Boulevard. I got myself
turned back around and made the correct turn on the second
go-round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first date was a success
and I was in bliss. Do I call her back the next day? No way! &quot;Guy
laws&quot; dictate that &lt;i&gt;you do not call a girl back until at least
two days later&lt;/i&gt;. Silly guy laws. SHE called ME back the very
next day! Awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the geocache, solve
this puzzle:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;14,15,18,20,8 - 20,8,9,18,20,25 - 19,5,22,5,14 - 4,5,7,18,5,5,19
- 6,15,21,18,20,5,5,14 - 16,15,9,14,20 - 19,5,22,5,14 - 5,9,7,8,20
- 20,23,15 - 13,9,14,21,20,5,19 - 1,14,4 - 23,5,19,20 -
14,9,14,5,20,25 - 19,5,22,5,14 - 4,5,7,18,5,5,19 - 5,12,5,22,5,14 -
16,15,9,14,20 - 14,9,14,5 - 20,23,15 - 20,23,15 -
13,9,14,21,20,5,19&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A word of caution with
puzzle-caches. When posting your log, do not include spoiler
answers in your log, lest you risk the unfortunate deletion of your
valuable log. It is such a sad tragedy when an inappropriate log
brings upon the inevitable destruction of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a black
ammo box with a cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides.
Original contents include a Guide to Geocaching, a Sacagawea gold dollar
coin, a Kansas quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, one of
those new-Lincoln-image-on-the-back pennies, an old wheat penny,
and lots of other miscellaneous trade items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
Cadaeic Cadenza contains information on memorizing the
first 3835 digits of pi. The contents of that book is irrelevant in
this case. However, the word Cadaeic in the title of the book is
also based on pi. Taking &quot;A&quot; as 1, &quot;B&quot; as 2, &quot;C&quot; as 3, etc.,
&quot;Cadaeic&quot; is the first 7 digits of pi, rounding on that last
one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;ZOO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, we took a road
trip. My daughter, being a curious tiny young child, wanted to know
where we were going. She was told that it was a secret. To a little
child, we drove for a very long time. Finally we came to a spot and
told her to look at a tall structure with letters on it. &quot;What does
that spell?&quot; we asked. We had been practicing the fine art of
figuring out what letters made what sounds. She sounded it out,
&quot;Zzzzzzzz&quot;. &quot;Uuuuuuuuuu&quot;. &quot;Zzzzzzuuuuuu.&quot; &quot;Zoo! We're going to the
zoo!&quot; That was the first word she ever read, and it was a good day
at the zoo, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Waving &lt;i&gt;Hello&lt;/i&gt; on the
highway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;When was the first time you
two met each other?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think that it was
the day when a mutual friend of ours asked me if I wanted to meet
her. &quot;Sure!&quot; So we stopped by where she worked and I got to
introduce myself to her. She was not happy with our mutual friend
because she didn't have any warning that we were coming and hadn't
&quot;done her hair&quot; or put on any make-up or any of that nonsense that
women do to impress a guy. That didn't matter to me; I was very,
very, very...very impressed. After that day life was awesome. We
dated. We got married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one day, after being
married for a while, we were talking and she was reminiscing about
years gone by. She said she used to drive to work in her mom's LTD.
That phrase echoed in my head, &lt;i&gt;driving to work in her mom's
LTD&lt;/i&gt;. Now where did I hear that before, &lt;i&gt;driving to work in
her mom's LTD&lt;/i&gt;? YES! Now I remember! Wow! That's
amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked my wife if she
remembered a certain incident that happened a long time ago. One
evening I was being driven back into Wichita on U.S. 81 Highway,
also known as South Broadway for those familiar with the Wichita
area. The driver was closing in on another car in front of us and
recognized that car. &quot;Hey! That's my friend. She's &lt;i&gt;driving to
work in her mom's LTD&lt;/i&gt;.&quot; (That's where I remembered the
words.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told the driver to pull up
beside the car in front of us, like we were going to pass but to
hesitate so that we were side-by-side. I didn't know who the
driver's friend was, but I was going to tease her anyway, since
this was a friend of the driver. The driver said that this was a
new car and that she might not recognize the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pulled up beside the LTD
and I watched to see what her reaction was going to be. She looked
over with a face like, &quot;What is wrong with this car beside me?&quot; She
didn't recognize the driver. Probably because the first thing she
saw when she looked over was me. I waved at her with my smiley face
up close to the window. Caught by surprise, she smiled and turned
away to look at the road in front of her. We stayed there beside
her car. After a few seconds she looked again. I was still watching
so I waved to her again. I saw that she laughed and again turned to
look straight ahead. This time she put up a hand beside her face as
if to show that she wasn't going to look anymore...but she did. So
I waved again! She was laughing but she stopped looking at me. She
just wouldn't look over anymore. Now what? I told the driver to
pull up some. We pulled ahead so that our car was barely ahead of
hers. We were still in the lane of oncoming traffic but there
wasn't any traffic coming. I rolled my window down, unbuckled my
seat belt, and climbed halfway out of the window so that my
waistline was resting on the car door. Going down the highway, the
wind was blowing pretty good. I looked back at her and waved real
big. She couldn't ignore me anymore now. Ha! She was laughing. Then
we finally had to get out of the oncoming lane and finish passing.
We drove off and headed out into the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, my wife definitely
remembered that night. So after being married for awhile, we found
out how that was actually the first time our lives had crossed. And
to think, looking back, that this guy sticking out of the window
was who she was going to end up marrying. She's so
crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bugg Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Dune
Bugg:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;As you lay on a summer's day&lt;br /&gt;
in a warm and sunny place,&lt;br /&gt;
don't look up into the skies;&lt;br /&gt;
instead, look down and squint your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
Squint them both so very tight&lt;br /&gt;
that if you look with all your might&lt;br /&gt;
you'll find the land of Morethansmall.&lt;br /&gt;
For in this land live Buggs, thats all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our oldest child was a
young toddler, we read many books to her, some of them were called
the &lt;i&gt;Bugg Books&lt;/i&gt;, by Stephen Cosgrove. She had the WHOLE
collection, LOTS of books. She had lots and lots of books, but the
Bugg Books were her favorite. We would read those Bugg Books to her
at bed time until it got very late at night, reading book after
book after book after book...after book after book. We always had
to end with &lt;i&gt;Eevil Weevil&lt;/i&gt;. That was her favorite one. Every
now and then she would fall asleep before we couldn't read
anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she was about three or
four, she would &quot;read&quot; the books to us, but she couldn't read the
words yet. She would just recite the long stories word-for-word
from memory. Now in college, she still remembers the Eevil Weevil
story, and that if you look with all your might you'll find the
land of Morethansmall, and in this land are Buggs, that's
all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;EHA&lt;/h1&gt;

A Kansas Heartland Geocache
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt; &amp;lt;&lt;b&gt;h&lt;/b&gt;eart&amp;gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
E.H.A.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I made when
I got a new scroll saw was a cut-out of the letters &quot;E&quot; and &quot;A&quot;
with a heart held in place between them. This is &lt;i&gt;The Heart&lt;/i&gt;
that started the idea of the &lt;i&gt;Heart&lt;/i&gt;land Geocaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an offset geocache.
To find the geocache, &lt;b&gt;add the following numbers to the posted
coordinates: 0.875' to latitude and 1.190' to longitude.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a black
ammo box with a cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides.
Original contents include a Guide to Geocaching, a Sacagawea gold dollar
coin, a Kansas quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, one of
those new-Lincoln-image-on-the-back pennies, an old wheat penny,
and lots of other miscellaneous trade items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She knew I was going to
ask...someday. We had picked out rings awhile back, but I wouldn't
ask until I physically had a ring in my hand to offer to her. She
told me that having a ring didn't matter, but I was going to wait
anyway until I had that ring. Finally, I was able to finish paying
on the rings and have them in my hands. According to the payment
plans, I wasn't supposed to finish payments for awhile longer. It
was her birthday and I had the rings, so I finally asked
her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Will you marry me?&quot; I
asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;YES!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself, &quot;Yes!
She said yes!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I found out that she
was getting very impatient and that if I had waited a bit longer,
she was going to do the asking and ask ME the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Can you draw a rectangle?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son was a tiny lad, just
learning to draw. &quot;Can you draw a circle?&quot; He would get the marker
and draw a squiggly circle on the white marker board. &quot;Good! Now
can you draw a triangle?&quot; He drew a figure with three squiggles for
sides. &quot;Good! Can you draw a rectangle?&quot; Then he showed me how to
draw a rectangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He drew the rectangle with
another squiggly curve going over the top. He started drawing
circles under the rectangle. He started drawing all kinds of lines
going all over the board. He was going at it for quite some time
until he finally finished and presented his work of art to me. The
original rectangle was now a coal car for an old locomotive
choo-choo train. He showed me the coal in the coal car, the wheels
on the bottom, the train tracks, the train engine with the big
smoke stack on the top of the engine (he couldn't pronounce his
Esses so he said &quot;Hmoke Htack&quot;), the triangle cow-catcher swoop
thing on the front, and the &quot;den-a-len&quot; (which was the bell beside
the smoke stack, because it made the sounds den-a-len, den-a-len,
den-a-len as the train went by). I had never seen him draw anything
more than squiggly shapes and big scribbles on the white board.
This was the first time I had seen him draw anything more elaborate
than a simple rectangle, and he just blew it away with the details.
Forget the rectangle; that's too easy now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the geocache, solve
this puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Birdy heaven. Bun lore, joint plate hero fix.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mighty heaven. Sun tree, anoint chicks dive fun.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do it again!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was younger I used to
do magic shows. As I got older, the &quot;coolness&quot; of doing magic shows
wore off, but I always had a few good ones that I could show at the
right occasions. One of those good ones was a favorite of my kids.
They would have someone over to visit and bring the friend over to
me. &quot;My dad can put a rock in his head.&quot; It sounded silly, but I
had fun with it. The rock was one particular stone, a coin-sized
piece of mineral with a hole in the middle and polished to a good
shine. The hole in the middle always seemed to have some kind of
imagined significance to the feat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They would go and get &quot;the
rock with a hole in it&quot; from its designated place and bring it to
me. I would twirl the rock around and around, showing how pretty it
was. &quot;Okay, are you ready?&quot; I would ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yeah!&quot; they would say with
anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I would slowly take the
rock up near my face, and then dramatically slap it onto my
forehead. For more theatrics I would rub it into my forehead,
squeezing the rock into my skull. After rubbing for a bit I would
remove my hand and let them see that the rock was indeed gone, not
in my hand and not stuck to the outside of my head. So obviously,
the only place it could have gone was into my forehead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yep, I can feel it in
there.&quot; I would look to the left, then up, then to the right and
shake my head like I was listening to it rattle around in my
noggin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I would lean forward a
bit and move my jaw around. I would reach up to the bottom surface
of my jaw and rub the area above my throat like I was trying to
grab something that was just under the skin. Then I would slowly
slide my fingertips forward and when they reached my chin, there
was the shiny rock with the hole in it. There wasn't another rock
like it so that one had to be the one that rattled down my head and
out the bottom of my jaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They loved it; they always
did. &quot;Wow! Do it again!&quot; A magician is not supposed to do the trick
again, but I made exceptions for this one. Sometimes I would do it
again. I would certainly be doing it again a few months later for
the next kid that stayed over at our house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find the geocache, solve
this puzzle:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now imagine a cache stashed inside a limousine. Breathe a
bit, and have peace.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A word of caution with
puzzle-caches. When posting your log, do not include spoiler
answers in your log, lest you risk the unfortunate deletion of your
valuable log. It is such a sad tragedy when an inappropriate log

&lt;p&gt;Adapted
from Wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;

There are many ways to memorize pi, including the use of
&lt;i&gt;piems&lt;/i&gt; (a portmanteau, formed by combining &lt;i&gt;pi&lt;/i&gt; and
&lt;i&gt;poem&lt;/i&gt;), which are poems that represent pi in a way such that
the length of each word (in letters) represents a digit. Here is an
example of a piem, originally devised by Sir James Jeans: &lt;i&gt;How I
want a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy lectures
involving quantum mechanics.&lt;/i&gt; Notice how the first word has
&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; letters, the second word has &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, the third has
&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, the fourth has &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, the fifth has &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;, and so
on to get 3.14159265358979. The Cadaeic Cadenza contains the first 3835 digits of pi
in this manner. Piems are related to the entire field of humorous
yet serious study that involves the use of mnemonic techniques to
remember the digits of pi, known as &lt;i&gt;pi&lt;/i&gt;philology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Kansas Heartland Geocache&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details? That's none of your
business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a black
ammo box with a cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides.
Original contents include a Guide to Geocaching, a Sacagawea gold dollar
coin, a Kansas quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, one of
those new-Lincoln-image-on-the-back pennies, an old wheat penny,
and lots of other miscellaneous trade items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See
waypoint OXQCKN for the next
Heartland Geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.opencaching.com/en/#!geocache/OXQCKN&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found
it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment —
always.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams
come true.

This cache is named for our babygirl who was very excited to put
this cache together and donated several of the items it is starting
out with.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The cache is a small loc and loc box. Original contents include
small log book, pen and FTF Prize (cache=cash???). Also included
are a CITO bag/container, scooby doo bracelet, homemade popsicle
stick figure (made by our babygirl Lyndsey), a drink koozi, salt
mine keychain, gingerbread man, gloria the hippo, a moose &amp;
Travel Slug&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt; CONGRATS TO KSRENEGADE FOR FTF!!!!!!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Update as of 1/23/10:
There is alot of evidence in this area of what looks to be pack
rats (lots of holes, dens and missing cache) wanted to place a TB
here but unable to find the physical cache.  It has been replaced with a waterproof
matchstick container. Log only bring ur own pen or pencil. If
anyone should find the original cache container please let us
know!! Thank you and happy caching!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the posted coordinates, you will find Shelly. She works at the Y. When you go to visit her, park at the southeast corner of her yard. Otherwise you may get run over by the speedsters who zip by the Y. Shelly will tell you where to find Sally. Sally has the cache at the final coordinates. A tall, plastic loc-N-lock container has miscellaneous stuff like stuffed animals, bracelets, Sally's sea shells from the sea shore, and an altoids tin packed with LUCKY pennies, and they really have brought me good luck too. To the west of Sally is an interesting construct.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This area is known as &lt;i&gt;Twin Lakes&lt;/i&gt;. Maybe it has to do with
the two larger bodies of water on both sides of the highway, to the
northwest and to the southeast. Personally, I don't believe in
calling small ponds &quot;lakes&quot;. And as for these ponds, they are
actually remnants of where the Ninnescah River once flowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google defines an oxbow as a U-shaped bend in a river or stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
river flows along the west edge of U.S. 81 Highway west of the
Turnpike. The Turnpike is the north-south road with a big gradual
kink in it. The river goes south, then turns left and heads east to
cross under the Turnpike. There, it used to double
back and flow north making an &quot;oxbow&quot;, coming back to almost meet
up with the Turnpike again. (The river was there first. When they
built the Turnpike, they designed the kink in it to go around the
bends of the river.) Then the river took a right turn and traveled
on a winding path towards the south again making another &quot;oxbow&quot;.
The winding had been overtaken at some moment in time and the river
took the path of least resistance, changing the path of flow to a
shorter route and closing the &quot;U&quot;. This shorter
route still has a winding to it. Another oxbow is inside the other
oxbow. So here we have a &lt;b&gt;DOUBLE OXBOW&lt;/b&gt; right after another
oxbow. Is that cool or what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trivia: the &lt;i&gt;Ninnescah River&lt;/i&gt; gets it's name from what it
used to be called back in the pioneer days, the &lt;i&gt;Ne-Ne Squaw
River&lt;/i&gt;, meaning the &lt;i&gt;Little Indian Girl River&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for an ammo box with cammo duct tape all over
it. I have it tied about five feet off the ground as a precaution
against local area flooding. It's tied to the usual with a bungie
cord. Try to put it back like you found it, or like it should have
been when you found it. Contents include a Sacagawea gold dollar
coin, a Kansas buffalo quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, a
beautiful bracelet hand crafted by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland,
and other miscellaneous trade goodies.&lt;/p&gt;

      part of Stage Three, being the Final Stage with the geocache.
      At Stage Two you will finish figuring Stage Three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers to the questions at Stage One and Stage Two may be
found without leaving your car. Sometimes these areas can be packed
with muggles. When an area is loaded with muggles, you may have to
get out of your vehicle to answer some of the questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;STAGE TWO COORDINATES&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
North AB° CD.EFG' West HI° JK.LMN'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North __ __ ° __ __ . __ __ __ '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West __ __ ° __ __ . __ __ __ '&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;FINAL STAGE COORDINATES&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
North AB° QR.STU' West HI° VW.XYZ'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North __ __ ° __ __ . __ __ __ '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West __ __ ° __ __ . __ __ __ '&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;While you're at Stage One, the posted coordinates:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; - From the sidewalk go south four blocks to
Merchant. The number you seek is on another side of the block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; - From the sidewalk go south three blocks to
Lincoln. Lincoln is your &quot;B&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; - There is a bundle of blocks south of the drive
entrance, south of a flagpole, south of a group of three large pine
trees. &quot;C&quot; is the third block (Merchant) at the south end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;D&quot; is the second block (Linden) at the south
end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt; - On the north side of the parking lot is a long
line of blocks. &quot;E&quot; is the east Logan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;F&quot; is the first block north of the drive
entrance, minus the block at the northeast corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt; - South of the flagpole is a small tree between two
blocks. Neither block is Elm. &quot;G&quot; is the higher number of the two
blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;H&lt;/b&gt; - Start at the sidewalk and go north to the first
of three Sumners. &quot;H&quot; is the first Sumner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; - Start at the sidewalk and go north one block to
Logan. Logan is your &quot;I&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;J&lt;/b&gt; - Between the first and second trees north of the
parking lot's drive entrance are four blocks. The difference
between two Sumners is your &quot;J&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;K&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;K&quot; is Linden in the north row of blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt; - On the east bunch of blocks, &quot;L&quot; is all the
Friends (Friends:___+___ +___=___) minus all the Elms
(Elms:___+___=___).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;M&quot; is the first Line north of the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;N&quot; is the first block south of the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;O&quot; is 7. You get this one for free, like the
middle square of a Bingo card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;P&quot; is 478 but you won't need &quot;P&quot; and you won't
need &quot;O&quot; either, just like the middle square of a Bingo card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;S&quot; is equal to one block north of a flagpole
minus one block south of a flagpole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;U&lt;/b&gt; - Between the drive entrance and the northwest
corner are four trees. ___ Add up all the blocks on the south side
of each of these four trees, one block for each tree. ___ Add up
all the blocks on the north side of each of these four trees, again
one block for each tree. &quot;U&quot; is equal to the south blocks minus the
north blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;Y&lt;/b&gt; - Your &quot;Y&quot; is the southernmost block, which is a
Merchant. Be sure to be south of the group of three big pine
trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;Z&lt;/b&gt; - Your &quot;Z&quot; is either Main Line between the parking
lot drive entrance and the flagpole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have what you need to calculate the coordinates of the
second stage. Fill in the blanks for the second stage. The blanks
are in the secion above the question for &quot;A&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;While you're at the Second Stage:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;Q&lt;/b&gt; - Orange Washington&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt; - Purple Washington&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt; - Main&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;VW&lt;/b&gt; - Add all the blocks that are greater than zero
and less than four. To those, add all the blocks that are greater
than four and less than ten. The two-digit number is your &quot;VW&quot;. The
left digit is the &quot;V&quot; and the right digit is the &quot;W&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt; - Both Washington's plus a good Lincoln.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have what you need to calculate the coordinates for the
final stage. The geocache is at this next stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a black ammo box with a
cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides. Contents include a
Sacagawea gold dollar coin, a Kansas buffalo quarter, a
Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, a beautiful bracelet hand crafted
by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and other miscellaneous trade
goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland     </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This geocache is more of a drive-around multi-stage, but since you aren't really looking for the stages in order, or looking for midstage cache containers, I decided to classify it as a Puzzle/Other type of geocache.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This small town has community spirit. Here is a list of coordinates. Take a tour of the town and drive by each location and see if there is a United States &lt;strong&gt;FLAGPOLE&lt;/strong&gt; or a Belle Plaine High School &lt;strong&gt;DRAGON&lt;/strong&gt; or a Belle Plaine Middle School &lt;strong&gt;BULL DOG&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.551 W97°16.880 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.571 W97°16.879 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.588 W97°16.878 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.593 W97°16.860 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°24.030 W97°16.862 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.604 W97°16.589 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.366 W97°16.600 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.665 W97°16.546 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.627 W97°16.546 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.859 W97°16.574 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After visiting each location, calculate the coordinates of the geocache as follows. Start with the posted coordinates as your base numbers.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each location with a &lt;strong&gt;FLAGPOLE&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
subtract 0.171 from the minutes of the North coordinate and&lt;br /&gt;
add 0.107 to the minutes of the West coordinate.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each location with a &lt;strong&gt;DRAGON&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
add 0.171 to the minutes of the North coordinate and&lt;br /&gt;
subtract 0.107 from the minutes of the West coordinate.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each location with a &lt;strong&gt;BULL DOG&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
subtract 0.171 from the minutes of the North coordinate and&lt;br /&gt;
subtract 0.107 from the minutes of the West coordinate.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you're done with all the adding and subtracting, you will end up with the final coordinates to the hidden geocache. The final coordinates will be within three miles of the posted coordinates.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the final coordinates, you are looking for an ammo box painted black with a cantuland geocache logo painted on the sides.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland  </groundspeak:long_description>

things ready, someone drove up and parked nearby. They got out of
their car and walked around. I was foiled that day because someone
ELSE was in the middle of NOWHERE too...so I set it on another day.
The place was deserted that day.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;FROM SATURDAY, APRIL 9, 2011&lt;br /&gt;
TO SUNDAY, APRIL 10, 2011

&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TULIP TIME&lt;/b&gt; is the annual spring citywide celebration in Belle Plaine, three miles to the east. There is a billboard just south of the cache that tells when the next Tulip Time celebration is going to be. Usually, the billboard is outdated until just before the celebration. I'll try to keep the dates for the next event posted here.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are looking for an ammo box with cammo duct tape all over it. This area goes through seasonal floods so the box is attached to the area with a chain. If you need to disconnect the box from the chain, it's an easy task. Just be sure to put it all back better than you found it.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contents include two Kansas buffalo quarters, two Lewis-and-Clark edition buffalo nickels, two other Lewis-and-Clark edition nickels, a bracelet hand crafted by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and other miscellaneous trade goodies.

Before you get distracted, look for a bench mark. This is a USGS bench mark that is not on the usual NGS list. It is a brass disk on top of a 4-inch sqare concrete post that sticks up about a foot above the ground. Take good care of this bench mark. It looks to have experienced some recent bruises. Look at it, but do not disturb it. The bench mark is visible from the above coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geocache is 0.004 minutes north and 0.018 minutes east of the USGS bench mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI: Half of a mile to the north is the Ninnescah Bowhunters Association property. Keep in mind, this is private land. Don't go trespassing or you might get yourself silently shot. No one would even hear any gun shots. If you're interested, give them a call. I couldn't find any contact info.&lt;/p&gt;

The trail crossed the river south of present Clearwater 1 mile south. The Trading Post was located on the site of present McQuillan farmstead{1985}. Ninnescah is an Osage-Souian Indian name. The first part of the name means &quot;water&quot;. Variations of the last part of the name includes clear, salt, spring, good, and white water. The name Clear Water for the meaning of Ninnescah has been popularized because of the town's name. Please tell me when log is full so I can replace it. I have permission from Clearwaters City Administrator to place this cache.Do not go onto citys fenched area near by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have changed the cache size to a regular AMMO BOX so Kids can come to the site plus people can bring and take Travel bugs to and from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to 4AMERICA for the FTF. The Clearwater P.O. is now open.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Geocaches are a great way to learn about history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a million years ago, people used to travel west into unsettled territory by following a worn, chiseled mammoth trail called the Chisholm Trail. Motivated by John Wayne re-runs, these strange people sought to find vast areas of land in which they could hide new geocaches. Wild stories of these hidden geocaches circulated from one saloon to the next through emails on the Internet. The news attracted geocachers like Mr. Lewis N. Clark from the east coast who were told, &quot;Go geocaching, young man.&quot; Some people brought wagons full of items to trade. Some even brought their whole family on geocaching expeditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This park is dedicated to a common route tracked by early geocachers. If you're lucky, you will even find a geocache still in this area, and then you too will be a part of this histerical account. Watch out for muggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Flat level ground located in City of Clearwater, Kansas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache has room only for log, bring a ink pen to log in with.Clearwater is situated in southwestern Sedgwick county, approximately 15 miles southwest of Wichita. The location is about 12 miles south of US highway 54 and 10 miles West of the Kansas Turnpike. In the regional setting, the city is about 35 miles north of the Kansas/Oklahoma border and 175 miles west of the Kansas Missour border. Major cities across the region, in addition to Wichita, include Oklahoma City, approximately 150 miles toward the south, Kansas City, within 200 miles toward the northeast; and Denver, approximately 490 miles to the northwest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a location close to the Kansas Turnpike (US 35) reaching the north east,Interstate I35 on a north-south alignment, and US Highway 54 coursing east-west through the state, each providing connection with the transcontinental highway system, the City of Clearwater is with in one to three days travel time of all major market areas in the contiguous 48 states.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The location of Clearwater with regard to the surrounding region is ilustrated graphically on the following figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The City of Clearwater is situated above the channel area of the Ninnesscah River on generally flat to gently sloping terrain consisting of deep, well drained soils above clayey alluvium and outwash silts,sandsand gravels. Due to reppeated meandering of the adjacent river over geologic time, the area is underlain by substantial deposits of water-bearing sand and gravel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the area was not subjected to permanent settlement until 1870's the earliest documented European incursion date from the well known expedition of discovery by Coronado in 1541,nearly 300 years earlier. The intervening centuries saw an acceleration flow of explorers, trappers,traders and buffalo hunters, culminating in a massive wave of immigration and settlement in the years following the civil war. By 1867 the famous Chisholm Trail was in use , passing just east of present day Clearwater. The trail was a favored route for movement of herds of semi-wild Spanish cattle from tesas to the rail head and market area of Abilene. With the arrival of permanent homesteading and construction of miles of barbed wire fencing the era of the great cattle drives came to a rapid close, with the final drives through the area occurring prior to 1874.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The history of the Clearwater community has been documented in detail in several publications including Clearwater, In the Valley of the Ninnecah, 1885-1985 by the Centennial Book Committee.  Present day Clearwater was moved to coincide with the route of the Missouri-Pacific Railroad in 1880's and completed in 1887. Santa-Fe by 1887 but ended in 1937.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many thanks to Mr. Kent Brown on his assistance placing the caches and permission to do so. They will be displaying a link on City of Clearwater internet sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to 4AMERICA on FTF. I have a muggle friend who watches this cache due to all the thiefs of materials in the county. Just let him know what you are doing and things will be alright.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A **DAYLIGHT ONLY** geocache north of Mulvane, Kansas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THE CACHE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a large-sized, black ammo box with a
cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides. Contents include a
gold Sacagawea dollar coin, a Kansas buffalo quarter, a
Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, a bracelet hand crafted by the
wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and lots of other miscellaneous trade
goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location for this geocache was chosen because of the effort
given by the people here to help all animals. They use their skills
indoors but the container is outdoors. Permission has been granted
to place the cache on their property. No night-time caching is
allowed for security reasons, so stop by during daylight only. If
you'd like, you can step into the office and say hello to the cat
who guards the front desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My cat named Bello&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This geocache is
     dedicated to a cat that I lost on June 13, 2007. His name was
     Bello, pronounced &quot;Bayo&quot;, Spanish for beautiful. He lived to
     be a very old cat and finally died of living too long. He used
     to be an outside cat, then had to become an inside cat to keep
     him out of trouble. He always wanted to go back outside. He
     would sit and look out the window for hours. I'm sure he was
     remembering what it was like to chase the birds and walk on
     the hoods of cars. He liked to be the center of attention. If
     the kids were paying attention to toys, Bello prefered that
     they paid attention to him. Sometimes he would try to interupt
     a card game. We kept playing the card game and he kept laying
     on the cards. Bello liked to play with anyone and was very
     tolerant of toddlers who wanted to pick him up, hang on to his
     tail, or even cover him with a dirt pile, a pile of leaves, or
     a pile of kids' swimming pool accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When family was sick, Bello was the nanny cat. If you just
couldn't give him some attention, then he would give it to you. He
would sit at your side all day for days if necessary, until you got
better. You couldn't fake it either; he always knew when you really
were sick. You didn't get any of the &quot;nanny attention&quot; if you were
faking it. Bello believed that babies were always in need of a
nanny cat to sit and protectively watch over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he &quot;pounced&quot; on you, he would look like he was the vicious
lion attacking its prey, but Bello's teeth would barely touch you,
more of a bump, and his slapping from his front paws was always
pulled back so you barely felt anything at all. If you teased him
and he got you with his back feet, he wouldn't use any claws. It
was a game to him. He liked to play...by the rules...and if you
crossed the line and teased him too much, he would stop playing and
look you right in the eyes and give you a scowl, not a threatening
&quot;I'm going to get you&quot; look, but more of a &quot;You're not playing
right so I quit&quot; look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was time to take a nap, Bello learned how to use the
curtain to make himself a hammock on the top of the couch so he
could soak in the sun. He loved his naps. Sometimes we would find
him napping on a pile of stuffed animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bello tried to give the impression that he was a grumpy old man,
but we knew the difference. He was very good at ignoring people and
&quot;pretended&quot; to not be interested. When he acted like he wasn't
interested in something, we could tell by the flick of his tail
what he really was thinking. If he was annoyed, he'd slowly raise
his tail and whop it down to make a loud thump. When he was
interested in something, even if he wanted to pretend that he was
ignoring you, the tip of his tail would barely twitch over and
over. If you thought he was sleeping, you could call his name. If
he was awake, his tail would unfailingly give one gentle twitch.
His tail always gave him away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when Bello was a kitten, he hung out with the kittens at
the neighbor's house. He and Spots became best buds. Bello was a
black cat and Spots was a white cat. Bello was purchased from the
pet store, and Spots came from a stray mommy cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They would wander together like brothers and torment the
neighborhood dogs, laying just barely out of reach of a dog's chain
while they flopped around in the dust. Bello was good at catching
mice. Spots was good at stealing Bello's mice. As they grew up,
Spots sought other territory and left our neighborhood, leaving
Bello to terrorize the area by himself. Bello eventually was
befriended by our dog; stealing the dog's food was even easier
then. After Bello became an inside cat, he still was caught every
now and then stealing dog food from the bag; he knew he wasn't
supposed to do that and had to be sneaky about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the story of nine lives goes, we think Bello used up all of
his nine lives and borrowed some more from the other cats in the
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*** One day Bello came home in a winter storm with ice all over
him. He looked like someone dumped water all over him. He got to
spend the rest of the storm indoors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*** Another time he came home with a sore on his chest. We took him
to the vet who said that he found some pieces of bird shot in his
chest. Someone had taken a shot at Bello and missed. Pieces must
have hit the ground in front of him, bounced, and got lodged in his
chest. The wound healed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*** Once he got too close to our dog. She darted to him and stuck
her mouth completely over his head, then backed off without biting.
Caught by surprise, Bello was shocked and his eyes were open very
wide. He learned the message that she was still the bigger of the
two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*** He had many occassions where he could have bit the dust, but he
always came through. He did, however, suffer a major
traumatization. Bello used to lay in the streets and make cars
drive around him...until he got run over. We took him to the vet,
surely thinking that this was the end for him. The vet said that he
had never seen a cat that bad and live through it. Well, he lived
through it. He suffered from permanent minor sinus damage and some
crooked teeth, but other than that, he recovered. That was the
event where we decided that he could no longer go
outside.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lived many years as an inside cat. He got to greet a new
kitten and watch it grow up to also be an old indoor cat. After
many years, Bello finally lived too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our family will miss
     Bello.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland

The road is the key feature here and if you can do the cache in the dry time because in the past I have seen the road very wet. But not in the past year I have not. If it is wet take a small boat or inflatable intertube to get to it. Their is a bridge nearby you can stand on if you get tried or swimming or what ever. No I did not hide it their either. Bridges have been over done I think. Take a pen or pencil please.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In Clearwater Kansas on 135th street AKA 4th street. No CENEX MAN here  . I have been trying to place caches in well known places but the spacing between each cache makes it hard to do. So visit Clearwaters answer of another CENEX cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use stelth to retrive the cache, but at times the traffic is slow after every one goes to work.No room for trackables just a log so bring a pen or pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congradulations to for FTF  to SilleB. You must be a new cacher in the area, and this is your first FTF well done and many more in the future. </groundspeak:long_description>

I have been camping near here several times in the past and remember the TWIN Bridges and you could go down the dirt ramp to the north to go camping here. We were in the Boy Scouts of America when we did this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch out for the steep side of the dirt embankment, take your time getting down to the cache site. If you explore be on the lookout for animals here going for a drink of water. Lots of nice places to look and place to hide a geocache here today. If you look at the cache page map you can see where to get to the campsites in the past, they are now gone and we did not attempt to go down to the river here. We have a FTF to report on this cache its J. Lincoln B Well done young man.</groundspeak:long_description>

We have placed this cache near a driveway to a field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I allways look for an object to name the geocache and this one is no exception to the rule. Most are muggle free they are away from houses and kind of away from the road its self. You might call the mirror a bit of road kill if you may and it is with in about 10 to 15 feet from the cache so look hard in those trees folks. Broken ground and of course weeds and trees.Please take along a pen or pencil to log in on the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have a FTF to report on this cache its, Hottopic96 and DAYofTH3D3aD</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This multi-staged chase will take you on a tour of this nice little park. The park is open from 7AM to 11PM. The stages need to be done in order, but they can be done at different times if need be.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The geocache is a 50-calibur standard ammo box and is at coordinates of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N 37°31.ABC', W 097°16.DEF'&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Take the tour to find out &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;. You will have to do some walking, some adding and some subtracting for this one. No multiplication is necessary. No hunting for microcaches is necessary. The number of swings at this park is your &quot;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; value. It isn't a trick question. At some time during your tour, just find the swing set in the obvious spot and count the number of swings for your &quot;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A = ______       H = ______       O = ______       V = ______&lt;br /&gt;B = ______        I = ______         P = ______      W = ______&lt;br /&gt;C = ______       J = ______        Q = ______       X = ______&lt;br /&gt;D = ______       K = ______        R = ______      Y = ______&lt;br /&gt;E = ______       L = ______        S = ______       Z = ______&lt;br /&gt;F = ______       M = ______        T = ______&lt;br /&gt;G = ______       N = ______       U = ______&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;STAGE ONE.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start the tour at the given posted coordinates. Look at the park sign here. Find the year under the word &quot;DERBY&quot;. It says something in the 1800s. We'll call it 18&lt;strong&gt;GH&lt;/strong&gt;. Find out &quot;&lt;strong&gt;GH&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;STAGE TWO.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;N 37°31.420', W 097°16.0GH'&lt;/strong&gt;. Count the number of trees within 20 feet of this spot. This is your &quot;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; value. Don't spend too much time on this stage. You are probably right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;STAGE THREE.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;N 37°31.4D2', W 097°16.11C'&lt;/strong&gt;, and find&lt;br /&gt;a metal thing with writing on it that starts out with &quot;TS36... &quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Find out the next 3 numbers, and use them as one 3-digit number, called &quot;&lt;strong&gt;JKL&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;JKL&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; minus 467 equals &quot;&lt;strong&gt;MNO&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;MNO&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; is also a 3-digit number.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;JKL&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; minus 851 equals &quot;&lt;strong&gt;PQR&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Hint: P equals zero. Another hint: V, W, X, Y, Z and I are just to&lt;br /&gt;confuse you if you don't read all this stuff. You can ignore them.&lt;br /&gt;They won't be used for anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;STAGE FOUR.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;N 37°31.MNO', W 097°16.PQR'&lt;/strong&gt;, and look around for something in this vicinity.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you see giant thorns,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;=1 and go to &lt;strong&gt;N 37°31.456', W 097°15.988'&lt;/strong&gt; for Stage 5.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you see a storm water inlet,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;=5 and go to &lt;strong&gt;N 37°31.470', W 097°16.000'&lt;/strong&gt; for Stage 5.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you see a big dog house,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;=9 and go to &lt;strong&gt;N 37°31.463', W 097°16.030'&lt;/strong&gt; for Stage 5.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;STAGE FIVE.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now look around this new location for something on the list.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you see giant thorns,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;=1 and go to &lt;strong&gt;N 37°31.488', W 097°16.000'&lt;/strong&gt; for Stage 6.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you see a storm water inlet,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;=5 and go to &lt;strong&gt;N 37°31.439', W 097°15.989'&lt;/strong&gt; for Stage 6.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you see a big dog house,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;=9 and go to &lt;strong&gt;N 37°31.476', W 097°16.100'&lt;/strong&gt; for Stage 6.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;STAGE SIX.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for a year stamped on something. It says something in the 1900s. We'll call it 19&lt;strong&gt;ST&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Find out &quot;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;Calculate &quot;&lt;strong&gt;U&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;; &quot;&lt;strong&gt;U&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; equals &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt;K&lt;/strong&gt;+&lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;STAGE SEVEN.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; is &quot;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; minus 3.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; is &quot;&lt;strong&gt;U&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; minus &quot;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;You now have what you need to find the geocache at &lt;strong&gt;N 37°31.ABC', W 097°16.DEF'&lt;/strong&gt; so GO GET IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland</groundspeak:long_description>

You may look at it, but please don't do anything that would disturb its position. Cleaning the top should be okay, so that you can read the disk...and take a picture of it (hint, hint).&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Ted Zollinger Park. It's a little place on the side
of the road. Parking is difficult to find. Lots of trees around
here have been dedicated to different people. There is a gazeebo
that makes for a good place to have a picnic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a small plastic peanuts container with cammo
duct tape all over it. Original contents included a 2007 dollar
coin, two Kansas buffalo quarters, two Lewis-and-Clark edition
nickels, a bracelet hand crafted by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland,
and other miscellaneous trade goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland   </groundspeak:long_description>

Walk over to home plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom of the 9th, full count, and the score is Found 50 and Set One. Bases are loaded. First base is to the east. Second base is 45 degrees left of first base. Third base is 90 degrees left. You're up to bat, and the pitcher throws the ball. The pressure is on. Everything starts to move in slow motion as you focus on the ball. Quickly, you check your GPSr and it says that the ball is bearing right at you with an accuracy of plus or minus 30 feet. You judge the pitch to be good enough and swing at it with all your might.&lt;br /&gt;BAM!&lt;br /&gt;You hit the ball and it goes 75 degrees left and just over the fence. A grand slam! Both teams celebrate by whipping out GPS receivers and everybody goes geocaching. Hooray!&lt;br /&gt;Don't just stand there. Go chase down your ball and find the cache. Camo-painted lock-N-lock. Be sure to hide it back as well or better than as you find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A townsite las laid out and named Clonmel in memory of Edward Wall, who donated five acres of land for a parish site in memory of his birth place, Clonmel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meaning of Clonmel is an old gaelic word &quot;cluain mealla &quot; meaning Vale of Honey. He donated 5 acres of land for the parish site, the deed was recorded April 5,1907.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first business said to have been a general store by Walter Wall in 1904 or1905. The Post Office was in this building. Their were also a barber shop, and blacksmith shop. These buildings were all along the north side of 71st street and West 183rd South. Residences are few, there is a trailer park north of Clonmel. In 1904 the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railroad laid tracks from Wichita to San Angelo, Texas. The grain elevator was built along the racks, also the stockyards were futher to the east. The tracks were pulled out after 1985 and trucks are used to haul the grain. Edward Walls homestead still stands west of the St Johns church and rectory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;St. Johns was first located 1 mile and a half north and one mile west of Clonmel. The Ist church was burned by fire. It was called St. Johns Settlement. The main reason the town is here is bacause of the Bishops policy to locate their churches near railroads, and St Johns Catholic Church was placed here because of a fire and the Bishops Policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many thanks to Father Jarrod Lies for permission to place the cache here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congradulations to 4AMERICA and ZROZRO7 for a co-FTF.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;When it comes to geocaches, Riggs Park is haunted and is famous
for &quot;eating&quot; geocaches. Geocaches go in, but they never come out.
The original placement of this geocache lasted two days before
being SHREDDED, keeping in step with the reputation of this park.
We'll see how long the second attempt lasts before also being
consumed. Hopefully it stays for quite a while. If you try this one
after a rain, expect the difficulty to be worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a small, sandwich-sized plastic loc-n-loc
with cammo duct tape all over it. Contents include miscellaneous
small trade goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began my journey into this place at the posted coordinates.
When I entered the area, there were squirrels running all over the
place. They were everywhere. As I continued to walk through this
woodsy scene, the air turned comfortably cooler, and I came upon an
unusual site. There on the ground before me was a squirrel sitting
up on his back legs and peering back at me. I carefully stepped
closer. It didn't dart away, but gave me a look of curiosity. It
was an old squirrel with very long grey hairs gently flowing in the
breeze. It looked as if it understood my very thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked the old squirrel, &quot;Why are there so many squirrels
around here?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The squirrel looked at me for a bit with unshaking eyes. Then
the squirrel spoke to me. Its voice was loud and deep and seemed to
reverberate inside my head as well as shake me on the outside. He
said in a loud booming voice, &quot;&lt;b&gt;Young one, you know about the
legend of the squirrels paradise.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed more of a question rather than a statement. I
answered, &quot;Nope, never heard of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appearing a little perturbed at my response, he continued to
speak to me in such a voice that it bore into my mind, forcing
understanding upon my thoughts. &quot;&lt;b&gt;Long ago began a legend that
somewhere there existed a place, a most wonderful place, a place
that every squirrel could call paradise. It was the Squirrels'
Paradise. I searched for most of my life to find such a place. I am
now one thousand two hundred and thirty-four years old.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wow, that's pretty old, for a squirrel,&quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;What? Oh, quit interrupting me. Of course it's old. I
searched most of my life for a place that every squirrel could call
paradise. ...Young one,&lt;/b&gt;&quot; he called to me, forcing his words on
my thoughts. He slowly held his arms out to the sides. He looked to
the left, then to the right, then back at me, peering into my mind
again. &quot;&lt;b&gt;Young one...this...IS...the Squirrels'
Paradise!&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wow!&quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;As old as I am, I do wonder about something. Why are you
talking to squirrels? Are you some kind of nut?&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, the old tree rat darted away, scurrying across
the ground to a nearby tree, and climbed up high to disappear into
the thick of the leaves above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland     </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;You find yourself at the Arkansas River. This place looks like a
good spot to build a giant arch gateway for a new &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot;
expedition to canoe through. We could have a re-enactment using
members of the Wichita Geocaching Society to get a canoe, dress up
in attire suitable for all-weather exploring (geocaching), and
explore this area with today's version of mapping gear (GPS
receiver). Who's going to play the part of Sacagawea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my &quot;artist's rendering&quot; of what the area would look like
viewed from a future spinning restaurant at the top of a hotel that
would be built nearby. It even shows a new bridge going to
Huckleberry Finn Land in Derby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area is owned by the City of Wichita, so maybe there are
plans for future development of this area. Maybe not. I don't know.
Until then, there are geocaches in the area to find (and more
later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is a short hike to a secluded spot next to the Arkansas
River. Sunrise from here is an awesome site. Park at a convenient
spot south of the geocache and take the path to the north to enter
the catacombs, or hike west to the berm, then north along the top
of the berm until you're ready to go into the thick of things. The
area is abundant with wildlife. While driving in to the area I saw
four deer stop at the side of the road as if the first was telling
the rest to look both ways before crossing the road. They didn't
bolt until I crossed their path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waterworld Gateway was planned for another spot, but you know
how it goes if you wait too long; you snooze, you lose. So now the
title is for this spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Container is a &lt;b&gt;HUGE&lt;/b&gt; one, and tethered in the event that
flood waters try to carry it off. This is the launching point for a
Geocaching Colorado (GCCO) Geocoin (TB23P6H)
   that was given to me by
   Buzz Lightyear I at the 2008 Meades Ranch
   tour. There's room in that box for big stuff, too. Weight
   yourself down before you come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland    </groundspeak:long_description>

The boys searched for caches in Sedgwick County Park, as well as along the Arkansas River to get ideas on how to do caches correctly as well as what not to do. Thanks to all of you cache owners that helped the boys be successful in their searches. Taking all of their experiences learned, the boys discussed a good site for our own city and came up with this one. You are looking for a small camouflaged waterproof container, Several mementos from the scouts' experiences were originally inside, including some camp coins, carabiners, and patches. You do not need to place scout specific items in the container, but please place something in if you take something out, Please leave it exactly where you find it. Please fill out the log so we know you have enjoyed this cache. Thanks.  </groundspeak:long_description>

Williams S. Struthers opened the Post Office on February 11,1879. Mail was kept in a walnut chest of drawers. Brought by horse overland from Wichita, Kansas. After the railroad Missouri-Pacific came thru Bayneville, Kansas, a Mrs Roseberry, who had to walk five miles to Ruby for her mail, would go to Bayneville Post Office and bring back the mail that had come in by train for the Ruby, Post Office. Usually she used a horse and wagon. After Struthers died, his wife continued to be the postmaster. The Post Office was closed June 30, 1894 and the mail was then sent to the Clearwater Post Office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located on private acres, you do not need to travel far from the road to find it. The property is owned by Mr.&amp;Mrs. Fred &amp;Chris Gorges,and have consented to have the cache place on their land. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Village setting not much going on, except for fiber optics installation. So keep your stelth on and have fun locating this one. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Property owners and neighbor across the street are very interested in history and will be watching for any comings and goings, He also knows about the cache also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congradulations to 2andaBoxer for the FTF.</groundspeak:long_description>

I have been keeping an eye on this location for the past 6 months so I could do it when the time came around.

attributes on this cache! Please be careful when attempting this
cache!&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; During our caching adventures we like to take our geo-pup
Tinkerbell aka Tinker, Stinker, Stinky, Tinky or Stinky-Tinky. We
have noticed on several occasions whenever the opportunity arises
she likes to climb and play on logs and trees. She does so with no
hesitation or fear and does so very nimbly. This is one of those
times when good sense should have taken over but nope away she went
so we decided to place this cache with her in mind.
&lt;p&gt;The container is a cammoed waterproof container bigger than a
matchstick container. A log and pencil are provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and remember please be safe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I snuck out of the hotel room before the break of dawn this morning to take a run at Sitting on a Spider.  After a multiple hour team excursion to complete that cache, I decided to make a grab or two on the way back to the hotel.  The team followed along as we made a pass at Tinker’s Tree.

Now, I was going to be the one to shimmy the tree and sign the log.  The problem with that plan is Hockabee was in this crew.  No matter how great my tree shimmying skills are, her tree scaling skills far outweigh my abilities.  

I have witnessed the power of the Hockabee on many caches.  I remember a cache we did in Oklahoma that was up a tree.  I had barely pointed and said I think it’s up there before she sprung up the tree like a squirrel attacking a nut.  In California, we parked on the wrong side of a ten foot fence.  No matter.  She made like a Marine and was on the other side before I knew what was happening.

The fact was that there was simply not enough room on that tree for the both of us.  So, I stood aside and let Hockabee do her thing.  And do it she did.  I would have made a second run up the tree, but I was already far beyond my caching curfew.  

Thanks for the great challenge, wolfy.</groundspeak:text>

If you like caching like J.A.R. and I do then this series of caches along the Old Railbed is just your ticket. It makes the old bones feel better and lets you sleep longer the next day. But that does not help if you are still employed and younger than 65 years old.</groundspeak:long_description>

Original contents included two Kansas buffalo quarters, two Lewis-and-Clark edition nickels, a homemade bracelet hand crafted by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and lots of other miscellaneous
trade goodies. The container has been replaced. Let's see what happens with an all metal container. New contents, new logbook, new container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old description: &lt;i&gt;There are lots of little cedar trees in the area, but when you see this image out there, you're there.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;My, my, how things have grown. There are lots of BIG cedar trees in the area now! The poison ivy bushes have become poison ivy trees too. It used to be easy entry if you follow the fence. Now it's just hard to get to the area no matter how you approach. I upped the ratings a bit to reflect the increase in defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland   </groundspeak:long_description>

I think the Owners of the railbed the Property of the Department of Transportation have problems of having enough fuel to mow the grass down. But I have seen a farmer mow and bale this tall grass and take it home to feed cattle. Possibly the cowboy from a few caches back. Hidden in a nice comfortable place.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This geocache is a revival of the original Wichita Traveler
Motel (GC8692), and, with permission from
blueyedkansan, is hidden in the same spot as the original. This is
in Emery Park with the BMX track. Use caution and watch out for the
muggles who frequent the area en mass; they already got the last
cache that was here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;b&gt;travel bug motel&lt;/b&gt;, this is a cache dedicated to the
geocaching trackable items that hitchhike from cache to cache.
Travel bugs often have set goals that they are trying to
accomplish. Sometimes the goal is to head east, head west, visit
pets, tabulate temperatures, or whatever. If you have a TB (travel
bug) or a geocoin that is looking for a place to camp, this
geocache is waiting for it. Be sure to check the goals to see if a
TB inside is heading in the same direction as you are. Feel free to
stop by every now and then to just &quot;discover&quot; a new TB or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a 30-calibur ammo box (just like the
original) painted dark with a cantuland-geocache-logo painted on
the sides. Original contents include some travel bugs to get the
cache started, a 2007 dollar coin, two Kansas buffalo quarters, two
Lewis-and-Clark edition nickels, a bracelet hand crafted by the
wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and other miscellaneous trade
goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland     </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This geocache is your basic one-stage traditional normal-sized
ammo box geocache. Just go to the posted coordinates and there it
is. The location, however, makes this one a little more difficult
than the average geocache. I rate it a 3/5. 5 on trudging through
the terrain, then about a 3 on overall difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been eyeing this location for quite a while; I had been
enchanted by this spot. Every day of driving by it made me glance
over and think to myself, &quot;Someday, someday.&quot; Well, now it's done.
I finally put a geocache in this spot and now, as the crazy
character said in the movie Braveheart, &quot;it's my island.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to do your research first before going out for this one.
Check out the online maps. I would suggest parking at the posted coordinates for
the geocache &quot;Park at the River&quot;. From there it's a long
hike, or swim, or boat ride, or whatever however. You can park
wherever you wish, but that's where I park. You might get wet on
this one. Safety first: bring adequate supplies and equipment, cell
phone, water bottle, whistle, spare batteries, etc.; bring a buddy;
notify someone of your intent; all that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a black ammo box with a
cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides. It's chained to about
head high and will likely stay that way. Contents include a 2007
dollar coin, a Kansas buffalo quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition
nickel, a bracelet hand crafted by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland,
and other miscellaneous trade goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland     </groundspeak:long_description>

To get exact coords to the cache you will need to solve the puzzle
below. You will be looking for a painted black sandwich sized loc n

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The book tells the story of Max, who one evening plays around
his home making &quot;mischief&quot; in a wolf costume. As punishment, his
mother sends him to bed without supper. In his room, a mysterious,
wild forest and sea grows out of his imagination, and Max sails to
the land of the Wild Things. The Wild Things are fearsome-looking
monsters, but Max proves to be the fiercest, conquering them by
&quot;staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once&quot;, and he
is made &quot;the king of all wild things&quot;, dancing with the monsters in
a &quot;wild rumpus&quot;. However, he soon finds himself lonely and homesick
and returns home to his bedroom where he finds his supper waiting
for him still hot.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Drive by the coordinates and have someone look to the west. Don't do it yourself, otherwise your driving may be distracted. Perhaps I should up the difficulty level for this part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see two planes, BIG ones. No you don't; someone else does. There are numbers on the tails. Have this imaginary person write down the numbers on the tails of the big planes. That's stage one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculate coordinates for Stage Two:&lt;br /&gt;
Use the numbers you got from the planes...I mean the numbers that &quot;your friend&quot; got from the planes. The number from the south plane (Which one was the south plane?) we'll call ABCDE. The number from the north plane we'll call FGHIJ. Now comes some confusing math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If A is greater than or equal to FIVE, then add THREE to it; that is your new A.
If A is less than FIVE, then add ZERO to it; that is your new A.
Optionally, you could subtract ZERO instead of adding, whichever you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of B,C,D and E:&lt;br /&gt;
If the number is greater than or equal to FOUR, then add FOUR.
If the number is less than FOUR, then add ONE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For F and G:&lt;br /&gt;
If the number is greater than or equal to FIVE, then subtract FOUR.
If the number is less than FIVE, then add THREE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For H,I and J:&lt;br /&gt;
If the number is greater than or equal to FIVE, then subtract EIGHT.
If the number is less than FIVE, then add EIGHT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have new numbers ABCDE and FGHIJ. The next stage is at coordinates of&lt;br /&gt;
N 37*AB.CDE' W 097*FG.HIJ'&lt;br /&gt;
where you will find coordinates to another stage. When you can't find anything at your calculated coordinates, then have a seat and bring a mirror to put at your heels...just for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final is a tall lock-N-lock plastic container with goodies. Watch out for low flying aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Stage four tells you details to project a waypoint to the final, so make sure you're up on knowing how to do that in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This was a geocache that I had been wanting to get around to hiding for a very long time. Finally I got it set. Now it's your turn to chase down the coordinates and find it! The container is hidden right out in the open. You may want to bring some binoculars on your &lt;i&gt;first visit&lt;/i&gt; ... to look at the ducks up close, of course. When I was looking to place a cache in this park, I found the remnants of an old cache very near this one. You may even find the remnants in your attempt to find this one. If you're looking for this cache and you find the empty coffee tin, then you haven't seen &lt;b&gt;Over the Rainbow&lt;/b&gt;, so keep looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the &lt;b&gt;difficulty level&lt;/b&gt; for this cache. You can claim it as a find &lt;b&gt;only if you sign the logbook&lt;/b&gt;. Whoever finds this first gets to keep the FTF Prize. After you sign the logbook, please place the cache back as it was (or should have been). Pay attention to how the stuff is put together. I made it so that it can be retrieved using a number of ways. Put it back the same way. I debated whether or not it should be a difficulty of 5, but after pondering on the matter for ages, I settled on the 5. I considered making this the final location to a difficult puzzle, but then the puzzle itself would get in the way of the fun for many people. I considered having this as the final location of a multistage geocache, but I wanted to post coordinates for this spot. So here you go. Get the coordinates and track it down. That's all. It's that &quot;easy&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a camo-painted 30-calibur ammobox with a cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides. (The original container was a small mug/thermos with cammo and black duct tape all over it but it was wiped out by a storm that threw in a few loose trees. The replacement is away from the precarious trees at a safer spot. Original contents included one of those new one dollar coins, two Kansas buffalo quarters, two Lewis-and-Clark edition nickels, a bracelet hand crafted by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and a few other tiny miscellaneous trade goodies.) Put on your stealthing caps for this one. Every now and then, a new Dorothy crew comes traveling down the yellow pathway, walks nearby, makes the loop at the end, makes a second pass and disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This park is a nice one; however, it has some restrictive visiting hours.&lt;br /&gt;
Winter hours: 8 a.m. - &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; p.m.&lt;br /&gt;
Summer hours: 8 a.m. - &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in this park, you can find some outdoor Wizard of Oz art, including a yellow brick road. There is a little train for grandpuppies to ride, and paddleboats available to get you out on the water. Ducks and geese are here year-round. Watch out when you drive up to certain parking areas, because they all know that the one who begs the loudest will get the treats. When Halloween rolls around, the Haunted Island in this park is one of the awesomest places to check out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland     </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I (Lauri) of the wolfy team is a KC Chiefs fan and my brother in
law (Merlinfreak) is a Buffalo Bills fan. The name of the cache
explains the reason for this cache!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ALL HAIL THE GLORIOUS BUFFALO
BILLS!!
&lt;p&gt;This cache is dedicated to the Buffalo Bills who spanked the KC
Chiefs in the season opener of the 2011-2012 season with a score of
41-7. At the time of this posting the Bills are 3-0 after beating
the other half of wolfy1970's team (Patriots) but that will come
out in due time........&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway the cache is a clear loc n loc with Buffalo Bills pics
and is filled with red, white and blue items, numerous old (90's)
Buffalo Bills trading cards and a couple of travel bugs! There is
also a free drink poker chip from Sonic for the FTF!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>So easy even a CAVEman (or Buffalo Bills fan) can do it.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We always enjoyed finding and trading stuff in caches, not the little nano caches that don't have any trading items in them. Then too we are always disappointed at the &quot;Tragedy of the Commons&quot; where the quality of cache swag degrades over time, so we built this big cache for big stuff, and stocked it with a virtual smorgasbord of swag. Remember, it's huge. Trade some big stuff. You can trade real stuff or you can trade &quot;virtual&quot; stuff. Right now it's only filled with virtual swag. Be sure to trade up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Virtual Swag Ideas:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use your imagination and sense of humor when deciding what to take and what to leave. Think BIG. The original virtual contents: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Life sized plaster-of-paris busts of the classical composers, each one wearing a pair of Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses. (Except Beethoven. He's on &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; piano.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elvis's last known pair of Blue Suede Shoes, size 15, with blue suede laces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A 1970's vintage microwave french-toast cooker, made of aluminum. (Yes it was recalled by the CPSC soon after product release, but what the heck, still collectable).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A set of metric and SAE lug wrenches, none of which will fit the lugnuts on your vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A life size plastic replica of the Rosetta Stone for your dashboard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The complete and unabridged fourteen-volume set of the history of Park City Kansas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A 22-LP set chronicling the heretofore unknown solo career of Cub Koda, the guitarist who formed the band &quot;Brownsville Station,&quot; (big hit: &quot;Smokin' in the Boys Room&quot;) in 1969. &quot;Spanning the decades of the 70's, 80's, 90's, and today.&quot; With lyrics printed on genuine hemp-fiber paper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sheet Music compilation, the complete works of Liberace including the unchained &quot;medleys,&quot; large print edition, with faux plastic Liberace collector rings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The transmission and clutch plate from a 1985 DeLorean, in stainless steel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The transporter control panel from the USS Enterprise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is quite near the parking lot so you don't have to haul your &quot;Hugh Jazz&quot; stuff very far to trade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE HIDE THE CACHE WHEN FINISHED LOGGING.&lt;/b&gt; It needs to blend in well as it is very near the muggle trail. Use the natural materials in the area to make a good pile on top of it. If you found the cache sitting out in the open, that's not going to keep it from getting muggled so please &lt;i&gt;PLEASE&lt;/i&gt; re-hide it under logs and debris so that it isn't out in the open.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cache idea based on two Austin-area caches:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Spur of the Moment Swag-less Cache!&quot; (GCJCW2) by Grajek and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Virtual Reality&quot; (GCHC66) by The Outlaw. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache was originally placed by &lt;i&gt;Hugh Jazz and his lovely wife Laura Jazz&lt;/i&gt;, who had to pursue life among the geocaches in far away lands. &lt;i&gt;cantuland&lt;/i&gt; adopted this geocache on January 15, 2007, to keep the magic alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was a cool departure from regular caches.  The container was HughJ!  I searched for the invisible cloak, but couldn't see it in there.  The log book looks like the T-Rex got ahold of it.  I took the spare Hummer tire, and left a small pony with a bag of lemon heads.  I know you're not supposed to leave anything that might attract critters, but the pony is pretty good at guarding the lemon heads.  The container was out in the open.  We tried to hide it better, but something that HughJ! is a little hard to keep hidden.  Use the invisibility cloak if you see it laying around.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I just finished watching the movie National Treasure 2 and went
out to spend the rest of the evening hunting for geocaches. While I
was in Pawnee Prairie Park, I came across a strange looking man
with a GPS receiver suspiciously hooked to his belt. He appeared on
the trail as he stumbled out of the bushes. He wore a white lab
coat and had crazy white hair. He walked toward me, staggering side
to side as he made his way closer and closer to me. Naturally, I
sprayed him with mace to protect myself. I readied my walking stick
as a ninja quarter staff in case he wanted to try anything. My Woo
Dan movements must have caught him by surprise, because as he was
falling to the ground, his face was full of confusion. As I turned
to run away with a panicked high pitched squeal and my arms
swinging around over my head, he grabbed my ankle with his left
hand as he hit the ground. With my squealing getting louder and
louder, I looked back at the strange man who attacked me in such a
weird fashion. His left hand kept me from running, but his right
hand was held up in the air grasping a white piece of cloth. With
such a refined display of my battle tactics, I naturally expected
the opposition to quickly surrender like he did, holding up a white
flag signifying defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped my strategic squealing and looked at the white piece
of cloth that the strange man was offering to me. I could see that
there was something written on it. The strange man got up from the
ground and spoke to me with a slightly hoarse voice. He told me
that 200 years ago, a group of rowdy kids, decorated in long white
wigs, had scribbled something on some parchment, and that the words
used were coded to lead to the location of a hidden treasure. This
guy looked pretty old; I bet anyone under 50 would be a kid in his
eyes. He continued to explain that no one would find the treasure
without the white cloth. The white cloth was the all-important key.
I asked the Doc where he came up with such a wild story. He started
to ramble about some boy named Marty who drove off with the old
man's silver car with long burning tire tracks, about taking the
secret cloth for the People of President Geo W. (obviously some
kind of Wichita geocacher with about a thousand finds), and that he
had to get back to the furniture, something like that. I got the
strong impression that this guy was a loopy man from the &quot;other
side of the river&quot;. He held up his hand again and offered me the
white cloth, telling me to never show the cloth to anyone else. It
was the key and was intended for We the People.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gently retrieved the cloth from his hand. After so doing, the
strange man disappeared, like when Yoda gave Luke Skywalker a last
bit of advice before departing to the land of cheap holograms. So,
assuming that I was now a new Jedi with my blazing Light Ninja
Quarter Staff Saber, I looked over the cloth, unraveling the folds
to discover mysterious writing on it. After learning the ways of
the force from the movie National Treasure 2, I quickly applied my
expert knowledge of a Lyon Playfair cipher to unravel the hidden
meaning of the text on the cloth. It didn't work. I turned the
cloth over and found additional messages about the puzzle hidden
away from the first side of the cloth. The additional text was
easily readable in common English. Having passed intense training
in 5th grade English class, I was well prepared for this particular
kind of encryption. It said that the puzzle leads to an ammo box
geocache and that anyone finding the treasure is to leave it there
and trade with the contents within. The white cloth mentioned that
the contents of the mysterious black box included a Lewis and Clark
edition buffalo nickel, a Sacagawea gold dollar coin, a beautiful
bracelet handcrafted by Mrs. puzzle, and other miscellaneous trade
goodies. Why would anyone go look for a treasure chest and leave it
there after they found it? Oh well, that is what the instructions
said to do, and, since it was written in English that I could read,
I would do as it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The white cloth was the key to the treasure. Knowing that thugs
from overseas would be after me to get the white cloth, I copied
the mysterious text to this webpage so I could read it again later
on. After that, I threw the cloth into a fireplace where no one
would be able to have the white cloth ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the white cloth is safely out of anyone's hands, it should
be okay to show you the puzzle. Here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
A1.S2.P3.
NH    MA+RI NJ    GA    PA-MD
DE+DE NY+RI MA-CT NC+NJ VA-SC

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The white cloth also said this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found
it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment —
always.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams
come true.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now John Henry was a mighty man, yes sir. He was born a slave in
the 1840's but was freed after the war. He went to work as a
steel-driver for the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad. And John Henry
was the strongest, the most powerful man working the rails. John
Henry, he would spend his day's drilling holes by hitting thick
steel spikes into rocks with his faithful shaker crouching close to
the hole, turning the drill after each mighty blow. There was no
one who could match him, though many tried. Well, the new railroad
was moving along right quick, thanks in no little part to the
mighty John Henry. But looming right smack in its path was a mighty
enemy - the Big Bend Mountain. Now the big bosses at the C&amp;O
Railroad decided that they couldn't go around the mile and a
quarter thick mountain. No sir, the men of the C&amp;O were going
to go through it - drilling right into the heart of the mountain. A
thousand men would lose their lives before the great enemy was
conquered. It took three long years, and before it was done the
ground outside the mountain was filled with makeshift, sandy
graves. The new tunnels were filled with smoke and dust. Ya
couldn't see no-how and could hardly breathe. But John Henry, he
worked tirelessly, drilling with a 14-pound hammer, and going 10 to
12 feet in one workday. No one else could match him. Then one day a
salesman came along to the camp. He had a steam-powered drill and
claimed it could out-drill any man. Well, they set up a contest
then and there between John Henry and that there drill. The foreman
ran that newfangled steam-drill. John Henry, he just pulled out two
20-pound hammers, one in each hand. They drilled and drilled, dust
rising everywhere. The men were howling and cheering. At the end of
35 minutes, John Henry had drilled two seven foot holes - a total
of fourteen feet, while the steam drill had only drilled one
nine-foot hole. John Henry held up his hammers in triumph! The men
shouted and cheered. The noise was so loud, it took a moment for
the men to realize that John Henry was tottering. Exhausted, the
mighty man crashed to the ground, the hammer's rolling from his
grasp. The crowd went silent as the foreman rushed to his side. But
it was too late. A blood vessel had burst in his brain. The
greatest driller in the C&amp;O Railroad was dead. Some folks say
that John Henry's likeness is carved right into the rock inside the
Big Bend Tunnel. And if you walk to the edge of the blackness of
the tunnel, sometimes you can hear the sound of two 20-pound
hammers drilling their way to victory over the machine.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I seen this site during a trip to the VETS. Seens too good to be true but their they were. Diamonds to the left of me, Diamonds to the right of me, into the Valley of Diamonds rode the cachers of America. I have trouble remembering numbers but you folks should be able to figure it out. The coordinates are in the middle of the valley and the offset is one of two numbers the first one was at 110 degrees from the coordinates the other is 290 degrees from the coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have it of good note that VicknRandy are placing caches at these diamonds, so since their are too many to be in a deck of cards. So thus this cache to have fun with and to tell VicknRandy about. Of course a lot of you cachers will find this a bit out of your way since most of you live on the East Side of Wichita. Please bring a pen or pencil to logg yourself in at the proper cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">CACHE IS NOT AT THE POSTED COORDS!
&lt;p&gt;You must first solve the puzzle below to get the coords to the final location! You will be looking for a ammo can with a special paint job!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;FIRST A LITTLE HISTORY!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start Bill-ieving: Buffalo 3-0 after beating Pats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Buffalo Bills are proving they're not the same old NFL pushovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One week it's rallying to beat Oakland, the next it's storming back to conquer an even bigger nemesis: AFC East rival New England. Rian Lindell made a 28-yard field goal as time ran out to seal a 34-31 win over the Patriots on Sunday after the Bills erased a 21-0 second-quarter deficit.The win has Buffalo - a team which hasn't reached the playoffs in 11 seasons - off to a 3-0 start and sitting alone on top of the division. It's early, sure, but maybe it's time to start Bill-ieving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The significance of this victory goes back much further as the Bills snapped a 15-game losing streak against the Patriots that dates to the 2003 season opener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linebacker Chris Kelsay can provide the proper perspective, given he's one of only four players left on the roster who played in that game.&quot;It's the biggest win of my career. I can't think of any bigger,&quot; Kelsay said. &quot;To beat these guys at home, in front of our fans, with the way they're behind us despite being down early, it's huge. I'll never forget it.&quot; Fitzpatrick led an offense that produced 448 yards and scored 30 points for the third straight week. Fred Jackson had 74 yards rushing and a score, and 87 yards receiving, with his final 38-yard catch setting up Lindell's field goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffalo's opportunistic defense played havoc with the usually unflappable Tom Brady , who threw four interceptions - equaling the number he threw all of last season - and one of which Drayton Florence returned for a touchdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New England (2-1) had a 10-game win streak snapped while losing to Buffalo for only the second time in 22 meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We had too many penalties, too many scoring opportunities that we missed. That's why we lost the game,&quot; Brady said. Then again, it's not as if the Patriots have never lost before.&quot;It's one loss, and it's a long season,&quot;Brady said. &quot;Hopefully, we'll learn from it, move on.&quot; Brady still went 30 of 45 for 386 yards and four scores - two each to Wes Welker and Rob Gronkowski. He also set the NFL record for most yards passing (1,326) over a three-game stretch. Welker had a career-best 16 catches for a franchise-record 217 yards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Patriots were overwhelmed by a Bills team that's gaining confidence and showing it's capable of pulling out victories following last year's 4-12 finish - three of those losses coming in overtime. Dating to 1950, the Bills became the only team to overcome deficits of at least 18 points to win in consecutive weeks, according to STATS LLC. In fact, only five teams had previously won twice in one season when trailing by 18 or more points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It feels great, man,&quot; said receiver Stevie Johnson , who had eight catches for 94 yards and a touchdown. &quot;We know we've got a ton of games to go, but just for the fans to say,`We beat the Patriots,' that's something big.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOW FOR THE PUZZLE! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;N: George Wilson* Aaron Williams + Brad Smith . Tyler Thigpen + Brian Moorman + Demetrius Bell + Colin Brown + Nick Barnett - Chris Kelsay&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;W: Chad Rinehart + Leodis McKelvin* Kraig Urbik - Terrence Wheatley . Marcell Dareus + Spencer Johnson + Steve Johnson + Donald Jones + Ruvell Martin + Torell Troup - Shawne Merriman - Drayton Florence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a place we allways went to on Saturdays to do roller skating back in the 1950's. In the earlier days it was an Ice Skate Arena. My Brother and Father would go and skate in the evenings and thats when he got his little finger cut and then sewn back on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The place was made out of bricks and we hauled off a bunch to make a patio out of them in the 1960's. I know that the place is gone and these appartments have taken up residence here. Placing a cache here is a little dificult because most of the cachers do not know about the history of the place. Across the street the church look a little run down but it was a beautiful place in the 40's,50's,and 60's when it was a Southern Baptist Church. The thing I want you to see is the problem of the addressess of the west side of the street Hydraulic is in the 700's and the east side is in the 800's. I would have liked to name the cache something else Like Which block am I on 754 or 888.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This puzzle doesn't require
much more than following the instructions and adding and
subtracting. No sudden intuitive leap of understanding or
epiphanous burst of insight is required to solve this puzzle. Just
follow the directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to the posted
coordinates. There you will find a mural on the side of a building.
You don't even have to get out of your car. Here's what part of the
mural looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the right end of the
painting you can find some numbers in boxes, four wide black boxes.
You will use these numbers to calculate the coordinates of the
geocache. The &quot;page&quot; is tilted a little bit. References like
&quot;top-right&quot; refer to the top-right corner of the painted page as if
you had the page in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE&lt;/b&gt;: Ignore any
dashes painted on the left edge of the numbers. The top-left number
and the bottom-right number have negative signs that we're not
interested in. We don't care if the number is positive or negative;
we're just interested in the number, not the sign. (For those with
knowledge of mathematical terminology, we'll use the &quot;absolute
value&quot; of these numbers.) Double-check that your numbers match
those on the mural. Incorrectly recording these numbers would make
for a disappointing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;CALCULATE LATITUDE NORTH:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The degrees is your typical
&quot;37&quot; like everything else around here. Now for the minutes. The
minutes, including its decimal part, is calculated by starting with
the number in the top-left box (ignore that negative sign). Add to
it the number in the top-right. Next subtract the bottom-left
number. Then subtract the bottom-right number from it. The result
is the North-Coordinate of the geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;CALCULATE LONGITUDE WEST:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Longitude-West
coordinate, use &quot;97&quot; for the degrees; that's what everything else
is around here. Now take the number in the top-right and write it
down four times. Add up all those four numbers. Next take the
number in the bottom-left and write it down three times. Add up
those three numbers like you just did for the previous number. Now
add your first group of four to your second group of three. After
that you're working with one number now. This number will probably
do for you as it is, but we're not done yet. To this number, add
&quot;0.0038&quot; for better results. This is your final result. This result
is the minutes and decimal minutes of the West-Coordinate of the
geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;DONE!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now have complete
coordinates of the hidden geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a black
ammo box with a cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides.
Contents include a Sacagawea gold dollar coin, a Kansas buffalo
quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, a beautiful bracelet
hand crafted by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and other
miscellaneous trade goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland    </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Wichita
&quot;Intrust Bank&quot; Arena.&lt;br /&gt;
The geocache you seek is elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wichita Arena is
centrally located in Wichita, Kansas. Within these walls you will
find the most amazing things. Sometimes there are creatures inside
that find their way out of the confines of these walls. Be on the
lookout for this possibility when you visit this site. These
creatures are the most unusual kind of creature - sometimes very
furry, other times hairless - the type of creature that seems to
randomly walk around looking, not at the amazing city sites, but
rather entranced at staring at a device held in front of the face,
as if hypnotized into following every command from the device.
These creatures seem to dance around like a drunken bee. Reports
have come in that it is their nature to freeze like a hunting dog
when they see a similar device held in the hands of a
&lt;i&gt;regular&lt;/i&gt; human being. If you see a creature of the likes of
this, proceed with caution. For your safety, you may yell out, &quot;I
FOUND IT,&quot; forcing these creatures to become temporarily
disoriented from their staring entrancement. Previous attempts at
this, however, have resulted in the creatures becoming crazed and
startling them into rushing toward you in a frenzy which at first
appears threatening, but once these creatures get within close
proximity, they will immediately stop their approach and begin to
thoroughly scour the ground around your feet. So far, all contact
with these unusual creatures have reported a non-violent outcome.
You have been warned.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The geocache is at:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;NORTH 37° AB.CD'&lt;br /&gt;
WEST 97° E.FG'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve the coordinates and
find the geocache, you need to take a tour of the outside of this
arena and answer some questions. The answers to the questions will
allow you to calculate the coordinates for the location of this
geocache. The calculation requires only some counting, some
addition and some subtraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;____ &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;. How many sets
of double-doors are at Entrance &quot;B&quot;? One pair of doors counts as
&quot;1&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;____ &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;. Along the
north side of the Arena there are some short concrete pillars that
are about two and a half feet tall and about 10 inches in diameter.
Starting from the west end and counting towards the east, stop when
you get to the 48th pillar. At the base of this pillar is a secret
message written on an iron plaque. It's a short message. Find the
difference between the number of vowels and the number of
consonants in this message. Then add 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;____ &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;. Continue
counting the pillars from Question B above. Count all the short
concrete pillars from the west end all the way to the east end. At
the east end, the line of pillars bends and heads towards the
building using just a few more pillars. Be sure to include those
pillars too in your count. After you get a number, add three to
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;____ &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;. On the west
side of the Arena are two sets of stairs. We're interested only in
one set. They are both the same so it doesn't matter which you
choose. When you are at the top of the steps, how many steps does
it take to get to the bottom? In other words, how many times do you
have to move a leg to change your elevation to a lower place? Once
you have that number, subtract 1 from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;____ &lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;. On the north
side of the Arena building there is a canopy sheltering the
walkway. How many long thin beams support the canopy outside to
keep it suspended in the air? There are more on the north edge than
on the south edge of the canopy. What's the total? Now subtract 1
from that total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;____ &lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;. On the south
side of the Arena is a small parking lot filled with handicap
parking stalls and 3 stalls for 15-minute-parking. How many stalls
are there all together? You can also count the number of vertically
posted signs marking each parking stall. Be sure to include the
three stalls for 15-minute-parking in your count. Now you have a
number that is made of two digits, one number in the &quot;one's&quot; place
and another number in the &quot;ten's&quot; place. &lt;b&gt;Subtract&lt;/b&gt; the ten's
digit number from the one's digit number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;____ &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;. The parking
lot mentioned in Question &quot;F&quot; has a retaining wall running along
the north edge of all the parking stalls. At the far west end of
the retaining wall is a secret message, two words, each ending with
the letter &quot;A&quot;. How many letters make up these words? Duplicate
letters increase the letter count. (For example, if one word was
&quot;SECRET&quot;, the number from that word would be 6 even though the
letter &quot;E&quot; was used twice.) To this number, add another number. The
other number is the quantity of hand rails found at one of the two
sets of steps mentioned in Question &quot;D&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have all you need to
calculate the coordinates of the geocache. Substitute the letters
in the coordinates with the answers to the above questions. The
hidden geocache is about a three-mile drive from the posted
coordinates, depending on how you drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a
plastic peanutbutter jar cammoed up to blend in with the
surroundings. Contents include a Sacagawea gold dollar coin, a
Kansas buffalo quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, one of
those new pennies with a different back to commemorate Abraham
Lincoln, a 3-D &quot;Egyptian&quot; dollar, a beautiful bracelet hand crafted
by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and other miscellaneous trade
goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland     </groundspeak:long_description>

of the Plains Plaza. Visit the site, and answer some questions. Use
the answers to come up with coordinates of a geocache hidden in
Wichita, Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geocache is a 50-calibur ammo box painted black with a
cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides. Original contents
include a 2007 dollar coin, two Kansas buffalo quarters, two
Lewis-and-Clark edition buffalo nickels, a bracelet hand crafted by
the wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and other miscellaneous trade
goodies. When you head for the final coordinates, you will be able
to drive right by it. However, parking right by it would rouse
muggle-suspicion and may compromise the future of this cache. Good
&quot;tact&quot; would be to park in either of two parking lots nearby, so
that you can use stealth when you get close. On your final stretch
and while you have the container, please keep an eye out for
muggles. There is a place close to the container where you can go
to be &quot;invisible&quot;, if needed, when ducking for cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Plains
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** The location of the geocache is at coordinates of&lt;br /&gt;
** North &lt;strong&gt;AB°CD.EFG'&lt;/strong&gt;, West
&lt;strong&gt;HI°JK.LMN'&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the plaza tour to find out what numbers to plug in for the
letters. You will have to do some searching at the plaza, some
reading, some adding and some subtracting for this one. No
multiplication is necessary. No hunting for microcaches is
necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a major tourist attraction, the Keeper of the Plains Plaza
is a great place for taking photographs. Photos are encouraged as
long as you don't upload photos that give away answers. Any spoiler
pictures will be removed. The questions are designed so that you
can enjoy uploading some good pictures without ruining this
puzzle-cache for other geocachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are your questions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the south end of the south pedestrian bridge, what is the
number of parallel bars that make up a hand-rail alongside the
steps?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add B.1 to B.2; then, from that result, subtract B.3; and after
all that, add ONE to it (Otherwise you'll end up in Oklahoma).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B.1: ESTEEMED PARTNERS - How many letters are in the last
word?&lt;/p&gt;

word?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.2: How many italic lines of text are in the plaque entitled
&quot;CITY OF WICHITA Arkansas River Corridor Improvement Project&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;F&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add F.1 and F.2; then subtract that amount from F.3; now add
F.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F.1: THE CEREMONIAL PIPE - How many puffs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many letters are in the 3rd word of the 8th line of the
paragraph that ends with, &quot;What follows is a brief account of their
vast and profound tradition.&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the north end of the north pedestrian bridge, there is a lone
lamp post with a stone/brick base. How many bricks are in the third
layer of bricks from the top, if you count the top &quot;flat&quot; layer as
the first layer?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;J&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with K.1; subtract K.2 from that; then add K.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K.1: At the south end of the south pedestrian bridge, what is
the number of steps in the first group of concrete stairs as you
descend to the bikepath along the river?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;L&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subtract L.1 from L.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.1: THE SOURCE OF LIFE - &quot;More than ___ million buffalo once
roamed the Plains.&quot; What is the left character of this number?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.2: SACRED SONGS AND OBJECTS - How many letters are in the tall
word under this plaque?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;M&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STRENGTH OF THE SHIELD - How many letters are in the 5th word of
the first sentence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discover the answers the questions above and you will have what
you need to find the geocache at the final coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** The location of the geocache is at coordinates of&lt;br /&gt;

Their is a monument to the newspaper at this site and I thought I would honor the newspaper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very busy corner at some times but the cache can be very hard to retreive. The monument is an old water fountain, and has been around since 1922.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have been reading the History of Wichita by Graig Miner and the Wichita Eagle has been quite a few places in the city. This place is supposed to be the first place that the Wichita Eagle was located other places include at Main and Douglas, and William and Market streets, where it was when I was a youngster in the 1940's. And it rival the Beacon was around the corner on Main and William. Both newspapers started in 1872 and of course the Beacon was bought by the Eagle sometime in the 1960's or 1970's. </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Many people have wondered what the pole is well I have done a
little research and the answer is it is a piece of art commissioned
by the city of Wichita from local artist Chris Frank. Here is his
website http://www.chrisfrankart.com/info.html. I have also placed
3 pics of what the art should look like in the gallery.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Unfortuntly this one is no longer going to be able to be part of
our Tin series so this one has been replaced once again but this
time with a nano. Log only, bring your own pen or pencil!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This one will take you near a place that provides lots of fun when it's open. The cache itself does not require that place to be open. Nearest parking is not too close but is probably a parking lot south of the cache. The container is a small loc-n-loc with cammo tape all around it. Inside are miscellaneous goodies that had been laying around for a while. I don't remember what's inside; I just dumped some stuff in there. Watch out for peering eyes. This one could be done at night, too, if you're careful.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;26APRIL2008: This geocache used to be called &quot;Sunrise Castle&quot; because of the view to the east. However, the current name is a much better one for this particular geocache. I considered using &quot;frogger&quot; ever since it first came out. I finally made the title change.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland </groundspeak:long_description>

Adventure 2007&lt;/b&gt;, held in conjunction with &lt;b&gt;Riverfest XXXVI&lt;/b&gt;
in Wichita, Kansas. There was a drawing held on Saturday, May 19,
2007 from the First 10 To Find. A &lt;b&gt;trip to Costa Rica&lt;/b&gt; with
Backwoods Adventures was awarded as the Grand Prize.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special Thanks to cantuland, daviddafish and jennielynn for
their part in writing clues and general good behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #1:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the following coordinates, you'll find a number of tidbits
about Wichita history. One of these tidbits mentions the Santa Fe
railroad and its history here. There's a rather large dollar amount
mentioned. Of the six digits, only one of them is not a zero. What
is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 37° 41.242 W 097° 19.657&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #2:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 15th century, buffalo dominated the American plains
with numbers over 60 million. By 1900, less than 1,000 buffalo
remained. But thanks to federal regulation and careful breeding,
there are now about 30,000 buffalo in national parks and privately
owned rangeland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll find a buffalo at the following coordinates. Next to him,
you'll find a plaque with two dates on it. Add up all of the digits
of the two dates (should be every number on the plaque). Once
you've done that, add up all the digits of that number. Continue
adding until you're down to a single digit. Now, multiply that
number by 2 and you'll have the next portion of our coordinate for
our final location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 37° 41.695 W 097° 21.409&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #3:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on a mission for the Admiral to deliver a package. To
where? He did not know. I would find out on my journeys. The
Admiral, being an expert navigator told me where to find more
information. He equipped me with a personal navigation device, a
hand-held GPS receiver. Using this GPS receiver, I was to proceed
to coordinates of N 37º 41.487’ W 097º 20.990’ where I
would meet the Great Wise One. He would tell me what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to the given coordinates and met the Great Wise One. He
towered over me. He spoke with a deep booming voice, but I could
sense empathy in his words. The Great One took off his feathered
headdress and gave me instructions to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told me, “These feathers have adorned me for long
enough. I will keep one feather for myself and give you the rest.
Take your feathers to N 37º 40.173’ W 097º 20.121’
where you will meet a friend of mine. When you can look him in the
eye, then you will see the writing on the wall, two words. Give my
friend one feather for each letter of those words. He will know
where next to send you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With great respect, I departed and did as he said. I did meet
his friend and gave him the appropriate number of feathers. I could
hear wisdom from this man as well, “Thank you for these
feathers. They mean more to me than you could imagine. Time stands
still for some people. Go to N 37º 41.041’ W 097º
20.822’ where you will see time for many. Looking down you
can see time reserved for the future. Looking up, you can see time
in motion. Looking straight ahead, you will find where time stands
still for some people. You will find four numbers together where
time stands still. Add the right two numbers to get a new number.
Add the left two numbers to get a second new number. Subtract the
second new number from the first new number. This is how many
feathers you will leave there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did as he said and left the appropriate number of feathers for
time to do as it wished. After finding time for myself, I looked in
my hands at the remaining number of feathers, I knew now what had
been with me all along. This number of feathers is a number to be
used for the 2007 Backwoods Geocache Adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #4:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howdy, Pardner! Saddle up yer pony and ride over yonder to the
spot marked by these here coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 37° 45.636 W 097° 20.171&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do a little recollectin’ on those brave cowboys riding the
ranges of the past, while you examine a page out of Kansas history.
While yer at it, be sure to take some note of the year the first
Cattle Drive moved through these here parts. Fact is, the number
ya’ll have the opportunity to collect for this particular
day’s clue is none other than the last digit of the
aforementioned year in history! Alright Friend, your work here is
done – go rustle up some grub at the chuck wagon. Happy
Trails!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #5:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using your GPS receiver, you will need to go to all the
coordinates listed below. Each coordinate is at the location of a
Wichita organization. Once you have determined what the
organizations are, you will need to determine their physical street
addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digit required for today’s clue is common in the
street number for the following organizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organization 1: N 37° 41.695 W 097° 20.376&lt;br /&gt;
Organization 2: N 37° 41.334 W 097° 20.920&lt;br /&gt;
Organization 3: N 37° 40.873 W 097° 20.734&lt;br /&gt;
Organization 4: N 37° 41.829 W 097° 21.809&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #6:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on a mission for the Admiral to deliver a package. To
where? He did not know. I would find out on my journeys. The
Admiral, being an expert navigator told me where to find more
information. He equipped me with a personal navigation device, a
hand-held GPS receiver. Using this GPS receiver, I was to proceed
to coordinates of N 37º 41.733’ W 097º 21.410’ where I
would meet people of a strange land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the journey to this land and found People of a sort that
I had never seen before. I think they had three legs! But I
couldn’t really tell the difference between their arms from
their legs. They were very friendly. When I confronted them with my
quest, they told me how unfortunate it was that they did not have
the answer I needed. They did know where to send me next, though.
They told me stories of others much like them, the People of the
Shaw. We had a great time telling adventurous stories. In the end,
each Person gave me a token, a strange cube inscribed with symbols
I had never seen before. They told me to go to N 37º 43.288’
W 097º 17.580’ where I would find People of the Shaw much
like them. These, however, would be People of much better
intelligence to aid me in obtaining the knowledge that I sought.
When I met them, I was to give each Person one of these tokens to
prove where I had come from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did as instructed and met more of the strange looking People
of the Shaw. To each Person here I gave a token. After more fun and
stories, they then told me what I needed to know. They told me,
“Look at the number of tokens left in my hands. That is the
number which will be used for the 2007 Backwoods Geocache
Adventure. With intelligence, much can be accomplished.” I
thanked them for their expert information, then continued on my
journeys for the Admiral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #7:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 37° 41.159 W 097° 19.915&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YLU BFCUQNO LUS SDN TLON!&lt;br /&gt;
SDN KUJANQ YLU RNNH FR&lt;br /&gt;
SDN KUJANQ BLUQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #8:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bricks aren’t the only yellow rock Kansas is known for.
Discover the primary composition of this useful rock to uncover the
number needed to finish the coordinates below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 37° 41.460 W 097° _.847&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journey to the coordinates, but beware, or the bells will toll
and you’ll go the way of The Wicked Witch. BOO! Did I scare
you? Quoting some old friends (very old friends), “hope you
guess my name.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #9:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on a mission for the Admiral to deliver a package. To
where? He did not know. I would find out on my journeys. The
Admiral, being an expert navigator told me where to find more
information. He equipped me with a personal navigation device, a
hand-held GPS receiver. Using this GPS receiver, I was to proceed
to coordinates of N 37º 40.766’ W 097º 20.286’ where I
would meet those who would help me on my mission and welcome them
to the great land of Wichita. The Admiral gave me many, many GPS
receivers to give to each of the new recruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to the coordinates and could see them coming, with great
sails high in the air. When they arrived, I saw the duty and honor
in the knights in shining armor as they stood tall and protective,
some on my left and some on my right. I was told that these knights
would join me on my journey. I gave them each a GPS receiver and we
were ready to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These knights and I then ventured to new coordinates of N 37º
43.022’ W 097º 24.456’ where we would be joined with
additional members. At this place I saw creatures of many distant
lands. Those who joined us looked similar to the knights in shining
armor in that they stood tall and orderly, towering over me, but
they wrapped themselves in clothes of living plants. When they all
joined our crew, our numbers almost tripled. I gave them each a GPS
receiver, and we were a fine crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had one more stop to gather our numbers. We traveled then to
new coordinates where we almost lost ourselves in the night with
all of the twists and turns of the pathways. Just as we were about
to turn back, we saw something glowing in the distance. Pursuing
the light, we eventually were greeted by those we had been seeking.
We found ourselves at coordinates of N 37º 41.695’ W 097º
22.240’ where all of the tall people of light agreed to join
us. I did feel so short among so many towering crewmembers. I doled
out the rest of the GPS receivers and we were on our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With such a large number of crewmembers, we changed course and
headed for coordinates of N 37º 41.784’ W 097º 12.856’
where we knew we faced a challenge. This was the land of the
roaring dragons. Our destination was to travel to the other side of
the land of dragons. We found a pathway under the mountain that
would keep us from the need to cross over the forbidden mountain.
As we approached the opening of the tunnel, we knew that not all of
us would make it to the other end. I counted how many were in our
party. We came up with a plan. It would be close. We all decided to
continue anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We entered the dark opening. As we traveled in the tunnel, we
could hear the dragons roaring above. Unexpectedly, our GPS
receivers failed us before we made it to the other side. Which way
were we to go? The dragons continued to roar above the mountain.
The ground vibrated with the roaring. We continued with the plan.
On our way through the tunnel, one by one, someone would make the
sacrifice of staying to hold up the tunnel ceiling, ensuring the
safety for the rest of the crew. And so it was, as we made our trek
through the tunnel, one of our numbers would stay to hold up the
tunnel ceiling. The plan took many of our numbers. Looking back, I
could see the long line of them, tall and proud, to forever support
the tunnel, for us and also for all who would later travel the
tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan took a toll on our numbers, but we did make it to the
other side. I counted how many were left. The rest of our crew had
to stay with the tunnel. These honorable few who made it through
the tunnel, these would be the ones who would stand to be counted
at the end of this journey. They were the tall ones left. Not being
near as tall as any of them, I did not count myself among their
numbers. The number of tall ones who made it through the tunnel,
this is the number to be used for the 2007 Backwoods Geocache
Adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

   AT THE POSTED COORDINATES!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, however, hidden somewhere in Sedgwick County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puzzle will have you visiting places all over the state.
Since my career takes me to diverse places in search of legal
descriptions of deeds, easements, right-of-way, titlework and legal
mumbo-jumbo like that, I decided to share my experiences. Take a
tour of these places so that you will gather the necessary
knowledge that is required to find this geocache. Before you start
your vehicle's engine, be sure you know exactly where you are going
and why, especially why. Otherwise you may waste a considerable
amount of fuel learning tons of information that is totally
irrelevant to the task at hand. Each of these places will help you
find parts of the final coordinates. Visit all of them to get the
completed coordinates of the final location. Let's see where I've
been.&lt;/p&gt;

As we tromped over and around a pack rats newt I stood there thinking that that little sucker has carried the cache home with him, I then looked above my head about 10 foot away, there was that varmint standing on a limb just looking at me, his body was about 8&quot; long plus his tail, (good sized one) so I screamed out at him and said what did you do with the cache container------ He wouldn't answer, he just took out and went up the tree faster than a squirrel travels.  We looked for several more minutes and finally found it.  Excellent Hide... I should have found it sooner because I have some hidden out there that is the same way.
Thanks for the cache.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The posted coordinates are within 10 miles of the true location. This puzzle involves two triangles, one named LAT and one named LONG.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The geocache sits at one corner of the first triangle called LAT. A muggle is 500 feet away from the geocache and to the left, and is at another corner of the triangle called LAT. Another muggle is twice that distance plus 13 more feet away, but to the right of the geocache, and is at the last corner of the triangle called LAT. The muggles happen to be 689 feet apart from each other.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unsuspecting muggles wander aimlessly as they tend to do, and, by chance, start getting closer. Now one of the muggles is 100 feet away to the left of the geocache, and at a corner of the triangle called LONG. The other muggle has wandered to a place that is triple that distance plus 24 more feet away from the geocache and to the right, and is at the last corner of the triangle called LONG. The two muggles are now 351 feet apart.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The geocache is at the corners of each triangle. Find the interior angles of LAT and LONG where the geocache sits, and you will have the geocache's latitude and longitude. Find the geocache before the two muggles accidentally mess it up.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cache container is an ammo box with cammo duct tape all around it. Original contents include two Lewis-and-Clark edition buffalo nickels, two Kansas buffalo quarters, a bracelet hand crafted by Mrs. cantuland, miscellaneous trade items, and an Altoids tin filled with LUCKY PENNIES (and they really have brought me good luck too).

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The geocache is not at the posted coordinates. If you went to
the posted coordinates without reading any of this, then you were
probably looking for the geocache hidden somewhere around a big
&quot;travel bug&quot; and didn't find it. So, since you didn't find it at
the travel bug and are here reading this now, let's get on with the
puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MANTISSA is defined as the fractional part of a floating-point
number...and a floating-point number is an approximate
representation of a real number value in scientific notation,
consisting of a fractional part (mantissa) and an exponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...whatever...It seems as if this puzzle has some useless
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin, let's find the abscissa of the mantissa. At the posted
coordinates you will find &quot;The Great Mantissa&quot;. The abscissa
increases in the cardinal direction that the Mantissa is facing.
The ordinate increases in the cardinal direction to the Mantissa's
left. This will be our arbitrary &quot;User Coordinate System&quot;. Sounds
like a lot of mumbo jumbo to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geocache is at the intersection of three lines. Only two are
needed, any two, but you get three lines so you can check yourself.
The three lines originate from three different points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first line originates from an abscissa of &lt;b&gt;30&lt;/b&gt; and an
ordinate of &lt;b&gt;8,442,038&lt;/b&gt;. On the way from this point of origin
and heading for the geocache, this line will pass through another
point that has an abscissa of &lt;b&gt;26,000&lt;/b&gt; and an ordinate of
&lt;b&gt;8,450,942&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second line originates from an abscissa of &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; and an
ordinate of &lt;b&gt;5,795,222&lt;/b&gt;. The second line passes through a
point that has an abscissa of &lt;b&gt;88,365&lt;/b&gt; and an ordinate of
&lt;b&gt;5,888,000&lt;/b&gt; as it heads for the geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third line originates from an abscissa of &lt;b&gt;1,959,997&lt;/b&gt;
and an ordinate of &lt;b&gt;50&lt;/b&gt; and heads for the geocache while
passing through a point having an abscissa of &lt;b&gt;2,700,000&lt;/b&gt; and
an ordinate of &lt;b&gt;4,036,430&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intersection of the three lines passes through the
coordinates of the geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have calculated the coordinates of the geocache, you
can easily convert the coordinates from our User Coordinate System
into WGS84 Latitude and Longitude coordinates in the typical format
that geocachers are used to dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first (okay, maybe not at first but maybe later) it may look
like some vital information is left out, but I believe you have all
the information you need to solve this mystery of the ABSCISSA OF
THE MANTISSA (said with a loud booming voice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a black ammo box with a
cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides. It is within one mile
of the posted coordinates. Contents include a Sacagawea gold dollar
coin, a Kansas buffalo quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, a
beautiful bracelet hand crafted by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland,
and other miscellaneous trade goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland    </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The posted coordinates are bogus. I picked the center of a
random body of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This geocache requires that you solve &lt;b&gt;THREE&lt;/b&gt; puzzles (with multiple parts for each).
The first is the hard part, very hard, so I don't think you'll find
this geocache. I suggest that you stop reading further right now.
Give it up. It's too hard for you. The second puzzle works off of
the first, and will make you think; it's a toughy too. The last
puzzle is just a &quot;simple&quot; waypoint projection to the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who finds this one is considered by me to be a really
good puzzle solver; it is my honor to have come up with this puzzle
for anyone out there who can pierce through all the puzzle pieces
and come up with &quot;Something From Nothing&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you've been warned. So let's get to figuring out some
coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;** FIRST PUZZLE **&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to this puzzle does not have one, two or four in the
answer. It doesn't have five, six or eight in the answer, nor does
it have three, seven or nine in the answer. Perhaps that leaves you
with nothing, but whatever is left also does not have zero in the
answer. If you still have something left, then delete this
waypoint. Use what you have left to work the second puzzle. What do
you have left? Nothing? Surely there's something left. If you have
nothing from something, then start over. You should end up with
something from nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;** SECOND PUZZLE **&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the many results of the first puzzle (See, I told you that
you would have something.) you will find a road intersection. This
spot is the intersection of &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;th Street West and &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt;th
Street North. You will have to figure out what &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt; and
&lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt; mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's use the results from the first puzzle. &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt; is the 4th
result, 1st result, 7th result, 7th result again, and ending with
the 1st result. Add those together and you have your &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt; you will use the same set of results from the first
puzzle. Likewise, &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt; is the 5th result, 1st result, 6th
result, 2nd result, 3rd result and once again ending with the 1st
result. Add those together and you have your &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is your second puzzle. The answer to the second puzzle is
not an obvious one, even when you have the first part of this
puzzle solved. I wish you luck with this one. In the end, you'll
find that you didn't need to know why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;** THIRD PUZZLE **&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one uses a simple projection from the results of the second
puzzle along with some basic math. Easy as pie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; is a number equal to&lt;br /&gt;
24 times the &quot;road that goes east&quot;,&lt;br /&gt;
whatever that means,&lt;br /&gt;
with 9 more added to that.&lt;br /&gt;
If you should happen to get a number larger than 360,&lt;br /&gt;
then subtract 360 so you have something that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;
(Does any of this make sense?)&lt;br /&gt;
From the results of the second puzzle,&lt;br /&gt;
go on a projection of &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; degrees true with a distance of
0.255 mile&lt;br /&gt;
to get a projected location.&lt;br /&gt;
The geocache you seek is at this projected location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it. You should end up with the coordinates of the
final location. Now go find it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Tribute to &quot;barondriver&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;
If you can't figure out the puzzle, then just go out looking in all
of the likely places where it might be. Does that sound like a
ridiculous alternative? I would have thought so, but I'd suggest
that you tag along with &quot;barondriver&quot;, because he has stumbled upon
at least two of my geocaches without figuring out the final
coordinates! He'll probably find this one the same way. When you're
as good as he is, you just throw out the GPS receiver and blindly
walk directly to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puzzle-cache is going to be a tough one. Hints are now
available. If you need a hint, send me an email and let me know what you
   have tried so far. I'll tell you what's next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a small-sized plastic loc-n-loc container.
Contents include a tiny logbook, a tiny pencil, a few little tiny
glass things, and a beautiful bracelet hand crafted by the
wonderful Mrs. cantuland (a nice three-strand bracelet with
sterling silver beads, a nice bracelet for a really tough
puzzle-cache).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland    </groundspeak:long_description>

Initial items in the jug: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;a bumper sticker;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;red, white and blue beads;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;star pin;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;flag button;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;red, white and blue key tags;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;flag lapel pin;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;flag stickers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also left a camera so you can show us who you are. The area is&lt;br/&gt;shady in spots, so we ask that you try to shoot your picture in the&lt;br/&gt;sun. Map of the area at http://www.gpnc.org/ccpmap.htm Update&lt;br/&gt;11/11/01 Be sure and visit the other cache in this park while you&lt;br/&gt;are here. Checked the cache, since no one has logged our special&lt;br/&gt;Cache prize, a XL Navy blue T-shirt, with an American Flag on it. I&lt;br/&gt;didn't update difficulty to be in line with the new geocaching&lt;br/&gt;standard above. According to it, this would be 2/3/5. Your milage&lt;br/&gt;may vary! In keeping with the cache rules, I took the candy someone&lt;br/&gt;left. Saw that a few had signed the log book, and haven't updated&lt;br/&gt;the geocaching web site yet, must be those closet geocachers!! :) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the oldest caches in Wichita</groundspeak:long_description>

I couldn't believe it; she crossed on a makeshift log footbridge over a muddy waterway; she hunkered down and walked under the low branches; she braved the woods and came out with a tick and a spider.  I thought for a second that she might just lay on the mud and start an army crawl towards the geocache but luckily for her sake (and mine) it didn't come to that. Wow!</groundspeak:text>

Chisholm Trail. Discover the rest of these geocaches listed with
Series #1 at Geocaching.com waypoint number GC19T3P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coordinates take you to one of the Chisholm Trail markers.
This marker seems as if it is hidden away. The only path to it is
from the west down a dirt road. You can't get to it from the
interstate highway. You'll have to take the scenic route. Be
cautious if you try this one when the roads are wet, because this
road shows signs of ruts where the road has tried to swallow
vehicle tires and strand motorists in such a remote location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a geocache that is offset from the marker. From the
posted coordinates project a waypoint to the east (farther down the
dead end). Use a bearing of 91 degrees true and a distance of 0.16
miles. The geocache is at this projection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a clear plastic Loc-N-Loc container.
Contents include a Sacagawea gold dollar coin, a Kansas buffalo
quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition buffalo nickel, a beautiful
bracelet hand crafted by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and other
miscellaneous trade goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland    </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a number search, much like the book of word search
puzzles that you get at the grocery store registers. For your first
number, &lt;b&gt;135&lt;/b&gt;, look for this number in the square of numbers
above and circle it or cross it out. (Hint: top-right) Don't get
too sloppy. Do the same for the following list of numbers. They can
be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, forward and backward. They each
follow a straight line; no curvy squiggly ones. You will have a few
numbers left over that haven't been circled or crossed out. These
numbers, in order from left to right and top to bottom, make up the
coordinates of the final location for this geocache.&lt;/p&gt;

Please observe park rules as posted along your way in. If you ever decide to rent out the buildings for some &quot;event&quot; (as in GEO), tell them that I sent you. They won't know what you are talking about, but it'll make for a good story. This place is easily accessible off the interstate. You can grab a bite to eat on the way from the highway to here, and maybe do some shopping on your way back. (Of course, on the way back; who would want to shop BEFORE finding a geocache?)

setting this cache here. I considered it an interesting place;
perhaps you will too. It's just over a mile south of U.S. Hwy56,
but is accessed from rutted dirt roads, so use caution when
traveling in the rain, because dirt roads become mud roads when
wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a small plastic
container with a speaker magnet attached. Contents include a
Sacagawea gold dollar coin, a Kansas buffalo quarter, a
Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, a beautiful bracelet hand crafted
by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and other miscellaneous trade
goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br /&gt;—cantuland    </groundspeak:long_description>

As we grew up in this community and watching Stanley Engdahl ride in many races, we found it fitting to place a cache here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The museum was started in 2003 as a local tribute to Marquette's own motorcycle racing legend and FIVE TIME National Racing Champion, &quot;Stan the Man&quot; Engdahl.  On display are over 600 trophies Stan won and his legendary Harley Davidson custom-built racing motorcyle he rode during his motorcycle racing career which spanned six decades from the 1940's to the 1990's.  While Stan unfortunately passed away on November 12, 2007, his wife LaVona, continues to be curator for the museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kansas Motorcyle Museum is located on the southeast corner of Washington (the main drag) and Third Street in downtown Marquette, KS.  It is open year round, Monday through Saturday, 10 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., and Sundays, 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  The Museum is also open most holidays, but please call ahead to make sure someone is there.  The museum is handicap accessible.  ADMISSION IS FREE, BUT DONATIONS ARE ALWAYS WELCOME.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You do not have to enter the museum to find the cache, but if you have time to tour the museum, it is well worth your time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small pill bottle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Permission has been granted to place the cache in this location.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is placed with permission of the Park Manager and should be a quick park and grab. If the office is open please take the time to visit with the helpful staff as they can point out several areas and trails that are well worth seeing. If you haven't already, you will need to purchase a State Park permit. You may purchase either a daily or yearly permit as you will need this to stop and retrieve the many caches located in the park and on the trails. As always replace the cache as found and enjoy the area. </groundspeak:long_description>

Having just been burned off should be highly visible and a quick park and grab. Do not I repeat Do not attempt after a rain until the road has had time to dry. There is a sign stating you will be fined $500.00 for damaging the road. Bring your pen and replace as found so the next cacher has the same challenge.

Easy access, mowed location. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container is a magnetic keyholder. You will need to bring your own writing instrument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 477 at the cache location was moved here in 1955. The engine was built in 1901 at the Baldwin Locomotive Works. The engine is one of the 1600 series, the most powerful engines of their day. This engine was originally engine 1697. It was reconfigured into a simple two cylinder engine, renumbered 477 and sent to the plains states as mainline power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On July 4th 1955 this engine made its final run from Junction City to Salina. Three weeks later it was moved from the roundhouse to its retirement here in Kenwood Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you can see this is a Micro so if you do not like a small cache you may want to filter this one out, although you would miss out on a nice park and a little history.</groundspeak:long_description>

You will be traveling on gravel, sand, dirt, grass roads, and &lt;br/&gt;even a few steep hills to climb and go down. You might want to trade your car for a Jeep, or just ride a mountain goat. If it is raining or the roads are wet, Don’t Go.  &lt;br/&gt;I hope no one gets lost, but if you do, don’t call me, call 911 and give them your coordinates and &lt;br/&gt;within a day or two they will find you! All jokes aside, you will see some beautiful country, deer and other animals.  You will pass by many electric wind farms that are being built in some of the areas, quite interesting.  So happy hunting and be careful, and most of all, be discrete.  There are a lot of muggers in the area, like animals and a few humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Practice stealth if warranted, and rehide the cache as you find it so the next person can have the same challenge.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you and good luck.</groundspeak:long_description>

As always be safe and enjoy the challenges placed before you with a smile.  Checking the attributes may help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please sign and date the log sheet only and no tradable items.

If it is raining or the roads are wet, Don’t Go.  &lt;br/&gt;I hope no one gets lost, but if you do, don’t call me, call 911 and give them your coordinates and &lt;br/&gt;within a day or two they will find you! All jokes aside, you will see some beautiful country, deer and other animals.  You will pass by many electric wind farms that are being built in some of the areas, quite interesting.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Take a short hike in a great historical local park. You can approach this cache several ways. You are looking for a regular cache in a green ammo can, with trade items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About a hundred years ago a small company was built in the town north of this cache by a man named C. L. Brown. This little company (telephone exchange) later became known as Sprint, now Sprint Nextel. This park is a gift to the community of Abilene from the man who became successfull building that company and this park is named not for him but his parents. The Brown Memorial Park currently includes a retirement home, a small camp with cabins you can rent ( it used to be a girls camp ) and the local council boy scout camp. It at one time had a grist mill, small lake for swimming fishing and boating and zoo. The Brown Foundation continues to maintain the park and home and they both have some interesting history. C. L. Brown and Family members are buried just next of the boy scout camp. This cache is in memory of my Dad who I spent lots of time fun times here. My dad for many years served on the Brown Foundation Board, he loved this place. You could find this cache from several approaches. You can get to it by trail (except the last 100 ft or so) or you could do some &quot;field work&quot; or be brave and bushwack most of the way. Close to the cache is an area that used to be used for camp outs. Look for the ammo can nearby. It contains some trade items, including a flash light for FTF. Please hide well, even though this may seem remote, this area is heavily used by the local teens (myself included but thats ancient history). </groundspeak:long_description>

During high water this area still can become an island but the park long ago stopped pumping water into the lake area which is now a milo field. You are looking for a od green cookie tin with the usual log book and trade items. There is a new camo cap for ftf. After you find the cache go ahead and take the rest of the nature trail its a great walk in the woods and there are some interesting historical points along the way.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a small container with small trade items. North east of the cache location you will notice a silo that the owner has painted with the American Flag and if you leave headed east you will see the Statue of Liberty on the east side of the silo. I talk with the owner and she said she started painting with a 20 ft ladder than switched to a 40 ft. ladder and than moved that ladder into the back of a wrecker. She than got the use of a bucket truck from a friend with which she finished her project. &lt;br/&gt;I think you will have to admit this is an impressive piece of art completed by an impressive lady. &lt;br/&gt;The cache is located on public property but I did get premission from the land owner so she would be aware of why people would be &lt;br/&gt;stopping.</groundspeak:long_description>

Those entering the property for the purpose of Geocaching are permitted to enter and park at the northern most entry and stay to the north.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a sealed, red, plastic, outdoor box filled with items that entertain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: We do have dogs, mostly indoor, but they are often let out untethered.  One is a pit bull and the other a toy cocker spaniel, both of which love car rides (just ask our UPS man) so keep your doors closed.  Neither dogs have a history of aggression but come at your own risk.</groundspeak:long_description>

Out caching on a nice day and found this cache hidden in the area and is only the second cache in OpenCaching that I have found. It is a nice neat container.
Thanks for the hide.

The house was built in 1900, and there is a plaque in the attic that says it was started May 3. According to stories handed down the house cost $2600 to build, and the guy that had it built went bankrupt shortly after because of that.I lived in the house until I was 25, when we built the home we live in now. My brother and I still own the house along with 80 acres of ground on the west side of the road, and we own 120 acres on the east side where the pond and my multi-cache, &quot;Overlook the Obvious&quot; is located&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a 30 cal. ammo can. It should be pretty easy to spot, as there is little or no muggle activity here. Cache started with a log book, pencil, several pens, and miscellaneous swag. There is a ready made micro cache for whomever wants it. I won't call it a FTF prize, but if the first to find wants to take it that is fine. Whomever takes it does not need to trade anything, All other finders please trade even, trade up, or don't trade.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is located along a seemingly little-known trail
called the Yankton Lake Loop. It can be reached from the North or
the South, the hike from the north is a little more difficult but
not terribly so. Access from the south begins at Chief White Crane
campground.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;While camping at Chief White Crane, we noticed a small
hand-written sign referring to the &quot;Yankton Lake Loop&quot; (4.5 miles
by the way) and asked one of the park employees for a map. No such
map exists.. We took it upon ourselves then, to walk the trail one
morning and find where it would come out on the other end. Along
the way, we enjoyed the scenery and wildlife and found it odd that
no geocaches had been placed along this trail (even though there
are several in the campground). We marked a likely spot, came back
the next day to check our coordinates and dropped off a mid-sized
Lock-N-Lock. Initial contents were: logbook, pencil, rain poncho,
calculator, small multi-tool, retractable cell-phone charger, CITO
bag and a Moose TB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No guarantees on the winter friendliness of this cache, the hike
to the cache may be pretty long if you're not dressed for the
cold.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On July 7, 2007, I married my wife (Mrs. IgottaFind) at the Olivet
United Methodist Church not too far from this location.&lt;br /&gt;
The sign says that the population of Olivet is 70. My wedding more
than doubled the population that day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is to remember the day I became the happiest man on
earth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I placed this cache with my father-in-law.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I visit this town 2 - 3 times a year to visit my in-laws.&lt;br /&gt;
This is a nice little town; I enjoy my visits here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I first came here, I wondered, where is the College
Stadium?&lt;br /&gt;
I now know that the stadium is the football field at the school and
I am to understand that there was once a college in the town.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache location is on the south side of the road.&lt;br /&gt;
Please be stealthy with locating, retrieving and returning the
cache container.&lt;br /&gt;
You may park near the intersection; this is not a very busy town.
Remember to obey traffic laws.&lt;br /&gt;

Of these Westerns were loved by both young and old. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gunsmoke was one of these programs running from 1952-1961. The show followed Matt Dylan sheriff of Dodge City,Kansas. Miss Kitty,Chester, and Doc were always heard with Matt setting the law right. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The surrounding area could well have been traveled through by the cattlemen and homesteaders. There is no room for a writing instrument so BYOP. Use caution while looking for this cache as there are some treacherous areas which could lead to severe injury or worse depending on the weather conditions. This cache is not winter friendly.&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: Some areas may give way, there Is lose soil. And you do not need to climb fences.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">During the golden age of radio, many of the popular programs were the mysteries. Each one brought its own spin to the life of a gumshoe or an undercover good guy. With a sidekick or a dame to share along in the adventure, most aired 30 minutes once each week usually with a mention to stay tuned next week, cliff hanging the program and keeping the audience wanting more.  As today stations like ABC, CBS, NBC or the NBC Blue Network made their money on the commercials however, many were incorporated into the shows directly through the actors and actresses promoting them. Sponsors ranging from body soaps, floor cleaning products, toothpastes, menswear, and unlike today both beer and cigarette companies were major advertisers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cases of Sherlock Holmes were brought to life over 220 episodes. Running in the US from October of 1939 and to July 1947, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson would find adventures, solve the mystery and take you back for a half hour every Monday evening, from 8:30 -9:00 p.m. Originally broadcast from NBC's Blue Network, it later moved to the Mutual Broadcasting System starting in Hollywood and moving out to New York City and was sponsored by Bromo Quinine and Petri Wine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To locate this cache you will need to use your noodle, think like a gumshoe and deduce where the likeliest place for the cache to be located. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: Please remember to cache at your own risk. Be respectful of the area and remember to CITO.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please put all the components back after you are finished and re-apply camouflage as needed.

It's not easy to find a place in town to hide one.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located near the English Coulee and is loaded with good swag.  It is located between 2 clearings off of the paved path.  This area could get a bit overgrown and there are some hidden logs and branches in the growth so you may want to watch your step.  It can be accessed from the North or South clearning.  The North Clearing will be the easier route.  You may hit some thorns if you come from the South clearing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All the parking nearby is by permit only.  Depending on the time of year this can be a very busy area.  Please be stealthy and take the time to rehide the cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was listed on GC.COM on 6/30/09 with GC# GC1VC47.  This is not a new cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

Welcome
to the Short Bus Stop!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; Before we get underway, please
observe the following Rules of
Conduct while
riding the short bus.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Do not sing &quot;the
wheels on the bus go round and round...&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not speak to the driver
while the bus is in motion (they have enough to do, including
watching all five mirrors, two dozen    
windows, eight gauges, six warning lights, six dozen faces, two
lanes of traffic and still keep a third eye open for wobbling
bicycles and daydreaming pedestrians, especially teenagers wearing
headsets who are in another world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your hands and arms
inside the bus at all times - you know the
story...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your hands to your
self, but also keep them north of the equator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't eat your stinky food
or chew gum on the bus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Those are the rules of
the short bus which will stop at this short bus stop. Everything
else goes. If you can't follow the rules&lt;br /&gt;
and play nice with
others, then just move along and find another
cache.&lt;br /&gt;
If you agree, then sit
back, relax, and enjoy the ride.</groundspeak:long_description>

afraid my dear geocachers.  Sit back, relax, and learn about
our friendly neighbor, the Bumble Bee...and set your eyes on the
biggest one you will EVER SEE! &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lets
learn a little about Bumble Bees shall we?&lt;br /&gt;
Fun Facts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bumble
bees do not produce enough honey for commercial use, just a few
grams at a time to feed their young&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all
bumble bees have a sting. Drones (smaller male bees that hatch in
mid summer ) have no sting at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bumble
bees are much less aggressive than honey bees. Generally they will
not attack a human at all, unless their life is under threat. Don't
wave your arms wildly in their presence, stand quietly and once
they smell you are not a flower with pollen they will move gently
away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bumble
bees do not lose their sting and die if they use it, as a honey bee
will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Head on over to this cache and look around.  You will be
amazed!  Bring your camera.  You will want to take
pictures!&lt;br /&gt;
You will be looking for a bison tube camoed to its natural
surroundings.  The real prize is when you look
around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When you find it, buzz on in to the store where you will see how
they did it.  Above the register playing on the
monitor is a short video on the making of it.  Be sure to
let them know how much you enjoyed their hard
work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You will want to bring the kids to this one, and since it is
seasonal, the attraction for this cache will be gone by the end of
October, or sooner, so be sure to log this cache this
summer!&lt;br /&gt;

co-ordinates above do not take you to the

&lt;br /&gt;
This
cache is a dedication to one of my favorite classic authors and one
of the most popular of his writings...The Raven.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The
Raven is a narrative poem published by American writer EdgarAllan
Poe in the year 1845. It is famous for its eerie supernatural
atmosphere, as well as its musicality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The poem takes place in the narrator's home, where he is reading
forgotten lore to try to get his mind off of his lost love, Lenore.
He is distracted from his studies by a rapping at his door, so he
gets up to see what it is. When he finds no one there, he hears a
rapping at his window, and opening it, is surprised by a raven. The
narrator questions the raven in his surprise, and is startled to
hear it answer &quot;nevermore.&quot; Thus begins the night time adventure
you won't soon forget.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our hope is that you enjoy the cache and then delve into the
writings of this great author. The raven is definitely a poem we
would recommend to friends, along with all of Poe's works. Whether
one wants a better understanding of classic American literature of
this period, or just a good poem, The Raven is an excellent
choice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To solve this puzzle, all you need to do is read The Raven. If you
don't have a&lt;br /&gt;
copy handy, you can go to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibiblio.org/ebooks/Poe/Raven.pdf&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to download
it. Match the correct answers with the proper co-ordinates and this
will lead you to the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located at N49 48.ACB  W97 04.DEF.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A) Published by the Evening
Mirror in 1845, 'The Raven' was a sensation, and Poe became a

&lt;br /&gt;
0 = &quot;Twas the night before Christmas and all through the
house&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
1 = &quot;Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and

6 = Lenore &lt;br /&gt;
7 = Nora     &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
C) While in the chamber,
besides 'Nevermore', what other word did the raven
utter?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
0 =  He didn't say anything

1 =  He said more than one other word &lt;br /&gt;

3 = 
Sorrow                                        &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
D) When the Raven begins
tapping the man in the poem goes and opens the door...no one is
there. Where is the Raven?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

mat       &lt;br /&gt;
1 = in the chamber
          &lt;br /&gt;

3 = on the
window lattice                      &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
E) At the end
of the poem in what state is the character in the
poem?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4 = his soul is
swinging on the door &lt;br /&gt;
5 = he cannot complete a
chore      &lt;br /&gt;
6 =his soul
is floating on the floor       &lt;br /&gt;

7 = he is eating more and more &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
F) In the end,
the Raven settles onto this place, and never moves from there.
Where is this place?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
0 = In the fire place
ablaze              &lt;br /&gt;

1 = On the loose bust of
Zeus         &lt;br /&gt;
2 = On the pallid bust of
Pallas &lt;br /&gt;
3 = On the crumbly bust of
Mr. Lee   &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That's it.  That's all you have to do.  There is an
unactivated Trackable
Adventure Guide (TAG) for the lucky first to find Geocacher. 
This is our first puzzle cache.  Happy caching!&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations on ertyu for being the first to
find!&lt;br /&gt;

This clock, however, in this lovely little rest area has long ago stopped working and has since lost it's hands. This area, where you can find the clock with no hands, is a place where time has stopped. The clock no longer tells time, therefore, imagine if you will....what if time is no longer measured here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What could that mean for you? Endless lunch hours......time to walk in this park.....no more hurrying to meet your daily schedules. If the day seems to be closing in, and you have lost track of all time, come and find this cache, and stay a while. Check out a book at your nearest library, curl up on one of the benches and listen to the birds sing.  After all, time stands still while you are here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Half our life is spent trying to find something to do with the time we have rushed through life trying to save.

We had both already found this cache through gc.com but went and signed the log so we could log ourselves as FTF's under this listing.

Enjoyed finding this one... again. :)</groundspeak:text>

Path is in need of a cache since the last one here has been gone for a while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If caching at Night bring your GeoFriend and flashlights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a small tupperware container and contains only log and pencil. Room for trade items, but I will have to place some in there in the coming week. Should be fairly quick, hopefully no need for stealth but people do use the path. Parking may be an issue as cache is a fair distance from any street access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache Created by: 1purplemonkeydishwasher1 @ Geocaching.com&lt;br/&gt;Cache Hidden: 01/16/2010</groundspeak:long_description>

Last time the GPSr was swinging back and forth between the far side of the railway tracks and the far side of the river. Today was a lot better, but it was still giving me results that differed by 10m (even tho the accuracy was rated at 3m). Finally just approximated the middle and started looking for likely spots (and telltale signs of geocaching. Spotted it fairly quickly.

I wasn't even going to give this one a third try except one of the puzzle caches ended not far from here.

The reason for the name is that my wife (Magenta) and I have the bird's eye view of the cache, and look forward to watching other cachers run around aimlessly. (If you see a flash go off, that's us taking a picture from the west, which we'll post here.) NOTE: My wife and I bought a house, and are no longer watching over your shoulders at this cache&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch for muggles everywhere during the weekday, working hours.

Located at the centre of a very busy street, the memorial can easily be seen from a great distance in both directions on Provencher Boulevard.  It is familiar not only to the Belgian community and residents of St. Boniface, but also to citizens throughout the city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This monument occupies its original site placed here in 1938.  The only alterations have been the addition of plaques to commemorate later wars.  This war memorial also represents the last surviving Hubert A. Garnier war monument in Winnipeg.&lt;br/&gt;You will be looking for a well hidden lock and lock container.  Please use stealth as there are hundreds of vehicles passing by at any given time.  Cache contains logbook, writing stick, and a first to find pin for the eager beaver cachers.  Please be CAREFUL retrieving and placing the cache back from where it came. Place it back EXACTLY as you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to grey4runner making this his 3rd FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

Good walk to get to it. Cache is micro so you will need to BYOP. Room for small trade items. Remember, CITO.
