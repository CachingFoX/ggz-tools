During dry weather this pond is completely dry, but after a good
rain it fills up nicely. Either way, there are interesting rocks
and trees along the trail, as well as excellent chances to see some
wildlife. We hope you enjoy your walk through this nice and

I've found three caches in this area recently but never turned left rather than right from the trail head. It was odd to find myself, according to my GPS, searching for this cache in the middle of a lake. Nothing but blue for yards around apparently! [:)]

I'll have to come back here after a big rainstorm to see if Mapsource is correct.

Two new caches in this new greenbelt this week - one either side of the creek. The roads look like they are coming very close to the creek on this side - don't know how much greenbelt will be left in the end.

I agree the adjacent large natural feature does look old. At least a couple of hundred years, likely more.

Nice straightforward find and I didn't get lost - both plus points!

I wimped out and went out this morning - another beautiful day, not a cloud in the sky. Must have seen fifty deer as I hiked through the park.

Checked it again at 10:00 when the rain had stopped and as nobody had logged it yet thought I'd give it a go. The trails to the cache site are well drained and it was easy to avoid the muddy spots; but it was cold - particularly the wind chill! Took my hands 15 minutes to thaw out when I got back to the car. Very nice cache and good location. Looks like new entrances are opening up to this greenbelt although I got completely Mapsourced (again) on my way here and had to back track all the way to Slaughter.

Wasn't surprised to see Ed's name in the log and anybody who came out in that rain deserves the FTF! [:)]

Not surprisingly the adjacent creek was in full flow and the whole area is looking very verdant.

&lt;p&gt;It is a fairly large container with lot's of goodies for the
kids. Start at the trail-head coordinates and follow the
double-track trail all the way to the end. Update: It is getting a
little more difficult to discern the double-track, so follow the
path of least resistance. When you get about 250 ft. away, you may
be tempted to veer left, but it is better to veer right along the
rock pile. There is also a nice playground and picnic area to enjoy
near the trail-head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please note:&lt;/b&gt; There is a bee-hive in the area along the
trail, so it's probably a good idea to not let your dogs or kids
run loose off the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please re-hide well.&lt;/p&gt;

Area which is located near the east runway at Austin-Bergstrom
International Airport. Nearly one acre has been set aside to
provide a vantage point for watching planes land and take off on
the airport's 9,000 foot east runway. This viewing spot offers a
paved parking area and picnic tables, so take a snack or meal and
enjoy the view. The Family Viewing Area is at the end of Golf
Course Road, which is on the south side of Hwy 71 East and just
east of the airport's entrance. Recommended viewing times when the
most flights are landing and taking off include mornings from 6-11
a.m., afternoons from 1:30-3 p.m., and evenings beginning around
7:30 p.m. If there are muggles present, you will need to use
extreme stealth while searching for and replacing the cache. If you
have a scanning radio or other air band radio, you can listen to
the flight controllers and pilots on the following frequencies:
&lt;p&gt;Tower (East): 121.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tower (West): 118.225&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ground: 121.7 and/or 121.9&lt;/p&gt;

Picking up my son from the airport, arrived a little early, so I decided to grab this cache. No muggles to speak of, although a couple of cars came and went from the TxDOT Avaition facility across the street while I was in the area. The most difficult aspect of this cache was crossing over Hwy 71 to get back to the airport.

Bit of a ghost-town out here with the deserted golf course. What's going to happen to that?

Our nearby cache &quot;Coming and Going&quot; used to be a travel bug hotel,
but due to landscaping changes we had to make it a micro. But we
thought to ourselves, there's a Hilton near the airport for people,
so there ought to be a Hilton near the airport for travel bugs. So
this is that cache. It may not be as fancy as the other Hilton, but
it is a convenient stopover place for those traveling bugs. When
you're in the area, be sure to drive to the end of the road and
check out the airport viewing area. Nearly one acre has been set
aside to provide a vantage point for watching planes land and take
off on the airport's 9,000 foot east runway.

    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes being so far from home I really miss having family around, but over the years I have learned to make my own 'family'. Good friends can be hard to find, so I consider myself lucky to have a new friend named Wayne. Thanks to Wayne and Candy, I stuck with Geocaching long enough to love it AND meet a lot of new friends!&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Wayne is one of the really special people in this world who would 'give you the shirt off his back' and he has, literally!!! Some really special moments for me are the time he called me to go to a newly posted cache, way out in the middle of nowhere, that was posted by an 'unknown' cacher. He personally drove over 100 miles out of his way so he could escort Julie and I to that cache and make sure we would be safe being the 'firsts to find it'. Another time, he took me caching all day in San Antonio and made sure to open the car door for me EVERY TIME when I got in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wayne is an awesome role model in my life as he dotes on his wife candy, too. It's obvious to all of us how much they adore one another. They are just plain 'good people' and I am so happy to add them to my list of family. Wayne, I salute you and thank you, thank you, thank you!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanya&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have made friends who you love like (or better than) family, write about someone who has changed your life for the better, by being your friend! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: There is a bonus cache for this series, GCJQG8. Be sure to read about it before you hunt this one!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

caches are in this series, yet!  As we are in the process of
placing them all now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our series begins in Dick

seven caches, even though you may notice some appear to be OUT of
the park, the first 7 are accessible from the park, the 8th is a
little further away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TSETSE SISTERS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsetse Sisters derive their
name from the noise they make when caching.  The name itself
means first finders in Geo-slang.  Tsetse range in size from a
6-16, are robust in form and can cause severe frustration to other
wannabe first finders.  A tsetse sister can find twice as many
caches in a single day as regular male cachers.&lt;/p&gt;

Was out and about picking up Queen Zelda's latest cache when this popped up. It was right on my route home - so what could I do? I had no option but to go for FTF...

Just one more of the Tsetse caches to get. Hasn't shown up yet - Prime Approver is building the suspense...

My strategy paid off (well - a little bit) managed to head the Tushes off at the pass by heading round the loop in the wrong direction and cutting across to this one before they got there.

It is a night time only cache that requires a bright flashlight for each adventurer. Once you reach the coordinates, shine your light around until you spot the first Lightning Bug that will guide you along the correct path. All the Lightning Bugs will be the same color, until you reach the site you seek. At that point you should see three Lightning Bugs of a different color, guiding you to your final destination. It can be tricky to find your way back out of the forest at night, so be sure to turn on your gps unit's tracking function before you head out!

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Congratulations, you have stumpled upon the &quot;Go Log
   Yourself!&quot; Cache Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are NOT sure how many
caches are in this series, yet!  As we are in the process of
placing them all now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our series begins in Dick
Nichols Park in SW Austin.  We parked there for the first
seven caches, even though you may notice some appear to be OUT of
the park, the first 7 are accessible from the park!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TSETSE SISTERS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsetse Sisters derive their
name from the noise they make when caching.  The name itself
means first finders in Geo-slang.  Tsetse range in size from a
6-16, are robust in form and can cause severe frustration to other
wannabe first finders.  A tsetse sister can find twice as many
caches in a single day as regular male cachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The name tsetse is derived
from the noise these flies make when flying. The name itself means
&quot;fly&quot; in Tswana.  Tsetse range in size from 6-14mm and are
robust in form and can cause sleeping sickness in humans.  A
tsetse fly can drink twice its weight in blood at every
meal.)&lt;/p&gt;

If the square root of Pythagoras is x and the train is traveling at y mph towards a station where a boy who had z crumpets for tea last February is standing facing due West then what is the probability of me finding a cache on a Tuesday morning in September?

Well, I worked this out by experimentation and, as it turns out, after some trial and error the answer is 100% - Yeah!!

This brightened up an otherwise dull morning. Had a mega conference call and wasn't sure I was going to get off it soon enough to beat Inspector Gadget to the cache! (Sorry Dan)

Yet another part of this 'Yet another greenbelt' that I hadn't seen before. How much more of this is there? I assume this is the other side of the creek from the exercise trail leading to Dick Nichols park. Certainly didn't know there was an entrance here.

Coordinates needed some creative cache finding! I bushwhacked WAY more than I needed to of course.

machines that have had a tremendous impact on our entire lives, and
without which Geocaching probably would not exist. We are talking
about the IBM PC, which is 25 years old this year, and the Apple
Computer, which will be 30 years old next year. (See the link above
for more information.) The cache is starting off with all computer
related items such as memory, modems, cables, a router, etc.,
(they're not brand new, but they work) and we would like to keep
that theme going, so if you trade, please leave a similar item.
(Birthday cards and Travel Bugs are OK, too.) 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: As of 02/23/08 someone took our large container and all
it's computer swag, so we decided to replace it with a small
Rubbermaid container in hopes that it will be left alone. It now
only has room for very small items.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The posted coordinates are for parking. There is a nice trail
into the woods from here. If a computer were to tell you where to
find the cash, it might say:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

8:10am on a Saturday!
Ah, the age of technology. Did it really begin with the IBM PC and Bill Gates? I think I'm going to have to go back to bed, lie down and pull the sheets over my head until the panic attacks calm down...

You can blame my kids for this FTF - it posted after I'd powered down last night and I wouldn't expect to surface until MUCH later than 8:00am. However, I had a secret weapon, the kids got up early to go help a friend move house and, being kids, weren't quite as quiet as church mice when they left. As a Brit, once I'm woken in the morning I have to get a cup of tea [i]immediately[/i] and just thought I'd check the computer.... 

An email from gc.com? Tea is immediately forgotten and, as they say, the rest is history.

Thanks for bringing me here, the parking spot was about a quarter of a mile from the house but, even though we've lived here over 11 years, I didn't know this trail existed.

It's interesting how it starts off as a rough trail and then suddenly you stumble across some very neat and tidy walking trails, presumably created by the nearby homeowners. Then reverts to rough trail again. Saw no birds but, to be honest, I wasn't really looking - just had the cache on my mind....

T - Green Jeep TB (I was just thinking last night that I hadn't seen one of these in the wild yet)

L - Signature carabiner (right on top of the cache so you see it straight away, must have been feeling cruel this morning [:)] )

If you've done a few Austin caches then you'll walk up to these immediately - however if you are newbie a couple will have you scratching your head!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a Stargate Cache that can be used to transport Travel Bugs
from Central Texas to another Stargate Port listed on this page.
Parking coords are: N 30 12.931 W 097 51.783 or you can park at
Dick Nichols lot across the street. All cachers welcome!!! Cache is
.15 miles from parking coords. Stay on trail till 70 feet from
cache. Container is an ammo can.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 
Put simply, any travel bug
arriving at a Stargate TB Cache is rapidly transported via WORMHOLE
at WARP speed to another Stargate TB Cache for eventual pickup.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a TB is left
at this cache (ammo can) with a valid Stargate address, the TB will
be transported to that specified Stargate TB
Cache (for example: if
“P3898” is included in the log entry or on a physical
note attached to the TB, that TB will arrive at the Stargate P3898
TB Cache). If the TB is left without a
valid Stargate address, or has an invalid address, it will be
transported to a cache that best advances its goal (in the cache
owner’s opinion).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Anyone interested in establishing a Stargate TB Cache that’s
at least 500 miles from any other Stargate TB Cache please
contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:devin.ross@verizon.net&quot;&gt;drossdross&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(*) TBs traveling overseas, or to other countries, may
require multiple wormhole trips to intermediate Stargates to
complete their mission. Additionally, a Zero Point Module (ZPM) may
be required. Logistics to arrange multiple trips and/or to secure a
ZPM may take several weeks or more. If the TB’s Commanding
Officer (i.e., owner) does not want the TB to volunteer for such a
lengthy, long-distance mission, just quickly contact the owner of
originating Stargate TB Cache (me, drossdross, for P4079) and they
will revoke the TB’s travel orders - and reassign the TB to
local support duties (i.e., redirect the TB to local
caches).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this cache is themed to
Travel Bugs, there is also a log and trading goodies in order to
welcome all
geocachers.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I hate how fast Austin is growing. Paving parking lots everywhere
we look! 
&lt;p&gt;One cool thing about South Austin is that in spite of it all,
these really cool little greenbelt, walking parks are popping up
everywhere! Even where you least expect them. I caught this one out
of the corner of my eye on the South Mopac flyover heading home and
thought, &quot;Hey look there's a place for a new cache!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here ya go Julie and my south austin pals and all my other

More than one way into this area - and I picked the wrong one through some incredibly sticky mud. Took me longer to get the mud off my shoes (had to do it - it made me too tall to get into the car) than to find the cache.

&lt;p&gt;The treasure chest is starting out with the following trade
items: sidewalk chalk, a wind-up helicopter, a magnifying glass,
needle-nose pliers, 2 small race cars, glow-in-the-dark shoe-laces,
a magnetic locker mirror, a locker organizer, and for the
first-to-find, an aluminun beverage container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an easy walk, but it gets a little tricky right near the
cache, so watch the little ones. Enjoy the area, and please re-hide
the treasure well.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway, for once 'X' really did mark the spot and the treasure chest willingly gave up its booty.

Met Golden Bear at the cache site - chatted for a while and warned her about my difficulties with Sunset View. I'm sure she didn't need any help as everyone else but me seems to have found it easily! I'm just having a bad-cache day I think (not enough hair for a bad hair day anymore)...

This is a small cylinder with camo tape, well hidden in a cute little unknown park in SW Austin/Oak Hill.

 
&lt;p&gt;

The park is in need of some TLC as you will see when you get there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

There are very few trails and lots of ups and downs to traverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  This is an old limestone quarry from way back when. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Prisoners cut limestone from here that was later used to build the Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

I would love to nominate this park for a Trash in Trash Out event this spring! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Have fun!!! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tanya &lt;/p&gt;

Took a while to spot - there are a million possible hiding places!

I can confirm that there are some dirty scratches in the log in the FTF slot which could be interpreted as TXBigfoot's if you squint and use your imagination! [:)]

Also found your TC cache in the same park Tanya - thanks!</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE LISTED COORDINATES ARE
BOGUS&lt;/b&gt;. To find the cache, you've got to turn your attention
northward and put your thinking cap on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; AND  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
We're bringing a little of Washington right here to Austin, Texas!
This is a two-stage Texas geocache working in tandem with a
two-stage Washington geocache. To find Stage 1, you must learn a
few things about our neighbors to the north. To find Stage 2, you
must partner with them online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;b&gt;STAGE ONE&lt;/b&gt;



&lt;br/&gt;
 In order to find this cache, you need to answer the quiz
below about Washington State.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;u&gt;The Quiz&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  What is the state capital?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  What is the state tree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  What is the state bird? (hint, American
is NOT in the answer, answer is 2 words)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.  What is the state fruit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.  What is the state song?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.  What is the state fish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;u&gt;The Coordinates&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
OK, now here's how you turn these answers into your Stage 1
coordinates:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;use the key below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The Stage 1 latitude is &lt;b&gt;N 30°&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;14.&lt;/b&gt; (#
of letters in answer 1 minus 7)  (# of letters in answer 2
minus 7)  (# of letters in answer 3 minus 7)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Stage 1 longitude is: &lt;b&gt;W 097° 54.&lt;/b&gt; (# of
letters in answer 4)  (# of letters in answer 5 minus
12)  (# of letters in answer 6 minus 10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The Stage 1 cache is a redirector containing only one piece of
information- the longitude and latitude of Stage 2. Just one
problem: While the longitude is for the Texas second stage, the
latitude is for the second stage in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;b&gt;STAGE TWO&lt;/b&gt;



&lt;br/&gt;
All right, Texans- now it's time to team up with your fellow
geocachers in the north. You're going to have to trade latitudes to
find Stage 2. Here's how you do it:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
1. Take a look below for notes anyone in Washington may have posted
to this website requesting a partner to exchange latitudes with. If
you find someone, click on their user name to get to their profile
page, then email them via geocaching.com and arrange the trade
between yourselves.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
2. If you fail to find any such notes, you can post one yourself on
our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OXZTVY&quot;&gt;counterpart cache page in Washington&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully,
someone in Washington who needs an Texan partner will read your
note and contact you via geocaching.com. You may have to wait a bit
for this, of course.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
3. If you've waited more than three weeks without finding a
partner, please contact the Washington cache owner, and she will
give you the second-stage latitude. (Of course, we could give you
the number ourselves, but that wouldn't be in keeping with the
spirit of this 'partner' geocache!)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;



&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT
NOTES&lt;/b&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Please do not post premature &quot;found it!&quot; notes. If you post a
&quot;found it!&quot; note before completing Stage 2, your note will be
deleted (after fair warning, of course).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Also, please remove any partner-seeking notes you post on the
Washington cache page after you've found a partner. Otherwise,
you'll keep getting contacted, and folks up there will be
frustrated by the clutter of old notes. Whenever we find outdated
notes on these two cache pages, we will remove them.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Finally, please don't post any coordinates on either of these cache
pages. Posts that include coordinates will be deleted as soon as
they are discovered. The cache is a standard ammo can, stocked full
of all kinds of Washington goodies, sent directly from our caching
counterparts. In order to keep the cache fully loaded -- &lt;b&gt;please
try and bring TEXAS (or Austin) items to trade&lt;/b&gt;, so that we can
keep their cache loaded with just as much cool stuff from the Lone
Star State! There is a ziploc bag for placing your Texas items
into; please do not remove any items from that bag- only take the
(very cool) Washington items in trade.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please also take care to replace it (and its camo) exactly as you
found it, so that we can avoid detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Initial contents of the Washington
cache include:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;key chains, stickers,
postcards, playing cards, magnets, whistles, etc.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Initial contents of the Texas
cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;key chains, stickers,
postcards, magnets, etc.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Please give credit to the
idea behind the creation of this cache to TEXAS GAL, where ever she
may be, we miss you, darlin, and would love to have you back in
Texas soon!]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I have to admit that this is NOT my kind of hide location and I likely wouldn't have gone if I'd known what it was. Once I was there though I couldn't chicken out and had to try it. It wasn't the finding that was the problem - it was getting away from the cache site afterwards that I found really difficult. Even though he sniped the coordinate trading Stratman deserves the FTF. There's NO way I'd have attempted this in the dark and/or wet. Curtis - you are truly insane! (and I mean that in the nicest way...[;)]

Also, Curtis, how did you manage to park 300ft away? Nearest parking I could find was 0.25 mile. Off-roading, heh? [:)]

Be sure to go check out the view after finding the cache. The terrain level reflects &quot;Ground Zero&quot; and not the trail itself. 

The cache is a camoed match container. You do not have to remove the cache from it's hiding spot. Please, just remove the lid. The cache is log only. You will need to bring your own pen. Remember the log is pretty small, so please sign the pages front AND back.

We chose this spot after we stumbled upon it by accident. It was sunset and the view was gorgeous with a nice breeze. We figured we should share it with more people. Its a shame that there aren't more people frequenting this park.

This area seems like a good place to launch a kayak or canoe.
You do not have to enter the private property nearby
Have fun!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This little peninsula serves as a nice little section of the hike and bike trail that doesn't get enough use. The cache itself should be easy to find for an experienced cacher. Getting to it requires going off trail, but not very far.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache itself is a small &quot;peanut butter jar&quot; style container that has been rinsed with bleach and camoed. The camo in this case, however, is really just for fun and less for camo. Please replace the cache exactly as you found it. The log is inside a pill container within the cache for a little added protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We really like this section of the hike and bike trail, but it doesn't see much use. The area around GZ frequently could use a little CITO, but the only muggle trouble you'll likely find is a random person catching fish or jogging past. There is normally plenty of parking in the area, but we reccomend the coordinates below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... and please remember to log your DNFs. They are a big help to everyone and not a mark of shame.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to FireMonkey0 on being FTF! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
iiiiPLEASE LOG TRAVEL BUGS PROPERLY OR DON'T TAKE THEM AT ALL!!!!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;h2&gt;CONSTRUCTION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The First Street Bridge was designed by UT School of Engineering
graduate Julian P. Montgomery with 4 lanes and 4 ft sidewalks. The
plan was to help relieve the traffic load on both Lamar Street and
Congress Ave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first steel span was placed on its concrete piers on June
22, 1953 with completion projected for late August, 1953. Well,
that didn't quite work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bridge was completed February 1, 1954 (at a cost of
$510,000) and the opening/dedication ceremony was held on February
11. The High point of the dedication was when Mayor A. C. McFadden
described the bridge as being symbolic of a link between &quot;two
segments of the finest people in the United States, those who live
in south Austin and those who live in north Austin.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first person to cross the bridge was 78 year-old E. R. Noe
who, in 1912, was the first person to officially cross the then new
Congress Avenue Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 19, 1956, the Austin City Council voted to rename the
bridge as The Drake Bridge in honor of William Sherman Drake, Jr.
(1909-1967) who had been the Mayor of Austin at the time the bridge
was built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NAMESAKE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor Drake's father, William Drake, Sr. (1864-1934), had come
from Connecticut to Austin with his brother Carl where, in 1883,
they founded the Drake Brothers Store. The store was located at 2nd
and Guadalupe; a point where wagon trains entered Austin. Shortly
thereafter, William Sr. bought out his brother and changed the name
of the store to Calcasieu Lumber Company and eventually became the
last Treasurer of the Republic of Texas and the first Treasurer of
the State of Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Jr.'s first real job came at the age of 21 as a
switchboard operator at the lumber yard. He took over as President
of Calcasieu Lumber 4 years later when his father died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drake's political career started when he was first elected to
the Austin City Council in 1949. He served as Mayor Pro Tem from
1949-1950. He was then reelected to the Council in 1951 and was
immediately and unanimously selected by the City Council to serve
as Mayor, replacing Taylor Glass who was stepping down to turn his
attention to running his ice cream factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mayor (1951-1952), two of Drake's primary interests were
fixing the growing traffic problems that were coming with a growing
Austin and promoting good, clean city government. He was
instrumental in establishing the current pattern of downtown Austin
one-way streets and being sure they, at the time, were synchronized
with lights in and just beyond the downtown Austin area to improve
traffic flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EXPANSION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 29, 1989, The Austin City Council gave approval for the
expansion of The Drake Bridge to it's current 6 lanes with 10 ft
sunken hike/bike paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;THE CACHE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, now that you know a little of the story behind this bridge,
head out and go find the cache placed there. Watch out for the
muggles (the reason for the high difficulty rating) and be careful
not to drop the cache! If you get lucky and don't have to worry
about muggles, the difficulty drops to a 1. Be sure to bring your
own pen, pencil, crayon, or other writing device of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache was placed to point out an unusual building in
West-Central Austin. The cache only has room for very small items. 
&lt;p&gt;Please be discreet and keep an eye out for muggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a little history on the building:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Military Institute started out as the Bastrop Military
Institute in the 1850's. Bastrop lies about 40-50 miles east of
Austin. The school ceased operations during the Civil War. After
the war, the occupying Union commander initially denied a request
to resume classes. However, in 1868 General Sheridan allowed the
school to reopen in Bastrop. Administrators quickly realized the
Bastrop facilities were inadequate. Austin then raised a $10,000
building fund (in gold!) and enticed TMI to relocate. The
castellated building was constructed in 1870 on a bluff overlooking
Shoal Creek, the original western boundary of the city. Original
plans called for an enclosed square with towers at each corner.
However, only two of the planned towers were built. In 1879 the
state established Texas A&amp;M as a military-style school and
hired TMI's president and entire faculty, forcing the private
school's closure. The building was used by Bickler's Academy
between 1884-1887. Thereafter it was a private residence for
several decades. The south end of the building (including one of
the towers) was removed sometime after 1887. In 2001 developer Gary
Bradley bought the castle for his office. Bradley had developed
Circle C Ranch in southwest Austin which led directly to a local
ordinance aimed at preserving water quality in the underlying
aquifer and Barton Creek. In response, Bradley's cronies in the
state legislature passed a law forbidding cities to make such
ordinances, and Austin's law was struck down. Well, that has
nothing to do with the castle but it has made for hot politics (and
dirty water) in Austin. Currently it is an office building in a
residential neighborhood. The area is still known as Castle Hill,
now also the name of a popular local restaurant. Most Austinites,
however, do not know the origin of the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another nice castle/home located at N30 17.525, W097
45.288 that is easily visible from your car if you care to check it
out, but I wasn't able to find a suitable location to place a cache
there.&lt;/p&gt;

How many of you remember travelling to far-off places through Robert Mueller Municipal Airport?
Well, from this spot you can see the only remaining vestige of that cozy little airport, along with a scenic new addition to the area.

When completed later this summer, the “Southwest Greenway” will include:

•	Restored Texas black-land prairie incorporating native plants in partnership with the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center
•	Educational amenities about the ecosystem and prairies of Central Texas
•	10-foot-wide hike and bike trail made of decomposed granite

Enjoy the winding path down to the picnic tables and the view!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Not only the tower remains. There are also some very incongruous structures still standing around it - a couple of bus shelters that used to be in front of the terminal and the large overhead gantry sign that used to direct you to Departures, Arrivals and parking. I can't count how many times I drove under that gantry in the past.

I have fond memories of this airport in a pre 911 world where you could just wander up to the gates to meet your friends or family as they came off a flight and the tiny bar and Taco Bell that was just about all that was available at the American gates at the end of the concourse.

However I also remember the rugby scrum that passed for the baggage carousel! Tiny carousels with no room and people 6 deep all around them. Yikes!

The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout.
Down came the rain, and washed the spider out.
If you search for this cache you better watch out!

There’s a rather large surprise here that the young and young at heart will get a kick out of seeing. Bring a camera and post your pictures to the web site.

This cache is located in the demonstration garden of the Southwest Greenway. There are already many beautiful native plants, rocks, trails, benches, and art objects in place.
Be sure to check out the labyrinth and the unusual drain covers within it.

Upon completion later this summer, the greenway  is also scheduled to include:

    • Restored Texas black-land prairie incorporating native        plants in partnership with the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center

I hadn't driven into that entrance since the airport closed but it all still looks strangely familiar. They are really doing a nice job with this area and the gardens will be stunning when they are finished.

BandA always find interesting spots to bring you for caches - thanks guys!

This cache is being placed to draw your attention to a cool feature of this new walking path. Being touted as &quot;the biggest public art project in Austin’s history&quot;, you will be looking at a series of 18- to 20-foot tall flower-shaped sculptures that collect the sun’s rays and convert them into solar energy to light the structures at night. So they will provide shade during the day, and a neat light show at night, as well as lighting the walking path after dark.

This cache is appropriately named &quot;No More Sniffles!&quot;, or at least it has been that way for me -- located near the allergist that I visit every 1-2 weeks to help me keep those sniffles at bay. 

The view from where the cache is also very nice, and has also been placed as always had me stopping for a bit, and taking it in the cityscape of Austin, and then having to get in the car and roll off to work!

This place can be busy at times (watch out for muggles), best to grab early in the morning or later in the evening.

This is a microcache that has be camouflaged to fit into its surroundings -- area of very well manicured landscaping! :) It is a log only, please BYOP!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The cache is hidden on a wall, in the creeping/climbing ivy.  It is tucked away about 1 foot down from the top of the wall.  It is a film canister that has been camouflaged.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

N30 21.234  W097 49.949
Cache is about .14 miles from parking coordinates down some cool mountain biking trails!  Have Fun!  Don't forget to bring a recipe!!!
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 



&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I really love good
  recipes &lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; I really wanted to create a nice theme cache, too.  So
  here it is, now you have both!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is a
  regular cache in a smaller ammo box.  Contents include 4 different
  recipes on nice colored cardstock for your files.  I have placed
  approximately 25 of each in the cache to start you off.  I will re-stock
  my recipes and add new ones as supplies grow low.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pasta e fagioli
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No Bake
      Chocolate Cookies
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choc-Oat-Chip
      Cookies
    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best Pecan
      Sandies (old family recipe, so yummy)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your mission,
  should you choose to accept it, is to take one or two of &lt;u&gt;my recipes&lt;/u&gt; for
  yourself and add one or two of your favorite recipes to share!  I will
  check on the cache periodically to collect the new recipes and either scan
  them or re-type them and post them as pictures on the cache website for all to
  share.&lt;/p&gt; I will work to post some recipes on my new cache site, soon.  Currently under construction.
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itscaching.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.itscaching.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Please only
  remove my recipe cards&lt;/u&gt;,
  so that I have time to scan the new ones for everyone.  Post a note
  whenever you log the cache find as to which recipe you took and which you
  leave, so I can keep count for re-stocking.  If you forget to bring a
  recipe, please email me one or add it to your log later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Please
  keep this a theme cache for recipes only&lt;/u&gt;.
   Please do not place
  toys and other cache stuff, there will not be room.  The only exception
  is Travel Bugs and/or other traveling items.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cache on!!! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Love, Gadget Girl&lt;/p&gt;

This cache is part of Popular Mechanics' series of caches that were hidden as part of an article on geocaching in the May 2011 issue. It is encased in a medium-sized Tupperware container. Inside the cache is a free t-shirt for the first lucky cacher to find it (if you take it, please leave something fun for the next cacher). There's also a Travel Bug that is aching for a fun trip.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">To reach the park from Ranch Road 620 in Lakeway, turn west onto
Lakeway Blvd. After about half a mile, turn right on Duck Lake Dr.
Go about a quarter mile and turn right on Palos Verdes Dr. The
trailhead is located at N30°21.821' W97°58.145'. (You &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt;
access the trail system by going to N30°22.066' W97°57.835' and
following the arrows painted on the pavement, but if you do, you
will bypass much of the scenic beauty this area has to offer, and
to share that beauty is the whole reason behind placing this
cache.) 
&lt;p&gt;The trails are well marked and maintained, but I recommend that
you click here for more information and for a trail
map that you can print and carry with you on the trail. (Use a
color printer if possible and set to landscape.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you look at the map, you will see that there are several
possible routes to the cache. I prefer the “primitive” trails, but
they are all nice, so try different ways out and back, and see
which is your favorite. The hike is about 1.7 miles round trip with
some ups and downs no matter which way you go, so take some
drinking water and maybe even a picnic, as there is a nice place
for one at your destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please resist the urge to take any off-trail shortcuts, both to
preserve the environment, and so that you won’t miss any of the
scenic views along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache is located within 40 feet of the trail, so please
stay on the trail until you are within this distance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your hike!&lt;/p&gt;

I'd been looking for a scenic cache to make find #1,000 and Emmy-n-Sapphie recommended this one.

Good call! This is the kind of cache that explains why a lot of us enjoy this hobby. I've never been a fan of exercise for its own sake and you'd never get me in a gym - it bores me to tears like most sports. What I need is an excuse to get exercise, a scenic hike with a purpose so that I get some hiking in without even noticing it.

Beautiful hike with just enough 'up and down' to make you feel like you've done something but not too much that it makes you feel ill, and some great views and scenery along the way. What could be better? (Well - maybe some water in the lake? :-) )

Thank you Banda for cache # 1,000!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Okay, since this is “My First Dam Cache Ever” I wanted it to be
mostly easy, but make you work a little bit. This Cache is located
near the Mansfield Dam Park near Austin, TX. Terrain is steep and
lots of tall plants around the trail.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Mansfield Dam (formerly Marshall Ford Dam) is a dam located on Lake
Travis across a canyon at Marshall Ford on the Colorado River, 13
miles (21 km) northwest of Austin, Texas. Construction of the dam
began in 1937 and was completed in 1941 as a joint project by the
Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) and the United States Bureau
of Reclamation. Originally called Marshall Ford Dam, the name was
changed in 1941 in honor of United States Representative J.J.
Mansfield. The reservoir behind Mansfield Dam is named Lake Travis.
The dam is owned and operated by the LCRA. 
&lt;p&gt;Mansfield Dam is 278 feet (85 m) high, 7,089 feet (2 km) long,
and 213 feet (65 m) thick at the base. The concrete gravity dam
with embankment wings and saddle dikes was designed to control
flooding; to store 1.4 km³ (369 billion US gallons) of water; and
to generate hydroelectric power (102 megawatts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-lane highway crossed the top of the dam, but traffic
congestion brought on by the growth of the city of Austin and
expanded popularity of recreation at Lake Travis forced the state
to build a four-lane highway bridge on the downstream side of the
dam. Traffic is no longer allowed on the road across the dam,
except for service vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

Cache is a little the worse for wear after 6 years in the wild but still serviceable and I was pleased to finally sign that logbook!

I was out looking for caches while waiting for the family to call me for dinner plans. I noticed the lack of caches in this area, so I grabbed one from my bag and placed it.

So without plotting coordinates, can you figure out where or what building I am talking about in the title?

This is very near a portion of the disc golf course and the water park so in the summer there could be a VERY high amount of muggle activity.

Congrats to HiDude_98 on the quick FTF!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;UPDATE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Semper Questio's injury in January, we
had to give Semper Fi back to the Greyhound Pets America. He was
having troubles we just could not handle while SQ was laid up.
Since then, we have been told that this gentle soul has succumbed
to bone cancer. We are so grateful that God brought Semper Fi into
our lives and that we were able to provide him a home and a
comfortable life for several years after his racing career was
over. He will be missed terribly. Good dogs NEVER live long
enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This
BYOP micro was placed near the spot where we had a fun time with
our dogs and, in particular, our Greyhound, Semper Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We brought the dogs out one day for some caching and just
walking around the park. There had been a good bit of rain recently
and there was a decent amount of water in this little creek feeding
the park's lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greyhounds are generally very graceful, but Semper Fi doesn't
swim. However, he does like to wade in water, as long as it is not
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; deep. About halfway up his legs is fine. So on
this day, he stepped up to the bank, looked at the water, and
decided it was a good time and place to get his feet wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stepped off, stepped in, and plunged into water all the way
over his shoulders! I don't know who was more surprised...him, or
us! But let me tell you, a Greyhound's eyes can get pretty darn
wide in certain circumstances and this was one of those! Keep in
mind I told you that &lt;b&gt;he does not swim&lt;/b&gt; but he was sure giving
it one heck of a try that day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we got him out all safe and sound and had (and still have
from time-to-time) a good, long laugh at his expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while you're in the area, take a break at the nearby bridge
and try to visualize a graceful, skinny, wide-eyed, 75 pound racing
dog flailing about in the water while you go bag this cache. Maybe
it'll give you a bit of a chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please do not park along the road. There is plenty of parking in
the nearby lot. Also, please do a little CITO along the way.
Finally, if the water is low, the Terrain rating drops to a 1.5 and
don't forget your own writing instrument of choice! Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

Doing some after dark caching, there were critters jumping into the pool in the creek, but it was too dark to see what they were. I decided that since they were jumping into the pool they were not going to attack me.
I looked right at the spot where this was hidden a couple of times before poking around and realizing that foraging insects had covered it with natural camouflage.
Due to the foraging insects this hiding spot has a limited shelf life, so to speak.
I was poking around on this site and saw that I had found this one so I decided to log it.</groundspeak:text>

It was a family that I know that lives not far from here, so I chatted with them for a while, went and found the cache then chatted a bit more before we all left. The father caught a sunfish while I was chatting with him. He said that he likes to come fishing here quite a bit. There is PI in the area but I did not see any along the route that I took to/from the cache. My friend said that he saw water moccasins in the river earlier as they were fishing. I did not see any wildlife except the barn swallows that are building nests under the bridge deck and the fish that he caught. This cache will not survive if another flood comes through here like the one that happened in September 2010 when tropical storm Hermine came through here. Right now there does not seem to be much danger of that due to the drought we are in. Driftwood can be seen hanging from the beams that support the bridge. The young man said that water was over the the bridge, which is a good 20 feet above the location of the cache. This is the 1st cache I have found that is listed only on opencaching.com and the 4th that I have found that is listed on opencaching.com. 1105301655Z</groundspeak:text>

I was out today checking on my own cache just a few yards from here (listed on geocaching.com) and decided to see if I could find this one.  Sure enough, there it is!

Took the Garmin coin.  Not quite sure yet if it is trackable anywhere or just collectible.

Not at all sure about this opencaching.com thing....  

TFTC anyway!

Night&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONGRATULATIONS JOEKING ON FTF!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a night cache that could be found in the
daytime. In fact, I will give you the alternatives in the
hints.&lt;br/&gt;
Throughout this state, there are many rest areas that have been
closed down and are basically a cacher’s ready-made dream. This is
one of those places. In fact, there used to be a cache here called
&quot;Forgotten Rest Area&quot; that was only recently archived.&lt;br/&gt;
When I arrived here around midnight, the State Constabulary was
observing traffic in darkness. I walked up to his vehicle and asked
him if he had heard of geocaching. I got the stock answer so I
basically told him that it was a treasure hunt with a GPSr and that
I wanted to hide one here. I asked if there would be a problem with
that and he said that was fine with him; in fact, he would move his
vehicle so that I could park safer. And that is what he did; he
moved off down the highway and left me to do my thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can park safely off of the main thoroughfare
and the cache can be obtained quite quickly.&lt;br/&gt;
For Night Cachers: When you get to the primary coordinates, stop,
and read the marker.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Why?&lt;br/&gt;
 Because it is there to be read.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Won't help you find the cache though except you know that you are
at the starting point.&lt;br/&gt;
After you have read the plaque, hold your flashlight out in front
of your eyes and look around for White #1.&lt;br/&gt;
Go to White #1 and look for White #2.&lt;br/&gt;
Go to White #2 and look for White #3.&lt;br/&gt;
When you have found White #3, look for Red #1.&lt;br/&gt;
Go to Red #1 and look for Orange and Green for the cache is just in
between the two off them.&lt;br/&gt;
The shorter you are the better chance you have of locating it.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>[For Day Cachers Only] Add decimal.zero one six to the north coordinate; add decimal.zero two three to the west coordinate and it should take you directly to the cache.  Orange and Green are about seven feet up the tree.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Not really sure if you log it twice if already found or what, but wanted to get the chance to put the 1st one out in Killeen, lol. This system is still in beta but it gave the option to list my caches from other websites but do not see where it tells the geocacher yet so I mention it here.____Description:___

There's a bear up in them woods, I tell ya! Peeking up around the trees a little while caching nearby, we came upon the extremely rare Texan green-eyed brown bear, thought to be exinct many years ago! If you can find him, he may surrender to you a cache as the reward. I would not recommend driving too far up to it, especially during or after a good rain.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;I knew this cache in its earlier day and its find is not easy.
So where are the rest of the brave souls; too timid to challenge
this one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE NAME SAYS IT! DO NOT MOVE ANYTHING! You do NOT have to move
ANYTHING except possibly leaves. Let me put it another way. DO NOT
move the rocks. DO NOT leave the road. DO NOT climb on the wall.
Why do I plant a cache? To take you to new places; to give you some
exercise; to enjoy the view; or maybe it is just simply issuing you
a challenge to see if you are up to it. If you ever visited &quot;JVC-
In the Crack&quot; (GC111HH) then you have found the precise location
for this cache. The name pretty much describes this cache. This
container was abandoned/archived but was never retrieved. All I
have done is verified that it is still in place and that there is a
fresh log there. There is absolutely no reason to move a single
stone and there is no reason to leave the road. You can park within
feet of the cache but this is one opportunity to see if your
parking brakes on your vehicle really work! Good luck...you are
going to need it!&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

CTC is a wonderful environment for exploration. This is my first effort at a cache and it is hidden in some urban landscape. There are small thorns/briars so be careful when hunting. I work just a few yards away so maybe I just might be watching during school hours. High muggle potential. Park in approved parking lots only. No bushwhacking required. Stay on the path.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;FTF - CACHIN' CRUISERS - Congratulations - 122
minutes from time published!&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In small towns (Oglesby has a population less than 500) it is
amazing that they can find enough people to have a baseball field.
The Oglesby Little League Park and Recreation Area is on the
eastern side of town. I was led here by accident when attempting to
find another cache. My TomTom in-car navigator was determined to
send me via this road through a few fields to my final destination.
Well the road ends here by the Little League field. I imagine that
this place may have random fits of intense muggle activity but
generally this place appears quiet. They have toilets but I don't
know if they are open 24/7. The cache itself is a small Geocache
Lock-and-Lock knockoff container held in place with a common
suspension system. Coordinates are pretty durned close. There is a
log and a pen and some small tradeables. It is not a roomy cache.
Please put the container back exactly where you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one other small note: Any road shown going EAST from the
cache site is a figment of someone's imagination. You cannot get
there from here!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS R&amp;PHUNTERS ON FTF!&lt;/b&gt; A very pretty kitty.
I would say come and sit and have a chat with her but she does not
have a chair yet at her new home. The dogs next door might raise
some ruckus but don't worry about them. Go ahead and open the gate;
just be sure to close it when you leave. If the cops bust you, tell
them to ring the doorbell, we will bail you out and give you some
coffee and/or hot chocolate. Should be an easy P&amp;G. Coords
might be a little off due to location surroundings. If it is before
22:00, ring the doorbell and we will be glad to chat. </groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache is dedicated to a couple of geocaching legends. Back
in the 70s there was a geocaching couple named &lt;i&gt;Denny and
Sandy&lt;/i&gt; who geocached under the name &lt;i&gt;The Geo-A-Go-Gos&lt;/i&gt;
because they were inveterate cachers and &lt;i&gt;dancing fools&lt;/i&gt;. They
were a part of everything that was geocaching. They had more finds
than practically anybody, and so many hides that you couldn't be a
geocacher for very long without finding one of their caches. Any
time you found a &lt;i&gt;really creative&lt;/i&gt; hide you'd think to
yourself &quot;This must be a Denny and Sandy cache,&quot; or &quot;This guy must
have learned this technique from Denny and Sandy.&quot; Not only that,
they were the center of the local geocaching social scene, with
picnics in the park, soirees at their &quot;cottage&quot; by the lake, dinner
parties at their palatial home. If you threw a party, they were
sure to be there. You name it, they were part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one day they just disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was like they had vanished off the face of the earth. Some
suspected the worst, but there were curious hints that they were
still alive and well &lt;i&gt;somewhere&lt;/i&gt;. There were occasional
garbled messages on the answering machines of local cachers. Now
and then there was a familiar sounding, but anonymous, post on a
geocaching message board. Some people reported finding barely
readable scribbled messages in cache log books. But no one ever
actually saw them. They left a big hole in the local geocaching
scene that was never completely filled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there were rumors about what had happened. Some say
they moved to New York City where Sandy sings and dances on
Broadway and Denny plays guitar in a jazz club on the lower East
Side. Others say they were shot down and captured by the
Sandanistas while fighting communism in Central America. Still
others say that they perished while trying to set up a 1000 cache
power-trail in Antarctica. As for me, I think they are off
somewhere fighting for Truth, Justice, and the American Way, and
that one day they will dance back into our lives with a chest full
of medals and a heroic tale to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is dedicated to you, Denny and Sandy, wherever you
are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located near the first stage of an old Denny and
Sandy multi-cache called &quot;Tweet, Tweet, Little Pete&quot; or something
like that. It is a container that is in keeping with that former
cache. It is log-only so bring your own pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck, Denny and Sandy, and may the geo-force be with
you.&lt;/p&gt;

Tennessee, and Central Texas -- at one of our favorite on-the-road
eateries.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The challenge here is to figure out where you need to be in
order to nab the cache without arousing curiosity or suspicion. If
a muggle sees you nab it, it will be history in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So pull up one of these nice rockin' chairs, set yourself down,
enjoy a game of checkers if you have a hankerin', and grab yourself
a smiley!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unusual pointer here is that although the cache may be
available pretty much around the clock, daylight hours may provide
better stealth cover. A night trip during opening hours may expose
you far more than you desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Although this is marked 24/7, be prepared to explain what
you are doing to the local constabulary if you are there after
hours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FINAL NOTE: Someone took the time to place this cache for your
enjoyment. That someone derives great pleasure in know that folk
appreciate the efforts taken to watch, monitor, and maintain. So,
please take the time to make a reasonable on-line log entry. Blank
on-line logs will be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">River Oaks Cemetery (later known as Martin Luther King Memorial
Cemetery) . . . now apparently abandoned and severely neglected.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;I found four markers in the cemetery (far removed from the
location of the cache). The only legible marker indicates that the
cemetery was in use in August of 1984.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I obtained information relative to the cemetery from the
McLennan County Cemetery Interest Group. Their web address is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.rootsweb.com/~txmclenn/mccig.htm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was originally River Oaks Cemetery and somewhere along the
line it was renamed as Martin Luther King Memorial Cemetery. The
markings for the letters can be seen on the face of the wall that
has fallen into serious disrepair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have attempted to contact the cemetery group but have had no
response to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pull well off of the road at the ruined wall at the front
of the cemetery. Highway 933 is extremely busy and traffic is
fast.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache consists of a decon container hidden in a fairly
obvious place. This was hidden in early January so I cannot say for
certain what the local plant life will be like later in the year.
Beggar's lice all over the place, a minimal amount of green briar,
and I suspect chiggers later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container contains a Geocoin for the FTF. No need to send it
on any journey. Although the coin has been activated, the
activation code is provided with the coin. A few other trinkets and
patches are in the container as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BYOP.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you depart, why not take some of the trash with you? No
cemetery should be treated or abandoned such as this one is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently found out about the &quot;Ashes-to-Ashes...caches and feel
that this should really be a part of that series. If I am out of
line, let me know and I will revert back to the original name.
Regardless, this is hallowed, although now empty, ground.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This was our first time to visit Dinosaur Valley SP and we had a blast. We thought that we would leave our mark on this location. Also, while we were caching at the SP, we met another family from the Ft. Worth area, who was leading a class on geocaching in the state park. The container is a camo milk bottle. This cache is titled after a cacher from Lampasas, Boogers58&amp;Mrs., who always put their hint as it's not in the cedar tree.
 
WE SUPPORT OUR STATE PARKS! In our strong desire to show our continuing support for our state parks, ALL geocachers must pay the entrance fee or show your Texas State Parks Pass in order to log this cache! By doing so, we will help geocaching continue to be a readily accepted use of Texas State Parks by parks management. This cache has been approved by the San Angelo State Park Management for placement in the park, with the typed permit on file at the Main Gate.</groundspeak:long_description>

We had a great time.  Initially, the cache was a little hard to find, but we didn't really know what we were looking for so it was actually probably about perfect.  The hike was nice and not too far.  The park is really nice and clean. Only thing we had any real confusion about is the 'butterflys'.  There was a &quot;butterfly trail&quot; but the signs are aged.

We're definitely hooked on this sport.</groundspeak:text>

Not long ago, a friend of mine moved to this subdivision. I thought this would be a good area to try my first hide. There are a couple other caches nearby. I hope you enjoy this one.

Watch out for thorns and ants at GZ on this one.

Lonestar where are you out tonight?
This feeling I'm trying to fight
It's dark and I think that I would give anything
For you to shine down on me

How far you are I just don't know
The distance I'm willing to go
I pick up a stone that I cast to the sky
Hoping for some kind of sign 
  
So on Lonestar Rd in the Lonestar State I couldn't think of a better name</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Green can in a big bush! Coming from the west side you need to walk past the storm drain with the hand rail. Then start counting the cuts in the concrete and when you get to the 4th take a half step more so that you are between the 4th and 5th cut. It is an Emerald Nut can and it does blend very well. Took me a minute to spot it and I put it there. GPSr was hovering at about the 2 foot mark. I couldn't get it to 0 when I went back tonight but I did mark this one in the rain.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As I was walking along to the area that I was going to put the cache in I found a trail head and decided what the heck. It is a well used trail. I don't have any idea where it goes to. It follows along a creek. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I walked along it for 15 minutes or so then turned back and found the spot I wanted. If you make the bend in the trail and see the log jam in the creek look back down at the GPSr because you went to far. The hide is not jammed into a log but the name will help you some. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I did wonder where the other end of this trail is, might have to walk it some day. Feel free to post if you know or if you want to guess. I couldn't really tell on google earth.

sometimes enjoy doing, this one is fairly easy. At the time I put
this out, there were no over grown areas, but that could change.

This one is named based on the location names that it is related to
(hint, hint). You should be able to get to both stages fairly easy,
but neither are going to be friendly to wheel chair bound
individuals. I'm hoping that this one will at least become a
TB/GCoin bed and breakfast, if not full on hotel. LOL

That cammo job is pretty tight though took me a few to spot it. Every thing was spot on too. Stage one has a pretty cool &quot;container&quot; to get you to stage two also. It was a nice walk from stage one to stage to but not to far. Glad I decided to go down a little further and avoid the beggar lice. I hate that little plant so much. It is so annoying. Thanks for the cool cache my Friend keep up the good work. </groundspeak:text>

This is in the top of a tree, well sort of. The tree has been cut down and lying on its side. This tree has been placed in the park as a display. This terrain is a 2 as you have to step up on a limb to reach the cache. You will be looking for a cammoed 35mm container only 7ft or so off the ground and is safe to climb.

This cache is placed in the same spot as my very first cache, Cliché Cache #1: The Vanderbilt (OXX4NJ).

That cache lasted from 2006-07-14 to about 2011-09-12. It was replaced once before but this time it couldn't be.

Cliché Cache #1 was a magnetic keyholder, camouflaged with silver duct tape, stuck to a galvanized steel guardrail. It can't be replaced because they removed that guardrail and installed a different kind of barrier.

This new cache is in memoriam of that first one.

Completely unrelated, Steve Jobs, of Apple Inc. fame, died the day this cache was placed. R.I.P. </groundspeak:long_description>

Eastern Hills was named Fort Worth Neighborhood of the Year in 2010 &amp; it has a voluntary HOA that meets monthly in the nearby church. Longtime Fort Worth residents have been heard saying they had no idea this jewel existed. It's a nice little neighborhood, with its rolling hills, tree lined streets &amp; friendly neighbors...and for us, it's home.

easy park &amp; stroll.
park on the street &amp; walk in the woods. no need to cross over to church proper. small container with room for small items. BYOP.

if this comes up missing or damaged, send a note or post for maintenance. it's near runoff creek &amp; water level comes close in a hard rain.

Congrats to kea3 for FTF!
You’re a brave one!</groundspeak:long_description>

Bill died in 1991 of cancer at the age of 50...WAY too soon. an avid hiker, gardener &amp; hippie to the end, he would have loved geocaching. this placement is our first &amp; is in his honor. we wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't for Bill. 

the placement of this &amp; others in this series mark our way home. not big fans of traffic, the route is a great alternative to rush hour on eastbound I-30.

it's along the Trinity &amp; trail hours are 6A-11P, although if you go at night, I suggest you bring a friend. trails are used by joggers, walkers &amp; people actually fish down below, although I can't imagine eating anything that comes out of there. yuck!

Decon container in a cedar tree. You might be able to park right next to it.

Be careful of muggles around here. One side of the tree is exposed to an apartment complex. The nearby library is closed on Sundays and Fridays, but otherwise opens between 10 and noon, and closes between 6 and 8 PM, depending on the day.

Please close the lid TIGHTLY (check all four corners) after you've made any trades and signed the log.

whose idea was it to put fish here, anyway?

sort of a park, stroll &amp; grab. not much of a view, but a trippy spot.

parking in lot from dawn to dusk. park trails open 5AM-11PM. cache is REALLY close to archived TTB #28. different container. different technique. to remove, raise up. to return, slip in &amp; slide down. if you want, just open. MANY briars, so beware. if it comes up missing or damaged, send me a note.

thanks to mpaintball for locale.

is it bad form to go out &amp; laugh at FTF candidate? told her to get a better flashlight before she tries any more of ours in the dark...that &amp; someone to watch her back! brave girl!

near archived TTB #25 (GC1DW1C), but not exactly. there were so many issues with keeping it out of muggle hands that I went deep on this one...hence, a walk in the woods. actually, the line from the movie Twister kept running through my head as I placed this one. like a song, it was driving me crazy, so I figured the name was meant to be.

there are other caches in this park that make for a nice little run. go beyond GZ for a slightly scary view of the Trinity, but not too far or you'll probably be wet &amp; in pain.

 This cache is placed at the oddest little cemetery I've seen. Odd because of location and size.  The cache is accessible without climbing any walls or opening any gates. It's not in the street either.

This cache is one of those tiny little magnetic buttons, so if you're not interested in this type of cache, please don't even try. The log is difficult to remove, so if you have some tweezers or a knife, that would speed things up. Difficulty is for the size of the container; terrain is probably wheelchair accessible if you can reach high enough.

This is the start of my salute to opencaching.com. I am a medic so I have tried to use containers that are medical in nature as much as possible. This section of the series except one cache is all blood tubes. They are water proof and cammo up real nice. When they expire they have to go to the trash so I do a little recycling and make a cache out of them. 

My hope is as the series gets bigger the caches will get bigger too. All my hides are kid friendly since I have a half of a baseball team of them and thats who I work with. Hope you enjoy.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This single lane bridge looks to have been built before WWII, but I couldn't find a plaque or anything. It's a classic steel truss bridge when rivets were king. Between I-35 and US 177, it is the only other river crossing. While it is rusting, it appears to be quite solidly built with its three segments suspending the road bed above the Canadian. Other than the 4 wheeler tracks, I don't imagine this shoreline has changed much in the last 200 years! Spend a little time looking across the river and imagine trying to drive a couple hundred cows to the other side or getting your wagon over without swamping the contents. Parking is limited to 1 spot unless you’ve got the vehicle to get down off the road. There is quite a nice beach area and don't forget the fishing pole. You're looking for a camoed plastic quart jar with a few trade items. Knowledge of the native Oklahoma flora might help confirm the cache location. But, by then you'll have to be looking right at it. PI is heavy away from the water. Follow the 4 wheeler trail, it leads right to the cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This historical marker is a&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;tribute to Irving&lt;/b&gt; where&lt;br/&gt;his party camped along the union of&lt;br/&gt;Little river and Hog creek in the fall of 1832.  He wrote about&lt;br/&gt;his expedition from Ft. Gibson in A Tour of the Prairies.  It is constructed with local rose rock and quartz as decoration. Although this is a good picnic spot with room to stretch yours or a dogs legs there are no trash cans, picnic tables or restrooms.  I did find the electricity on at the pole, so you could recharge something.  There is a small grill across the street. I've been told by some cachers that is serves a good breakfast. The cache is less than 200 feet from the marker.  Bushwhacking should be minimal as you can use the highline as a path to get close to the cache.  The container has my typical camo and is in a good hide.  It’s got a few trade items for kids and will hold medium travel bugs.  Please replace as you found it and enjoy this little piece of Oklahoma history.

Parking is at an old, overgrown boat access point on public land about .13 of a mile from the hide. Walk in along the fence line to the east and you'll avoid most of the brier and tangles. Remember, you're going on a duck hunt; long pants, sleaves and boots are recommended! The only thing you won't have to do is wade water. There is no need to cross any fences. When you get done digging thru the 50 cal ammo can, you'll have a good view from the south shore. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the unique feature of these lakes. A deep channel was cut in 1962 to connect them allowing water and boats to flow between each. You can motor your favorite cabin cruiser (no more than a 3 ft draft) back and forth all day long. If you've got a boat, it will allow you to get 5 or 6 caches without all the driving around. A city permit is required to go boating at $4 a day. The cache is near the edge. It's best to keep the kids in the car or well away from the cache for this one. I certainly don't want to hear of any unplanned splashes. Small splashes from rocks are okay as long as there aren't any boats about. Body sized splashes are prohibited. But, getting wet isn't required for this cache.

A lot of people think of the big Bluestem at 7 or 8 feet tall, I think of the more modest  Little bluestem with it's coppery fall color.  Parking is at the end of the road and approved by the local LE as is access.  You may see coyote, cottontail rabbit, turtle, armadillo and a myriad of birds anywhere in this field of mixed grass prairie. Bring the kids for this one. You're going after an ammo can with lots of kid goodies. There

is a bit of green briar around the cache, but I didn't find any grass burrs. Other than the lake, I doubt this area has changed much in the last 100 years. If you're in the area at sunset, you should have a great view. </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;bout. I didn't know of this cemetery until I was working on
the nearby Kansas Heartland geocaches. This geocache is sort of
accessible from Highway I-35. There is a pull-off barely on the
south side of the overpass, one for the southbound lane and another
one for the northbound lane. You probably have to stop at the gate
and walk the rest of the way which, for northbounders, includes
walking over the overpass to the west end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a 50-cal
black ammo box with a cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides.
Original contents include a Sacagawea gold dollar coin, a Kansas
quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, one of those
new-Lincoln-image-on-the-back pennies, an old wheat penny, an
&quot;Egyptian&quot; dollar, a beautiful bracelet handcrafted by the
wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and other miscellaneous trade
goodies.&lt;/p&gt;

Welcome to Wellington Donut Bay. This cache has been placed in a new area, still near Donut Bay. The cache is a Coleman jug. You will have to bushwack some. I suggest approaching from the east along the railroad. Enjoy the adventure and check out the Slate Creek dam to the south.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the posted coordinates, you will find Shelly. She works at the Y. When you go to visit her, park at the southeast corner of her yard. Otherwise you may get run over by the speedsters who zip by the Y. Shelly will tell you where to find Sally. Sally has the cache at the final coordinates. A tall, plastic loc-N-lock container has miscellaneous stuff like stuffed animals, bracelets, Sally's sea shells from the sea shore, and an altoids tin packed with LUCKY pennies, and they really have brought me good luck too. To the west of Sally is an interesting construct.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This area is known as &lt;i&gt;Twin Lakes&lt;/i&gt;. Maybe it has to do with
the two larger bodies of water on both sides of the highway, to the
northwest and to the southeast. Personally, I don't believe in
calling small ponds &quot;lakes&quot;. And as for these ponds, they are
actually remnants of where the Ninnescah River once flowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google defines an oxbow as a U-shaped bend in a river or stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
river flows along the west edge of U.S. 81 Highway west of the
Turnpike. The Turnpike is the north-south road with a big gradual
kink in it. The river goes south, then turns left and heads east to
cross under the Turnpike. There, it used to double
back and flow north making an &quot;oxbow&quot;, coming back to almost meet
up with the Turnpike again. (The river was there first. When they
built the Turnpike, they designed the kink in it to go around the
bends of the river.) Then the river took a right turn and traveled
on a winding path towards the south again making another &quot;oxbow&quot;.
The winding had been overtaken at some moment in time and the river
took the path of least resistance, changing the path of flow to a
shorter route and closing the &quot;U&quot;. This shorter
route still has a winding to it. Another oxbow is inside the other
oxbow. So here we have a &lt;b&gt;DOUBLE OXBOW&lt;/b&gt; right after another
oxbow. Is that cool or what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trivia: the &lt;i&gt;Ninnescah River&lt;/i&gt; gets it's name from what it
used to be called back in the pioneer days, the &lt;i&gt;Ne-Ne Squaw
River&lt;/i&gt;, meaning the &lt;i&gt;Little Indian Girl River&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for an ammo box with cammo duct tape all over
it. I have it tied about five feet off the ground as a precaution
against local area flooding. It's tied to the usual with a bungie
cord. Try to put it back like you found it, or like it should have
been when you found it. Contents include a Sacagawea gold dollar
coin, a Kansas buffalo quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, a
beautiful bracelet hand crafted by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland,
and other miscellaneous trade goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br/&gt;—cantuland    </groundspeak:long_description>

      adding, some subtracting, and some counting.&lt;/b&gt; You
      may find this puzzle easier to figure out if you print out
      the cache page so you have something to write on as you go.
      Go to the posted coordinates. There you will find lots of
      references to the local streets in town. You will use these
      references to come up with the positions of Stage Two and
      part of Stage Three, being the Final Stage with the geocache.
      At Stage Two you will finish figuring Stage Three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers to the questions at Stage One and Stage Two may be
found without leaving your car. Sometimes these areas can be packed
with muggles. When an area is loaded with muggles, you may have to
get out of your vehicle to answer some of the questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North __ __ ° __ __ . __ __ __ '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West __ __ ° __ __ . __ __ __ '&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;While you're at Stage One, the posted coordinates:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; - From the sidewalk go south four blocks to
Merchant. The number you seek is on another side of the block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; - From the sidewalk go south three blocks to
Lincoln. Lincoln is your &quot;B&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; - There is a bundle of blocks south of the drive
entrance, south of a flagpole, south of a group of three large pine
trees. &quot;C&quot; is the third block (Merchant) at the south end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;D&quot; is the second block (Linden) at the south
end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt; - On the north side of the parking lot is a long
line of blocks. &quot;E&quot; is the east Logan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;F&quot; is the first block north of the drive
entrance, minus the block at the northeast corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt; - South of the flagpole is a small tree between two
blocks. Neither block is Elm. &quot;G&quot; is the higher number of the two
blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;H&lt;/b&gt; - Start at the sidewalk and go north to the first
of three Sumners. &quot;H&quot; is the first Sumner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; - Start at the sidewalk and go north one block to
Logan. Logan is your &quot;I&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;J&lt;/b&gt; - Between the first and second trees north of the
parking lot's drive entrance are four blocks. The difference
between two Sumners is your &quot;J&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;K&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;K&quot; is Linden in the north row of blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt; - On the east bunch of blocks, &quot;L&quot; is all the
Friends (Friends:___+___ +___=___) minus all the Elms
(Elms:___+___=___).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;M&quot; is the first Line north of the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;N&quot; is the first block south of the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;O&quot; is 7. You get this one for free, like the
middle square of a Bingo card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;P&quot; is 478 but you won't need &quot;P&quot; and you won't
need &quot;O&quot; either, just like the middle square of a Bingo card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt; - &quot;S&quot; is equal to one block north of a flagpole
minus one block south of a flagpole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;U&lt;/b&gt; - Between the drive entrance and the northwest
corner are four trees. ___ Add up all the blocks on the south side
of each of these four trees, one block for each tree. ___ Add up
all the blocks on the north side of each of these four trees, again
one block for each tree. &quot;U&quot; is equal to the south blocks minus the
north blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;Y&lt;/b&gt; - Your &quot;Y&quot; is the southernmost block, which is a
Merchant. Be sure to be south of the group of three big pine
trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;Z&lt;/b&gt; - Your &quot;Z&quot; is either Main Line between the parking
lot drive entrance and the flagpole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have what you need to calculate the coordinates of the
second stage. Fill in the blanks for the second stage. The blanks
are in the secion above the question for &quot;A&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;While you're at the Second Stage:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;Q&lt;/b&gt; - Orange Washington&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt; - Purple Washington&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt; - Main&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;VW&lt;/b&gt; - Add all the blocks that are greater than zero
and less than four. To those, add all the blocks that are greater
than four and less than ten. The two-digit number is your &quot;VW&quot;. The

&lt;p&gt;___ &lt;b&gt;X&lt;/b&gt; - Both Washington's plus a good Lincoln.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have what you need to calculate the coordinates for the
final stage. The geocache is at this next stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a black ammo box with a
cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides. Contents include a
Sacagawea gold dollar coin, a Kansas buffalo quarter, a
Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, a beautiful bracelet hand crafted
by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and other miscellaneous trade
goodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This geocache is more of a drive-around multi-stage, but since you aren't really looking for the stages in order, or looking for midstage cache containers, I decided to classify it as a Puzzle/Other type of geocache.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This small town has community spirit. Here is a list of coordinates. Take a tour of the town and drive by each location and see if there is a United States &lt;strong&gt;FLAGPOLE&lt;/strong&gt; or a Belle Plaine High School &lt;strong&gt;DRAGON&lt;/strong&gt; or a Belle Plaine Middle School &lt;strong&gt;BULL DOG&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.551 W97°16.880 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.571 W97°16.879 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.588 W97°16.878 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.593 W97°16.860 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°24.030 W97°16.862 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.604 W97°16.589 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.366 W97°16.600 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.665 W97°16.546 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.627 W97°16.546 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N37°23.859 W97°16.574 - Flagpole/Dragon/Bull Dog&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After visiting each location, calculate the coordinates of the geocache as follows. Start with the posted coordinates as your base numbers.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each location with a &lt;strong&gt;FLAGPOLE&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;br/&gt;
subtract 0.171 from the minutes of the North coordinate and&lt;br/&gt;
add 0.107 to the minutes of the West coordinate.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each location with a &lt;strong&gt;DRAGON&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;br/&gt;
add 0.171 to the minutes of the North coordinate and&lt;br/&gt;
subtract 0.107 from the minutes of the West coordinate.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each location with a &lt;strong&gt;BULL DOG&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;br/&gt;
subtract 0.171 from the minutes of the North coordinate and&lt;br/&gt;
subtract 0.107 from the minutes of the West coordinate.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you're done with all the adding and subtracting, you will end up with the final coordinates to the hidden geocache. The final coordinates will be within three miles of the posted coordinates.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the final coordinates, you are looking for an ammo box painted black with a cantuland geocache logo painted on the sides.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br/&gt;—cantuland  </groundspeak:long_description>

things ready, someone drove up and parked nearby. They got out of
their car and walked around. I was foiled that day because someone
ELSE was in the middle of NOWHERE too...so I set it on another day.
The place was deserted that day.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;FROM SATURDAY, APRIL 9, 2011&lt;br/&gt;
TO SUNDAY, APRIL 10, 2011

&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TULIP TIME&lt;/b&gt; is the annual spring citywide celebration in Belle Plaine, three miles to the east. There is a billboard just south of the cache that tells when the next Tulip Time celebration is going to be. Usually, the billboard is outdated until just before the celebration. I'll try to keep the dates for the next event posted here.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are looking for an ammo box with cammo duct tape all over it. This area goes through seasonal floods so the box is attached to the area with a chain. If you need to disconnect the box from the chain, it's an easy task. Just be sure to put it all back better than you found it.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contents include two Kansas buffalo quarters, two Lewis-and-Clark edition buffalo nickels, two other Lewis-and-Clark edition nickels, a bracelet hand crafted by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and other miscellaneous trade goodies.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Go to the above coordinates. Then walk (east-northeast) toward the obvious local attraction. Before you get distracted, look for a bench mark. This is a USGS bench mark that is not on the usual NGS list. It is a brass disk on top of a 4-inch sqare concrete post that sticks up about a foot above the ground. Take good care of this bench mark. It looks to have experienced some recent bruises. Look at it, but do not disturb it. The bench mark is visible from the above coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geocache is 0.004 minutes north and 0.018 minutes east of the USGS bench mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI: Half of a mile to the north is the Ninnescah Bowhunters Association property. Keep in mind, this is private land. Don't go trespassing or you might get yourself silently shot. No one would even hear any gun shots. If you're interested, give them a call. I couldn't find any contact info.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Geocaches are a great way to learn about history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a million years ago, people used to travel west into unsettled territory by following a worn, chiseled mammoth trail called the Chisholm Trail. Motivated by John Wayne re-runs, these strange people sought to find vast areas of land in which they could hide new geocaches. Wild stories of these hidden geocaches circulated from one saloon to the next through emails on the Internet. The news attracted geocachers like Mr. Lewis N. Clark from the east coast who were told, &quot;Go geocaching, young man.&quot; Some people brought wagons full of items to trade. Some even brought their whole family on geocaching expeditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This park is dedicated to a common route tracked by early geocachers. If you're lucky, you will even find a geocache still in this area, and then you too will be a part of this histerical account. Watch out for muggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;THE CACHE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a large-sized, black ammo box with a
cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides. Contents include a
gold Sacagawea dollar coin, a Kansas buffalo quarter, a
Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, a bracelet hand crafted by the
wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and lots of other miscellaneous trade
goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location for this geocache was chosen because of the effort
given by the people here to help all animals. They use their skills
indoors but the container is outdoors. Permission has been granted
to place the cache on their property. No night-time caching is
allowed for security reasons, so stop by during daylight only. If
you'd like, you can step into the office and say hello to the cat
who guards the front desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My cat named Bello&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This geocache is
     dedicated to a cat that I lost on June 13, 2007. His name was
     Bello, pronounced &quot;Bayo&quot;, Spanish for beautiful. He lived to
     be a very old cat and finally died of living too long. He used
     to be an outside cat, then had to become an inside cat to keep
     him out of trouble. He always wanted to go back outside. He
     would sit and look out the window for hours. I'm sure he was
     remembering what it was like to chase the birds and walk on
     the hoods of cars. He liked to be the center of attention. If
     the kids were paying attention to toys, Bello prefered that
     they paid attention to him. Sometimes he would try to interupt
     a card game. We kept playing the card game and he kept laying
     on the cards. Bello liked to play with anyone and was very
     tolerant of toddlers who wanted to pick him up, hang on to his
     tail, or even cover him with a dirt pile, a pile of leaves, or
     a pile of kids' swimming pool accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When family was sick, Bello was the nanny cat. If you just
couldn't give him some attention, then he would give it to you. He
would sit at your side all day for days if necessary, until you got
better. You couldn't fake it either; he always knew when you really
were sick. You didn't get any of the &quot;nanny attention&quot; if you were
faking it. Bello believed that babies were always in need of a
nanny cat to sit and protectively watch over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he &quot;pounced&quot; on you, he would look like he was the vicious
lion attacking its prey, but Bello's teeth would barely touch you,
more of a bump, and his slapping from his front paws was always
pulled back so you barely felt anything at all. If you teased him
and he got you with his back feet, he wouldn't use any claws. It
was a game to him. He liked to play...by the rules...and if you
crossed the line and teased him too much, he would stop playing and
look you right in the eyes and give you a scowl, not a threatening
&quot;I'm going to get you&quot; look, but more of a &quot;You're not playing
right so I quit&quot; look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was time to take a nap, Bello learned how to use the
curtain to make himself a hammock on the top of the couch so he
could soak in the sun. He loved his naps. Sometimes we would find
him napping on a pile of stuffed animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bello tried to give the impression that he was a grumpy old man,
but we knew the difference. He was very good at ignoring people and
&quot;pretended&quot; to not be interested. When he acted like he wasn't
interested in something, we could tell by the flick of his tail
what he really was thinking. If he was annoyed, he'd slowly raise
his tail and whop it down to make a loud thump. When he was
interested in something, even if he wanted to pretend that he was
ignoring you, the tip of his tail would barely twitch over and
over. If you thought he was sleeping, you could call his name. If
he was awake, his tail would unfailingly give one gentle twitch.
His tail always gave him away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when Bello was a kitten, he hung out with the kittens at
the neighbor's house. He and Spots became best buds. Bello was a
black cat and Spots was a white cat. Bello was purchased from the
pet store, and Spots came from a stray mommy cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They would wander together like brothers and torment the
neighborhood dogs, laying just barely out of reach of a dog's chain
while they flopped around in the dust. Bello was good at catching
mice. Spots was good at stealing Bello's mice. As they grew up,
Spots sought other territory and left our neighborhood, leaving
Bello to terrorize the area by himself. Bello eventually was
befriended by our dog; stealing the dog's food was even easier
then. After Bello became an inside cat, he still was caught every
now and then stealing dog food from the bag; he knew he wasn't
supposed to do that and had to be sneaky about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the story of nine lives goes, we think Bello used up all of
his nine lives and borrowed some more from the other cats in the
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*** One day Bello came home in a winter storm with ice all over
him. He looked like someone dumped water all over him. He got to
spend the rest of the storm indoors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*** Another time he came home with a sore on his chest. We took him
to the vet who said that he found some pieces of bird shot in his
chest. Someone had taken a shot at Bello and missed. Pieces must
have hit the ground in front of him, bounced, and got lodged in his
chest. The wound healed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*** Once he got too close to our dog. She darted to him and stuck
her mouth completely over his head, then backed off without biting.
Caught by surprise, Bello was shocked and his eyes were open very
wide. He learned the message that she was still the bigger of the
two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*** He had many occassions where he could have bit the dust, but he
always came through. He did, however, suffer a major
traumatization. Bello used to lay in the streets and make cars
drive around him...until he got run over. We took him to the vet,
surely thinking that this was the end for him. The vet said that he
had never seen a cat that bad and live through it. Well, he lived
through it. He suffered from permanent minor sinus damage and some
crooked teeth, but other than that, he recovered. That was the
event where we decided that he could no longer go
outside.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lived many years as an inside cat. He got to greet a new
kitten and watch it grow up to also be an old indoor cat. After
many years, Bello finally lived too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our family will miss
     Bello.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br/&gt;—cantuland

The stages need to be done in order, but they can be done at different times if need be.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The geocache is a 50-calibur standard ammo box and is at coordinates of&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N 37°31.ABC', W 097°16.DEF'&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;Take the tour to find out &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;. You will have to do some walking, some adding and some subtracting for this one. No multiplication is necessary. No hunting for microcaches is necessary. The number of swings at this park is your &quot;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; value. It isn't a trick question. At some time during your tour, just find the swing set in the obvious spot and count the number of swings for your &quot;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A = ______       H = ______       O = ______       V = ______&lt;br/&gt;B = ______        I = ______         P = ______      W = ______&lt;br/&gt;C = ______       J = ______        Q = ______       X = ______&lt;br/&gt;D = ______       K = ______        R = ______      Y = ______&lt;br/&gt;E = ______       L = ______        S = ______       Z = ______&lt;br/&gt;F = ______       M = ______        T = ______&lt;br/&gt;G = ______       N = ______       U = ______&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;u&gt;STAGE ONE.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Start the tour at the given posted coordinates. Look at the park sign here. Find the year under the word &quot;DERBY&quot;. It says something in the 1800s. We'll call it 18&lt;strong&gt;GH&lt;/strong&gt;.

Another hint: V, W, X, Y, Z and I are just to&lt;br/&gt;confuse you if you don't read all this stuff.

You may look at it, but please don't do anything that would disturb its position. Cleaning the top should be okay, so that you can read the disk...and take a picture of it (hint, hint).&lt;/p&gt;

of the road. Parking is difficult to find. Lots of trees around
here have been dedicated to different people. There is a gazeebo
that makes for a good place to have a picnic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a small plastic peanuts container with cammo
duct tape all over it. Original contents included a 2007 dollar
coin, two Kansas buffalo quarters, two Lewis-and-Clark edition
nickels, a bracelet hand crafted by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland,
and other miscellaneous trade goodies.&lt;/p&gt;

Walk over to home plate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bottom of the 9th, full count, and the score is Found 50 and Set One. Bases are loaded. First base is to the east. Second base is 45 degrees left of first base. Third base is 90 degrees left. You're up to bat, and the pitcher throws the ball. The pressure is on. Everything starts to move in slow motion as you focus on the ball. Quickly, you check your GPSr and it says that the ball is bearing right at you with an accuracy of plus or minus 30 feet. You judge the pitch to be good enough and swing at it with all your might.&lt;br/&gt;BAM!&lt;br/&gt;You hit the ball and it goes 75 degrees left and just over the fence. A grand slam! Both teams celebrate by whipping out GPS receivers and everybody goes geocaching. Hooray!&lt;br/&gt;Don't just stand there. Go chase down your ball and find the cache. Camo-painted lock-N-lock. Be sure to hide it back as well or better than as you find it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br/&gt;—cantuland </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;When it comes to geocaches, Riggs Park is haunted and is famous
for &quot;eating&quot; geocaches. Geocaches go in, but they never come out.
The original placement of this geocache lasted two days before
being SHREDDED, keeping in step with the reputation of this park.
We'll see how long the second attempt lasts before also being
consumed. Hopefully it stays for quite a while. If you try this one
after a rain, expect the difficulty to be worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a small, sandwich-sized plastic loc-n-loc
with cammo duct tape all over it. Contents include miscellaneous
small trade goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began my journey into this place at the posted coordinates.
When I entered the area, there were squirrels running all over the
place. They were everywhere. As I continued to walk through this
woodsy scene, the air turned comfortably cooler, and I came upon an
unusual site. There on the ground before me was a squirrel sitting
up on his back legs and peering back at me. I carefully stepped
closer. It didn't dart away, but gave me a look of curiosity. It
was an old squirrel with very long grey hairs gently flowing in the
breeze. It looked as if it understood my very thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked the old squirrel, &quot;Why are there so many squirrels
around here?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The squirrel looked at me for a bit with unshaking eyes. Then
the squirrel spoke to me. Its voice was loud and deep and seemed to
reverberate inside my head as well as shake me on the outside. He
said in a loud booming voice, &quot;&lt;b&gt;Young one, you know about the
legend of the squirrels paradise.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed more of a question rather than a statement. I
answered, &quot;Nope, never heard of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appearing a little perturbed at my response, he continued to
speak to me in such a voice that it bore into my mind, forcing
understanding upon my thoughts. &quot;&lt;b&gt;Long ago began a legend that
somewhere there existed a place, a most wonderful place, a place
that every squirrel could call paradise. It was the Squirrels'
Paradise. I searched for most of my life to find such a place. I am
now one thousand two hundred and thirty-four years old.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wow, that's pretty old, for a squirrel,&quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;What? Oh, quit interrupting me. Of course it's old. I
searched most of my life for a place that every squirrel could call
paradise. ...Young one,&lt;/b&gt;&quot; he called to me, forcing his words on
my thoughts. He slowly held his arms out to the sides. He looked to
the left, then to the right, then back at me, peering into my mind
again. &quot;&lt;b&gt;Young one...this...IS...the Squirrels'
Paradise!&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wow!&quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;As old as I am, I do wonder about something. Why are you
talking to squirrels? Are you some kind of nut?&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, the old tree rat darted away, scurrying across
the ground to a nearby tree, and climbed up high to disappear into
the thick of the leaves above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br/&gt;—cantuland     </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;You find yourself at the Arkansas River. This place looks like a
good spot to build a giant arch gateway for a new &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot;
expedition to canoe through. We could have a re-enactment using
members of the Wichita Geocaching Society to get a canoe, dress up
in attire suitable for all-weather exploring (geocaching), and
explore this area with today's version of mapping gear (GPS
receiver). Who's going to play the part of Sacagawea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my &quot;artist's rendering&quot; of what the area would look like
viewed from a future spinning restaurant at the top of a hotel that
would be built nearby. It even shows a new bridge going to
Huckleberry Finn Land in Derby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area is owned by the City of Wichita, so maybe there are
plans for future development of this area. Maybe not. I don't know.
Until then, there are geocaches in the area to find (and more
later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is a short hike to a secluded spot next to the Arkansas
River. Sunrise from here is an awesome site. Park at a convenient
spot south of the geocache and take the path to the north to enter
the catacombs, or hike west to the berm, then north along the top
of the berm until you're ready to go into the thick of things. The
area is abundant with wildlife. While driving in to the area I saw
four deer stop at the side of the road as if the first was telling
the rest to look both ways before crossing the road. They didn't
bolt until I crossed their path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waterworld Gateway was planned for another spot, but you know
how it goes if you wait too long; you snooze, you lose. So now the
title is for this spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Container is a &lt;b&gt;HUGE&lt;/b&gt; one, and tethered in the event that
flood waters try to carry it off. This is the launching point for a
Geocaching Colorado (GCCO) Geocoin (TB23P6H)
   that was given to me by
   Buzz Lightyear I at the 2008 Meades Ranch
   tour. There's room in that box for big stuff, too. Weight
   yourself down before you come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br/&gt;—cantuland    </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This geocache is your basic one-stage traditional normal-sized
ammo box geocache. Just go to the posted coordinates and there it
is. The location, however, makes this one a little more difficult
than the average geocache. I rate it a 3/5. 5 on trudging through
the terrain, then about a 3 on overall difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been eyeing this location for quite a while; I had been
enchanted by this spot. Every day of driving by it made me glance
over and think to myself, &quot;Someday, someday.&quot; Well, now it's done.
I finally put a geocache in this spot and now, as the crazy
character said in the movie Braveheart, &quot;it's my island.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to do your research first before going out for this one.
Check out the online maps. I would suggest parking at the posted coordinates for
the geocache &quot;Park at the River&quot;. From there it's a long
hike, or swim, or boat ride, or whatever however. You can park
wherever you wish, but that's where I park. You might get wet on
this one. Safety first: bring adequate supplies and equipment, cell
phone, water bottle, whistle, spare batteries, etc.; bring a buddy;
notify someone of your intent; all that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a black ammo box with a
cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides. It's chained to about
head high and will likely stay that way. Contents include a 2007
dollar coin, a Kansas buffalo quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition
nickel, a bracelet hand crafted by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland,
and other miscellaneous trade goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br/&gt;—cantuland     </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;You see two planes, BIG ones. No you don't; someone else does. There are numbers on the tails. Have this imaginary person write down the numbers on the tails of the big planes. That's stage one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculate coordinates for Stage Two:&lt;br/&gt;
Use the numbers you got from the planes...I mean the numbers that &quot;your friend&quot; got from the planes. The number from the south plane (Which one was the south plane?) we'll call ABCDE. The number from the north plane we'll call FGHIJ. Now comes some confusing math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If A is greater than or equal to FIVE, then add THREE to it; that is your new A.
If A is less than FIVE, then add ZERO to it; that is your new A.
Optionally, you could subtract ZERO instead of adding, whichever you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each of B,C,D and E:&lt;br/&gt;
If the number is greater than or equal to FOUR, then add FOUR.
If the number is less than FOUR, then add ONE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For F and G:&lt;br/&gt;
If the number is greater than or equal to FIVE, then subtract FOUR.
If the number is less than FIVE, then add THREE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For H,I and J:&lt;br/&gt;
If the number is greater than or equal to FIVE, then subtract EIGHT.
If the number is less than FIVE, then add EIGHT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have new numbers ABCDE and FGHIJ. The next stage is at coordinates of&lt;br/&gt;
N 37*AB.CDE' W 097*FG.HIJ'&lt;br/&gt;
where you will find coordinates to another stage. When you can't find anything at your calculated coordinates, then have a seat and bring a mirror to put at your heels...just for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final is a tall lock-N-lock plastic container with goodies. Watch out for low flying aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Stage four tells you details to project a waypoint to the final, so make sure you're up on knowing how to do that in general.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is a geocache that I had been wanting to get around to hiding for a very long time. Finally I got it set. Now it's your turn to chase down the coordinates and find it! The container is hidden right out in the open. You may want to bring some binoculars on your &lt;i&gt;first visit&lt;/i&gt; ... to look at the ducks up close, of course. When I was looking to place a cache in this park, I found the remnants of an old cache very near this one. You may even find the remnants in your attempt to find this one. If you're looking for this cache and you find the empty coffee tin, then you haven't seen &lt;b&gt;Over the rainbow&lt;/b&gt;, so keep looking. Also, there is another cache nearby, GCYVM7, that mentions a letterbox that was found when Lunartear was scouting around to place that cache. So I figure that this park used to contain hundreds of caches and letterboxes, but then the Wicked Witch arrived and they all disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the difficulty level for this cache. You can claim it as a find &lt;b&gt;only if you sign the logbook&lt;/b&gt;. After you sign the logbook, please place the cache back as it was (or should have been). Pay attention to how the stuff is put together. I made it so that it can be retrieved using a number of ways. Put it back the same way. I debated whether or not it should be a difficulty of 5, but after pondering on the matter for ages, I settled on the 5; let me know if it's worthy. I considered making this the final location to a difficult puzzle, but then the puzzle itself would get in the way of the fun for many people. I considered having this as the final location of a multistage geocache, but I wanted to post coordinates for this spot. So here you go. Get the coordinates and track it down. That's all. It's that &quot;easy&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a small mug/thermos with cammo and black duct tape all over it. Contents include one of those new one dollar coins, two Kansas buffalo quarters, two Lewis-and-Clark edition nickels, a bracelet hand crafted by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and a few other tiny miscellaneous trade goodies. Put on your stealthing caps for this one. Every now and then, a new Dorothy crew comes traveling down the yellow pathway, walks nearby, makes the loop at the end, makes a second pass and disappears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This park is a nice one; however, it has some restrictive visiting hours.&lt;br/&gt;
Winter hours: 8 a.m. - &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; p.m.&lt;br/&gt;
Summer hours: 8 a.m. - &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt; p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in this park, you can find some outdoor Wizard of Oz art, including a yellow brick road. There is a little train for grandpuppies to ride, and paddleboats available to get you out on the water. Ducks and geese are here year-round. Watch out when you drive up to certain parking areas, because they all know that the one who begs the loudest will get the treats. When Halloween rolls around, the Haunted Island in this park is one of the awesomest places to check out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br/&gt;—cantuland    </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We always enjoyed finding and trading stuff in caches, not the little nano caches that don't have any trading items in them. Then too we are always disappointed at the &quot;Tragedy of the Commons&quot; where the quality of cache swag degrades over time, so we built this big cache for big stuff, and stocked it with a virtual smorgasbord of swag. Remember, it's huge. Trade some big stuff. You can trade real stuff or you can trade &quot;virtual&quot; stuff. Right now it's only filled with virtual swag. Be sure to trade up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Virtual Swag Ideas:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use your imagination and sense of humor when deciding what to take and what to leave. Think BIG. The original virtual contents: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Life sized plaster-of-paris busts of the classical composers, each one wearing a pair of Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses. (Except Beethoven. He's on &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; piano.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elvis's last known pair of Blue Suede Shoes, size 15, with blue suede laces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A 1970's vintage microwave french-toast cooker, made of aluminum. (Yes it was recalled by the CPSC soon after product release, but what the heck, still collectable).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A set of metric and SAE lug wrenches, none of which will fit the lugnuts on your vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A life size plastic replica of the Rosetta Stone for your dashboard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The complete and unabridged fourteen-volume set of the history of Park City Kansas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A 22-LP set chronicling the heretofore unknown solo career of Cub Koda, the guitarist who formed the band &quot;Brownsville Station,&quot; (big hit: &quot;Smokin' in the Boys Room&quot;) in 1969. &quot;Spanning the decades of the 70's, 80's, 90's, and today.&quot; With lyrics printed on genuine hemp-fiber paper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sheet Music compilation, the complete works of Liberace including the unchained &quot;medleys,&quot; large print edition, with faux plastic Liberace collector rings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The transmission and clutch plate from a 1985 DeLorean, in stainless steel.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The transporter control panel from the USS Enterprise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one is quite near the parking lot so you don't have to haul your &quot;Hugh Jazz&quot; stuff very far to trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE HIDE THE CACHE WHEN FINISHED LOGGING.&lt;/b&gt; It needs to blend in well as it is very near the muggle trail. Use the natural materials in the area to make a good pile on top of it. If you found the cache sitting out in the open, that's not going to keep it from getting muggled so please &lt;i&gt;PLEASE&lt;/i&gt; re-hide it under logs and debris so that it isn't out in the open.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache idea based on two Austin-area caches:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Spur of the Moment Swag-less Cache!&quot; (GCJCW2) by Grajek and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Virtual Reality&quot; (GCHC66) by The Outlaw. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This cache was originally placed by &lt;i&gt;Hugh Jazz and his lovely wife Laura Jazz&lt;/i&gt;, who had to pursue life among the geocaches in far away lands. &lt;i&gt;cantuland&lt;/i&gt; adopted this geocache on January 15, 2007, to keep the magic alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br/&gt;—cantuland</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This puzzle doesn't require
much more than following the instructions and adding and
subtracting. No sudden intuitive leap of understanding or
epiphanous burst of insight is required to solve this puzzle. Just
follow the directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to the posted
coordinates. There you will find a mural on the side of a building.
You don't even have to get out of your car. Here's what part of the
mural looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the right end of the
painting you can find some numbers in boxes, four wide black boxes.
You will use these numbers to calculate the coordinates of the
geocache. The &quot;page&quot; is tilted a little bit. References like
&quot;top-right&quot; refer to the top-right corner of the painted page as if
you had the page in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE&lt;/b&gt;: Ignore any
dashes painted on the left edge of the numbers. The top-left number
and the bottom-right number have negative signs that we're not
interested in. We don't care if the number is positive or negative;
we're just interested in the number, not the sign. (For those with
knowledge of mathematical terminology, we'll use the &quot;absolute
value&quot; of these numbers.) Double-check that your numbers match
those on the mural. Incorrectly recording these numbers would make
for a disappointing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;CALCULATE LATITUDE NORTH:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The degrees is your typical
&quot;37&quot; like everything else around here. Now for the minutes. The
minutes, including its decimal part, is calculated by starting with
the number in the top-left box (ignore that negative sign). Add to
it the number in the top-right. Next subtract the bottom-left
number. Then subtract the bottom-right number from it. The result
is the North-Coordinate of the geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;CALCULATE LONGITUDE WEST:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Longitude-West
coordinate, use &quot;97&quot; for the degrees; that's what everything else
is around here. Now take the number in the top-right and write it
down four times. Add up all those four numbers. Next take the
number in the bottom-left and write it down three times. Add up
those three numbers like you just did for the previous number. Now
add your first group of four to your second group of three. After
that you're working with one number now. This number will probably
do for you as it is, but we're not done yet. To this number, add
&quot;0.0038&quot; for better results. This is your final result. This result
is the minutes and decimal minutes of the West-Coordinate of the
geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;DONE!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now have complete
coordinates of the hidden geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a black
ammo box with a cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides.
Contents include a Sacagawea gold dollar coin, a Kansas buffalo
quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, a beautiful bracelet
hand crafted by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and other
miscellaneous trade goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br/&gt;—cantuland    </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Wichita
&quot;Intrust Bank&quot; Arena.&lt;br/&gt;
The geocache you seek is elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wichita Arena is
centrally located in Wichita, Kansas. Within these walls you will
find the most amazing things. Sometimes there are creatures inside
that find their way out of the confines of these walls. Be on the
lookout for this possibility when you visit this site. These
creatures are the most unusual kind of creature - sometimes very
furry, other times hairless - the type of creature that seems to
randomly walk around looking, not at the amazing city sites, but
rather entranced at staring at a device held in front of the face,
as if hypnotized into following every command from the device.
These creatures seem to dance around like a drunken bee. Reports
have come in that it is their nature to freeze like a hunting dog
when they see a similar device held in the hands of a
&lt;i&gt;regular&lt;/i&gt; human being. If you see a creature of the likes of
this, proceed with caution. For your safety, you may yell out, &quot;I
FOUND IT,&quot; forcing these creatures to become temporarily
disoriented from their staring entrancement. Previous attempts at
this, however, have resulted in the creatures becoming crazed and
startling them into rushing toward you in a frenzy which at first
appears threatening, but once these creatures get within close
proximity, they will immediately stop their approach and begin to
thoroughly scour the ground around your feet. So far, all contact
with these unusual creatures have reported a non-violent outcome.
You have been warned.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The geocache is at:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;NORTH 37° AB.CD'&lt;br/&gt;
WEST 97° E.FG'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve the coordinates and
find the geocache, you need to take a tour of the outside of this
arena and answer some questions. The answers to the questions will
allow you to calculate the coordinates for the location of this
geocache. The calculation requires only some counting, some
addition and some subtraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;____ &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;. How many sets
of double-doors are at Entrance &quot;B&quot;? One pair of doors counts as
&quot;1&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;____ &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;. Along the
north side of the Arena there are some short concrete pillars that
are about two and a half feet tall and about 10 inches in diameter.
Starting from the west end and counting towards the east, stop when
you get to the 48th pillar. At the base of this pillar is a secret
message written on an iron plaque. It's a short message. Find the
difference between the number of vowels and the number of
consonants in this message. Then add 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;____ &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;. Continue
counting the pillars from Question B above. Count all the short
concrete pillars from the west end all the way to the east end. At
the east end, the line of pillars bends and heads towards the
building using just a few more pillars. Be sure to include those
pillars too in your count. After you get a number, add three to
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;____ &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;. On the west
side of the Arena are two sets of stairs. We're interested only in
one set. They are both the same so it doesn't matter which you
choose. When you are at the top of the steps, how many steps does
it take to get to the bottom? In other words, how many times do you
have to move a leg to change your elevation to a lower place? Once
you have that number, subtract 1 from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;____ &lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;. On the north
side of the Arena building there is a canopy sheltering the
walkway. How many long thin beams support the canopy outside to
keep it suspended in the air? There are more on the north edge than
on the south edge of the canopy. What's the total? Now subtract 1
from that total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;____ &lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;. On the south
side of the Arena is a small parking lot filled with handicap
parking stalls and 3 stalls for 15-minute-parking. How many stalls
are there all together? You can also count the number of vertically
posted signs marking each parking stall. Be sure to include the
three stalls for 15-minute-parking in your count. Now you have a
number that is made of two digits, one number in the &quot;one's&quot; place
and another number in the &quot;ten's&quot; place. &lt;b&gt;Subtract&lt;/b&gt; the ten's
digit number from the one's digit number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;____ &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;. The parking
lot mentioned in Question &quot;F&quot; has a retaining wall running along
the north edge of all the parking stalls. At the far west end of
the retaining wall is a secret message, two words, each ending with
the letter &quot;A&quot;. How many letters make up these words? Duplicate
letters increase the letter count. (For example, if one word was
&quot;SECRET&quot;, the number from that word would be 6 even though the
letter &quot;E&quot; was used twice.) To this number, add another number. The
other number is the quantity of hand rails found at one of the two
sets of steps mentioned in Question &quot;D&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have all you need to
calculate the coordinates of the geocache. Substitute the letters
in the coordinates with the answers to the above questions. The
hidden geocache is about a three-mile drive from the posted
coordinates, depending on how you drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a
plastic peanutbutter jar cammoed up to blend in with the
surroundings. Contents include a Sacagawea gold dollar coin, a
Kansas buffalo quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, one of
those new pennies with a different back to commemorate Abraham
Lincoln, a 3-D &quot;Egyptian&quot; dollar, a beautiful bracelet hand crafted
by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and other miscellaneous trade
goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br/&gt;—cantuland     </groundspeak:long_description>

of the Plains Plaza. Visit the site, and answer some questions. Use
the answers to come up with coordinates of a geocache hidden in
Wichita, Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geocache is a 50-calibur ammo box painted black with a
cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides. Original contents
include a 2007 dollar coin, two Kansas buffalo quarters, two
Lewis-and-Clark edition buffalo nickels, a bracelet hand crafted by
the wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and other miscellaneous trade
goodies. When you head for the final coordinates, you will be able
to drive right by it. However, parking right by it would rouse
muggle-suspicion and may compromise the future of this cache. Good
&quot;tact&quot; would be to park in either of two parking lots nearby, so
that you can use stealth when you get close. On your final stretch
and while you have the container, please keep an eye out for
muggles. There is a place close to the container where you can go
to be &quot;invisible&quot;, if needed, when ducking for cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** The location of the geocache is at coordinates of&lt;br/&gt;
** North &lt;strong&gt;AB°CD.EFG'&lt;/strong&gt;, West
&lt;strong&gt;HI°JK.LMN'&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the plaza tour to find out what numbers to plug in for the
letters. You will have to do some searching at the plaza, some
reading, some adding and some subtracting for this one. No
multiplication is necessary. No hunting for microcaches is
necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a major tourist attraction, the Keeper of the Plains Plaza
is a great place for taking photographs. Photos are encouraged as
long as you don't upload photos that give away answers. Any spoiler
pictures will be removed. The questions are designed so that you
can enjoy uploading some good pictures without ruining this
puzzle-cache for other geocachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are your questions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the south end of the south pedestrian bridge, what is the
number of parallel bars that make up a hand-rail alongside the
steps?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;B&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add B.1 to B.2; then, from that result, subtract B.3; and after
all that, add ONE to it (Otherwise you'll end up in Oklahoma).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B.1: ESTEEMED PARTNERS - How many letters are in the last
word?&lt;/p&gt;

word?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.2: How many italic lines of text are in the plaque entitled
&quot;CITY OF WICHITA Arkansas River Corridor Improvement Project&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;F&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add F.1 and F.2; then subtract that amount from F.3; now add
F.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F.1: THE CEREMONIAL PIPE - How many puffs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many letters are in the 3rd word of the 8th line of the
paragraph that ends with, &quot;What follows is a brief account of their
vast and profound tradition.&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the north end of the north pedestrian bridge, there is a lone
lamp post with a stone/brick base. How many bricks are in the third
layer of bricks from the top, if you count the top &quot;flat&quot; layer as
the first layer?&lt;/p&gt;

roamed the Plains.&quot; What is the left character of this number?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.2: SACRED SONGS AND OBJECTS - How many letters are in the tall
word under this plaque?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;M&lt;/h3&gt;

the first sentence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discover the answers the questions above and you will have what
you need to find the geocache at the final coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** The location of the geocache is at coordinates of&lt;br/&gt;

Nearest parking is not too close but is probably a parking lot south of the cache. The container is a small loc-n-loc with cammo tape all around it. Inside are miscellaneous goodies that had been laying around for a while. I don't remember what's inside; I just dumped some stuff in there. Watch out for peering eyes. This one could be done at night, too, if you're careful.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;26APRIL2008: This geocache used to be called &quot;Sunrise Castle&quot; because of the view to the east. However, the current name is a much better one for this particular geocache. I considered using &quot;frogger&quot; ever since it first came out. I finally made the title change.

Adventure 2007&lt;/b&gt;, held in conjunction with &lt;b&gt;Riverfest XXXVI&lt;/b&gt;
in Wichita, Kansas. There was a drawing held on Saturday, May 19,
2007 from the First 10 To Find. A &lt;b&gt;trip to Costa Rica&lt;/b&gt; with
Backwoods Adventures was awarded as the Grand Prize.&lt;br/&gt;
Thank you to all who played, and remember, LIVE OUT LOUD!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special Thanks to cantuland, daviddafish and jennielynn for
their part in writing clues and general good behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #1:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the following coordinates, you'll find a number of tidbits
about Wichita history. One of these tidbits mentions the Santa Fe
railroad and its history here. There's a rather large dollar amount
mentioned. Of the six digits, only one of them is not a zero. What
is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 37° 41.242 W 097° 19.657&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #2:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 15th century, buffalo dominated the American plains
with numbers over 60 million. By 1900, less than 1,000 buffalo
remained. But thanks to federal regulation and careful breeding,
there are now about 30,000 buffalo in national parks and privately
owned rangeland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll find a buffalo at the following coordinates. Next to him,
you'll find a plaque with two dates on it. Add up all of the digits
of the two dates (should be every number on the plaque). Once
you've done that, add up all the digits of that number. Continue
adding until you're down to a single digit. Now, multiply that
number by 2 and you'll have the next portion of our coordinate for
our final location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 37° 41.695 W 097° 21.409&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #3:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on a mission for the Admiral to deliver a package. To
where? He did not know. I would find out on my journeys. The
Admiral, being an expert navigator told me where to find more
information. He equipped me with a personal navigation device, a
hand-held GPS receiver. Using this GPS receiver, I was to proceed
to coordinates of N 37º 41.487’ W 097º 20.990’ where I
would meet the Great Wise One. He would tell me what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to the given coordinates and met the Great Wise One. He
towered over me. He spoke with a deep booming voice, but I could
sense empathy in his words. The Great One took off his feathered
headdress and gave me instructions to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told me, “These feathers have adorned me for long
enough. I will keep one feather for myself and give you the rest.
Take your feathers to N 37º 40.173’ W 097º 20.121’
where you will meet a friend of mine. When you can look him in the
eye, then you will see the writing on the wall, two words. Give my
friend one feather for each letter of those words. He will know
where next to send you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With great respect, I departed and did as he said. I did meet
his friend and gave him the appropriate number of feathers. I could
hear wisdom from this man as well, “Thank you for these
feathers. They mean more to me than you could imagine. Time stands
still for some people. Go to N 37º 41.041’ W 097º
20.822’ where you will see time for many. Looking down you
can see time reserved for the future. Looking up, you can see time
in motion. Looking straight ahead, you will find where time stands
still for some people. You will find four numbers together where
time stands still. Add the right two numbers to get a new number.
Add the left two numbers to get a second new number. Subtract the
second new number from the first new number. This is how many
feathers you will leave there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did as he said and left the appropriate number of feathers for
time to do as it wished. After finding time for myself, I looked in
my hands at the remaining number of feathers, I knew now what had
been with me all along. This number of feathers is a number to be
used for the 2007 Backwoods Geocache Adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #4:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howdy, Pardner! Saddle up yer pony and ride over yonder to the
spot marked by these here coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 37° 45.636 W 097° 20.171&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do a little recollectin’ on those brave cowboys riding the
ranges of the past, while you examine a page out of Kansas history.
While yer at it, be sure to take some note of the year the first
Cattle Drive moved through these here parts. Fact is, the number
ya’ll have the opportunity to collect for this particular
day’s clue is none other than the last digit of the
aforementioned year in history! Alright Friend, your work here is
done – go rustle up some grub at the chuck wagon. Happy
Trails!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #5:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using your GPS receiver, you will need to go to all the
coordinates listed below. Each coordinate is at the location of a
Wichita organization. Once you have determined what the
organizations are, you will need to determine their physical street
addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The digit required for today’s clue is common in the
street number for the following organizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organization 1: N 37° 41.695 W 097° 20.376&lt;br/&gt;
Organization 2: N 37° 41.334 W 097° 20.920&lt;br/&gt;
Organization 3: N 37° 40.873 W 097° 20.734&lt;br/&gt;
Organization 4: N 37° 41.829 W 097° 21.809&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #6:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on a mission for the Admiral to deliver a package. To
where? He did not know. I would find out on my journeys. The
Admiral, being an expert navigator told me where to find more
information. He equipped me with a personal navigation device, a
hand-held GPS receiver. Using this GPS receiver, I was to proceed
to coordinates of N 37º 41.733’ W 097º 21.410’ where I
would meet people of a strange land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the journey to this land and found People of a sort that
I had never seen before. I think they had three legs! But I
couldn’t really tell the difference between their arms from
their legs. They were very friendly. When I confronted them with my
quest, they told me how unfortunate it was that they did not have
the answer I needed. They did know where to send me next, though.
They told me stories of others much like them, the People of the
Shaw. We had a great time telling adventurous stories. In the end,
each Person gave me a token, a strange cube inscribed with symbols
I had never seen before. They told me to go to N 37º 43.288’
W 097º 17.580’ where I would find People of the Shaw much
like them. These, however, would be People of much better
intelligence to aid me in obtaining the knowledge that I sought.
When I met them, I was to give each Person one of these tokens to
prove where I had come from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did as instructed and met more of the strange looking People
of the Shaw. To each Person here I gave a token. After more fun and
stories, they then told me what I needed to know. They told me,
“Look at the number of tokens left in my hands. That is the
number which will be used for the 2007 Backwoods Geocache
Adventure. With intelligence, much can be accomplished.” I
thanked them for their expert information, then continued on my
journeys for the Admiral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #7:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 37° 41.159 W 097° 19.915&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YLU BFCUQNO LUS SDN TLON!&lt;br/&gt;
SDN KUJANQ YLU RNNH FR&lt;br/&gt;
SDN KUJANQ BLUQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #8:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bricks aren’t the only yellow rock Kansas is known for.
Discover the primary composition of this useful rock to uncover the
number needed to finish the coordinates below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 37° 41.460 W 097° _.847&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journey to the coordinates, but beware, or the bells will toll
and you’ll go the way of The Wicked Witch. BOO! Did I scare
you? Quoting some old friends (very old friends), “hope you
guess my name.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clue #9:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was on a mission for the Admiral to deliver a package. To
where? He did not know. I would find out on my journeys. The
Admiral, being an expert navigator told me where to find more
information. He equipped me with a personal navigation device, a
hand-held GPS receiver. Using this GPS receiver, I was to proceed
to coordinates of N 37º 40.766’ W 097º 20.286’ where I
would meet those who would help me on my mission and welcome them
to the great land of Wichita. The Admiral gave me many, many GPS
receivers to give to each of the new recruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to the coordinates and could see them coming, with great
sails high in the air. When they arrived, I saw the duty and honor
in the knights in shining armor as they stood tall and protective,
some on my left and some on my right. I was told that these knights
would join me on my journey. I gave them each a GPS receiver and we
were ready to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These knights and I then ventured to new coordinates of N 37º
43.022’ W 097º 24.456’ where we would be joined with
additional members. At this place I saw creatures of many distant
lands. Those who joined us looked similar to the knights in shining
armor in that they stood tall and orderly, towering over me, but
they wrapped themselves in clothes of living plants. When they all
joined our crew, our numbers almost tripled. I gave them each a GPS
receiver, and we were a fine crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had one more stop to gather our numbers. We traveled then to
new coordinates where we almost lost ourselves in the night with
all of the twists and turns of the pathways. Just as we were about
to turn back, we saw something glowing in the distance. Pursuing
the light, we eventually were greeted by those we had been seeking.
We found ourselves at coordinates of N 37º 41.695’ W 097º
22.240’ where all of the tall people of light agreed to join
us. I did feel so short among so many towering crewmembers. I doled
out the rest of the GPS receivers and we were on our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With such a large number of crewmembers, we changed course and
headed for coordinates of N 37º 41.784’ W 097º 12.856’
where we knew we faced a challenge. This was the land of the
roaring dragons. Our destination was to travel to the other side of
the land of dragons. We found a pathway under the mountain that
would keep us from the need to cross over the forbidden mountain.
As we approached the opening of the tunnel, we knew that not all of
us would make it to the other end. I counted how many were in our
party. We came up with a plan. It would be close. We all decided to
continue anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We entered the dark opening. As we traveled in the tunnel, we
could hear the dragons roaring above. Unexpectedly, our GPS
receivers failed us before we made it to the other side. Which way
were we to go? The dragons continued to roar above the mountain.
The ground vibrated with the roaring. We continued with the plan.
On our way through the tunnel, one by one, someone would make the
sacrifice of staying to hold up the tunnel ceiling, ensuring the
safety for the rest of the crew. And so it was, as we made our trek
through the tunnel, one of our numbers would stay to hold up the
tunnel ceiling. The plan took many of our numbers. Looking back, I
could see the long line of them, tall and proud, to forever support
the tunnel, for us and also for all who would later travel the
tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan took a toll on our numbers, but we did make it to the
other side. I counted how many were left. The rest of our crew had
to stay with the tunnel. These honorable few who made it through
the tunnel, these would be the ones who would stand to be counted
at the end of this journey. They were the tall ones left. Not being
near as tall as any of them, I did not count myself among their
numbers. The number of tall ones who made it through the tunnel,
this is the number to be used for the 2007 Backwoods Geocache
Adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

Took a ball cap.
Left a red feather and a travel bug (Elf in search of a home).

Thanks for putting on such an awesome event.  Can't wait till next year!

   AT THE POSTED COORDINATES!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, however, hidden somewhere in Sedgwick County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puzzle will have you visiting places all over the state.
Since my career takes me to diverse places in search of legal
descriptions of deeds, easements, right-of-way, titlework and legal
mumbo-jumbo like that, I decided to share my experiences. Take a
tour of these places so that you will gather the necessary
knowledge that is required to find this geocache. Before you start
your vehicle's engine, be sure you know exactly where you are going
and why, especially why. Otherwise you may waste a considerable
amount of fuel learning tons of information that is totally
irrelevant to the task at hand. Each of these places will help you
find parts of the final coordinates. Visit all of them to get the
completed coordinates of the final location. Let's see where I've
been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The posted coordinates are within 10 miles of the true location. This puzzle involves two triangles, one named LAT and one named LONG.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The geocache sits at one corner of the first triangle called LAT. A muggle is 500 feet away from the geocache and to the left, and is at another corner of the triangle called LAT. Another muggle is twice that distance plus 13 more feet away, but to the right of the geocache, and is at the last corner of the triangle called LAT. The muggles happen to be 689 feet apart from each other.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unsuspecting muggles wander aimlessly as they tend to do, and, by chance, start getting closer. Now one of the muggles is 100 feet away to the left of the geocache, and at a corner of the triangle called LONG. The other muggle has wandered to a place that is triple that distance plus 24 more feet away from the geocache and to the right, and is at the last corner of the triangle called LONG. The two muggles are now 351 feet apart.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The geocache is at the corners of each triangle. Find the interior angles of LAT and LONG where the geocache sits, and you will have the geocache's latitude and longitude. Find the geocache before the two muggles accidentally mess it up.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cache container is an ammo box with cammo duct tape all around it. Original contents include two Lewis-and-Clark edition buffalo nickels, two Kansas buffalo quarters, a bracelet hand crafted by Mrs. cantuland, miscellaneous trade items, and an Altoids tin filled with LUCKY PENNIES (and they really have brought me good luck too).

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The geocache is not at the posted coordinates. If you went to
the posted coordinates without reading any of this, then you were
probably looking for the geocache hidden somewhere around a big
&quot;travel bug&quot; and didn't find it. So, since you didn't find it at
the travel bug and are here reading this now, let's get on with the
puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MANTISSA is defined as the fractional part of a floating-point
number...and a floating-point number is an approximate
representation of a real number value in scientific notation,
consisting of a fractional part (mantissa) and an exponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...whatever...It seems as if this puzzle has some useless
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin, let's find the abscissa of the mantissa. At the posted
coordinates you will find &quot;The Great Mantissa&quot;. The abscissa
increases in the cardinal direction that the Mantissa is facing.
The ordinate increases in the cardinal direction to the Mantissa's
left. This will be our arbitrary &quot;User Coordinate System&quot;. Sounds
like a lot of mumbo jumbo to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geocache is at the intersection of three lines. Only two are
needed, any two, but you get three lines so you can check yourself.
The three lines originate from three different points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first line originates from an abscissa of &lt;b&gt;30&lt;/b&gt; and an
ordinate of &lt;b&gt;8,442,038&lt;/b&gt;. On the way from this point of origin
and heading for the geocache, this line will pass through another
point that has an abscissa of &lt;b&gt;26,000&lt;/b&gt; and an ordinate of
&lt;b&gt;8,450,942&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second line originates from an abscissa of &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; and an
ordinate of &lt;b&gt;5,795,222&lt;/b&gt;. The second line passes through a
point that has an abscissa of &lt;b&gt;88,365&lt;/b&gt; and an ordinate of
&lt;b&gt;5,888,000&lt;/b&gt; as it heads for the geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third line originates from an abscissa of &lt;b&gt;1,959,997&lt;/b&gt;
and an ordinate of &lt;b&gt;50&lt;/b&gt; and heads for the geocache while
passing through a point having an abscissa of &lt;b&gt;2,700,000&lt;/b&gt; and
an ordinate of &lt;b&gt;4,036,430&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intersection of the three lines passes through the
coordinates of the geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have calculated the coordinates of the geocache, you
can easily convert the coordinates from our User Coordinate System
into WGS84 Latitude and Longitude coordinates in the typical format
that geocachers are used to dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first (okay, maybe not at first but maybe later) it may look
like some vital information is left out, but I believe you have all
the information you need to solve this mystery of the ABSCISSA OF
THE MANTISSA (said with a loud booming voice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a black ammo box with a
cantuland-geocache-logo painted on the sides. It is within one mile
of the posted coordinates. Contents include a Sacagawea gold dollar
coin, a Kansas buffalo quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, a
beautiful bracelet hand crafted by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland,
and other miscellaneous trade goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br/&gt;—cantuland    </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Cheney State Park and the 2011 KWPT State Parks Challenge! This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas. The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching
 for specific details and instructions.


Cheney Reservoir was constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation and was finished in 1965.  The lake consists of 9,600 surface acres of water.  The State Park consists of 1,913 acres in three counties on the South end of the lake, both on the East shore and West Shore.   Located in windy central Kansas, the lake offers excellent sailing.   In fact, national sailing regattas take place at Cheney.  It’s a breathtaking sight to see more than 100 multicolored sailboats on the lake at one time.

The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name! Keep all of your certificates together as you travel across our beautiful state completing the Challenge. At the end of the Challenge, mail your entry forms and all collected certificates to KWPT to become eligible for prizes such as camping permits, annual park permits, and more. Completed entry forms and all collected certificates must be received by KWPT by November 1, 2011. See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching
 for complete details and instructions.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The posted coordinates are bogus. I picked the center of a
random body of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This geocache requires that you solve &lt;b&gt;THREE&lt;/b&gt; puzzles (with multiple parts for each).
The first is the hard part, very hard, so I don't think you'll find
this geocache. I suggest that you stop reading further right now.
Give it up. It's too hard for you. The second puzzle works off of
the first, and will make you think; it's a toughy too. The last
puzzle is just a &quot;simple&quot; waypoint projection to the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who finds this one is considered by me to be a really
good puzzle solver; it is my honor to have come up with this puzzle
for anyone out there who can pierce through all the puzzle pieces
and come up with &quot;Something From Nothing&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you've been warned. So let's get to figuring out some
coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;** FIRST PUZZLE **&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to this puzzle does not have one, two or four in the
answer. It doesn't have five, six or eight in the answer, nor does
it have three, seven or nine in the answer. Perhaps that leaves you
with nothing, but whatever is left also does not have zero in the
answer. If you still have something left, then delete this
waypoint. Use what you have left to work the second puzzle. What do
you have left? Nothing? Surely there's something left. If you have
nothing from something, then start over. You should end up with
something from nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;** SECOND PUZZLE **&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the many results of the first puzzle (See, I told you that
you would have something.) you will find a road intersection. This
spot is the intersection of &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;th Street West and &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt;th
Street North. You will have to figure out what &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt; and
&lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt; mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's use the results from the first puzzle. &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt; is the 4th
result, 1st result, 7th result, 7th result again, and ending with
the 1st result. Add those together and you have your &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt; you will use the same set of results from the first
puzzle. Likewise, &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt; is the 5th result, 1st result, 6th
result, 2nd result, 3rd result and once again ending with the 1st
result. Add those together and you have your &lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is your second puzzle. The answer to the second puzzle is
not an obvious one, even when you have the first part of this
puzzle solved. I wish you luck with this one. In the end, you'll
find that you didn't need to know why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;** THIRD PUZZLE **&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one uses a simple projection from the results of the second
puzzle along with some basic math. Easy as pie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; is a number equal to&lt;br/&gt;
24 times the &quot;road that goes east&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;
whatever that means,&lt;br/&gt;
with 9 more added to that.&lt;br/&gt;
If you should happen to get a number larger than 360,&lt;br/&gt;
then subtract 360 so you have something that makes sense.&lt;br/&gt;
(Does any of this make sense?)&lt;br/&gt;
From the results of the second puzzle,&lt;br/&gt;
go on a projection of &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; degrees true with a distance of
0.255 mile&lt;br/&gt;
to get a projected location.&lt;br/&gt;
The geocache you seek is at this projected location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you have it. You should end up with the coordinates of the
final location. Now go find it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Tribute to &quot;barondriver&quot;)&lt;br/&gt;
If you can't figure out the puzzle, then just go out looking in all
of the likely places where it might be. Does that sound like a
ridiculous alternative? I would have thought so, but I'd suggest
that you tag along with &quot;barondriver&quot;, because he has stumbled upon
at least two of my geocaches without figuring out the final
coordinates! He'll probably find this one the same way. When you're
as good as he is, you just throw out the GPS receiver and blindly
walk directly to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puzzle-cache is going to be a tough one. Hints are now
available. If you need a hint, send me an email and let me know what you
   have tried so far. I'll tell you what's next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a small-sized plastic loc-n-loc container.
Contents include a tiny logbook, a tiny pencil, a few little tiny
glass things, and a beautiful bracelet hand crafted by the
wonderful Mrs. cantuland (a nice three-strand bracelet with
sterling silver beads, a nice bracelet for a really tough
puzzle-cache).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br/&gt;—cantuland    </groundspeak:long_description>

We also left a camera so you can show us who you are. The area is
shady in spots, so we ask that you try to shoot your picture in the
sun. Map of the area at http://www.gpnc.org/ccpmap.htm Update
11/11/01 Be sure and visit the other cache in this park while you
are here. Checked the cache, since no one has logged our special
Cache prize, a XL Navy blue T-shirt, with an American Flag on it. I
didn't update difficulty to be in line with the new geocaching
standard above. According to it, this would be 2/3/5. Your milage
may vary! In keeping with the cache rules, I took the candy someone
left. Saw that a few had signed the log book, and haven't updated
the geocaching web site yet, must be those closet geocachers!! :)

I couldn't believe it; she crossed on a makeshift log footbridge over a muddy waterway; she hunkered down and walked under the low branches; she braved the woods and came out with a tick and a spider.  I thought for a second that she might just lay on the mud and start an army crawl towards the geocache but luckily for her sake (and mine) it didn't come to that. Wow!</groundspeak:text>

Chisholm Trail. Discover the rest of these geocaches listed with
Series #1 at Geocaching.com waypoint number GC19T3P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coordinates take you to one of the Chisholm Trail markers.
This marker seems as if it is hidden away. The only path to it is
from the west down a dirt road. You can't get to it from the
interstate highway. You'll have to take the scenic route. Be
cautious if you try this one when the roads are wet, because this
road shows signs of ruts where the road has tried to swallow
vehicle tires and strand motorists in such a remote location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a geocache that is offset from the marker. From the
posted coordinates project a waypoint to the east (farther down the
dead end). Use a bearing of 91 degrees true and a distance of 0.16
miles. The geocache is at this projection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a clear plastic Loc-N-Loc container.
Contents include a Sacagawea gold dollar coin, a Kansas buffalo
quarter, a Lewis-and-Clark edition buffalo nickel, a beautiful
bracelet hand crafted by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and other
miscellaneous trade goodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;REMEMBER:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the fair trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log your visit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leave the site better than you found it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect the environment — always.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate those around you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find another cache!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, and may all your cache dreams come true.&lt;br/&gt;—cantuland    </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a number search, much like the book of word search
puzzles that you get at the grocery store registers. For your first
number, &lt;b&gt;135&lt;/b&gt;, look for this number in the square of numbers
above and circle it or cross it out. (Hint: top-right) Don't get
too sloppy. Do the same for the following list of numbers. They can
be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, forward and backward. They each
follow a straight line; no curvy squiggly ones. You will have a few
numbers left over that haven't been circled or crossed out. These
numbers, in order from left to right and top to bottom, make up the
coordinates of the final location for this geocache.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Sand Hills State Park and the 2011 KWPT State Parks Challenge! This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas. The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for specific details and instructions.


Sand Hills State Park, a 1,123 acre natural area, has been preserved for its sand dunes, grasslands, wetlands, and woodlands.  Popular activities at the park are hiking and horseback riding.  Other activities include hunting, bird watching, wildflower walks, jogging and just simple relaxation in the country.  There are 8 distinct trails within the park which are broken down into interpretive, hiking and horseback riding trails.  There are 14 miles of trails which weave in between 10 to 40 feet high sand dunes, through grasslands and trees, and around ponds.

The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name! Keep all of your certificates together as you travel across our beautiful state completing the Challenge. At the end of the Challenge, mail your entry forms and all collected certificates to KWPT to become eligible for prizes such as camping permits, annual park permits, and more. Completed entry forms and all collected certificates must be received by KWPT by November 1, 2011. See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for complete details and instructions.

setting this cache here. I considered it an interesting place;
perhaps you will too. It's just over a mile south of U.S. Hwy56,

traveling in the rain, because dirt roads become mud roads when
wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a small plastic
container with a speaker magnet attached. Contents include a
Sacagawea gold dollar coin, a Kansas buffalo quarter, a
Lewis-and-Clark edition nickel, a beautiful bracelet hand crafted
by the wonderful Mrs. cantuland, and other miscellaneous trade
goodies.&lt;/p&gt;

This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas. The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for specific details and instructions.


The refuge is located 6 miles north of Canton, in the very southeastern tip of the scenic Smoky Hills, an area of large rolling hills.   Principal vegetation is a warm-season mixed grass prairie with many species of grasses and forbs.  The dominant grass species are big bluestem, little bluestem, Indiangrass, switchgrass, and sideoats grama.  Forbs are abundant and numerous clumps of native sand plum and smooth sumac are scattered throughout the area.  Soils are mostly moderately deep sandy loams.  Principal management techniques used on the area are prescribed fire and grazing by bison and elk, including herd management to maintain proper grazing levels.  Primary use of the area is wildlife viewing.  The Maxwell Refuge is the only location in Kansas where public herds of both bison and elk can be viewed in a native prairie environment. It is home to the state's largest public herd of bison.

Kansas’ oldest recreation area includes more than 15,000 acres of rolling hills, bluffs, and woods.  Kanopolis Reservoir at normal pool covers 3,000 acres and is located just off Highway K-141, 33 miles southwest of Salina.  Construction of the reservoir’s dam began in 1940 but was halted in 1942 due to World War II.  Construction resumed in 1946, and the project was completed in 1948.  Kanopolis offers 27.38 miles of trails open to hikers, mountain bikers, and horseback riders, 15.3 of which are on the Smoky Hill Wildlife Area.  Experience all they have to offer, but be aware, it can take more than a day to complete some trails on foot, and you won’t be able to camp along the way.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Take a short hike in a great historical local park. You can approach this cache several ways. You are looking for a regular cache in a green ammo can, with trade items.

About a hundred years ago a small company was built in the town north of this cache by a man named C. L. Brown. This little company (telephone exchange) later became known as Sprint, now Sprint Nextel. This park is a gift to the community of Abilene from the man who became successfull building that company and this park is named not for him but his parents. The Brown Memorial Park currently includes a retirement home, a small camp with cabins you can rent ( it used to be a girls camp ) and the local council boy scout camp. It at one time had a grist mill, small lake for swimming fishing and boating and zoo. The Brown Foundation continues to maintain the park and home and they both have some interesting history. C. L. Brown and Family members are buried just next of the boy scout camp. This cache is in memory of my Dad who I spent lots of time fun times here. My dad for many years served on the Brown Foundation Board, he loved this place. You could find this cache from several approaches. You can get to it by trail (except the last 100 ft or so) or you could do some &quot;field work&quot; or be brave and bushwack most of the way. Close to the cache is an area that used to be used for camp outs. Look for the ammo can nearby. It contains some trade items, including a flash light for FTF. Please hide well, even though this may seem remote, this area is heavily used by the local teens (myself included but thats ancient history). </groundspeak:long_description>

 This cache is located in Brown Memorial Park, To find it you must go out onto &quot;the island&quot; via the nature trail there used to be a zoo here. During high water this area still can become an island but the park long ago stopped pumping water into the lake area which is now a milo field. You are looking for a od green cookie tin with the usual log book and trade items. There is a new camo cap for ftf. After you find the cache go ahead and take the rest of the nature trail its a great walk in the woods and there are some interesting historical points along the way.</groundspeak:long_description>

You have permission to hunt this cache, but the tenants in the farmhouse request NO night caching.

If you look to the north you will see the house where I grew up. The house was built in 1900, and there is a plaque in the attic that says it was started May 3. According to stories handed down the house cost $2600 to build, and the guy that had it built went bankrupt shortly after because of that.I lived in the house until I was 25, when we built the home we live in now. My brother and I still own the house along with 80 acres of ground on the west side of the road, and we own 120 acres on the east side where the pond and my multi-cache, &quot;Overlook the Obvious&quot; is located

You are looking for a 30 cal. ammo can. It should be pretty easy to spot, as there is little or no muggle activity here. Cache started with a log book, pencil, several pens, and miscellaneous swag. There is a ready made micro cache for whomever wants it. I won't call it a FTF prize, but if the first to find wants to take it that is fine. Whomever takes it does not need to trade anything, All other finders please trade even, trade up, or don't trade.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is located along a seemingly little-known trail
called the Yankton Lake Loop. It can be reached from the North or
the South, the hike from the north is a little more difficult but
not terribly so. Access from the south begins at Chief White Crane
campground.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;While camping at Chief White Crane, we noticed a small
hand-written sign referring to the &quot;Yankton Lake Loop&quot; (4.5 miles
by the way) and asked one of the park employees for a map. No such
map exists.. We took it upon ourselves then, to walk the trail one
morning and find where it would come out on the other end. Along
the way, we enjoyed the scenery and wildlife and found it odd that
no geocaches had been placed along this trail (even though there
are several in the campground). We marked a likely spot, came back
the next day to check our coordinates and dropped off a mid-sized
Lock-N-Lock. Initial contents were: logbook, pencil, rain poncho,
calculator, small multi-tool, retractable cell-phone charger, CITO
bag and a Moose TB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No guarantees on the winter friendliness of this cache, the hike
to the cache may be pretty long if you're not dressed for the
cold.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; On July 7, 2007, I married my wife (Mrs. IgottaFind) at the Olivet
United Methodist Church not too far from this location.&lt;br/&gt;
The sign says that the population of Olivet is 70. My wedding more
than doubled the population that day.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is to remember the day I became the happiest man on
earth.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I placed this cache with my father-in-law.&lt;br/&gt;

There is a small amount of room for some trade items.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It is placed with the knowledge of the property owner.&lt;br/&gt;
Please do not drive up the hill; there is room to park on the
street (this is not a very busy town).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You must sign the log in order to claim a find.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

The container you seek is a nano.&lt;br/&gt;
This could be a quick park &amp; grab.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I visit this town 2 - 3 times a year to visit my in-laws.&lt;br/&gt;
This is a nice little town; I enjoy my visits here.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When I first came here, I wondered, where is the College
Stadium?&lt;br/&gt;
I now know that the stadium is the football field at the school and
I am to understand that there was once a college in the town.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache location is on the south side of the road.&lt;br/&gt;
Please be stealthy with locating, retrieving and returning the
cache container.&lt;br/&gt;
You may park near the intersection; this is not a very busy town.
Remember to obey traffic laws.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You must sign the log to claim a find.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Long before there were over 200+ TV stations and the imagination was used to stir the senses. There were several types of programs. Of these Westerns were loved by both young and old. 

Gunsmoke was one of these programs running from 1952-1961. The show followed Matt Dylan sheriff of Dodge City,Kansas. Miss Kitty,Chester, and Doc were always heard with Matt setting the law right. 

The surrounding area could well have been traveled through by the cattlemen and homesteaders. There is no room for a writing instrument so BYOP. Use caution while looking for this cache as there are some treacherous areas which could lead to severe injury or worse depending on the weather conditions. This cache is not winter friendly.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">During the golden age of radio, many of the popular programs were the mysteries. Each one brought its own spin to the life of a gumshoe or an undercover good guy. With a sidekick or a dame to share along in the adventure, most aired 30 minutes once each week usually with a mention to stay tuned next week, cliff hanging the program and keeping the audience wanting more.  As today stations like ABC, CBS, NBC or the NBC Blue Network made their money on the commercials however, many were incorporated into the shows directly through the actors and actresses promoting them. Sponsors ranging from body soaps, floor cleaning products, toothpastes, menswear, and unlike today both beer and cigarette companies were major advertisers. 

The cases of Sherlock Holmes were brought to life over 220 episodes. Running in the US from October of 1939 and to July 1947, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson would find adventures, solve the mystery and take you back for a half hour every Monday evening, from 8:30 -9:00 p.m. Originally broadcast from NBC's Blue Network, it later moved to the Mutual Broadcasting System starting in Hollywood and moving out to New York City and was sponsored by Bromo Quinine and Petri Wine.

To locate this cache you will need to use your noodle, think like a gumshoe and deduce where the likeliest place for the cache to be located. 

Warning: Please remember to cache at your own risk. Be respectful of the area and remember to CITO.</groundspeak:long_description>

Access is actually along a township road, with easiest access being from Hillsboro along Highway 200 to the east. This cache is located along the only drive-able tunnel I know of in Trail County. The tunnel is only wide enough for one vehicle at a time and parking available on the west end. You assume all risks in finding this cache. 


You are looking for an ammo can, but fear not! It’s not your average green metal box. There is still plenty of room for trade items and t-bugs! The extraction tool is in the Treasure Box meaning there is no reason to be tipping it over! I hope you enjoy. Please put all the components back after you are finished and re-apply camouflage as needed. Happy Caching!

Edit (12/12/2011) Congrats go out to TheGilby4 on the FTF!)

You need to bring your own writer. No trespassing signs are on the corner, but no worries, permission for foot travel has been given by the owner. Note: All the tools you need are provided and please place everything back in its proper place when done. Log book signature required for find. 


The cache contains only a logbook, although there could be room for small trade items. You may want to bring bug spray in the summer months. If you see a big white german shepherd, whom tends to know when cars come and go, he is people friendly and goes by the name Bear.

Recently Bear passed away and is no longer around the farm any more. :(

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You are looking for my favorite kind of cache, an ammo can.  It's not easy to find a place in town to hide one.  

The cache is located near the English Coulee and is loaded with good swag.  It is located between 2 clearings off of the paved path.  This area could get a bit overgrown and there are some hidden logs and branches in the growth so you may want to watch your step.  It can be accessed from the North or South clearning.  The North Clearing will be the easier route.  You may hit some thorns if you come from the South clearing.

All the parking nearby is by permit only.  Depending on the time of year this can be a very busy area.  Please be stealthy and take the time to rehide the cache. 

This cache was listed on GC.COM on 6/30/09 with GC# GC1VC47.  This is not a new cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

This small tree or shrub forms thickets around sloughs and ponds throughout the prairies, spreading mostly from shallow underground roots. This willow has one of the widest distributions of all willows occuring from Alaska south through BC &amp; California, across the prairie provinces than all the way to New Brunswick, and as far south as Louisiana.

 There is a somewhat dry route from the south east - look for thin spot in brush. 

This cache is to test the Opencaching website.

We had both already found this cache through gc.com but went and signed the log so we could log ourselves as FTF's under this listing.

If caching at Night bring your GeoFriend and flashlights.

Cache is a small tupperware container and contains only log and pencil. Room for trade items, but I will have to place some in there in the coming week. Should be fairly quick, hopefully no need for stealth but people do use the path. Parking may be an issue as cache is a fair distance from any street access.
