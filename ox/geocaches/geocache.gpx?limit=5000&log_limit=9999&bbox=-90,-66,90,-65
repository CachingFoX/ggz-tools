Lo pude sacar rápido con un &quot;soplo&quot; aunque colocarlo de vuelta fue un poco difícil por los comensales del negocio enfrente que entre botella y botella, no dejaban de observar todo lo que hacía. Volví con &quot;el mecaneo&quot; del carro y se les quitó el presentamiento y pude volver a ubicar el cache en su escondite.  Muy bueno. TFTC. </groundspeak:text>

Llovía a cántaros cuando llegué al GZ y tuve que esperar dentro del carro como 2 horas. En realidad no fue tan malo pues normalmente de 3-7pm estoy en el tapón escuchando &quot;El Goldo y la Pelúa&quot; y esta vez los escuché &quot;relax&quot; en mi carro. Tan pronto escampó, salí en busca del cache y debo decir que lo encontré rápido gracias a la lluvia. Las gotas se habían alineado en una pendiente perfecta y sabiá que eso no era parte de la vegetación. Abrir el envase fue lo mejor de todo porque el aroma de esa poción mágica que me ayuda a pasar mis &quot;PT tests&quot; sin hacer mucho ejercicio, me encanta.</groundspeak:text>

Todavia me interesa saber mas sobre ellos asi que si alguien sabe
mas de esto se lo agradeceria.

Para encontrar este cache necesitas la numeración de 6 dígitos que podrás encontrar parado en las coordenadas iniciales. Luego utilizando esa numeración podrás resolver las coordenadas finales.

Sustituye las letras con los digitos correspondientes de esta manera:
A es el primer dígito, B el segundo dígito y asi sucesivamente.(no hay que multiplicar)

De mi familia por parte de madre, todos los varones (9, mis tíos) sirvieron en varios conflictos bélicos. Se podrán imaginar cuánto influyó eso en la vida de toda la familia. Solo aquellos que han tenido que tomar un arma y usarla contra otro ser humano saben lo que realmente eso significa, y el alto costo que tiene la guerra; en más de un ámbito. Los que se fueron y no regresaron y los que fueron y regresaron físicamente, pero que su alma se perdió o se quedó militando. Esos son los héroes verdaderos.

English Version

La Cueva del Indio in Las Piedras was discovered during some developer’s excavations in 1982. Once they realized what they found, the place was protected. It has been on National Registrar of Historic monuments since 2003.

The park can be visited weekdays from 8am - 4pm but with a previous appointment through the tourism and cultural office (787-733-2160 ext. 2474). This is free of charge.

The cache is located OUTSIDE the park accessible 24 hours a day.

Me parece fascinante el aspecto de “crítica” que tiene este cache. Creo que es el primero de esta índole en Puerto Rico. La mayoría son resaltando lugares y uno que otro incomprensible. Mabodomoca acaba de escribir lo que estuve pensando desde que salí del lugar. Hay potencial para que la AGPR haga un proyecto de conservación o hasta un CITO event. Otra alternativa es que se haga como parte de un proyecto de servicio de Eagle Scout y más ahora con el BOOM! Que ha tenido el geocaching dentro de Boy Scouts of America gracias a la nueva insignia de mérito. 

Casi se me olvida el cache. Ufff… un calor insoportable, sol ardiente, humedad… No tuve problema con las coordenadas pero sí con la densa vegetación. Definitivamente mi próximo “geo-tool” será un machete.

Nestled in the heart of Yarmouth County, is a 114-ha (282 acre)
great spot for outdoor recreational activities. The warm, clear
waters of this lake make it ideal for swimming, boating or fishing.
And with the choice of two sandy beachfronts, a picnic park,
playground, walking trail and boat launch, your dilemma is really
what to do first.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The land around the park, like all of southwest Nova Scotia, was
scraped and moulded by glaciers more than 10,000 years ago. As the
ice melted, the debris left behind created distinctive
mounds—like eskers and drumlins—and blocked waterways
that would form the many lakes we see here today.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The relatively flat terrain makes the 1.5 km walking trail within
reach for all ages. Stroll through the traditional “Acadian
Forest”—a mixture of maple, birch, hemlock, spruce, fir
and pine. Stop, and take in the simple beauty around you. Little
folk will delight in the antics of squirrels and the many forest
birds. The more quiet among you may catch a glimpse of deer, grouse
or groundhog.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As you explore the lakeshore area, remember to look for, yet
protect, the rare plants of the “Coastal Plain
Flora”—a group of species that grows along rocky
lakeshores of the eastern United States and in this small pocket of
southwestern Nova Scotia. Thousands of years ago, the continental
shelf along the Atlantic coast was exposed, and southwest Nova
Scotia was part of an unbroken shoreline east of the Appalachian
mountains. Rising sea water from melting glaciers later submerged
the shelf between Maine and Nova Scotia, but this special plant
life has remained, cut off from its southerly cousins. Today, the
delicately flowered pink coreopsis, Plymouth gentian and water
pennywort that grow in this part of Nova Scotia are not found
anywhere else in Canada. All three are protected species by
provincial and federal governments. For some Coastal Plain species
the plants found here make up much of the world’s remaining
populations.&lt;br/&gt;

This geocache is part of the 2010 NS Provincial Parks Geocaching
challenge. For more information about the geocaching challenge,
click the following LINK for more information.  To participate
in the challenge, you will need to download the associated
PASSPORT. At each geocache, there is a punch that you can mark the
corresponding box on your passport. Collect all 5 and you can send
in your passport to receive a free trackable geocoin.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In order to solve this geocache, you will need to brush up on your
knowledge of trees.  Refer to the following links to help
you.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

Natural Resources Identification Program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardwood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Softwood&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
How to Solve This
Multi&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
1. At the starting coordinates; identify the species of tree that
you see. (Hint: you will see a yellow trail marker 5 feet up the
tree)&lt;br/&gt;
Answer: 6 letters, The pine beetle likes these in white or red.
Place each letter in the following slots.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
   (a) ___&lt;br/&gt;
   (b) ___&lt;br/&gt;
   (c) ___&lt;br/&gt;
   (d) ___&lt;br/&gt;
   (e) ___&lt;br/&gt;
   (f) ___&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
2. Refer to this cipher key to get the corresponding digits 
from step 1. (eg. the letter I = 2 + 4 = 6)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;



0 1 2 3 4 5&lt;br/&gt;
1 A B C D E&lt;br/&gt;
2 F G H I J&lt;br/&gt;
3 K L M N O&lt;br/&gt;
4 P Q R S T&lt;br/&gt;
5 U V W X Y&lt;br/&gt;


 &lt;br/&gt;
3. Use your answers in step 2 to discover the final geocache
location:&lt;br/&gt;
   N e3
bb.a37      W db b9.a7e&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
4. Verify your answers...&lt;br/&gt;
   i. The checksum from step 2 is a + b + c + d + e + f=
36&lt;br/&gt;
   ii. The geocache is located within the park along
trails or access road, &lt;b&gt;No bush wacking required&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

This trail winds through some
lovely forest and crosses a beautiful little stream. There is an
interesting story told along the way that is unlike anything that
is offered on any other trail in the park. There was a gold rush of
sorts in this area beginning in the mid - 1800’s. Three mines
were developed in this part of the province and one can still be
found in the park today.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Goldmines trail takes you on a tour of the little-known history
of gold mining in Nova Scotia. Many local people invested a lot in
these ventures and had high hopes of striking it rich! To find out
what they got out of it and where the lost mine is, read the signs
that guide you around the loop.
 Ce sentier
serpente au travers d’une jolie forêt et traverse un superbe
petit ruisseau.  Une histoire unique est racontée le long de
ce sentier.  Une sorte de ruée vers lors s’est produite
vers le milieu des années 1800.  Trois mines ont été établies
dans cette partie de la province et l’une d’elle se
trouve toujours dans le parc aujourd’hui.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Le sentier Goldmines vous donnera un survol de l’histoire peu
connue des mines d’or de la Nouvelle-Écosse.  Plusieurs
résidants locaux, suivant l’appât du gain, ont investi
beaucoup d’argent dans cette aventure.  Pour apprendre
ce qu’ils en ont tirés, et où la mine est située, lisez les
panneaux d’interprétation le long de cette boucle.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All GPS points are on a park trail or in a public use
area in the front-country and all are attached to human-made
structures like bridges, platforms, etc. These would be considered
beginner to intermediate geocaches. All five could be found in a
couple of hours in a vehicle/hiking, in a half day by
bicycle/hiking and a whole day if you were just hiking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kejimkujik, the only inland national park of Canada in
the Maritimes, features abundant lakes and rivers ideal for
canoeing. The lush woodlands and gently rolling landscapes are home
to a variety of wildlife. Visitors will find historic canoe routes,
portages and many beautiful hiking trails in the park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the container location, you will see the forest take regain the marsh area surrounding Grafton Lake; which was once flooded as part of a Salmon hatchery just up the trail to connecting brook into Kejimkujik Lake. Now the hatchery is gone but the buildings remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

Download the passport &lt;a href=&quot;http://atlanticgeocaching.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;amp;task=cat_view&amp;amp;gid=75&amp;amp;Itemid=175&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;; use the punch in each of the 5 caches to punch your passport.  When you complete all 5 you have a chance to earn a limited edition trackable patch &amp; achievement pin (only 250 minted!- first come, first-served).

The geocache is a partnership of the Atlantic Canada Geocaching Association,  and Kejimkujik National Park. Please pay appropriate park entry fees. As per the Parks Canada geocaching policy: Trade items are not permitted in caches, this includes Travel Bugs.

This cache will bring you to a lovely view of Kejimkujik Lake. You will look out over the tops of birch, maple, aspen among other trees, to the body of water that used to be named Fairy Lake. The bay that lies just below the cache site, still sports that name and is one of the areas where petroglyphs are found in Kejimkujik. The petroglyphs date back to the 18th and 19th centuries and represent the lifestyle, art and observations of Mi'kmaq people from this time. They are the one remaining tangible trace of Mi’kmaq life in the park.

Some say the name came not from fairies, but the European understanding of the Wiklatmu’j, the little people of Mi’kmaq legend. There is a story that says the Wiklatmu’j are responsible for the art on the rocks of Fairy Bay and when the Mi’kmaw people tried to explain this to the Europeans, they understood the Wiklatmu’j to be magical beings like fairies and that is how they named the lake. The Wiklatmu’j are small, but very strong and quick and can help or hinder you depending on how they feel! So be respectful of their home and keep an eye out for them while you are looking out over the cultural landscape around Kejimkujik Lake. </groundspeak:long_description>

Present your GPSr at the Visitor Centre with this final screen in order to redeem for your reward item. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

items are not permitted in caches, this includes Travel
Bugs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All GPS points are on a park trail or in a public use
area in the front-country and all are attached to human-made
structures like bridges, platforms, etc. These would be considered
beginner to intermediate geocaches. All five could be found in a
couple of hours in a vehicle/hiking, in a half day by
bicycle/hiking and a whole day if you were just hiking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kejimkujik, the only inland national park of Canada in
the Maritimes, features abundant lakes and rivers ideal for
canoeing. The lush woodlands and gently rolling landscapes are home
to a variety of wildlife. Visitors will find historic canoe routes,
portages and many beautiful hiking trails in the park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;The container is located along the Mersey River trail. From here you can walk or bike along the river edge. The river was an important transportation hub as you could canoe from the Bay of Fundy all the way to the Mouth of Liverpool Harbour to the Atlantic Ocean.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;[EN] The advances in technology over the last couple of generations can be dizzying, but a compass carved in stone is a solid place to get your bearings!  Use your modern technology to locate the cache nearby and find out how the compass came to be.

&lt;p&gt;Kejimkujik, the only inland national park of Canada in
the Maritimes, features abundant lakes and rivers ideal for
canoeing. The lush woodlands and gently rolling landscapes are home
to a variety of wildlife. Visitors will find historic canoe routes,
portages and many beautiful hiking trails in the park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jakes Landing was used as the main ferry point for outdoorsmen heading for the Kedgemakooge Hunting and Rod Club. A popular destination for the wealthy during the 1800 &amp; early 1900's. Now it is the location for the canoe/kayak &amp; Bike rental service. During the season you will be able to cross the river using the footbridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;




There has been a lot of activity on
this point of land. It has been the site of a small resort in the
1920’s, farming, heavy logging and summer cottages up to the
time that the area became a national park. The forest is
regenerating well and is largely hardwood. There is a small wetland
on the shore next to the cache. Wetlands tend to be looked upon as
less interesting places, but they are extremely rich and diverse
habitats.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Take the time to explore the shoreline as you paddle along. It can
be a happening place for wildlife, especially if there are reeds
and other shore plants that they can hide in. There are also two
picnic areas and if the water isn’t too high there are also
some nice little beaches!
Cette pointe de terre
fut le théâtre de beaucoup d’activité.  Elle fut le site
d’un lieu de villégiature dans les années 1920,
d’activités agricoles, d’exploitation forestière et de
chalets d’été, jusqu’au jour où le parc national fut
créé.  Le processus de régénération de la forêt, qui est
composée surtout de feuillus, est bien enclenché.  Le long du
rivage, vous découvrirez une petite zone humide près de la
cache.  Les zones humides sont souvent négligées mais ce sont
des habitats extrêmement riches et diversifiés.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Prenez le temps d’explorer le rivage alors que vous pagayez;
vous y découvrirez peut-être une faune diverse, particulièrement
dans les roseaux et autres plantes le long de la rive.  Deux
aires de piquenique sont accessibles, ainsi que quelques superbes
petites plages, si l’eau n’est pas trop haute.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find this cache, a Chirp compatible GPSr is required.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you walk up to the coordinates, you will receive the chirp message &amp; waypoint to the container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can participate in the optional paperless passport program, by logging all 5 geocaches with a chirp, decode the message at each chirp &amp; container and you will be able to find a unlisted 6th chirp, which is your validation page along with a confirmation code. Present your GPSr at the Visitor Centre with this final screen in order to redeem for your reward item. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;[EN] This year’s geocaching challenge is built on family foundations from Kejimkujik’s past.  You will travel to five different sites within the park that tell stories about a few families who left their mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;[FR] Le thème du défi de la géocache cette année se repose sur les fondations familiales à Kejimkujik.  Vous voyagerez aux cinq sites dans le parc qui marquent les lieux où cinq familles se sont enracinées.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a small green cache container containing a park message, log book, pencil &amp; punch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geocache is a partnership of the Atlantic Canada Geocaching Association, and Kejimkujik National Park. Please pay appropriate park entry fees. As per the Parks Canada geocaching policy: Trade items are not permitted in caches, this includes Travel Bugs.

&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;[EN] In the 1800’s, a farm was established atop the drumlin on what is now the Farmlands trail in Kejimkujik.  There are some interesting stories to discover about the families that lived on the farm over the years and also about an unusual pet.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;




You can
reach this area over land or water. One trip will take you through
lowlands and over ridges, through mixed forest and across a few
streams. Make sure you wear your hiking boots! The other will take
you across lakes of clear and dark waters and along the meanderings
of a brook. Either way, it is a beautiful trip in the backcountry
of Kejimkujik.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You’ll be travelling through a glacial landscape. Thousands
of years ago, glaciers carved and sculpted their way across North
America. In some places they carried sediment, and even large
boulders along with them, in others they left these things behind.
The area you’re heading for has a great example of one of the
many glacial features found in the park. To find out what it is,
you’ll have to find the cache!
Cette cache est
accessible par voie terrestre ou par voie d’eau.  La
voie terrestre vous amènera de basses terres en crêtes, au travers
d’une forêt mixte et de quelques ruisseaux. 
Assurez-vous de porter des chaussures de randonnée !  La voie
d’eau vous verra parcourir des lacs d’eaux claires et
sombres et le long des méandres d’un ruisseau.  Peu
importe la voie que vous choisirez, ce sera un superbe voyage dans
l’arrière-pays de Kejimkujik.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Vous voyagerez au travers d’un paysage glaciaire.  Il y
a des milliers d’années, les glaciers ont sculpté et découpé
le paysage dans leurs déplacements en Amérique du Nord, amenant
avec eux sédiments et roch ers, alors qu’en d’autres
endroits ils laissèrent ces vestiges derrière eux.  La zone où
vous vous dirigez contient un excellent exemple  d’un
des vestiges laissé par ces glaciers.  Pour le découvrir, vous
n’avez qu’à trouver la géocache !&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

We had a lovely hike instead.  We didn't see much wildlife - a toad, some birds, nothing exciting.  We did see lots of furry scat though, so we know there's a carnivore nearby.  This was our 5th and final cache in this very well put together series.  Thanks so much!</groundspeak:text>

This cache is located on the Hemlocks &amp; Hardwoods trail. .   The trail will take you to along the walk-in tent sites, 300 year old hemlock forest.

You are looking for a small green cache container containing a park message, log book, pencil &amp; punch (for your passport). Download the passport &lt;a href=&quot;http://atlanticgeocaching.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;amp;task=cat_view&amp;amp;gid=75&amp;amp;Itemid=175&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;; use the punch in each of the 5 caches to punch your passport.  When you complete all 5 you have a chance to earn a limited edition trackable patch &amp; achievement pin (only 250 minted!- first come, first-served).

The geocache is a partnership of the Atlantic Canada Geocaching Association,  and Kejimkujik National Park. Please pay appropriate park entry fees. As per the Parks Canada geocaching policy: Trade items are not permitted in caches, this includes Travel Bugs.

This trail will take you through gorgeous mixed forest on a ridge, past glimpses of an expanse of water, through a black spruce swamp and into an outdoor cathedral of ancient hemlocks. Some of the trees in the mixed forest are over 100 years old, but that seems young in comparison with the 300 year-old hemlocks that can be found along the trail. You can feel the change as you walk into this part of the forest and are surrounded by these towering giants.

Along the first part of the trail, you will walk past a prescribed burn. Prescribed fire is a carefully designed fire that is ignited by experts after extensive planning, review and environmental assessment. A low-intensity surface fire was managed by Kejimkujik’s excellent fire team in the spring of 2010 as part of a larger study. The goal is to study fire’s ecological role within a landscape and to understand the role fire plays as a natural disturbance in the park. The regeneration after just a few months is amazing! </groundspeak:long_description>

The Keji cache event ended here with a group night hike. Guided by Paul ( park interpreter ) his knowledge &amp; fascinating facts about the Hemlocks and Hardwoods trail made the hike to the cache location very interesting and enjoyable. With the many flashlighs beans of light cutting through the darkness the fire tacks we quickly located. The log book was signed by all in the group and a few pictures were taken.
TFTH and happy caching!</groundspeak:text>

The side of the banks can be slippery so be cautious near the edge.

This series of caches is placed along Old Liverpool Road and Halfway Road in Annapolis County.  Caches range from a bison tube to a large peanut butter jar, some cammoed some not and almost all are Park and Grabs.  

Old Liverpool Road begins just off West Dalhousie Road near where it meets Highway 10.  It starts as a fairly good country road, deteriorates to a rough county road, and improves again.  Halfway Road is a two-lane dirt road that meets up with Lake Pleasant Road near where it meets Highway 10 in Springfield.

The circuit took us approximately 2.5 hours to complete, keeping in mind that we placed caches all along the way.  

A special thanks to F&amp;V for providing many of the caching containers that we used today.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Yes, you read it correctly - it is a nano in the woods.  To help you out, we placed a red bison tube in an evergreen tree - should be easy, no?

This series of caches is placed along Old Liverpool Road and Halfway Road in Annapolis County.  Caches range from a bison tube to a large peanut butter jar, some cammoed some not and almost all are Park and Grabs.  

Old Liverpool Road begins just off West Dalhousie Road near where it meets Highway 10.  It starts as a fairly good country road, deteriorates to a rough county road, and improves again.  Halfway Road is a two-lane dirt road that meets up with Lake Pleasant Road near where it meets Highway 10 in Springfield.

The circuit took us approximately 2.5 hours to complete, keeping in mind that we placed caches all along the way.  

A special thanks to F&amp;V for providing many of the caching containers that we used today.</groundspeak:long_description>

This one fits the &quot;Hide a Big One&quot; Criterion.

You're looking for a 20 Liter container and with a cache that size, you don't really need much more info, right?  As much as I wanted to make this one Winter Friendly, I couldn't find a perfect spot, so it is not exactly winter friendly.  If we have less than two feet of snow, you should be able to find it.  However, you'll need an OHV or Snow machine as the road is not maintained in winter.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Surface Water Erosion
Surface water runoff is water that doesn't soak into the ground or evaporate but instead flows across Earth's surface.
Rill erosion occurs when runoff flows and a small stream forms and carries away plants and soil leaving a scar or channel on the side of the slope. A rill is the channel left on the side of the slope.
Gully erosion is when a rill channel becomes much deeper and wider which forms a gully. Gully erosion is basically rill erosion on a much higher level. 

Walk along were this road once was, and see the Power of Erosion

It’s a bit of a hike up to the cache, an elevation of about 237 ft.  If you crossover the gully at the top of the road and walk up on the left side of it to the cache , I found it the easiest way. The cache is winter friendly, however the hike maybe more treacherous during the winter months.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This an is nano size cache but should
not be too difficult to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above coordinates are incorrect
you must solve the following&lt;br/&gt;
puzzle: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   44° AB.CDE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   065° FG.HIJ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 11+5 = __ (mod 13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; B 3-9 = __ (mod13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; C 9+5 = __ (mod 13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; D 11+8 =__ (mod 13) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E 5-17 = __ (mod 13) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F19+11 = __ (mod 26)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; G 11-6 = __ (mod 26)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; H 2+26 = __ (mod 26) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I  5-24 = __ (mod 26) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J 21 +40= __ (mod 26)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nearby parking, you pick the location. Also no need to
go on to nearby properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
When putting log back into cache, roll up log and place it in the
cover first, this will make it easier to put back together. Please
return cache to its original location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring your own writing tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

This series of caches is placed along Old Liverpool Road and Halfway Road in Annapolis County.  Caches range from a bison tube to a large peanut butter jar, some cammoed some not and almost all are Park and Grabs.  

Old Liverpool Road begins just off West Dalhousie Road near where it meets Highway 10.  It starts as a fairly good country road, deteriorates to a rough county road, and improves again.  Halfway Road is a two-lane dirt road that meets up with Lake Pleasant Road near where it meets Highway 10 in Springfield.

The circuit took us approximately 2.5 hours to complete, keeping in mind that we placed caches all along the way.

For this special park and grab you don't even need to get out of the car.  It's a slow down and grab.  I sat in the car to place this cache.  Happy finding!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This very well cammoed film canister is ready for you to find.

This series of caches is placed along Old Liverpool Road and Halfway Road in Annapolis County.  Caches range from a bison tube to a large peanut butter jar, some cammoed some not and almost all are Park and Grabs.  

Old Liverpool Road begins just off West Dalhousie Road near where it meets Highway 10.  It starts as a fairly good country road, deteriorates to a rough county road, and improves again.  Halfway Road is a two-lane dirt road that meets up with Lake Pleasant Road near where it meets Highway 10 in Springfield.

The circuit took us approximately 2.5 hours to complete, keeping in mind that we placed caches all along the way.  

A special thanks to F&amp;V for providing many of the caching containers that we used today.</groundspeak:long_description>

This series of caches is placed along Old Liverpool Road and Halfway Road in Annapolis County.  Caches range from a bison tube to a large peanut butter jar, some cammoed some not and almost all are Park and Grabs.  

Old Liverpool Road begins just off West Dalhousie Road near where it meets Highway 10.  It starts as a fairly good country road, deteriorates to a rough county road, and improves again.  Halfway Road is a two-lane dirt road that meets up with Lake Pleasant Road near where it meets Highway 10 in Springfield.

The circuit took us approximately 2.5 hours to complete, keeping in mind that we placed caches all along the way.

This series of caches is placed along Old Liverpool Road and Halfway Road in Annapolis County.  Caches range from a bison tube to a large peanut butter jar, some cammoed some not and almost all are Park and Grabs.  

Old Liverpool Road begins just off West Dalhousie Road near where it meets Highway 10.  It starts as a fairly good country road, deteriorates to a rough county road, and improves again.  Halfway Road is a two-lane dirt road that meets up with Lake Pleasant Road near where it meets Highway 10 in Springfield.

The circuit took us approximately 2.5 hours to complete, keeping in mind that we placed caches all along the way.  

A special thanks to F&amp;V for providing many of the caching containers that we used today.</groundspeak:long_description>

Ervind is a cacher from Southwest Nova Scotia who has almost 700 cache placements.  Many of these caches were placed while he was out doing maintenance on other caches.  Also, many are in novel cache containers.  

Today we were out doing maintenance and placing caches.  This one shouted Ervin's name to me so this one is dedicated to him.  

If you continue down this side road, you will come to another cache at the end of the road.  It's only available during times of low water though.  Bring your camera, it's a lovely area!</groundspeak:long_description>

We found this lovely spot while heading to a not often found cache called Runaround.  

There is no need to go under the bridge!  The rocks can be very slippery and this cache is not winter friendly.  

You're looking for a small peanut butter container.  Enjoy your hunt.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the seventh cache in our &quot;Bridges of the Backroads&quot; series.

The cache is a small camoed peanut butter container.  The cache is not located on the bridge, for several reasons... one - the cottagers nearby had a full view of the bridge from their deck and we didn't want to be obvious, and there weren't any great hiding spots from there.  Continue about 80 feet (27 M) past the  bridge to begin your search. 

While on the bridge, check out the bobs that you see from B.o.B.  This looks like a popular fishing spot.

The river is very pretty - be sure to take time to enjoy your surroundings.</groundspeak:long_description>

You're looking for a regular sized PB jar.  It's nestled securely into its hiding spot to ensure it's not taken away by inclement weather.  It's near a good docking spot and only 0.11 miles from the parking.

While on a maintenance run to the Old Liverpool Road, we decided to place a few more caches.  All of the new placements have great parking spots and range in size from tiny, like this one, to HUGE, as you will see when you progress down the &quot;road&quot;.  

This road continues on to Halfway Road which comes out in Springfield.</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache was a large tube and is filled with pencils and pencil related items.  

Oddly, the cache went missing so we had to replace it with a large jar.  It no longer holds pencils, but certainly has the capacity to do so.  Hopefully we will have better luck with this one.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Just off Varner Mountain Road:

This series consists of several caches that can be completed by walking around the loop. It starts on Inglisville Road just off Varner Mountain and loops around to Neily Road South, back to Varner Mtn road and back to the car. There are parking coordinates for either end and you can easily do the route from the other direction. The 4.35 mile walk took us 2 hours, but this included searching for cache locations and placing the caches.

We came twice... once to place the caches and once to check the coordinates. The second visit was after a solid week of rain. The road appeared to be a river in places so be prepared for wet feet in Spring or after heavy rain.

We nicknamed this one &quot;Snap&quot;.  35 mil film canister.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Just off Varner Mountain Road:

This series consists of several caches that can be completed by walking around the loop. It starts on Inglisville Road just off Varner Mountain and loops around to Neily Road South, back to Varner Mtn road and back to the car. There are parking coordinates for either end and you can easily do the route from the other direction. The 4.35 mile walk took us 2 hours, but this included searching for cache locations and placing the caches.

We came twice... once to place the caches and once to check the coordinates. The second visit was after a solid week of rain. The road appeared to be a river in places so be prepared for wet feet in Spring or after heavy rain.

We nicknamed this one &quot;Mossy&quot;.

We followed some pretty big canine tracks into the woods here today - we're far enough away from the houses for me to think it might have been a coyote - hence the name of the cache.  There have been sightings but no encounters or issues.  Always be safe and alert.

This container was won at the Jingle Mingle event.  These containers seem to be the newest fad!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Today we took a walk on the trails near home and planted some new caches. This cache is placed as a part of the 2010 Winter Challenge, designed to encourage winter caching and winter friendly placements. 

There are a few good parking spots available for the caches in this residential trail system. You will be able to do three caches from one parking spot. This cache is closest to Orchard Drive.  There is no access from Highway 10, as this is private property.

This little green micro container was won as a FTF prize in an escaperr cache at an event in Bridgewater.  Don't worry, it's not a nano!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This Cache is located on the Vault Road near Melvern Square. It may be a bit difficult to find the right road, but that is part of the fun, right? 

Seven Falls is the local name for the series of cascading waterfalls which flow down the side of the mountain. Each one is steeper and more difficult to climb. I placed the cache not far from the bottom to be more kid friendly.

It is a nice climb to the top if you are the adventurous type. I wouldn't recommend it for small children. My 3 year old made it to the cache site with minimal help, but it was starting to get steeper.

I have also added a twist to this cache. I made it a sports theme cache. I want to have only sports related items traded. I have placed my first TB, &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; in the cache to start his journey. 

There is a rock quarry near the bridge where you will walk up the falls. Park by the gate, because the wooden bridge is not safe to drive on.

The posted co-ords are accurate to 10m because of the heavy tree cover. If someone gets a better fix please feel free to log them.</groundspeak:long_description>

We stopped the car at the bottom of the hill because it was still covered with snow and ice.  (This is after trying to approach from the north - while the map shows a road there really isn't).  

The cache was in great shape, having held up to winter very well.  The falls were lovely too!  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

The Department of Transport agreed to construct a new airport which would be operated and maintained by The City of Saint John. The agreement was signed on March 20, 1950, but the actual construction began in March 1949. One year later runway 05-23 was completed measuring 5500 feet long and 200 feet wide. Soon after, runway 14-32 was completed measuring 5100 feet long.

The first aircraft to land was actually during construction on runway 05-23. Pilot James Wade landed his Cessna plane on a rough gravel surface. His passengers included Senator Riley and V.I.P.'S. In February of 1950, the first night landing was made by an RCAF Dakota. The actual first scheduled flight to the new Saint John Airport was a Maritime Central Airways DC-3 piloted by Captain Jones of Apohaqui, N.B. on August 11, 1951.

The terminal building started construction in 1951 and a mobile ticket unit was used during construction. The official opening of the airport was the same day the Air Terminal Building was opened, January 8, 1952. The facility came to be known as the Turnbull Airfield. Mr. W.R. Turnbull of Rothesay, N.B. was a pioneer in the aeronautical research and invention fields.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Your first glimps of the Saint John airport can be from here if you look for it.

The Department of Transport agreed to construct a new airport which would be operated and maintained by The City of Saint John. The agreement was signed on March 20, 1950, but the actual construction began in March 1949. One year later runway 05-23 was completed measuring 5500 feet long and 200 feet wide. Soon after, runway 14-32 was completed measuring 5100 feet long.

The first aircraft to land was actually during construction on runway 05-23. Pilot James Wade landed his Cessna plane on a rough gravel surface. His passengers included Senator Riley and V.I.P.'S. In February of 1950, the first night landing was made by an RCAF Dakota. The actual first scheduled flight to the new Saint John Airport was a Maritime Central Airways DC-3 piloted by Captain Jones of Apohaqui, N.B. on August 11, 1951.

The terminal building started construction in 1951 and a mobile ticket unit was used during construction. The official opening of the airport was the same day the Air Terminal Building was opened, January 8, 1952. The facility came to be known as the Turnbull Airfield. Mr. W.R. Turnbull of Rothesay, N.B. was a pioneer in the aeronautical research and invention fields.

It turned out to be a very nice sunday so we decided to get a few caches and we had fun finding these caches.
The road was very drivable...As I suspected this was no ordinary container which made the find easier but it is a good change from the film container.

Take the highway towards the Saint John Airport for this cache. Park at the parking co-ordinates provided . You will need flashlights to find the starting point firetack. Then from there you are on your own to find and  follow the &quot;correct&quot; trail.

Remember the following rules:
1 tack   = means follow this trail
2 tacks = means a change of trail
3 tacks = means stop, cache is here.

As we approached the parking coords I saw a car pulled over and the tail lights go out and two people got out and started getting things from the car.  As we got closer my earlier suspicions were confirmed and on an impulse of mischief I quietly rolled up and laid on the horn bringing them both to their feet![:O] [}:)]. We waited for a few minutes before heading in and then started shining our lights around and moving ahead slowly.  At first we only spotted the tacks by observation but about halfway in I tried something different and the tacks lit up perfectly.  From there it was no problem other than watching our step to avoid snagging up in an overhanging branch or tripping over an occasional root. Sprucegum was the first to spot the cache and we all signed and then headed back out.  Just out of curiosity we chatted for a bit and it got completely dark and to test my findings we went back in a short jaunt and it worked perfectly again so now I know how to make these puppies light up quite nicely.

Myself and Lady Tag-Long decided to attempt this one. 
We had just finished another series of caches and it was dark already and we were not too far so why not.
For some reason we didnt find the tacks very shiny or brilliant or whatever they are supposed to do. We relied more on observation and experience to find those tacks in the woods despite using three different kind of lights and yes even the flamethrower.
I am glad I was not alone doing this one, I would not walk alone in those trails.  [:)]
We found the cache and got out there pretty quickly and we sure glad to be back in the open.
Thanks for the experience.</groundspeak:text>

The only place in New Brunswick where you can see 2 Covered Bridges in 1 view.

So if I was to drive here and stay for several hours there would be more to do within walking distance then anywhere else I go to.

Cache is a regular sized Camo'd container holding a logbook and pencil, the regular traders and three TB's. If you want the full enjoyment of the hike you can park by the church or you can drive to the top of the hill and take the logging road from there.

There is a gate at the church and it was chained preventing driving up all the way to the old logging road for a comfy 300meters hike, instead its a miserable 1.1km hike instead.
Bushwhacking from the road is not really an option either with the thick trees.

Cache was easy to find, and it is in great shape, the inside is dry.

Shared FTF with Ajlong.
It turned out to be a very nice sunday so we decided to get a few caches and we had fun finding these caches.
The road was very drivable...
Interesting cemetery. Not alot of residents. We love these caches.

Although the start of this one (from the parking co-ordinates looks very easy, don't be fooled. Once you start down the trail there are small hidden sink holes so tread carefully. This is not a cache for those with walking problems. Hence the high ratings.

Take your own walking and writing sticks.

PIN TRADING CACHE - Please trade your pins remember 1 for 1. I placed a Canada pin, NB Flag pin and a pin I got from Whitehorse, Yukon as starters.

Parking is no problem - enjoy the view of the pond and maybe you will see the geese while there.

Want to give me a gift as well? Then get this one on June 20th and log it the same day. If you do, you can wish me a happy brithday as a gift to me. For this year Father's Day is my birthday. Also this is my 40th cache placed.

Father's Day is a celebration inaugurated in the early twentieth century to complement Mother’s Day in celebrating fatherhood and male parenting. It is also celebrated to honor and commemorate our forefathers. Father's Day is celebrated on a variety of dates worldwide and typically involves gift-giving, special dinners to fathers, and family-oriented activities. The first observance of Father's Day is believed to have been held on June 13, 1910 through the efforts of Sonora Smart Dodd of Spokane, Washington. After listening to a church sermon at Spokane's Central Methodist Episcopal Church in 1909 about the newly recognized Mother's Day, Dodd felt strongly that fatherhood needed recognition, as well. She wanted a celebration that honored fathers like her own father, William Smart, a Civil War veteran who was left to raise his family alone when his wife died giving birth to their sixth child. 

Dodd was the first to solicit the idea of having an official Father's Day observance to honor all fathers. Enlisting help from the Spokane Ministerial Association in 1909, she arranged for the celebration of fatherhood in Spokane. On June 19, 1910, young members of the YMCA went to church wearing roses: a red rose to honor a living father, and a white rose to honor a deceased one. Dodd traveled through the city in a horse-drawn carriage, carrying gifts to shut-in fathers.

Kennebecasis Valley Fire Department

The department was formed in 1924 as the Village of Rothesay Fire Department. It was comprised of all volunteers and their first apparatus was a 1924 Ford Model “T” chemical unit. Over the years the department grew in size and changed locations several times. In 1966, when several of the surrounding villages were incorporated the department began official fire protection to the six municipalities in the Kennebecasis Valley. In 1967 the first two (2) career fire fighters were hired, Chief Geoff Sayre and Deputy Chief Earl Carleton. 
In 1982 the Quispamsis fire Station was officially opened, giving us a faster response time to the growing population in that area. In 1989 the department was regionalized and became jointly owned by all six municipalities. Then in 1998 the provincial government amalgamated the valley into two large towns, Quispamsis and Rothesay. This amalgamation included the former six municipalities as well as a large portion of the parish of Rothesay. Along with portions of three local service districts the total coverage area is in excess of 120 square kilometers.

With these changes and the increasing size of the force and equipment it was apparent a new fire station was necessary to house the organization. On April 22, 2001 the new fire station on Campbell Drive in Rothesay was officially opened. The change of name from Rothesay Regional to Kennebecasis Valley came about in 2006, the result of a new regional agreement signed between the two towns.

The department is a composite organization comprised of a Chief, Deputy Chief, Divisional Chief, twenty-eight career staff, six part-time fire fighters, and thirty volunteer fire fighters. Housed in the two fire stations are two rapid intervention vehicles, three pumpers, a Quint, three tankers, an equipment van, a Boston Whaler rescue boat, an all terrain vehicle and three service vehicles.

In 1989 the department was regionalized and became jointly owned by all six municipalities. Then in 1998 the provincial government amalgamated the valley into two large towns, Quispamsis and Rothesay. This amalgamation included the former six municipalities as well as a large portion of the parish of Rothesay. Along with portions of three local service districts the total coverage area is in excess of 120 square kilometers. 

With these changes and the increasing size of the force and equipment it was apparent a new fire station was necessary to house the organization. On April 22, 2001 the new fire station on Campbell Drive in Rothesay was officially opened. The change of name from Rothesay Regional to Kennebecasis Valley came about in 2006, the result of a new regional agreement signed between the two towns. 

The department is a composite organization comprised of a Chief, Deputy Chief, Divisional Chief, twenty-eight career staff, six part-time fire fighters, and thirty volunteer fire fighters. Housed in the two fire stations are two rapid intervention vehicles, three pumpers, a Quint, three tankers, an equipment van, a Boston Whaler rescue boat, an all terrain vehicle and three service vehicles.

A quick park and grab. Cammo-micro with log only.

This pond &quot;towers&quot; above all others and is &quot;blue&quot; year round. Travel &quot;Downeast&quot; 2.5km and you will be in site of this one. Watch out for the old &quot;gnarly&quot; evergreen.

Kennebecasis Valley Fire Department
 
The department was formed in 1924 as the Village of Rothesay Fire Department. It was comprised of all volunteers and their first apparatus was a 1924 Ford Model “T” chemical unit. Over the years the department grew in size and changed locations several times. In 1966, when several of the surrounding villages were incorporated the department began official fire protection to the six municipalities in the Kennebecasis Valley. In 1967 the first two (2) career fire fighters were hired, Chief Geoff Sayre and Deputy Chief Earl Carleton.
 In 1982 the Quispamsis fire Station was officially opened, giving us a faster response time to the growing population in that area. In 1989 the department was regionalized and became jointly owned by all six municipalities. Then in 1998 the provincial government amalgamated the valley into two large towns, Quispamsis and Rothesay.

Kennebecasis Valley Fire Department
 
The department was formed in 1924 as the Village of Rothesay Fire Department. It was comprised of all volunteers and their first apparatus was a 1924 Ford Model “T” chemical unit. Over the years the department grew in size and changed locations several times. In 1966, when several of the surrounding villages were incorporated the department began official fire protection to the six municipalities in the Kennebecasis Valley. In 1967 the first two (2) career fire fighters were hired, Chief Geoff Sayre and Deputy Chief Earl Carleton.
 In 1982 the Quispamsis fire Station was officially opened, giving us a faster response time to the growing population in that area. In 1989 the department was regionalized and became jointly owned by all six municipalities. Then in 1998 the provincial government amalgamated the valley into two large towns, Quispamsis and Rothesay. This amalgamation included the former six municipalities as well as a large portion of the parish of Rothesay. Along with portions of three local service districts the total coverage area is in excess of 120 square kilometers.
 
With these changes and the increasing size of the force and equipment it was apparent a new fire station was necessary to house the organization. On April 22, 2001 the new fire station on Campbell Drive in Rothesay was officially opened. The change of name from Rothesay Regional to Kennebecasis Valley came about in 2006, the result of a new regional agreement signed between the two towns.
 
The department is a composite organization comprised of a Chief, Deputy Chief, Divisional Chief, twenty-eight career staff, six part-time fire fighters, and thirty volunteer fire fighters. Housed in the two fire stations are two rapid intervention vehicles, three pumpers, a Quint, three tankers, an equipment van, a Boston Whaler rescue boat, an all terrain vehicle and three service vehicles.

Cache is located close to the trail, it should be an easy walk to it.

Oh dont forget to bring a pen this time. ;)

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Yellow flashing lights and Susan Sleep guard our precious children as they cross the street to and from school each day.

Susan Sleep (see pictures) has been manning (womaning) the crossing station on the Gondola Point Road for over 25 years. Every school day, twice a day. You can do the math as to the number of days she has been there. Red and yellow vest, STOP sign in hand, sunny days, hot days, cold days, windy days, rainy days (maybe some snowy days too). 

Thousands of boys and girls from grade one to six have obeyed her and made it safely across this busy street to school in the morning and home again in the afternoon. Most will remember her smile, her laugh and her listening to them. All can and will look back to see her there protecting each of them against the cars and trucks to get them safely across the roadway.

Susan is still doing it today. She is also active in the community with Scouts Canada and as a cacher. 

Have fun finding this cache. If you go during a school day maybe Susan will help you get across and even hint at where her cache is.

Kennebecasis Valley Fire Department
 
The department was formed in 1924 as the Village of Rothesay Fire Department. It was comprised of all volunteers and their first apparatus was a 1924 Ford Model “T” chemical unit. Over the years the department grew in size and changed locations several times. In 1966, when several of the surrounding villages were incorporated the department began official fire protection to the six municipalities in the Kennebecasis Valley. In 1967 the first two (2) career fire fighters were hired, Chief Geoff Sayre and Deputy Chief Earl Carleton.
 In 1982 the Quispamsis fire Station was officially opened, giving us a faster response time to the growing population in that area. In 1989 the department was regionalized and became jointly owned by all six municipalities. Then in 1998 the provincial government amalgamated the valley into two large towns, Quispamsis and Rothesay. This amalgamation included the former six municipalities as well as a large portion of the parish of Rothesay. Along with portions of three local service districts the total coverage area is in excess of 120 square kilometers.
 
With these changes and the increasing size of the force and equipment it was apparent a new fire station was necessary to house the organization. On April 22, 2001 the new fire station on Campbell Drive in Rothesay was officially opened. The change of name from Rothesay Regional to Kennebecasis Valley came about in 2006, the result of a new regional agreement signed between the two towns.
 
The department is a composite organization comprised of a Chief, Deputy Chief, Divisional Chief, twenty-eight career staff, six part-time fire fighters, and thirty volunteer fire fighters. Housed in the two fire stations are two rapid intervention vehicles, three pumpers, a Quint, three tankers, an equipment van, a Boston Whaler rescue boat, an all terrain vehicle and three service vehicles.

I only grabbed the cords for it as I was going to stop on my way home.
I was looking at my Gps when I met two new cachers to the scene, met Vexidus and another cacher.
Always great to meet new cachers.

Although the bridge won't move the rocks will. This cache will always be dry as long as the beams stay in place. Hope no one steel's it. 

I have gone under this bridge for years turning off the Mackay Highway and never thought about it until today. Great hiding place.

I have long seen ATV during the summer using this area and in the winter skaters. Best to head towards the pond before heading to the cache itself.

accuracy is within 4 meters (13.12 ft  for Imperial users)

About Comex
Comex is a BRT (bus rapid transit) service that provides morning and after work service to citizens in outlying areas to and from Uptown Saint John. Comex serves residents of Grand Bay-Westfield, Rothesay, Quispamsis and Hampton Monday to Friday. 
 
In partnership, Saint John Transit and the Saint John Parking Commission are endeavouring to provide an integrated transportation network for the area. The Saint John Parking Commission has introduced www.shareyourride.ca, a website to enable commuters an easy method to find ridesharing partners in their area. Free Comex parking lots are provided for those who want to park their cars and ride the bus, or as a meeting and drop off points for ridesharing partners.

Goals of Comex
Each bus can remove 40 cars from the road, and eliminate the needs for forty parking spaces in Uptown Saint John. By using Comex, area residents can work toward reducing CO2 emissions and reduce traffic congestion.

This should be an easy P&amp;G. Bring your own writing stick.

The pump house at the side of the road provides the perfect cover to get behind and cache.

Quick park and grab.
Not so good hiding spot.
Too muggle prone and somewhat dangerous imo.
Good thing I got it late in the day so traffic was reduced and was not an issue.

Some of the caches in this series are just to bring up your cache count 
Some of them may be a little more difficult to find.
Be careful during hunting season, especially MOOSE season. There are a lot of hunters in this area.
Take it easy driving on the road; it can be rough on a car. I have gone out this way many times to go to St. Martins. It is a nice drive.

The cache is located on a new little trail which loops around the dog park, located off Vincent Road, in Quispamsis, New Brunswick.

Bushwacking is required for this one. Our dog loved to run through the woods (and streams, and mud) so this cache is in the woods. 

Inside the lid is a picture of our dog Rocky. It was taken one sunny afternoon, his smile shows how happy he was to be outside. Please post a picture posted of your favorite pet when you log this cache

The cache is a cammo lock-in-lock. It has a logbook, a, pencil, Whitehorse pin.

Close enough to the dogs so NO CATS ALLOWED.

A cammo square lock-in-lock. Logbook and pencil and a FTF Signal the Frog is in container.

Bushwacking required. Very well hidden. GPS showed within 2m

FTF = Mud in the Face

I am glad to finally get this one done.
It was an easy find, but the container was stuck because of the ice and it took me a serious effort to release the container from its ice prison but I was not going to leave without signing the logbook.  [:)]

Lots of rain, lots of water, lots of mud, lots of wet trees today, but it had lots of fun and with FTF to boot.
Found the cache easily, and with all the traffic today on this road, I thought I would get to see 4 ton trucks again in these roads.

Point Beach, a beautiful sandbar created on the shore of the
Kennebecasis River, near the cable ferry service, offers picnic
canopies, sandy beach, seasonal Red Cross swimming lessons, and
lifeguard service&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed there was no cache in this
little park yet, so I decided that it would be a good place for me
to hide one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not approach this from the
Gandola Point Arterial (Route 119)... Instead, take the more scenic
Gandola Point Road to the dead end.. Lots of parking there...
Careful crossing the street...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial cache contents include some
little toys donanted by my kids, and a couple of travel
Bugs...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing...&lt;/p&gt;

I love the changing view of the Hammond River basin. Winter white, spring break- up, summer pasture (cows), and fall colours.

Parking is available between the NO Parking sign and the end of the guard rail.

Lots of rain, lots of water, lots of mud, lots of wet trees today, but it had lots of fun and with FTF to boot.
Found the cache easily, and with all the traffic today on this road, I thought I would get to see 4 ton trucks again in these roads.
On the way out of Saddleback got to meet Digger and Ynds getting all wet.
Good to see Ynds out on cachin again and Digger I loved the hat! [:)]

Some of the caches in this series are just to bring up your cache count 
Some of them may be a little more difficult to find.
Be careful during hunting season, especially MOOSE season. There are a lot of hunters in this area.
Take it easy driving on the road; it can be rough on a car. I have gone out this way many times to go to St. Martins. It is a nice drive. 
The original contents of this cache are.
1 – Pencil sharpener.
2 – Log book.
3 – Pencil.
4 – Led light
5 – Travel bug, Nightwish want to play gig in South America and        Australia. Then Nightwish want to go back home in Finland.</groundspeak:long_description>

So with the storm just starting in the middle of the night in a split second decision went after the new caches.
The roads were not too bad yet, but it was pitch dark.
This cache was easy to find and not too far from the road Hooray for that. :)
What an incredible tree.
It was even more impressive in the dark. :)
I think we wont be seeing this tree on any furniture. :)

Best moment of the day... 
Saw the publishing of this cache, but had some stuff to do around the house so I didnt jump to it right away.
After I was done I checked and it hadnt been claimed yet so a quick call to Ajlong if he wanted to come along, and as usual got his answer pretending to sound like a drag 'I guess I can go!'  [:D]
As we are leaving Robinson Road we see a Red Jeep cruisin down the road and I even mentioned to AJlong 'I wonder if that is Triple Trouble?'
And to our surprise it was! So I start chasing him, flashing my lights, honking and waving my arm to no effect, he kept just on going.
After a few kilometers he finally decided to look in his rear mirror and saw us and finally stop.
Someone need to tell Triple Trouble that the rear mirror is there for a reason.  [:D]
He was on his way home after all the caching in Bloomfield.
Quick chat and once again told him about this new cache down the road and soon we were looking for it.
Took a peek under the bridge and couldnt spot it, I started to wonder that this could be a troublemaker cache with all the hiding spots available.
I tried to get myself into Diggers mind trying to figure out where he would hide such cache, but all I could see was micros, ammo cans, trees and orange.  [:D]
Expanded my search and came across a container. 'Got it!' I yelled all excited for finally finding it but the excitement turned into disappointment when Triple mentioned that there used to be another cache in the spot where I found this one. I took a look at the log and my fears were cleared when I realized that it was a brand new logbook.
Saw that someone had already signed it, although with the wrong date (may/17) and a name unknown to us. As such we are not claiming FTF on this one.
Thanks for bringing us here Digger.</groundspeak:text>

Some of the caches in this series are just to bring up your cache count 
Some of them may be a little more difficult to find.
Be careful during hunting season, especially MOOSE season. There are a lot of hunters in this area.
Take it easy driving on the road; it can be rough on a car. I have gone out this way many times to go to St. Martins. It is a nice drive. 
The original contents of this cache are.

Family fun time for the village.

This little village is a hive of activity for families of all ages. If it gets to hot then call out the fire department. 

Nauwigewauk is a great place to come and slow down and enjoy life.

From the actual cache site you can look upon this bridge built in 1914. Do to all the flooding in the spring time a new two lane bridge was built for the muggles to use.

Park on the old road.

There is a plaque close by, on a tree, that tells the story of the bridge.

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;History&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
 The Hampton &amp; St. Martins Railway
was originally conceived to connect the rural communities in the
Hammond River valley with the outside world. Hampton, at one end of
the line had excellent rail and riverboat service to Saint John.
Approximately 28 miles away, at the other end of the line, St
Martins had been a shipbuilding centre and was served by regular
coastal freighter. By the 1870's, however, shipbuilding was in
decline, and boat connections soon disappeared. As a result, the
new railway would provide a lifeline for St Martins as well and it
was first incorporated in 1871 as the St. Martins &amp; Upham
Railway Company.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cost the company $15000.00 and the province $112000.00 thanks
to a $5000.00 per mile province government subsidy.&lt;br/&gt;
It broke ground in 1874 and opened in 1878 but it struggled to
operate profitably right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, the area was too sparsely populated, and there were too
few industries to ever allow the railroad to prosper. It spent much
of its existence in financial hardship and changed hands a number
of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After only ten years of operation the line was taken over by the
Central Railway becoming its Southern division.&lt;br/&gt;
Also because of a lack of traffic the line Central was unable to
turn a profit.&lt;br/&gt;
The line was not used in the winter due to a lack of snow removal
equipment.&lt;br/&gt;
In 1897 Central returned the line to its original shareholders and
it was renamed the Hampton St Martins Railway.&lt;br/&gt;
In 1906 it was finally sold to new owners at a big loss and it was
renamed the St Martins Railway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the several change of hands and cut costing measures and
attempts at boosting revenue the line was never profitable.&lt;br/&gt;
It was taken over and modernized as part of the federal railway
system at the end of WW1 as it was buying private railways at a
price of $65000.00 and it was renamed once again The Canadian
Government Railway and became part of the Canadian National
Railway. But the writing was on the wall. As was the case for many
railroads, better road transportation reduced the need for this
little branchline even further and it came to its inevitable demise
in 1940.&lt;/p&gt;

This cache should have been easier to find than it was.  We looked around for quite a while and almost gave up and go to the next when for some reason I looked on the other side of the path from where the GPS was telling me where to go and found it.  Then I told the GPS where to go.
I had even done the Garmin dance and it was still telling me the cache was on the opposite side of the path.

Was out today with AJLong for some hunting and had a blast.

Found the lid nearby, but left the cache wrapped in the blue bag on the ground, did not know where it is supposed to be.
The owner might want to go replace the cache asap

Today was a beautiful day to be outside and I had this one on my radar for some time.
Parked at the church and made my way to the fields across the road and from there it was a nice hike with the snowshoes.
Found the cache with no problem, but it surprised me that it was the winter friendly symbol, it is sitting on the ground.
I lucked out that the cover was not covered with snow/ice and was able to open it. The container was frozen in place.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;History&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
 The Hampton &amp; St. Martins Railway
was originally conceived to connect the rural communities in the
Hammond River valley with the outside world. Hampton, at one end of
the line had excellent rail and riverboat service to Saint John.
Approximately 28 miles away, at the other end of the line, St
Martins had been a shipbuilding centre and was served by regular
coastal freighter. By the 1870's, however, shipbuilding was in
decline, and boat connections soon disappeared. As a result, the
new railway would provide a lifeline for St Martins as well and it
was first incorporated in 1871 as the St. Martins &amp; Upham
Railway Company.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cost the company $15000.00 and the province $112000.00 thanks
to a $5000.00 per mile province government subsidy.&lt;br/&gt;
It broke ground in 1874 and opened in 1878 but it struggled to
operate profitably right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, the area was too sparsely populated, and there were too
few industries to ever allow the railroad to prosper. It spent much
of its existence in financial hardship and changed hands a number
of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After only ten years of operation the line was taken over by the
Central Railway becoming its Southern division.&lt;br/&gt;
Also because of a lack of traffic the line Central was unable to
turn a profit.&lt;br/&gt;
The line was not used in the winter due to a lack of snow removal
equipment.&lt;br/&gt;
In 1897 Central returned the line to its original shareholders and
it was renamed the Hampton St Martins Railway.&lt;br/&gt;
In 1906 it was finally sold to new owners at a big loss and it was
renamed the St Martins Railway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the several change of hands and cut costing measures and
attempts at boosting revenue the line was never profitable.&lt;br/&gt;
It was taken over and modernized as part of the federal railway
system at the end of WW1 as it was buying private railways at a
price of $65000.00 and it was renamed once again The Canadian
Government Railway and became part of the Canadian National
Railway. But the writing was on the wall. As was the case for many
railroads, better road transportation reduced the need for this
little branchline even further and it came to its inevitable demise
in 1940.&lt;/p&gt;

This one is definitely winter friendly, maybe a little too winter friendly.  Over 6 feet up and then it didn’t want to let go of its hook.  Finally got it down and signed log and got it back up.  What a nice place
This is the last and now time to go back to the cachemobile.
The bugs weren’t too bad today; I think it was too hot for them.

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;History&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
 The Hampton &amp; St. Martins Railway
was originally conceived to connect the rural communities in the
Hammond River valley with the outside world. Hampton, at one end of
the line had excellent rail and riverboat service to Saint John.
Approximately 28 miles away, at the other end of the line, St
Martins had been a shipbuilding centre and was served by regular
coastal freighter. By the 1870's, however, shipbuilding was in
decline, and boat connections soon disappeared. As a result, the
new railway would provide a lifeline for St Martins as well and it
was first incorporated in 1871 as the St. Martins &amp; Upham
Railway Company.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cost the company $15000.00 and the province $112000.00 thanks
to a $5000.00 per mile province government subsidy.&lt;br/&gt;
It broke ground in 1874 and opened in 1878 but it struggled to
operate profitably right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, the area was too sparsely populated, and there were too
few industries to ever allow the railroad to prosper. It spent much
of its existence in financial hardship and changed hands a number
of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After only ten years of operation the line was taken over by the
Central Railway becoming its Southern division.&lt;br/&gt;
Also because of a lack of traffic the line Central was unable to
turn a profit.&lt;br/&gt;
The line was not used in the winter due to a lack of snow removal
equipment.&lt;br/&gt;
In 1897 Central returned the line to its original shareholders and
it was renamed the Hampton St Martins Railway.&lt;br/&gt;
In 1906 it was finally sold to new owners at a big loss and it was
renamed the St Martins Railway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the several change of hands and cut costing measures and
attempts at boosting revenue the line was never profitable.&lt;br/&gt;
It was taken over and modernized as part of the federal railway
system at the end of WW1 as it was buying private railways at a
price of $65000.00 and it was renamed once again The Canadian
Government Railway and became part of the Canadian National
Railway. But the writing was on the wall. As was the case for many
railroads, better road transportation reduced the need for this
little branchline even further and it came to its inevitable demise
in 1940.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cache is located in the railbed that is all but gone.&lt;br/&gt;
It should be an easy find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hampton &amp; St. Martins Railway was originally conceived
to connect the rural communities in the Hammond River valley with
the outside world. Hampton, at one end of the line had excellent
rail and riverboat service to Saint John. Approximately 28 miles
away, at the other end of the line, St Martins had been a
shipbuilding centre and was served by regular coastal freighter. By
the 1870's, however, shipbuilding was in decline, and boat
connections soon disappeared. As a result, the new railway would
provide a lifeline for St Martins as well and it was first
incorporated in 1871 as the St. Martins &amp; Upham Railway
Company/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cost the company $15000.00 and the province $112000.00 thanks
to a $5000.00 per mile province government subsidy.&lt;br/&gt;
It broke ground in 1874 and opened in 1878 but it struggled to
operate profitably right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, the area was too sparsely populated, and there were too
few industries to ever allow the railroad to prosper. It spent much
of its existence in financial hardship and changed hands a number
of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After only ten years of operation the line was taken over by the
Central Railway becoming its Southern division.&lt;br/&gt;
Also because of a lack of traffic the line Central was unable to
turn a profit.&lt;br/&gt;
The line was not used in the winter due to a lack of snow removal
equipment.&lt;br/&gt;
In 1897 Central returned the line to its original shareholders and
it was renamed the Hampton St Martins Railway.&lt;br/&gt;
In 1906 it was finally sold to new owners at a big loss and it was
renamed the St Martins Railway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the several change of hands and cut costing measures and
attempts at boosting revenue the line was never profitable.&lt;br/&gt;
It was taken over and modernized as part of the federal railway
system at the end of WW1 as it was buying private railways at a
price of $65000.00 and it was renamed once again The Canadian
Government Railway and became part of the Canadian National
Railway. But the writing was on the wall. As was the case for many
railroads, better road transportation reduced the need for this
little branchline even further and it came to its inevitable demise
in 1940.&lt;/p&gt;

My eye looks awful, but returned later to complete the series, was not going to leave the series incomplete. [:)]

Take it easy driving on the road; it can be rough on a car. I have gone out this way many times to go to St. Martins.  It is a nice drive.
I even went through here driving a concrete truck once.

When all was said and done we were totally wet.
We thought we would be able to get ftf to this one but when we arrived to the cache noticed the a red jeep and someone behind a tree trying to hide himself (he was a tad too big for the tree).
Got out of the car and yelled &quot;What do you think you are doing??&quot; with a strong manly voice. [;)]
He replied that he was doing a survey of the tree.
It was my pleasure to meet Triple Trouble and we chatted for a bit and continued our trek.

Fun ride.

Go to the end of this road and you will find the Norton Shore road.  The beginning, notice I did not say trail head, because there is no trail, can be found at N45 30.020  W 06 55.166.  I have placed orange marking tape to help you.  It is a hardwood forests so the bushwacking is not difficult.  Look for the marking tape up to the top, or make your own way to the top.  In the cache I have placed 5 of my favourite movies.  Try to think of Hollywood if you are leaving a trade.  P.S. this is not a child friendly climb. </groundspeak:long_description>

Well this one is definitely harder to get to.
There is no trail, and the ground is filled with loose rocks, very easy to slide on it.
To make things harders there are now houses at the bottom, so please extra caution to not dislodge any large rock that will make its way to the houses. You've been warned.

The climb is steep, at the top there are still some red tape left that helped us going in the right direction.
The view is superb.
The descent was as bad as the climb.
Very happy to be back on the road. [:)]

Out with ZeMartelo this afternoon after the wonderful corn boil this afternoon that Mud in the Face put on. This was quite the exercise for an old fellow like myself. This should have taken off any extra pounds that was put on at the corn boil.
This is definitely a terrain 5, it should have a couple ++’s added to it.

 For his first solo around the world attempt, in the Solo Challenger departed Stratobowl, S.D., on Jan. 8, 1996. He landed the bottom of this field approximately 2,200 miles, three days later, on Jan. 11.

Chicago adventurer Steve Fossett called it &quot;the most embarrassing day of my life,&quot; but a woman from the tiny, picturesque town of Hampton, New Brunswick, thought otherwise. Forcing her way through the crowd that gathered Wednesday around Fossett's grounded Solo Challenger after his aborted attempt to be the first balloonist to fly non-stop around the world, she offered him a miniature Canadian flag. &quot;Welcome to Canada,&quot; she said. Fossett sighed wearily and said thanks.

The adventurer was 63 when he disappeared in September 2007 while on a solo flight from a Nevada ranch.</groundspeak:long_description>

Take it easy driving on the road; it can be rough on a car. I have gone out this way many times to go to St. Martins.  It is a nice drive.
I even went through here driving a concrete truck once.

Probably not winter friendly.

Thanks to mud in the face for the heads-up


There could be a soft place in the road before the cache.  You might have to walk a short ways.

Take your time Driving on these roads.  I wouldn’t want to see anyone have to walk out.
There has been a lot of wood taken out of here. This is just a little side trip up to a nice view.  Watch out for hunters in the fall.  A lot of hunters come out to this area hunting.

The road is surprisingly excellent. Initially we thought we would have to leave the vehicle behind and walk, but no problem whatsoever.
Cords were a bit off, the hint helped locating the cache.

The road is surprisingly excellent. Initially we thought we would have to leave the vehicle behind and walk, but no problem whatsoever.

The road is surprisingly excellent. Initially we thought we would have to leave the vehicle behind and walk, but no problem whatsoever.
Cords were a bit off, the hint helped locating the cache.

Be careful during hunting season, especially MOOSE season.  There are a lot of hunters in this area.
Take it easy driving on the road; it can be rough on a car. I have gone out this way many times to go to St. Martins.  It is a nice drive.
I even went through here driving a concrete truck once.

Probably not winter friendly.

Take your time Driving on these roads.  I wouldn’t want to see anyone have to walk out.
There has been a lot of wood taken out of here. This is just a little side trip up to a nice view.  Watch out for hunters in the fall.  A lot of hunters come out to this area hunting.

I was FIRST to get there.
I was FIRST to look around.
I also was FIRST to not find it.
Too many firsts and I almost missed the most important one but got a nudge from my good friend and went back and got it.
Sometimes you just need to look in the right place to see it.
Just right before the big pour came down.

Out with Lady to enjoy the end of the afternoon. Such a great day, we couldnt stay home.
The road is surprisingly excellent. Initially we thought we would have to leave the vehicle behind and walk, but no problem whatsoever.
Cords were a bit off, the hint helped locating the cache.

Take it easy driving on the road; it can be rough on a car. I have gone out this way many times to go to St. Martins.  It is a nice drive.
I even went through here driving a concrete truck once.

at cache # GC2D34N BLACK SETTLEMENT ROAD # 6 Follow it until you
come to a small brook. Just before the brook you should find a
walking trail going down to the cache. Be careful as it is quite a
steep descent. Not recommended at night. The falls are really nice
when cache was placed but not much water going over it. I imagine
that it would be really spectacular after a good rain. The cache
has a FTF coin in it. The coordinates may be a bit off as it is
heavy tree cover. The GPS had 5m accuracy. I went back after a good
rain and got this picture.</groundspeak:long_description>

Very nice place well worth the visit. Theres two ways to get to this cache. The easy way and the hard way. I took the hard way to get to the cache but took the easy way out.

Out with Lady to enjoy the end of the afternoon. Such a great day, we couldnt stay home.
Surprised to find empty logs.
Cords were a bit off, the hint helped locating the cache.

&lt;p&gt;The Cache is located at the start of the line near the Hampton
Station. You will be standing at what remains of the line. You will
be looking at history as more than a century ago trains would use
this line on a daily basis. Take a moment and try to imagine what
it must have looked like back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Hampton Station&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area’s first railway station was built in 1859, but
burned to the ground in 1867. The new station house was built later
that same year, and around 1922 was partly demolished and renovated
into the building that stands on site today. The last station
master ended his service in 1974. It currently houses the VIC, a
gift shop, and is a satellite location of the Kings Co. Museum
featuring railway artefacts. This station has had an interesting
history. For about 40 years after the opening of the rail line
towards St. Martins in 1877, the Hampton Station was home to two
separate railways. In 1918 the St. Martins line was purchased by
the Canadian Government Railways and merged into the Intercolonial
Railway. The trains to and from St. Martins were operated from its
own side of the station until the railway operations to St. Martins
was discontinued August 1, 1940.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hampton &amp; St. Martins Railway was originally conceived
to connect the rural communities in the Hammond River valley with
the outside world. Hampton, at one end of the line had excellent
rail and riverboat service to Saint John. Approximaely 28 miles
away, at the other end of the line, St Martins had been a
shipbuilding centre and was served by regular coastal freighter. By
the 1870's, however, shipbuilding was in decline, and boat
connections soon disappeared. As a result, the new railway would
provide a lifeline for St Martins as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, the area was too sparsely populated, and there were too
few industries to ever allow the railroad to prosper. It spent much
of its existence in financial hardship and changed hands a number
of times. It was taken over and modernized as part of the federal
railway system at the end of WW1, but the writing was on the wall.
As was the case for many railroads, better road transportation
reduced the need for this little branchline even further and it
came to its inevitable demise in 1940.&lt;/p&gt;

 There is a nice view from this cache. Some of the caches in this
series are just to bring up your cache count Some of them may be a
little more difficult to find. Be careful during hunting season,
especially MOOSE season. There are a lot of hunters in this area.
Take it easy driving on the road; it can be rough on a car. The
roads aren’t getting any better, are they? Micro – BYOP</groundspeak:long_description>

You are looking for a small weather proof green box. In it is a park message, a log book, a pencil and a punch (for your passport). Download the passport HERE. Do not forget to punch your passport. 

When you complete all 5 caches you have a chance to earn a limited edition non-trackable token (Only 250 minted! First-come first- served).

The geocache is a partnership of the Atlantic Canada Geocache Association, the Fundy Guild and Fundy National Park. Please pay appropriate park entry fees. As per the Parks Canada geocaching policy: Trade items are not permitted in caches, this includes Travel Bugs.
There is no need to bushwack to reach this geocache as it follows an established trail. Please consult the park map. You can follow the Point Wolfe Beach trail. Total distance is 1.2km.
Many people are surprised to learn that most of the forest in the park was logged – twice and even three times in the past. Before logging began in the early 1800s, this coastal forest had red spruce trees more than 400 years old! Some trees were up to 25 metres tall. Don’t let height trick you though; some small trees in this area are actually quite old. Cool temperatures and strong winds along the coast stunt tree growth.

Back then logging was a major industry in the province, including what is now Fundy National Park. In the Park logging was concentrated along the Point Wolfe, Upper Salmon and Goose rivers. In the winter, trees were cut and stacked along the riverbanks. In the spring, the logs were released into the swollen rivers and driven to the mills.

Logging along the rivers was not unique to the park area. At one point, mills existed on almost every river along the Fundy coast. Ships sailed up the bay to the Point Wolfe cove to load with freshly milled lumber. Fully loaded, the ships sailed to Saint John, NB, New England and as far away as the British Isles. Between three and six million board feet of lumber were shipped out each year, enough wood to build between 1,000 and 2,000 small homes today. By the late 1800s the resource was exhausted – the market for timber was in decline, easily accessible trees had been cut and the rivers were clogged with debris.

Since the creation of Fundy National Park in 1948, the forest has been protected and is recovering naturally from more than 100 years of logging. Can you imagine what it might look like in 40, 100 or even 200 years? Essential for maintaining biodiversity, Fundy National Park protects some of the last maturing forests in the region and still contains some old growth trees that are hundreds of years old. Along the coast, a researcher discovered a Red spruce that is at least 445 years old and still growing.
Plusieurs seront surpris d’apprendre que la forêt du parc fut exploitée pour son bois – deux et même trois fois dans le passé. Avant le début de l’exploitation forestière au début des années 1800, certaines épinettes de cette forêt côtière avaient plus de 400 ans ! Certains arbres mesuraient plus de 25 mètres. Ne vous fiez pas uniquement à la taille par contre; certains arbres dans cette région sont très vieux. La température fraiche ainsi que les vents forts retardent la croissance des arbres.

Au début des années 1800, l’exploitation forestière était une industrie majeure dans la province, incluant le territoire maintenant occupé par le Parc National Fundy. Dans le parc, l’exploitation se concentrait surtout le long des rivières Point Wolfe, Upper Salmon et Goose. Durant l’hiver, les arbres fraichement coupés étaient empilés sur les berges alors qu’au printemps, les billots étaient poussés dans les rivières gorgées d’eau et guidés jusqu’aux moulins.

L’exploitation forestière le long des rivières n’était pas confinée au secteur du parc. À une certaine époque, il y avait des moulins le long de presque toutes les rivières de la côte de Fundy. Des navires remontaient la baie jusqu’à l’anse de Point Wolfe pour faire chargement de bois d’oeuvre fraichement coupé. À pleine charge, les navires se rendaient jusqu’à Saint-Jean (Nouveau-Brunswick), en Nouvelle-Angleterre et même jusque dans les iles britanniques. On estime qu’entre 3 et 6 millions de pieds-planches de bois étaient ainsi expédiés chaque année; assez de bois pour construire de 1000 à 2000 petites maison aujourd’hui. Vers la fin des années 1800, la ressource était épuisée – le marché du bois d’œuvre était en déclin et les débris bouchaient les rivières.

Depuis la création du Parc National Fundy en 1948, la forêt, maintenant protégée, se remet naturellement de l’effet de plus de 100 ans d’exploitation forestière. Pouvez-vous imaginer son aspect dans 40, 100 ou même 200 ans ? Le Parc National Fundy protège certaines des dernières forêts arrivant à maturité de la région et compte toujours plusieurs arbres qui ont quelques centaines d’années. Le long de la côte, un chercheur a découvert une épinette rouge qui a au moins 445 ans !

Fundy National Park is the only national park in
Canada in which visitors can journey back in time by passing
through a covered bridge.  At the time of the park’s
establishment in 1948, there were four such bridges.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Today, two covered bridges remain  in Fundy National Park: one
spanning the Point Wolfe River and the other over the Forty-Five
River on the Eastern Boundary of the park.   Both of
these structures are Howe truss covered bridges.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
The bridge at the Forty-Five River has spanned a deep gorge on the
Forty-Five River since 1914 and is the only remaining original
covered bridge in the park..  It is situated on the
Park’s Eastern boundary formed by the  Forty-Five
Road.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Settlers were attracted to the Point Wolfe area in the early 1820s
by the splendid trees. A dam and  sawmill were built 
downriver from the bridge.  An ingenious suspension bridge was
built in 1853 under the direction of Gideon Vernon whose
father’s timber empire then included Point Wolfe.  A
more substantial suspension bridge replaced it around 1875. 
This collapsed into the mill pond in the summer of 1908.  C.T.
White, the lumber baron who owned the Point Wolfe milling operation
at that time, prodded the provincial Bridge Department for two
years until a wooden Howe truss bridge was built in 1910.  It
was given a roof and sidewalls in 1911.  After the accidental
destruction of the 81-year-old covered bridge in 1990, a temporary
Bailey bridge spanned the gap.  It was replaced in 1992 by the
one you travel through today.  To find out more about the
history of Pt. Wolfe, visit the interpretive panels at  the
look off just upriver from the   bridge&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
The two covered bridges that no longer exist, were at Bennett Lake
and the mouth of the Upper Salmon River.  The Bennett Lake
covered bridge, built in 1924, was removed in 1950 when highway 114
was rebuilt.  Why not go for a paddle  on the lake and
see old abutments found near the dam?  Stop by the visitor
centre near the Alma entrance to  see a model of this
bridge.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 The covered bridge spanning the Upper Salmon River
(1919-1969) served for many years to link Alma and Fundy National
Park.   It had a swinging span that would allow ships to
pass  upriver to the  Alma mill.  In 1939 the swing
span was replaced with the semi-covered Howe truss span.  The
bridge was dismantled and replaced with today’s cement bridge
(1967). One of the original concrete peers of the Alma covered
bridge is still visible on the Alma side of the river.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
There’s  a lot to explore in Fundy.  Whether
it’s the wonders of nature or a glimpse back in time through
the history of the area,  there’s always something to
discover.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
If you are on foot, please use caution around the covered bridge
areas.  Bridges are one lane. Also, if you are in the bridge,
a driver may not see you as their eyes adjust to the darkness
inside the bridge.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
To see more evidence of the people who lived here long ago, hike to
Matthews Head. Keep your eyes open for old foundations, former farm
fields, farmers’ rock piles, plants the settlers grew such as
lilac, rhubarb, apple trees, day lilies, rose bushes. Many of these
things can also be discovered in other areas of the park. 
Also, there are interpretive displays at Point Wolfe about its
history.  &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Happy caching!&lt;br/&gt;
Le parc Fundy est le seul parc
national du Canada où les visiteurs peuvent remonter le temps en
passant sur un pont couvert. À l’époque de sa fondation, en
1948, le parc comptait quatre de ces ponts couverts.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Aujourd’hui, deux ponts couverts sont toujours en place dans
le parc national Fundy : l’un deux enjambe la rivière Point
Wolfe et l’autre, la rivière Forty-Five située à la limite
est du parc. Ces deux structures sont des ponts couverts à poutres
Howe.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 Le pont de la rivière Forty-Five enjambe une
profonde gorge depuis 1914. Il s’agit du seul pont couvert
original qui reste dans le parc. Il marque l’extrémité est du
parc, qui est délimité par le chemin Forty-Five.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Attirés par les arbres majestueux de la région, des pionniers se
sont établis à Point Wolfe au début des années 1820. Un barrage et
une scierie ont été construits en aval du pont. En 1853, un
ingénieux pont suspendu a été construit sous la direction de Gideon
Vernon : l’empire du bois d’œuvre de son père
comprenait alors Point Wolfe. Le pont suspendu plus sophistiqué qui
l’a remplacé vers 1875 s’est effondré dans
l’étang de la scierie au cours de l’été 1908. C.T.
White, le magnat du bois à qui appartenait la scierie de Point
Wolfe à l’époque, a fait pression auprès du ministère
provincial des ponts pendant deux ans jusqu’à ce qu’un
pont de bois à poutres Howe soit construit en 1910. Un toit et des
murs y ont été ajoutés en 1911. Après la destruction accidentelle
de ce pont couvert vieux de 81 ans en 1990, un pont Bailey a été
érigé temporairement. Cette structure a été remplacée en 1992 par
le pont que vous empruntez aujourd’hui pour traverser la
rivière Point Wolfe. Pour en apprendre davantage sur
l’histoire de Point Wolfe, consultez les panneaux
d’interprétation au belvédère en amont du pont.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Les deux ponts couverts qui n’existent plus étaient situés
sur le lac Bennett et à l’embouchure de la rivière Upper
Salmon. Construit en 1924, le pont couvert du lac Bennett a été
démoli en 1950 lors de la reconstruction de la route 114. Pourquoi
ne pas faire un petit tour en canot ou en kayak sur le lac et en
profiter pour aller voir les vieilles culées du pont près du
barrage? Vous pouvez également passer au Centre d’accueil
près de l’entrée du parc à Alma pour voir une maquette de ce
pont.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Le pont couvert qui enjambait la rivière Upper Salmon de 1919 à
1969 reliait pendant de nombreuses années le village d’Alma
et le parc national Fundy. Ce pont comportait une travée pivotante
qui permettait aux bateaux de remonter la rivière vers la scierie
d’Alma. En 1939, le pont à travée pivotante a été remplacé
par un pont semi-couvert à poutres Howe. Ce pont a été démoli et
remplacé en 1967 par la structure actuelle en ciment. L’une
des piles originales en béton du pont couvert d’Alma est
encore visible du côté de la rivière qui donne sur le
village.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Le parc Fundy regorge d’endroits à explorer. Qu’il
s’agisse de merveilles naturelles ou de vestiges historiques
d’une époque révolue, il y a toujours quelque chose à
découvrir.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 Si vous êtes à pied, soyez prudents autour des
ponts couverts. Ce sont des ponts à une voie. N’oubliez pas :
lorsque vous êtes sur le pont, vous devez faire attention aux
voitures. Les conducteurs pourraient ne pas vous voir puisque leurs
yeux doivent s’habituer à la pénombre qui règne à
l’intérieur.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Pour voir d’autres traces des gens qui vivaient ici
autrefois, empruntez le sentier du Cap-Matthews. Gardez
l’œil ouvert. Vous pourriez apercevoir de vieilles
fondations, d’anciens champs agricoles, des piles de roches
laissées par les fermiers ou encore des plantes que les pionniers
cultivaient telles que des lilas, de la rhubarbe, des pommiers, des
hémérocalles et des rosiers. Ces traces sont toujours présentes
dans d’autres secteurs du parc. Ne manquez pas également
d’aller jeter un coup d’œil aux panneaux
d’interprétation à Point Wolfe sur l’histoire de la
région. Bonne chasse!&lt;br/&gt;

So with the storm just starting and in the middle of the night in a split second decision went after the new caches.
The roads were not too bad yet, but it was pitch dark.
This cache was easy to find and not too far from the road Hooray for that. :)
Ive know about this spring for awhile and the water has always tasted good.

Take the Bloomfield exit off Highway #1.  Go south on Bloomfield Ridge South Rd.
Cache is on the right.  Go in just before the brook and a short way in there is a good spring that is running all the time and the water is good and cold.
Some of the cottagers come here to get their water.  One of them had it tested and nailed the results to a tree but I see it is gone now.  It was tested good.  It is very cold and refreshing.
The cache is a medium sized plastic camo container containing pencil and sharpener, log book, and small trading items..
To start with there is a Travel Bug and a Travel Tag.
The Waypoint for the spring is 45-34-026 and 65-40-383.  Just down from the Cache.

Did not know there was a brook and a spring in that area.
Terrain was very muddy but thats normal for this time of the year and with all the rain we've had.
The water tasted fresh.

 We thought this was a very interesting looking tree. It looks like
it has been hand formed into that shape. It is definitely not a
miniature bonsai. Some of the caches in this series are just to
bring up your cache count Some of them may be a little more
difficult to find. Be careful during hunting season, especially
MOOSE season. There are a lot of hunters in this area. Take it easy
driving on the road; it can be rough on a car.</groundspeak:long_description>

If you have a car you will likely have to walk from here.
It should only be a little more than 2 kilometers round trip.
This road is locally known by this name.
Just up the road, at the bottom of the hill on the opposite side of the road there was a shack between the road and the brook.  There was a family of Indians lived there.  They literally lived off the land.  Because of their Indian status they could go onto anyone’s land and they would cut down a tree and take what they needed to make baskets and things.  I remember they would get the locals to take their baskets and goods to market.  Sometimes they would take them as far as Nova Scotia.  I remember that they had a boy that was quite a bit older than I was and he used to work for my father in the woods cutting pulp wood and firewood.  They also had a daughter about my age and seeing I lived up the road further and had to walk past here to go to school we would walk to school together.  As I remember she was a pretty thing too.</groundspeak:long_description>

So with the storm just starting in the middle of the night in a split second decision went after the new caches.
The roads were not too bad yet, but it was pitch dark.
This cache was further from the road than I expected and let me tell you that the trees look very creepy in pitch dark and a flashlight.
Did not find the cache last night because the GPS was telling me to go in further and I really didnt want to go. It was that creepy.
On top of that the flashlight died.
So early this morning I went out again and was greeted with all the snow and bad road conditions.
Did that stop me? Nope, especially with a FTF in play.
This morning the road was so bad that I could not get the car all the way to the cache and got it stuck about 1.3km's from it. Did that stop me?
Nope, walked the distance facing the cold and the snow.
Thats how determined I was.
Once I got to the location I simply trusted the GPS and found the cache in no time and was out there... for another walk that was to the car.
All this for a FTF...
TFTC.

If someone can give me better coordinates I will try to change them.

On the way to the caches on this Shepody road take your time; it could be harmful to your vehicle.  There are boulders and large gravel on the road.  Take your time.  I wouldn’t want to see anyone have to walk out.

This is a micro so BYOP

Some of the people who were allotted land on the Shepody Road were not very well satisfied due to the poor quality of the land. The truth is that when the tide of Immigration from Ireland began about 1818 there was very little good land along the rivers left ungranted. In 1826, a number of the settlers petitioned to have the Shepody Road improved. They  complained of its condition and the choice of taking it over the tops of some mountains nearly perpendicular and so very stony that no labor ever could make it a good turnpike road. The petition states there were thirty-five families making in all one hundred and thirty three souls and they had cleared and had under cultivation three hundred and eighty acres of land. They spoke of their various hardships and how it was very difficult for them to get enough money to pay for their land grants. The petition was signed by: James Elliott. Henry Douglas, Hugh McCarter, James Alexander, Arthur Robson, Edward Robson, Robert Mills, James Dunne, Thomas Duffield, Frederick Emerson, John Patton, George Crow, Charles Campbell, Thomas Schoals, John Smith, Ephraim Smith, John Wiley, Robert Nethery, Thomas Gregory, James Nethery, William Marshall, William Scott, Joseph Emerson, James Crow, Samuel Campbell and William Barber. This gives us some idea as to the heads of families living on the Shepody Road in 1826.
Other petitions are included. Appendix B lists the owners of Land Grants.

The Anglican settlers of Londonderry were served by travelling ministers and missionaries until St. Paul's was built in the early 1850s. Rev. W. H. DeVeber reported to the Church Society in 1851 that &quot;a neat norman structure, consisting of a tower, nave and chancel of pleasing proportions had been built. It will hold about 159 people and will, it is hoped prove a blessing to the settlers in that comparatively poor district. With the Society's help, the Missionary hopes to finish the church next summer.&quot;

Quotations also are given from the diary of Bishop Medley.

The settlers of Londonderry did get their house of worship but one by one they left the Shepody Road until the farm land was taken over by the forests.

The Ulster Scots have never had an easy time, but their toughness and their love for their church shows again in their descendants as they labor to keep the building intact, just as their forefathers labored to have the church erected.

This year, as in years past, on a Sunday in August, they will travel the dusty narrow Shepody Road to open the doors of St. Paul's Church in Londonderry and step back in time by singing the hymns of praise and hearing the words of scripture as did the settlers of years gone by.

Got to this cache before the big rainfall in the morning but nonetheless still managed to get all wet walking into the woods. :)
It was nice to meet the three brothers, but they gave me a bit of trouble with the cache.

They  complained of its condition and the choice of taking it over the tops of some mountains nearly perpendicular and so very stony that no labor ever could make it a good turnpike road. The petition states there were thirty-five families making in all one hundred and thirty three souls and they had cleared and had under cultivation three hundred and eighty acres of land. They spoke of their various hardships and how it was very difficult for them to get enough money to pay for their land grants. The petition was signed by: James Elliott. Henry Douglas, Hugh McCarter, James Alexander, Arthur Robson, Edward Robson, Robert Mills, James Dunne, Thomas Duffield, Frederick Emerson, John Patton, George Crow, Charles Campbell, Thomas Schoals, John Smith, Ephraim Smith, John Wiley, Robert Nethery, Thomas Gregory, James Nethery, William Marshall, William Scott, Joseph Emerson, James Crow, Samuel Campbell and William Barber. This gives us some idea as to the heads of families living on the Shepody Road in 1826.
Other petitions are included. Appendix B lists the owners of Land Grants.

The Anglican settlers of Londonderry were served by travelling ministers and missionaries until St. Paul's was built in the early 1850s. Rev. W. H. DeVeber reported to the Church Society in 1851 that &quot;a neat norman structure, consisting of a tower, nave and chancel of pleasing proportions had been built. It will hold about 159 people and will, it is hoped prove a blessing to the settlers in that comparatively poor district. With the Society's help, the Missionary hopes to finish the church next summer.&quot;

Quotations also are given from the diary of Bishop Medley.

The settlers of Londonderry did get their house of worship but one by one they left the Shepody Road until the farm land was taken over by the forests.

The Ulster Scots have never had an easy time, but their toughness and their love for their church shows again in their descendants as they labor to keep the building intact, just as their forefathers labored to have the church erected.

This year, as in years past, on a Sunday in August, they will travel the dusty narrow Shepody Road to open the doors of St. Paul's Church in Londonderry and step back in time by singing the hymns of praise and hearing the words of scripture as did the settlers of years gone by.

Got to this cache before the big rainfall in the morning but nonetheless still managed to get all wet walking into the woods. :)
As I was turning around a truck pulls up the road and I got to meet Tetagoucher.
It was a pleasant surprise and we chatted for a bit and we both went our way.
Its always great to meet cachers on the trails and especially even more with folks like Tetagoucher.
Hopefully we will meet again.
On the way out had to make space for some heavy equipment that was being hauled by 4 ton trucks.
That was the last place I expected to see these trucks.

I challenged Teta to get the new caches on Shepody early morning thinking that he would be too tired or busy at work but he called my bluff and made me get up at 5am for the cache run.
Cache was easy to find.
We saw the carcass on  the ground, not sure how long its going to stay there.
Had a great time finding the caches and enjoyed going along with Tetagoucher.
Cant comment on the breakfast,I wasnt offered one!  [:(]

The American eel is found throughout the eastern coast of  North America and lower Greenland.   When in our rivers and lakes the adult (yellow eel)  is browny - green on top and more yellow on bottom. American eels have a small sharp pointed head with sharp teeth and no pelvic fin.

 
Adult American eels migrate (as silver eels) to the Sargasso Sea (in the southwestern part of the North Atlantic Ocean) to have their young.  They make an incredible journey from lakes, down rivers and streams until they meeet the ocean.  Along this journey their bodies change to prepare for the transition from freshwater to salt water and for repreoduction.  Theese changes occur at depths of up to 400m below the ocean’s surface!

 
Each female produces up to 4 million eggs in the salty warm water  of  the Sargasso Sea blanketed in sargassum- the  seaweed that is found there.  After spawning the adults die- completeing the  final stage of their lives .  When the egg hatches the larval eels, leptocepheli, passively drift with the ocean currents.  For 16 – 18 months the leptocepheli follow the Gulf Stream. Soon they begin to change and  make their way to fresh water. They are perfectly clear and are known as glass eels.  Once they have swam up river and begun to eat aquatic insects they darken up and are known as elvers. As they continue to swim farther up stream and settle in lakes and deep pools they will be adults, yellow eels. Silver eels are the adults who are migrating back to the ocean, the final stage of their lives.

 
Eels have an important role in the freshwater ecosystem.  They eat dead fish, insects and other invertebrates.  In turn, eels are eaten by eagles, other fish, and humans.  Humans and American Eels share habitats.  Eels have historical and cultural significance to the people who live in the same regions as eels do.

 
Dams or barriers that alter and fragment river systems are one of the biggest threats to eels.  They make an incredible journey from the Sargasso Sea-where they begin their lives, to the freshwater systems, where  they spend thirty, forty or even fifty years of their lives.  To carry on their cycle of life, they return to the Sargasso Sea.    This is when they are in greatest danger of dams, especially with turbines, obstructing water ways.  On dark damp nights eels have been known to leave the water and crawl around on shore to get around dams and barriers.  The turbines found in dams can mean injury or death for eels. Climate change is also a threat for eels.  Ocean currents may be altered and could interfere with how young eels make their way from the sea to freshwater.

 
Fundy National Park protects 206 km2 of Maritime Acadian Highlands.  Inside our park boundaries many species can be found.  However many of these species, big and small, move in and out of our boundary.  Some migrate great distances as part of their life cycle.  Can you think of any? The American eel is one of those species.  Fundy National Park is learning more about eels by monitoring returning eel populations.

 
The life of an American eel is incredible! Imagine- one eel can live up to fifty years in freshwater before migrating back to the sea.  Eels are truly an amazing fish.  Recently, american eels have been listed as ‘special concern’ by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC).   What can you do to help species like the eel?

Just a note on Martha.  She was a Native of Londonderry
She would have been born in 1774.  That was a long time ago.
She may have known my 3rd great-grandfather.  He was born 1773 and I think he settled in Long Settlement which isn’t far from here.  He came from Ireland about 1818
Who knows, maybe they came over together.  I don’t know anything about his family, who knows she could be his sister, only 1 year apart in age.

The Crowe Cemetery is an old cemetery found on the north side of the Shepody Road approximately 3.3 km from the Schoales Dam Forest Ranger station. It is completely overgrown, but there is a small sign by the side of the road and a trail leading up to the cemetery, where other paths take you to the various sites where stones are erected. Some monuments are only iron markers with no information preserved on them. It is hard to establish the dates between which the cemetery was used since some of the data is now missing, however we can surmise that it was not used prior to 1818 or even possibly 1826.

In 1818, James Crow came to New Brunswick from Ireland, most probably with his father or brother. Like many others at that time, he may have been given a location ticket which allowed him to settle upon a lot of land and improve upon it before formally applying for a grant of the land in his own name at a later date. He applied for his grant of land in 1826 and/or 1827. He was granted his 50 acre grant in 1834. There is no indication as to when the grant next to it, granted to George Crow, was received. This George Crow would appear to be the father or brother of James as he appears on a petition to have the route of the road changed in 1826. There is no record of this George Crow in the 1851 census for Hammond. We do find a George Crow living a few miles north on the border of what is now Hammond and Waterford Parishes in 1861.

So the land for this cemetery would not have been set aside for such use before 1818 and maybe as late as 1828, the earliest known date for a burial there. The latest burial may have been in 1891, as that is the last date known with any certainty. After that date, few people lived in that area.

The cemetery is found, as I mentioned, by traveling by foot about 150 m up the hill from the road. Many people may wonder why a cemetery was ever put here, so far from the road and on such a steep hill. However  we make this judgment based upon where the road is today. Back when the road was first laid out and the land was granted by location ticket, the road actually ran in pretty much a straight line rather than curving around the hills in this area, meaning that the roadway was actually about 300m further north than its present course at this point. The road, originally built about 1817, was changed in 1826 because some of the 1817 road, in this section in particular, was along the tops of hills, some of which were extremely steep and rocky, making passage through the area very difficult. The cemetery, then, would have been south of the old road and probably beside it on a little knoll.

Without the benefit of a survey, it is hard to say with any certainty on which property the cemetery lies, but the best guess would place it roughly in the upper right hand corner of the George Crow grant. By the 1890's, there was the beginning of an exodus away from the area since the road was no longer used by the stagecoach nor was the road used as the main road from Shepody to Saint John, a new one being opened through Harvey around 1845-1850. With the end of the stage through the area, the hope of the area becoming a thriving trading area began to wane. People began to move to Sussex, to Saint John and to other regions, some even as far away as Western Canada, where the land was good and they were looking for farmers.

There are only nine markers remaining in this cemetery, but there are undoubtedly more graves here than represented by the markers. Like many other cemeteries, stones may either be missing or never erected in the first place. Of the nine markers, three are missing the names of those buried there. This leaves us with only six markers designating people buried here.

I was creeped out the whole time while looking for the tombstones.
It was quickly getting dark and the tombs were hard to read even with a flashlight and I spent more time looking over my shoulders than at the tombstones.
I am not sure if I got the right cords or not as my GPS was bouncing me around and I was looking for a micro which made me spend more time than I liked looking for it when I spotted the small container.
After signing the logbook I ran out of there as fast as I could.
I dont usually have a problem being in the woods in the dark but there was something with this place that made me sweat and very uneasy.
Very creepy.

Btw, thanks for the history of this place, I wonder if there are any remains of settlements nearby?

This is a micro so BYOP

Some of the people who were allotted land on the Shepody Road were not very well satisfied due to the poor quality of the land. The truth is that when the tide of Immigration from Ireland began about 1818 there was very little good land along the rivers left ungranted. In 1826, a number of the settlers petitioned to have the Shepody Road improved. They  complained of its condition and the choice of taking it over the tops of some mountains nearly perpendicular and so very stony that no labor ever could make it a good turnpike road. The petition states there were thirty-five families making in all one hundred and thirty three souls and they had cleared and had under cultivation three hundred and eighty acres of land. They spoke of their various hardships and how it was very difficult for them to get enough money to pay for their land grants. The petition was signed by: James Elliott. Henry Douglas, Hugh McCarter, James Alexander, Arthur Robson, Edward Robson, Robert Mills, James Dunne, Thomas Duffield, Frederick Emerson, John Patton, George Crow, Charles Campbell, Thomas Schoals, John Smith, Ephraim Smith, John Wiley, Robert Nethery, Thomas Gregory, James Nethery, William Marshall, William Scott, Joseph Emerson, James Crow, Samuel Campbell and William Barber. This gives us some idea as to the heads of families living on the Shepody Road in 1826.
Other petitions are included. Appendix B lists the owners of Land Grants.

The Anglican settlers of Londonderry were served by travelling ministers and missionaries until St. Paul's was built in the early 1850s. Rev. W. H. DeVeber reported to the Church Society in 1851 that &quot;a neat norman structure, consisting of a tower, nave and chancel of pleasing proportions had been built. It will hold about 159 people and will, it is hoped prove a blessing to the settlers in that comparatively poor district. With the Society's help, the Missionary hopes to finish the church next summer.&quot;

Quotations also are given from the diary of Bishop Medley.

The settlers of Londonderry did get their house of worship but one by one they left the Shepody Road until the farm land was taken over by the forests.

The Ulster Scots have never had an easy time, but their toughness and their love for their church shows again in their descendants as they labor to keep the building intact, just as their forefathers labored to have the church erected.

This year, as in years past, on a Sunday in August, they will travel the dusty narrow Shepody Road to open the doors of St. Paul's Church in Londonderry and step back in time by singing the hymns of praise and hearing the words of scripture as did the settlers of years gone by.

Some of the caches in this series are just to bring up your cache count 
Some of them may be a little more difficult to find.
Be careful during hunting season, especially MOOSE season. There are a lot of hunters in this area.
Take it easy driving on the road; it can be rough on a car.

This is a micro so BYOP
Hint: It is all in the title.
Some of the people who were allotted land on the Shepody Road were not very well satisfied due to the poor quality of the land. The truth is that when the tide of Immigration from Ireland began about 1818 there was very little good land along the rivers left ungranted. In 1826, a number of the settlers petitioned to have the Shepody Road improved. They  complained of its condition and the choice of taking it over the tops of some mountains nearly perpendicular and so very stony that no labor ever could make it a good turnpike road. The petition states there were thirty-five families making in all one hundred and thirty three souls and they had cleared and had under cultivation three hundred and eighty acres of land. They spoke of their various hardships and how it was very difficult for them to get enough money to pay for their land grants. The petition was signed by: James Elliott. Henry Douglas, Hugh McCarter, James Alexander, Arthur Robson, Edward Robson, Robert Mills, James Dunne, Thomas Duffield, Frederick Emerson, John Patton, George Crow, Charles Campbell, Thomas Schoals, John Smith, Ephraim Smith, John Wiley, Robert Nethery, Thomas Gregory, James Nethery, William Marshall, William Scott, Joseph Emerson, James Crow, Samuel Campbell and William Barber. This gives us some idea as to the heads of families living on the Shepody Road in 1826.
Other petitions are included. Appendix B lists the owners of Land Grants.

The Anglican settlers of Londonderry were served by travelling ministers and missionaries until St. Paul's was built in the early 1850s. Rev. W. H. DeVeber reported to the Church Society in 1851 that &quot;a neat norman structure, consisting of a tower, nave and chancel of pleasing proportions had been built. It will hold about 159 people and will, it is hoped prove a blessing to the settlers in that comparatively poor district. With the Society's help, the Missionary hopes to finish the church next summer.&quot;

Quotations also are given from the diary of Bishop Medley.

The settlers of Londonderry did get their house of worship but one by one they left the Shepody Road until the farm land was taken over by the forests.

The Ulster Scots have never had an easy time, but their toughness and their love for their church shows again in their descendants as they labor to keep the building intact, just as their forefathers labored to have the church erected.

This year, as in years past, on a Sunday in August, they will travel the dusty narrow Shepody Road to open the doors of St. Paul's Church in Londonderry and step back in time by singing the hymns of praise and hearing the words of scripture as did the settlers of years gone by.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">According to family history, sometime between 1820 and 1830, Edward O’Donnell took a coastal boat from the port of Saint John up to Shepody in Albert County, seeking suitable land for a homestead.  He saw a great green forest sloping down to the Bay of Fundy he went in-land, hacked out a clearing and built a log cabin. He was eventually thought missing and a search party was sent out from Saint John to find him. Upon arrival, the search party, also Irish immigrants, were also impressed and stayed. Others followed, carving a path that became known as the Shepody Road and here the community of New Ireland came to be.

Some of the caches in this series are just to bring up your cache count 
Some of them may be a little more difficult to find.
Be careful during hunting season, especially MOOSE season. There are a lot of hunters in this area.

I challenged Teta to get the new caches on Shepody early morning thinking that he would be too tired or busy at work but he called my bluff and made me get up at 5am for the cache run.
Cache was easy to find.
Had a great time finding the caches and enjoyed going along with Tetagoucher.
Cant comment on the breakfast,I wasnt offered one!  [:(]
Thanks for the FTF and the cache fun.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This bridge used to always be green so all the locals still refer to it as “THE OLD GREEN BRIDGE”, although the last time they painted it a different colour.
I have heard my father say that this is the longest single span steel bridge ever built.
He said when he was a kid they used to dive off the bridge into the water.  I don’t think the water is deep enough to do that now.
Paddlewheelers used to come up past this point in the river.</groundspeak:long_description>

I challenged Teta to get the new caches on Shepody early morning thinking that he would be too tired or busy at work but he called my bluff and made me get up at 5am for the cache run.
Cache was easy to find.
Had a great time finding the caches and enjoyed going along with Tetagoucher.

I challenged Teta to get the new caches on Shepody early morning thinking that he would be too tired or busy at work but he called my bluff and made me get up at 5am for the cache run.
Cache was easy to find.
Had a great time finding the caches and enjoyed going along with Tetagoucher.
Cant comment on the breakfast,I wasnt offered one!  [:(]

There is a TB in this container to be moved along to keep on his journey.
Some of the caches in this series are just to bring up your cache count 
Some of them may be a little more difficult to find.
Be careful during hunting season, especially MOOSE season. There are a lot of hunters in this area.

I challenged Teta to get the new caches on Shepody early morning thinking that he would be too tired or busy at work but he called my bluff and made me get up at 5am for the cache run.
Cache was easy to find.
Had a great time finding the caches and enjoyed going along with Tetagoucher.

This road was put in about the time when they put the four lane hwy through.  I had never been up this way before.  When I took the drive up here I thought it would be a good place to put out some caches in the area.

Very winter friendly.

This one may require a hike for some.  When ZeMartelo got the first caches that were published on this road he said that he drove on in as far as the shooting range and the road looked good to go in further so here goes.  I have a Jeep, it sounded good to me.</groundspeak:long_description>

Hmmm since when does people listen to me?
No matter it was a nice hike from the shooting range even thou the road is pretty good to drive thru.
It was an easy find.
Thanks for the fun.

I challenged Teta to get the new caches on Shepody early morning thinking that he would be too tired or busy at work but he called my bluff and made me get up at 5am for the cache run.
Cache was easy to find.
Had a great time finding the caches and enjoyed going along with Tetagoucher.
Cant comment on the breakfast,I wasnt offered one!  [:(]
Thanks for the FTF and the cache fun.</groundspeak:text>

I challenged Teta to get the new caches on Shepody early morning thinking that he would be too tired or busy at work but he called my bluff and made me get up at 5am for the cache run.
Cache was easy to find.
Had a great time finding the caches and enjoyed going along with Tetagoucher.
Cant comment on the breakfast,I wasnt offered one!  [:(]
Thanks for the FTF and the cache fun.</groundspeak:text>

It sure doesn’t look much like farm land right now.  Maybe with all the clear cutting going on around here now, it will look a lot more baron.  I am little worried about putting caches out along here but here goes.  I will put out a few.
I left a travel tag in this cache to start it off.  Please move it along.
When you log this traveler tag on www.travelertags.com please enter the coordinates and the cache code number where you drop it off

I challenged Teta to get the new caches on Shepody early morning thinking that he would be too tired or busy at work but he called my bluff and made me get up at 5am for the cache run.
Cache was easy to find.
Had a great time finding the caches and enjoyed going along with Tetagoucher.
Cant comment on the breakfast,I wasnt offered one!  [:(]
Thanks for the FTF and the cache fun.</groundspeak:text>

You will have to bring your own writing stick as there is none in the container.

I love my paperless caching GPS! :)

The road was bare and no problem drive up to the cache location.
Get out of the car look at the GPS and it tells me that the cache is 200meters away and then start walking into the woods.
I see the spring box and as I walk and sink to my waist in snow I come across this huge open field and the cache still 180 meters away.
&quot;Theres no way I can walk this without snowshoes!&quot; - because with every step I would find myself buried to the waist. And then I remembered, this was supposed to be an easy cache.
So thanks to my paperless geocaching GPS I read the description and yep it says right there &quot;Easy cache&quot; and terrain 1.5 and difficulty 1.5.
Walking 200meters does not qualify for &quot;easy cache&quot; and I know Ajlong would not put a cache that far into the woods.
A quick phone call to the owner to confirm my suspicions.
&quot;Yep the cache is near the road at the base of a tree, good luck with it&quot;.

So looked around for the most obvious places and there it was.
Almost in plain sight.
Signed the darn thing and kissed my GPS, it saved me of alot of aggravation.
TFTC.

If anyone gets a better coordinates maybe you could let me know.
If you can find the cache fairly easy I will leave alone.
After crossing the stone wall the ground could be a little wet.

I challenged Teta to get the new caches on Shepody early morning thinking that he would be too tired or busy at work but he called my bluff and made me get up at 5am for the cache run.
Cache was easy to find but the climb not so fun. [:)]
Had a great time finding the caches and enjoyed going along with Tetagoucher.
Cant comment on the breakfast,I wasnt offered one!  [:(]
Thanks for the FTF and the cache fun.</groundspeak:text>

Easy find. I was not too happy with the road anymore the more I drove in the worse it seemed to get and was running out of time so I made this the last one for the day... Will be back sometime to get the other caches in the area.

Your first attempt and a successful one for sure.
At the second stage I was looking the wrong way till I read the description and realized that I was looking in the wrong direction. [:)]
After that it was an easy find.

It is located between Bloomfield and Norton on RT. 121
The cache is a medium sized plastic camo. container containing pencil and sharpener, log book, radio tube and a cow for trading items.
To start with there and a Travel Tag.
I found this cemetery many years ago and it was in really run down condition.  I new some Baxter’s in Saint John so I told them about the cemetery and they new nothing about it.  They came out and cleaned it up a bit. When I was talking to them a way back then I asked how much of the 5000 acre grant was still owned by Baxter’s and they thought it was about 40 acres.
Since then the Kings County Historical Society has cleaned it up a lot more.

When I found out that my good friend AJLong had another cache out I went out after it right away.

Did not know that there was a cemetary there despite passing that road very often.
Took some time to find the cache because of the snow.
Very nice place.
Left TB and coin.

Right behind Zemartello, Jim52 and Hillbilly Bob. Looks like I am going to have to start caching at night to catch new ones coming out. LOL! thanks for the Cache. Nice spot here and the frost in the Alders along the river really looked nice (Nice and COLD that is!) Winter is coming and the caching is easy TNLN SL

It was a beautiful clear day when I was here and the view is breathtaking
This is the container that I won at the Geocacher's Breakfast May 2nd, 2010 Sussex, NB
This is also my 100th placed cache.

The view is really awesome. Not the kinda of spot I would find on my own for sure, but this is geocaching at his best.
Ajlong made this his 100th hidden cache and I cant think of a better place to do it than here. 
Congratulations on your 100th Hide.

I challenged Teta to get the new caches on Shepody early morning thinking that he would be too tired or busy at work but he called my bluff and made me get up at 5am for the cache run.
Cache was easy to find.
Had a great time finding the caches and enjoyed going along with Tetagoucher.
Cant comment on the breakfast,I wasnt offered one!  [:(]
Thanks for the FTF and the cache fun.</groundspeak:text>

Welcome to the Norton TB Hotel and Geo Post.
Feel free to stop by and trade your TB's and/or Coins to help them on their journey.

I hope this location will be good for moving TB's and post cards for other cachers.

You can visit this cache as many times as you wish, just log that you found it the first time, and any time after that all I require is that if you take a TB that you leave one unless you are traveling and just want to pick one up to move it along and you don't have one to drop. Please log a note that you have been here again. This also is the same if you just want to stop in to check the mail, or move some along for other people.

Have fun. Please rehide the cache as you found it. Thanks. Ze. </groundspeak:long_description>

There is a lot of good swag in this one.  This is a good place for a Hotel and Post Office.  I dropped off 3 coins and got 3 TB’s.
As I was getting close to this one I say to the better half that I should do the GPS dance as I haven’t done it for quite a while.  I just started making my trip around and noticed the cache and went for it and when I got there I looked at the GPS and it was 1m to cache which is exactly how far away I was, so no need to do the dance.

&lt;h2&gt;Cache Details&lt;/h2&gt;
The cache is a small container hidden at the base of the concrete
pier where the bridge that crossed the Kennebecasis river in Norton
once stood.&lt;br/&gt;
The bridge consisted of two spans and in 1905-1908 period when the
line was renovated they were torn down and two new Howes Truss
Spans were built.&lt;br/&gt;
When the line was closed the bridge was dynamited by the army corps
and as per the locals used for shooting practice.&lt;br/&gt;
The railbed has been overgrown but there is a path that can be used
to reach this spot.&lt;br/&gt;
To get to the this cache, park nearby the railway and walk your way
alongside until you are 80 meters or so from the cache, look
closely and you should be able to spot a path going towards the
cache.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In 1857 the European and North American Railway was opened,
connecting the farming communities of the Kennebecasis River valley
with Saint John and Moncton. Sussex was incorporated in 1895 but
was only officially established as a town on April 30, 1904. The
settlers were for the most part British Loyalists who had fled the
American Revolution in 1776, with many Irish refugees of the potato
famine from the mid-19th century settling in the nearby farming
communities.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In 1885, the Sussex Military Camp was established on the eastern
edge of the town. The facility was closed following the Second
World War and the town purchased the land to expand the municipal
boundaries. Today the agricultural exhibition and some areas remain
as open land on the former site of Camp Sussex.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Sussex underwent several changes in the post-war period. In the
early 1960s, several local roads were upgraded as part of the
Trans-Canada Highway project which saw Route 2 pass immediately
north of the town between Fredericton and Moncton. At the same
time, a series of local roads in the Kennebecasis River valley were
designated as Route 1, running from an interchange with the
Trans-Canada at Sussex, southwest to Saint John.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The creation of Sussex as a highway interchange in this post-war
period led to some transportation planners in New Brunswick calling
for the consolidation or closure of the Fredericton, Saint John,
and Moncton airports to be replaced by a single airport located in
Sussex to serve all three population centres of southern New
Brunswick; this being in the late 1950s/early 1960s before these
facilities underwent considerable expansion.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Potash was subsequently discovered in large quantities in the area
surrounding Sussex, with the deposit being the second largest in
the world after an area in Saskatchewan. Two mines were built near
the town, one at Penobsquis 8 km east, and another at Cassidy Lake
(no longer operational), 10 km southwest. CN Rail built track to
serve both mines, which employed hundreds from the surrounding
area. Since 2003, natural gas has been produced from the McCully
field near Sussex.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The former CN rail station in Sussex now houses the 8th Canadian
Hussars Museum.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Sussex also began to see a growing tourism trade, with many
flocking to see the collection of wood-constructed covered bridges
throughout the central area of Kings County. As the heart of Kings
County with its 16 covered bridges, Sussex is also known as the
Covered Bridge Capital of Atlantic Canada. Eight of these wonderful
wooden structures are within a ten-minute drive of town hall. In
addition, Canada's most continuous agricultural fair draws visitors
each August (marking 113 years in 2008), as well as the
establishment of southern New Brunswick's only alpine ski hill in
the Caledonia Mountains southeast of the town at Poley Mountain.
Twenty-six murals were created during the summers of 2006 and 2007,
establishing its reputation as the Mural Capital of Atlantic
Canada. There is also a very popular international hot air balloon
festival in Sussex held every September, and Canada's largest
outdoor flea market each August.&lt;br/&gt;
The town is home to Sussex Golden Ginger Ale, a popular maritime
beverage. At one point, Sussex claimed to be the birthplace of the
ice cream cone, though the Kings County Record recently proved this
claim to be false. Sussex titles itself as the Dairy Capital of New
Brunswick.&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Location&lt;/h2&gt;
Milepost : 82.80&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Kennebacasis River; 2 span ( 108' each) Kennard Patent Through
Lattice Steel Girder bridge, 1905 - 1962; dynamited 1973.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cache Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

136 with the bridge in the
background.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is a small container and is not winter friendly.&lt;br/&gt;
To get to the cache you can park anywhere near route 121 and follow
the railbed. There is an old garage and driveway but permission was
granted by the owner to access the trail.&lt;br/&gt;
The bridge consisted of two spans and in 1905-1908 period when the
line was renovated they were torn down and two new Howes Truss
Spans were built.&lt;br/&gt;
When the line was closed the bridge was dynamited by the army
corps.&lt;br/&gt;
The blast was so intense that the army was not allowed to dynamite
the middle section by the Norton residents which reported
considerable damage to some nearby houses.&lt;br/&gt;
One of the colonels oversighting the blasting of the bridge brought
a camera to film the explosion and he went to great lengths to
place the camera in the ideal spot but his film turned out black
because he forgot to remove the cap from the lens.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

I challenged Teta to get the new caches on Shepody early morning thinking that he would be too tired or busy at work but he called my bluff and made me get up at 5am for the cache run.
Cache was easy to find.
Had a great time finding the caches and enjoyed going along with Tetagoucher.
Cant comment on the breakfast,I wasnt offered one!  [:(]
Thanks for the FTF and the cache fun.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is a small container and should not be too hard to&lt;br/&gt;
spot...&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To get to the cache you can park anywhere near route 121 and follow
the railbed.&lt;br/&gt;
There is an old garage and driveway but permission was granted by
the owner to access the trail.&lt;br/&gt;
The railbed is still visible although it shows some deterioration.
The locals like to use for a nice stroll, so be careful when
looking for the cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Theres plenty of wild life to be observed in the marsh.

This cache is placed on the Tracy
Lake trail.  The trail head is at Bennett Lake which is
accessible from Route 114. Parking is available nearby.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Tracy lake trail is 7km one way and is of moderate
difficulty. It connects three of FNP’s many lakes one of
which (Tracy Lake) has two back country campsites.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You are looking for a small green cache container containing a park

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bienvenue au Parc National
Fundy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
La cache est située sur le bord
du sentier du lac Tracy. Le sentier débute au lac Bennett,
accessible de la route 114. Des places de stationnement se
trouvent à proximité. Le sentier du lac Tracy mesure
sept kilomètres (aller) et présente un niveau de difficulté
modéré. Il relie trois des nombreux lacs du parc national
Fundy. L’un d’eux, le lac Tracy, possède
deux aires de camping en arrière-pays.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Partez à la recherche d’un petit contenant
vert en plastique Lexan qui renferme un message du personnel du
parc, un journal de bord, un crayon et un poinçon. Téléchargez
votre passeport en cliquant 
ICI. Après avoir une cache, poinçonnez votre passeport. Si
vous découvrez les cinq caches, vous courez la chance de
gagner une géopièce à tirage limité. Seulement 350 géopièces
ont été frappées. Premier arrivé, premier

&lt;p&gt;Les activités de géocachette
sont le résultat d’un partenariat entre l’Atlantic
Canada Geocaching Association, la Guilde de Fundy et le parc
national Fundy. N’oubliez
pas de payer les droits d’entrée du parc. Conformément aux
lignes directrices sur la géocachette de Parcs Canada, les objets

les caches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;




Fundy’s landscape is
rich with freshwater from brooks to rivers and many sizes of lakes
and ponds. For millions of years this water has carved its way to
the sea through the underlying rocks to form the intricate system
of river valleys that is Fundy’s Caledonia Highlands.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Take a moment to imagine that this water was your home, indeed your
world. That the only way you had to travel from one part of this
world to another was through water.. If our only road to the
supermarket was blocked, most North Americans would be in dire
straits even if their house and place of work, for instance, was
still accessible.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Just like us many aquatic species use different parts of their
world for different things and in different seasons. They may find
their food in one area of a stream; lay their eggs in quite another
and even have to spend part of their lives far from home in the
ocean. If a barrier of any kind prevents them moving from one part
of their home to another it could have disastrous consequences for
the long term survival of that species.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Unfortunately what appears at first glance as a&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Fundy and other Atlantic national parks have made significant
investments to lessen these barriers and are working very hard to
continue to improve this situation by assessing all culverts in the
park, and if necessary replacing or repairing them. We are also
working with our neighbors to do the same in nearby areas outside
the park.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The dam you can see at the southern end of Bennett Lake has been a
barrier to the movement of eels and brook trout since the
1800’s.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Soon it will have a fish friendly bypass which will do its
part in getting us closer to the goal of restoring freedom of
movement to all aquatic life within the park and its
watersheds. perfectly connected system of waterways
is far from that to its inhabitants. The area that is now Fundy
National Park has a long pre-park history of logging and
settlement. This has left the area with a legacy of dams and river
crossings which have contributed to the decline and even
extirpation of several of our freshwater aquatic
species.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Le paysage du
parc Fundy est façonné par une multitude de cours d’eau, dont
des ruisseaux, des rivières, ainsi que des lacs et des étangs de
différentes tailles. Pendant des millions d’années,
l’eau s’est frayée un chemin jusqu’à la mer dans
la couche rocheuse pour former le réseau complexe de vallées
fluviales que sont les collines calédoniennes de Fundy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Prenez quelques instants pour
imaginer que ces cours d’eau représentent votre habitat, ou
plutôt votre univers, et que la nage est le seul moyen dont vous
disposez pour vous déplacer d’une partie à l’autre du
monde. Si la seule route menant au supermarché était bloquée, la
plupart des Nord-Américains seraient dans une situation
désastreuse, même si leur domicile et leur lieu de travail, par
exemple, étaient accessibles.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Comme nous, un grand nombre d’espèces aquatiques utilisent
les parties de leur monde à différentes fins et à différents
moments de l’année. Elles se nourrissent dans une section
d’un ruisseau, pondent leurs œufs dans une autre
section et doivent même passer une partie de leur existence loin de
leur habitat, dans l’océan. Si un obstacle quelconque les
empêche de se déplacer d’une partie à une autre de leur
habitat, les conséquences seront désastreuses pour leur survie à
long terme.  &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Au premier coup d’œil, on dirait un réseau de voies
navigables parfaitement reliées. Malheureusement, ce n’est
pas le cas pour ses habitants. Avant qu’il abrite le parc
national Fundy, ce territoire était peuplé et servait à
l’exploitation forestière depuis longtemps. Par conséquent,
la région a hérité de barrages et de ponts qui contribuent au
déclin et, même, à l’éradication de plusieurs de nos espèces
d’eau douce, à l’instar de certains ponceaux plus
récents.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Le parc national Fundy et d’autres parcs nationaux de la
région de l’Atlantique procèdent à des investissements
majeurs pour atténuer ces obstacles et travaillent très dur pour
continuer à améliorer la situation en évaluant et, au besoin, en
remplaçant ou en réparant tous leurs ponceaux. En outre, nous nous
joignons à nos voisins pour réaliser cette même entreprise dans les
alentours du parc.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
De la berge, vous verrez un barrage qui entrave les déplacements
des anguilles et des ombles de fontaine depuis les
années 1800. Bientôt, il y aura une dérivation sans danger
pour les poissons qui contribuera à l’atteinte d’un
objectif précis : redonner la liberté de mouvement à toutes
les formes de vie aquatique du parc et de ses bassins
versants.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

The cache is a micro. Please leave it as found to ensure maximum
stealth&lt;br/&gt;
To get to the cache you can park anywhere near route 121 and follow
the railbed.&lt;br/&gt;
There is an old garage and driveway but permission was granted by
the owner to access the trail.&lt;br/&gt;
The railbed is still visible although it shows some
deterioration.&lt;br/&gt;
The locals like to use for a nice stroll, so be careful when
looking for the cache.&lt;br/&gt;
Theres plenty of wild life to be observed in the marsh.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

I challenged Teta to get the new caches on Shepody early morning thinking that he would be too tired or busy at work but he called my bluff and made me get up at 5am for the cache run.
Cache was easy to find and yes there is a barbecue here... huh?
Had a great time finding the caches and enjoyed going along with Tetagoucher.

The cache is a small black container and should not be too hard to
find.&lt;br/&gt;
To get to this cache just follow the underground cable posts from
route 124.&lt;br/&gt;
Wear appropriate gear as the area might be wet.&lt;br/&gt;
At the cache location you will be standing on the railbed.
Unfortunately it has been overgrown and barely noticeable.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cache Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is a small black container.&lt;br/&gt;
There are several ways to get to this cache, but the recommended
way is to start with the Norton#5 cache first and walk on the
railbed.&lt;br/&gt;
There is a short bushwhack but it will open to a very nice
trail.&lt;br/&gt;
When the line was dismantled in 1959 the railbed was left to be
transformed into a trail, but it was eventually left abandoned.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
 For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cache Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is a small black container.&lt;br/&gt;
It is located at the end of the trail, from here the railbed has
been lost forever has it has been plowed and is now private
property.&lt;br/&gt;
There are several ways to get to this cache, but the recommended
way is to start with the Norton#5 cache first and walk on the
railbed.&lt;br/&gt;
There is a short bushwhack but it will open to a very nice
trail.&lt;br/&gt;
When the line was dismantled in 1959 the railbed was left to be
transformed into a trail, but it was eventually left abandoned.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
 For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Location&lt;/h2&gt;
Milepost : 89.10&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Almshouse Brook single span 25 foot girder bridge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cache Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is a small black container.&lt;br/&gt;
It is located near the bridge that surprisingly still exists
today.&lt;br/&gt;
The locals call it the 'Black' bridge. The kids back in the day
used to swim in the brook and would jump from it.&lt;br/&gt;
There are two ways to reach this cache. The railbed is now private
property and is very close to the owner house. He kindly gave
permission to walk the railbed to the bridge, but &lt;b&gt;**please
before doing so ask for permission to cross his yard
first**&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The hard way and thats the reason this cache is rated with a
terrain difficulty of 4 is to walk alongside the brook to reach the
railbed behind the property. Start at the waypoint and make your
way to the railbed. I have placed orange trail tape to show which I
think is the easiest way to get to it.&lt;br/&gt;
Wear appropriate gear as it is might be wet in some areas.&lt;br/&gt;
The bushwhack is approx 180meters long and it can be rough in
places.&lt;br/&gt;
Once on the railbed its a nice walk to the bridge. Theres some
fallen trees in the way&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;*** Do not walk on the bridge, IT IS NOT SAFE! ***&lt;/b&gt;

It sure does look like a good woodpecker tree, and there seems to be all sorts of woodpeckers around here. 
Tetagoucher spotted it first. Definitely a great hide, hope it will last for awhile.

terrain difficulty of 4 is to walk alongside the brook to reach the
railbed behind the property. Start at the waypoint and make your
way to the railbed. I have placed orange trail tape to show which I
think is the easiest way to get to it.&lt;br/&gt;
Wear appropriate gear as it is might be wet in some areas.&lt;br/&gt;
The bushwhack is approx 180meters long and it can be rough in
places.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;History&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
 For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

The cache is a small black container.&lt;br/&gt;
The railbed is very overgrown but still visible and it is clearly
evident the path that Molly took.&lt;br/&gt;
It also shows that the dirt road above would not exist when the
line was in operation. This whole area more than likely looked alot
differently back then. The passengers on the train likely had a
really nice view of the falls just down the brook which is worth a
visit.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The remains in considerable good
shape despite the years.&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is a regular black container.&lt;br/&gt;
From here the railbed would cross Otis Drive and go straight to
cross HWY 124 to the right side of Belleisle RD going towards
Case.&lt;br/&gt;
Theres still some interesting remains of the bridge crossing this
little brook. After 50 years one side is almost intact and you can
appreciate what it looked like back then.&lt;br/&gt;

There was a truck parked right about the cache cords. We thought it was a cacher but it turned out not to be.
So we continued caching down the road and came back.
The cords were a bit off so we started sweeping the area, Tetagoucher started on one side of the road and I started on the other.
Looked around and couldnt find. At some point I couldnt see where Tetagoucher was either but I got a glimpse of the cache on his side of the road so I quickly signed it and put it back in place plainly visible and called him. Told him that we should look again around and that she should start on his side of the road and I would do the other side. He looked at the cache area and I thought he saw it but no he missed it and went look elsewhere. I could not believe that he missed it. He didnt fall for my gag and figured out that I had already found it... darn it was still a good laugh thou.
Great fun today with Tetagoucher looking for Ajlong caches.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cache Details&lt;/h2&gt;
The cache is a micro container and is winter friendly.&lt;br/&gt;
It should be an easy find, the line was very close to the road, but
its overgrown.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

Loons have been making their home at
     picturesque Wolfe Lake on  the headwaters of the East
     Branch and Point Wolfe River for many years.  The first
     recorded loon at Wolfe Lake was in 1965.  Typically,
     loons prefer lakes bigger, however they will nest on smaller
     ones, like this, especially if there is a good spot to nest-
     like the grassy islands.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The presence of nesting loons on a lake is an indication that the
lake is in good health- or it has ecological integrity.  Loons
diet consists largely of fish.  Fish bioaccumulate  heavy
metals and pesticides that can unfortunately be found in
water.  Loons can die from the effects of toxic materials that
can be found in fish.  If the loons are healthy and
successfully nesting, hatching and raising their young, we can
assume the lake is in a good ecological state.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Loons,  like many other species, require a large undisturbed
space.  Human disturbances like acid rain caused by pollution,
shoreline development and human use of lakes  are stressors
for loons.  For example, nests are typically on small islands
in lakes very close to shore.  This gives their eggs a better
chance to be protected from nest predators which would be more
abundant on the land -like racoons and snakes. Any sudden rise in
the level of the water could be tragic for loons nest sites and
eggs.  Boat wake on lakes can swamp and destroy nests- and may
even cause loons to abandon their nest sites.  &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Fishing has also been an obstacle between humans and loons. 
Lead sinkers can end up in the food chain and cause loons to suffer
with  lead poising.  Abandoned and unattended nylon
fishing line and hooks can cause injury or death  to loons-
catching on the beak and tongue. This happened in Fundy (August
1995) and prevented the individual from feeding herself and her two
young.  Thanks to the cooperative efforts of CWS and Park
Staff the bird was captured and the fishing line removed.  If
this can happen in a protected area- imagine the stressors a bird
faces in unprotected lakes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Initiatives are in place in Fundy National
     Park to protect the Loons.  Wolfe lake is closed to
     fishing and boating to avoid nesting disturbances.  The
     dam at the far end of Wolfe Lake will be maintained to ensure
     the adequate water levels.  Wherever fishing is to
     continue in Fundy non-toxic sinkers must be substituted for
     the lethal lead type.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Depuis des années, les plongeons
huards viennent nicher sur le magnifique lac Wolfe, dans les eaux
d’amont de la rivière Point Wolfe et de sa branche est. Le premier
individu y a été recensé en 1965. En général, le plongeon préfère
les grands lacs, mais il élit aussi résidence sur de petits bassins
d’eau comme celui-ci, surtout s’il y trouve un lieu de nidification
propice, comme des îlots d’herbe.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 La présence des plongeons indique que le lac
     est en bonne santé – qu’il a conservé son intégrité
     écologique. Le poisson est la principale source de nourriture
     du plongeon huard. Les métaux lourds et les pesticides
     présents dans l’eau de certains lacs se bioaccumulent dans le
     poisson et peuvent avoir un effet mortel sur les plongeons
     huards. Si les plongeons sont en bonne santé et qu’ils
     réussissent à nicher et à élever leur progéniture, on peut
     présumer que le lac est en bon état sur le plan
     écologique.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Comme bien d’autres espèces, le plongeon huard a besoin de grandes
étendues de nature vierge. Les perturbations d’origine humaine,
telles que les pluies acides causées par la pollution,
l’aménagement des côtes et l’activité humaine sur les lacs, sont
des agresseurs qui menacent l’espèce. Par exemple, les plongeons
huards font généralement leur nid sur de petits îlots tout près de
la rive. Les œufs ont ainsi de meilleures chances d’être protégés
contre les prédateurs, tels que les ratons laveurs et les serpents,
qui sont plus abondants sur la terre ferme. Toute élévation
soudaine du niveau d’eau pourrait avoir des conséquences tragiques
pour les nids et les œufs. Les vagues créées par les bateaux
peuvent inonder et détruire les nids – et ainsi amener les
plongeons huards à abandonner leur lieu de
nidification. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
La pêche représente un autre agresseur. Les plombs peuvent aboutir
dans la chaîne alimentaire et empoisonner les plongeons huards. Les
lignes de pêche en nylon et les hameçons abandonnés ou laissés sans
surveillance peuvent les blesser ou les tuer lorsqu’ils se fixent à
leur bec ou à leur langue. Cette situation s’est déjà produite dans
le parc national Fundy (en août 1995). L’oiseau n’arrivait plus à
se nourrir et à donner la becquée à ses deux oisillons. Grâce aux
efforts concertés du SCF et du personnel du parc, il a été capturé,
et la ligne de pêche a été enlevée. Si un tel incident peut se
produire dans une aire protégée, imaginez les agresseurs auxquels
les oiseaux doivent faire face sur les lacs non protégés.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Diverses initiatives sont en place dans le
     parc national Fundy afin de protéger les plongeons huards.
     Parcs Canada interdit la pêche et la navigation de plaisance
     sur le lac Wolfe pour éviter de perturber les oiseaux
     nicheurs. De plus, il entend conserver le barrage aménagé à
     l’autre extrémité du lac, de manière à assurer des niveaux
     d’eau suffisants aux plongeons huards. Là où la pêche est
     autorisée dans le parc, les plombs aux effets mortels doivent
     être remplacés par des lests sans danger.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cache Details&lt;/h2&gt;
The cache is a small container and is not
winter friendly.&lt;br/&gt;
To get to the cache you can park anywhere on Belleisle Rd and
follow your GPS to the cache. It is a short hike in an open field
and light bushwhack to the railbed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cache Details&lt;/h2&gt;
The cache is a small container and is
winter friendly.&lt;br/&gt;
To get to the cache you can park anywhere on Belleisle Rd and
follow your GPS to the cache. It is a short and light bushwhack to
the railbed.&lt;br/&gt;
In here you can find good sections of visible railbed.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

The cache is a small container and is Winter friendly.&lt;br/&gt;
To get to the cache you can park at the parking spot and have a
nice short hike on the railbed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you drive from Norton you will notice on the left side of the
Belleisle Rd the railbed.&lt;br/&gt;
Unfortunately its now private property and I have not been able to
get permission from the owner.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;*PLEASE DO NOT USE IT, ITS PRIVATE PROPERTY!*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
To get to the cache you can park at the parking waypoint.&lt;br/&gt;
Plenty of room to park your vehicle and its a short hike to the
railbed.&lt;br/&gt;

We had friends down from Ontario with a couple of kids and we had a great time looking for the cord’s for this cache.
It was a nice overcast day to do it.
I think you should check your checksum again, I think they should both be 30.

The cache is a small 35mm container located on the old railbed of
the Norton-Chipman Railway now used as an atv trail near
Belleisle.&lt;br/&gt;
You will be able to find some remnants of the track along the trail
like wood ties and spikes on the ground.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cache Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Belleisle Creek
Bridge.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The cache is not at the posted coordinates, but you need to
visit them to find the correct coordinates.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is a small black container located on the old railbed of
the Norton-Chipman Railway now used as an atv trail near Belleisle
Creek.&lt;br/&gt;
It is winter friendly.&lt;br/&gt;
Located in the nw side of the bridge there are still some traces of
the bridge. Its in very precarious condition so please very
careful.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;** DO NOT GO DOWN THE GULLEY, IT CAN BE DANGEROUS. **&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
To find the cache go to the
posted coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;
You will find a guardrail fence to protect distracted atv'rs going
down the gully.&lt;br/&gt;
Look at the guardrail and count
the number of guardrails that the fence is made of.&lt;br/&gt;
Also take note of the number of
spikes on the left and right side of the fence holding the
guardrails.&lt;br/&gt;
Looking behind the fence you will see the remnants of the bridge.
Count the number of visible bolts
with rings on the wood structure that are facing the fence.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To find the cache just &lt;br/&gt;
- ADD  to the posted
NORTH coordinates the result of : (# guardrails * # spikes on the right side of the fence) - #
SPIKES on the left side of the fence.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
- ADD to the posted
WEST coordinates the result of :
(# bolts with rings * # spikes on the left side of the fence) + (#
guardrails * # bolts with rings) - (#spikes on the left side of the
fence / (#bolts with rings - # guardrails))&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Checksum N:22 W:34&lt;br/&gt;
Good luck.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;History&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

Other places provide quite a challenge  and some sections are completely inaccessible which is unfortunate because it could be an excellent walking/hiking trail.  A lot of work went into doing these caches and it makes for a great experience following the trail.  TFTC </groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cache Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is a small black container located on the old railbed of
the Norton-Chipman Railway now used as an atv trail near Belleisle
Creek.&lt;br/&gt;
It is in a great shape and at the time of the cache placement very
busy as well.&lt;br/&gt;
You will also be able to find some remnants of the track along the
trail like wood ties and spikes on the ground.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

 In May 1885 the New Brunswick militia assembled in Camp Sussex to prepare for service in the North West Rebellion. There is a series of colour post cards on display in the Tea House Museum on Maple Street showing Sussex Camp cira 1910. It was a large tented camp. During World War One, the First Training Battalion of the New Brunswick Regiment was established in Camp Sussex. In 1918 it was called the 1st Depot Battalion and was under command of Lieutenant Colonel James McAvity.

 The Tea House Museum at a composite photograph of this unit. It was still largely a tented camp. When the mobilization of the 3rd Division was approved during World War Two, it was decided to concentrate it in the Maritimes under command of New Brunswicker Major-General E.W. Sansom.
 One of the areas selected was the existing camp at Sussex. The camp was enlarged to handle a brigade group and the units began to arrive in the autumn of 1940 to undergo training prior to embarkation. When the 3rd Division left for overseas, it was replaced by units from the 4th Division. 

When it went overseas, it was replaced by the 17th Infantry Brigade of the 7th Division, the general reserve for Atlantic Command. In April 1943 this brigade consisted of the Victoria Rifles of Canada, The Dufferin &amp; Haldimand Rifles of Canada and the Les Voltigeurs de Quebec. In early 1944 A-34 Special Officer's Training Center was established for one year in Camp Sussex to train officers for the CANLOAN programme. Photographs in the Tea House Museum shows the camp was a typical World War Two camp consisting of wooden &quot;H&quot; huts.

The training camp was closed and the land purchased by the Town of Sussex. Leonard Drive runs through the old camp site, but there are few landmarks left. The NB Agricultural Museum is located on the site of a tank hanger and two large pine tree behind the community centre mark the location of the officers' mess.
 A modern armoury is named in memory of Brigadier Milton Gregg VC and is home to &quot;B&quot; Squadron of the 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's). 

There is a Sherman Tank named &quot;Balaclava&quot; on display outside the armoury. Although the old rifle range located on Fowler Ave is no longer used as a firing range, it is still Department of National Defence property. </groundspeak:long_description>

I know the chap that drove this tank into this final resting place
You know I don’t like these types of caches, I guess that is why you picked this place.  At least it wasn’t a nano.
Thanks for that.

The cache is a small black container is winter friendly&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To get access to the cache take the road at the waypoint and turn
left at the big building and after a very short ride you will find
the railbed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;*THIS IS THE BEST APPROACH, USE IT**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The railbed has been used as an atv travel and it should be a short
hike to the cache&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is located on a culvert that has caved in.

&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

There was a long trestle approx 100meters long.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
On August 10th, 1900, the engine went through the railway bridge
near where Sargeson Siding stood. The engineer was killed and the
fireman was very badly hurt. The Sargeson Siding was taken away in
1923.&lt;br/&gt;

This cache is located in a very good section of the line. From here
it will follow alongside Joliffs Brook towards Salmon Creek.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You can park at the reference waypoints depending how much of the
line you decide to hike.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This is a snowmobile trailer and is clearly indicated by the
signs and the owner does not want atv's on this section!&lt;/b&gt;

Thank you.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is a small camo container is winter friendly&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is located in a very good section of the line. From here
it will follow alongside Joliffs Brook towards Salmon Creek.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You can park at the reference waypoints depending how much of the
line you decide to hike.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This is a snowmobile trailer and is clearly indicated by the
signs and the owner does not want atv's on this section!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cache Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Whats left of the
platform.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is a small cammo container is winter friendly&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Theres very little left of the station besides the platform. The
station itself was a very small structure.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You can park at the reference waypoints depending how much of the
line you decide to hike.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This is a snowmobile trailer and is clearly indicated by the
signs and the owner does not want atv's on this section!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;++Post pictures to help preserve the memory of the line++&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

Found it easily and took a few moments to explore the beaver pond. Water levels were down quite a bit since the first log and we could see where we would have had to go if we had stayed the course from the other side.

The cache is a small cammo container and is winter friendly.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

This section of the line goes towards Salmon Creek and it should
provide with a very nice hike.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Story Teller Series&lt;/h1&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 100 caches that have been placed out in
rural New Brunswick near Salisbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally intended for highway 126 between Moncton and
Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is a small cammo container and is winter friendly.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This section of the line goes alongside Salmon Creek and it should
provide with a very nice hike.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
7200 gal. water tank active from
about 1910 to March 1962&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is a small cammo container and is winter friendly.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This section of the line goes alongside Salmon Creek and it should
provide with a very nice hike.&lt;br/&gt;
The water tower is long gone and nothing remains of it.&lt;br/&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
For years the residents of Grand Lake,
Chipman, Cumberland Bay and other surrounding areas had hoped that
the Intercolonial Railway would be built along the proposed
&quot;Central Line&quot;. It would have cut diagonally across the middle of
the Province and thus provide them with direct access to markets in
Central Canada. However, the Intercolonial Railway was instead
built along the &quot;Robinson Route&quot; in 1872 and it would not be until
1912 that the National Transcontinental Railway line, built along
the &quot;Central Line&quot;, would be officially opened. So in 1873 a group
of local investors incorporated the Central Railway Company to
build a line from Fredericton to connect with the Intercolonial
Railway line somewhere between Sussex and Moncton. A final decision
on the route that the line would take was not made until 1886. The
final route which passed by the head of Grand Lake also went
through the coal rich areas around Minto and Chipman before heading
south towards Norton. That same year work began on the 80 mile long
track and in 1888 the line from Norton, on the Intercolonial line,
to Chipman was completed and opened for business. The section of
track from Gibson near Fredericton, the terminus of the New
Brunswick Railway line, to Chipman was not completed until 1913.
This section of track was built by a separate company the New
Brunswick Coal and Railway Company, which later became the
Fredericton and Grand Lake Coal and Railway Company. In 1913
Canadian Pacific took control of the line by taking out long-term
leases on the line. One interesting note is that due to the fact
that the bridges on the line could not accommodate the heavier
diesel engines, Canadian Pacific had to run steam engines on the
line into the 1960's. Abandonment of the line began in 1961 when
the section from Norton to Pennlyn was abandoned and by the 1990's
the entire line had been abandoned.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Story Teller Series&lt;/h1&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 100 caches that have been placed out in
rural New Brunswick near Salisbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally intended for highway 126 between Moncton and
Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Lots of driving, lots of rushing into the woods and lots of containers to sign.
Mix that with rain and sun at the same time and we had a blast all day.

While driving down the access road to get to this cache, it gives the impression you're headed down the highway backwards, its quite a neat sensation!

Not so Standard&quot; Micro/Pen combo.

&lt;h1&gt;The Story Teller Series&lt;/h1&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 100 caches that have been placed out in
rural New Brunswick near Salisbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally intended for highway 126 between Moncton and
Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

While on patrol, my team and I picked up some strange background
noise over our comm frequencies. It looked like there was a code,
or some sort of data somebody was trying to push to us. I'm no
expert, but it almost sounded like computer code to me.

My team needed to bypass some security systems to gain full
access to the data, but after one of our cryptanalysts decrypted a
data burst, we were able to make our way to the stash.

Data Burst:

X.X.X.............................................................X.X.X......X\\X.XXXX...XXXX.X///....XXXX....XXXX.X//X.X\\\........X.X.X......X../.X......X....X.......X../....X..X.X..\.X...........X.X.X......XXXX.XXXX...XXXX.X///....XXXX....X\\X.XXXX.X\\\........X.X.X......\..X....X......X.\../..../..X.XX./..X./..X.X..\........X.X.X......\\\X.XXXX...XXXX.X///....XXXX.XX.///X.///X.X\\\........X.X.X.............................................................</groundspeak:long_description>

Ajlong tried to get it yesterday but said that there was too much snow on the ground and snowshoes were needed and that was the perfect excuse to take the snowshoes out. It was a short hike from the road and the day was beautiful. I should do this more often.
The cache is not winter friendly.
Very well thought puzzle. Thanks for the challenge.

Towers are everywhere. This one called out to us asking for a cache. So the three of us found the perfect place to hide it. High enough up so it should be above the new average snow line for New Brunswick yet low enough that you can reach it. There is room for Small traders to be left here as well.

&lt;h1&gt;The Story Teller Series&lt;/h1&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 100 caches that have been placed out in
rural New Brunswick near Salisbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally intended for highway 126 between Moncton and
Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

While in the area me and Ajlong decided to get the three remaining caches to complete the excellent Zor Story teller series now that the cords have been corrected.
Easy find in the dark.

&lt;h1&gt;The Story Teller Series&lt;/h1&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 100 caches that have been placed out in
rural New Brunswick near Salisbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally intended for highway 126 between Moncton and
Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Lots of driving, lots of rushing into the woods and lots of containers to sign.
Mix that with rain and sun at the same time and we had a blast all day.

&lt;h1&gt;The Story Teller Series&lt;/h1&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 100 caches that have been placed out in
rural New Brunswick near Salisbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally intended for highway 126 between Moncton and
Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;The Story Teller Series&lt;/h1&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 100 caches that have been placed out in
rural New Brunswick near Salisbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally intended for highway 126 between Moncton and
Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Out with Ajlong completing the series and looking for the codes for the puzzle caches.
Lots of driving, lots of rushing into the woods and lots of containers to sign.
Mix that with rain and sun at the same time and we had a blast all day.

Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;The Story Teller Series&lt;/h1&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 100 caches that have been placed out in
rural New Brunswick near Salisbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally intended for highway 126 between Moncton and
Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Lots of driving, lots of rushing into the woods and lots of containers to sign.
Mix that with rain and sun at the same time and we had a blast all day.

&lt;h1&gt;The Story Teller Series&lt;/h1&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 100 caches that have been placed out in
rural New Brunswick near Salisbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally intended for highway 126 between Moncton and
Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This cache is dedicated to my wife's cousin/relative Jimmy
Roberts who through what can only be described as a miracle,
survived a recent heart transplant, after ending up in the hospital
with major heart failure, all at the age of 29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jimmy is alive and well and on his way to recovery, so while we
were here at the legion helping raise money for his family, I
placed a cache very near to honour the miracle of life that was
given back to this young man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're looking for a small camo'd lock-n-lock container with
logbook, pencil, and several body parts (don't worry, they're
rubber).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please rehide in the same place and take a moment to honour
those listed on the plaque nearby. Happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Wilson's Point and Beaubears Island have played huge roles in the development of Miramichi through the ages. From the First Nations people over 3,000 years ago, to the Acadian and Scottish settlers, and a shipbuilding legacy of generations, the stories to be told about this area are endless.

Some of the prominent figures to grace this area with their business and development skills include: William Davidson, Joseph Russell, J. Leonard O'Brien, Richard Denys and countless others.

During your hunt, you will be walking along a trail that surrounds an old Scottish grave yard, where many great pioneers of this region are interred.

Cache is a small camo’d Lock N Lock. Original contents are: logbook, pencil, pencil sharpener, and ‘muggle card’ (please leave these items in the cache). Original tradable items include: wooden toy block, green die, orange toy frog, “Old Maid” card game, and Joseph Russell Travel Bug.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the third of an 11-cache series, focusing on nature in Miramichi. Other caches will be launched throughout summer 2011. We hope you enjoy this series and that you'll learn about our natural history as well. We'll also be dropping off another series of TB's in these caches at a later date.

Here is some information about the site chosen for this cache:

Parking is available at the Vye's Beach lookout area, then the cache is a short walk along the side of the highway and a few meters into the wooded cliff area. Great views! Lots of muggles drive by but seldom stop.

For decades, Vye’s Beach had been a popular place to swim, sun, and soak up the outstanding views of the Miramichi River. Only a short distance from town, families once flocked to cottages along the shore and laid their towels on the beach below.

Today, the sounds of these summer days have subsided and Vye’s Beach has become a simple, but attractive lookout area. The lookout was implemented as part of development work, in addition to significant erosion protection along part of the site (erosion had become a serious threat to the King George Highway). Unfortunately this remediation work covered much of the visible beach area, making “Vye’s Beach” a strong misnomer.

Cache is a small camo’d Lock N Lock. Original contents are: logbook and pencil. Original tradable items include: eraser, magnetic letter “G”, game piece, plastic ball.</groundspeak:long_description>

Not many muggles stop here (at least during the times that I’ve been there), but many do drive by, so be stealthy as always. This is a fairly small area, so finding the cache shouldn’t be too difficult.

As the western-most site within the Miramichi Landings system along the north side of the Miramichi River, Vye’s Beach acts an entry point for visitors traveling from western New Brunswick.

Vye's Beach is important to the community due to its former use as a recreation site in the mid-1900's; however, with recent stabilization works, this use has all but disappeared. Vye's Beach now offers a lookout platform with views of Beaubears Island, Strawberry Marsh, and Nelson, Miramichi and interpretive panels describing its history.

Vye's Beach was named after Charles Vye, a famed shipbuilder who settled in Miramichi around 1797.

Cache is a small camo’d Lock N Lock. Original contents are: logbook, pencil, pencil sharpener, and ‘muggle card’ (please leave these items in the cache). Original tradable items include: wooden toy block, white die, yellow toy car, thimble, and Charles Vye Travel Bug.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache is located in Strawberry Marsh, just off the walking trail. Cache is about halfway through the marsh, so regardless of which side you park on, the hike will be about the same distance, around 1km. There may be the occasional muggle walking on the trail, but the marsh is relatively flat, so you can probably see them coming.

Strawberry Marsh is a resilient natural space that has undergone incredible transformations. Once a shipyard, racetrack, and even a garbage dump, the marsh has withstood years of heavy use. Today, the park’s healthy marsh ecosystem thrives through community efforts, and is a popular place for both residents and anglers alike.

In 1785, a surveyor by the name of Daniel Micheau was sent to Miramichi to establish lot boundaries along both banks of the Miramichi River. One of these lots was that of Strawberry Marsh.

Although archeological evidence shows that the Mi'kmaq First Nations people were the first inhabitants of the area, Daniel Micheau was one of the first people to have formally recognized Strawberry Marsh as the property it is today.

Cache is a small camo’d Lock N Lock. Original contents are: logbook, pencil, pencil sharpener, and ‘muggle card’ (please leave these items in the cache). Original tradable items include: wooden toy block, white die, red toy car, green coil key chain, Landsharkz lapel pin, and Daniel Micheau Travel Bug.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the fourth of an 11-cache series, focusing on nature in Miramichi. Other caches will be launched throughout summer 2011. We hope you enjoy this series and that you'll learn about our natural history as well. We'll also be dropping off another series of TB's in these caches at a later date.

Here is some information about the site chosen for this cache:

Cache is located about 30 meters off the main trail in the marshy woods. Rubber boots are suggested as the ground is often soggy. Cache has some natural camo, so please try to replace as found.

Deep in the 100 Aker Marsh, you’ll find a unique and accessible wetlands environment that can be enjoyed by visitors and residents alike. Located adjacent to the Miramichi Bridge, Strawberry Marsh comprises roughly 100 acres of reclaimed land near the heart of downtown Newcastle. The site features a large wetland environment protected by Ducks Unlimited and by the City of Miramichi.

The marsh is also home to a water treatment system created from more than 100,000 tonnes of garbage. Guided by the principles of geo-science, trash from an abandoned dump was converted into fill that was molded into an award winning earthen structure – the first of its kind – used for the treatment of the city’s waste-water. While the treatment facility may seem contradictory to the nearby wetlands, it does support the overall renewal and environmental reclamation activities that take place on the site as well as within the City of Miramichi at large.

Cache is a small camo’d Lock N Lock. Original contents are: logbook and pencil. Original tradable items include: eraser, magnetic letter “A”, game piece, plastic ball, NB trails council lapel pin.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache is located at Ritchie Wharf. Terrain shouldn’t be a problem. Use extreme stealth when avoiding muggles in this area. Summer may not be the best time to hunt for this cache due to the popularity of this park, but it would make for an interesting challenge.

Ritchie Wharf is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Miramichi. Many small shops and buildings are located on this property, but one house in particular offers a glance into our history - the Murray House.

After the Great Miramichi Fire of 1825, the Former Town of Newcastle was in a state of disrepair and called upon the talents of Scottish master builder, William Murray. Murray built numerous houses and churches in the Newcastle area, including his own home, now known as the Murray House.

The Murray House was relocated to Ritchie Wharf in an attempt to pay tribute to the late William Murray. Although the house is currently closed to the public, renovations and structural repair are scheduled to revitalize this property.

Cache is a small camo’d Lock N Lock. Original contents are: logbook, pencil, pencil sharpener, and ‘muggle card’ (please leave these items in the cache). Original tradable items include: wooden toy block, red die, silver toy car, “Donkey” card game, and William Murray Travel Bug.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache is located just off the tree-lined trail at Canadian Point.

Canadian Point holds an important, and often unrecognized, place in the history of Miramichi. During the years of the deportation of the Acadians in the mid-18th century, Canadian Point played a vital role in the survival of the Acadian families.

Across the river at Kethro Lookout, the French operated a military battery, with views down to the mouth of the Miramichi River. This battery was used to warn the settlers - who were in reality, refugees - if the British were on their way. Signals would be sent from Kethro Lookout to runners stationed at Canadian Point, who would then make the trek to the encampments at Beaubears Island and Wilson's Point to warn of a pending assault.

Cache is a small camo’d Lock N Lock. Original contents are: logbook, pencil, pencil sharpener, and ‘muggle card’ (please leave these items in the cache). Original tradable items include: wooden toy block, green die, brown/green toy frog, thimble, and Acadian Travel Bug.

New contents include: new logbook and pencil and a few items for trade. </groundspeak:long_description>

There are not many muggles in this area, but use caution just in case. There is no need to go beyond the “No Trespassing” sign, although many people hike the trails deeper in the woods. Cache is located on public property.

Tucked away on the southern side of the Miramichi River, just west of the Former Town of Chatham on the inland side of Water Street, Morrison Cove is one of Miramichi Landings’ largest sites and perhaps its greatest hidden gem.

Know to many locals as &quot;Big Dam&quot;, a name referring to a large dam hidden deep in the woods near the old Chatham reservoir, Morrison Cove is a popular hiking spot with trails winding their way through the woods and around the reservoir.

Henry Cunard, brother of the infamous Joseph Cunard, operated a mill and small general store at this location at one time. In more recent years, the entrance to Morrison Cove has been used as a fire training facility, a facility that will be relocated in the coming years.

You’ll find some steep stairs that will lead to an overgrown lookout; this is where you should begin your search. Please replace cache exactly how/where it was hidden.

Miramichi has more than its fair share of haunting folklore, and none may be more famous than the story of the Headless Nun.

As the story goes, Sister Marie Inconnu, a French missionary, was charged with the task of protecting a very valuable treasure. This treasure, sought after by many, would inevitably lead to her untimely demise.

One night, two men, mad with leprosy, attacked Sister Marie Inconnu, decapitating her and stealing her treasure. It is unknown if the two men escaped; however, the head of Sister Marie Inconnu has never been found.

It is said that anyone who enters French Fort Cove in search of her treasure, will be forever haunted by the Headless Nun.

We decided to let the Headless Nun guard our own little treasure, so muggles beware: should you tamper with this cache, she will find you...

We hope you enjoy this series and that you'll learn about our natural history as well. We'll also be dropping off another series of TB's in these caches at a later date.

Here is some information about the site chosen for this cache:

Moving forward with this series we really wanted to make our caches a little more challenging than &quot;a nice easy find&quot;. Please hunt for this cache at your own risk. Although no special gear is needed to find this cache, the cliff is quite steep and can be slippery after the rain.

In the late 1800s, sandstone was a valuable commodity and was used in the construction of many of our country’s first major buildings. So when Charles E. Fish opened his sandstone quarry at French Fort Cove in 1884, work came rolling in. This natural rock was used in several buildings in Miramichi including Harkins Elementary School and St. Patrick’s Church, and was also used in the construction of the Langevin Block of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa which today houses the office of the Prime Minister.

Although the quarry was abandoned in 1905, you can still find many remnants of quarrying on the eastern hillside of Fish Quarry Trail at French Fort Cove. Our natural history is preserved in the dense forest of French Fort Cove and the once bustling sandstone quarry.

As one way to help preserve our natural history in the dense forest of French Fort Cove and its once bustling sandstone quarry, please be sure to Cache In and Trash Out whenever possible.

Cache is a small camo’d Lock N Lock. Original contents are: logbook and pencil. Original tradable items include: clip, smiley stickers, star stickers, NB/Acadian sticker, guitar pick, &quot;U&quot; magnet, and a toy frog.

Depending on snowfall amounts, cache may not be winter friendly, but perhaps that would make for a slightly more difficult hunt.

This cache is in honour of the founder of the Town of Chatham, Francis Peabody. In 1800, Peabody, a businessman from Massachusetts, landed at what is now known as Waterford Green and quickly began influencing the development of the town.

Waterford Green is now used as a public gathering space, playing host to numerous festivals and events year round. Recent renovations to the park have included the installation of a large stage, landscaping, a playground area, interpretive signage, and a bronze statue of Francis Peabody - a favourite photo op for residents and tourists alike.

Due to cache placement guidelines, this cache isn't officially at Waterford green, but resides in a small green space a short distance away.

Cache is a small camo’d Lock N Lock. Original contents are: logbook, pencil, pencil sharpener, and ‘muggle card’ (please leave these items in the cache). Original tradable items include: wooden toy block, red die, brown toy frog, yellow coil key chain, and Francis Peabody Travel Bug.

Elm Park is a popular public park located a short distance away from Historic Water Street and includes a large community war memorial with a number of monuments and decommissioned artillery weapons.

Joseph Cunard was a local businessman who helped develop the Historic Water Street Business District and for a number of years was held in the highest regard within the community.

Money problems took their toll on Cunard and his businesses, resulting in bankruptcy and the loss of many jobs. It is said that Joseph Cunard was run out of the community and he fled to Liverpool, UK. Cunard was a hero to some and a villain to many, but he remains one of the most famous characters in Miramichi history.

Cache is a small camo’d Lock N Lock. Original contents are: logbook, pencil, pencil sharpener, and ‘muggle card’ (please leave these items in the cache). Original tradable items include: wooden toy block, red die, black toy frog, thimble, Landsharkz lapel pin, and Joseph Cunard Travel Bug.

The Looshtauk was one of several ships quarantined on Middle Island in Miramichi, New Brunswick in the mid-1800s. As Irish immigrants fled their homeland during the Potato Famine, many ships like The Looshtauk sailed across the Atlantic in search of a better home.

Miramichi Landings tells the stories of the island's troubled past through a series of interpretive panels dotting the island and will be continuing to preserve and present this heritage in years to come.

A replica lighthouse now stands on the eastern tip of Middle Island, a short distance from the Celtic Cross, a monument commemorating the hundreds of lives lost during the years of Irish immigration.

Cache is a small camo’d Lock N Lock. Original contents are: logbook, pencil, pencil sharpener, and ‘muggle card’ (please leave these items in the cache). Original tradable items include: wooden toy block, green die, yellow toy frog, “Animal Snap” card game, and The Looshtauk Travel Bug.

Can be reached from the shoreline/rocks, or can be reached from the side of the road. The only real difficulty with this cache is the cliff; not many muggles in this area.

Situated along the south side of the Miramichi River, St. Andrew’s Point is an important entry point into the Miramichi Landings system for visitors arriving from the southeast. St. Andrew’s Point is located near the center of what was once a thriving industrial community along the banks of the Miramichi:
Loggieville.

Originally known as Black Brook, the success of local brothers A. and R. Loggie (fish exporters who were the first to market fish from the Miramichi on the world market) saw the name changed in 1895. As their business grew, so too did the village.

Transforming into a thriving “company town,” Loggieville grew to have its own school, post office, businesses, telephone, hotel, and lumbering operation – it even became the terminus of the Eastern Canadian Railway.

Cache is a small camo’d Lock N Lock. Original contents are: logbook, pencil, pencil sharpener, and ‘muggle card’ (please leave these items in the cache). Original tradable items include: wooden toy block, green die, green toy frog, purple coil key chain, and Leigh Loggie Travel Bug.

When placing this cache, I approached from the shoreline as I thought I would be less visible to any muggles in the area, but feel free to take whichever route you’d like.</groundspeak:long_description>
