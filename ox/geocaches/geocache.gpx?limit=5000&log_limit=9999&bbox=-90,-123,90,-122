The Chirp is on public access private property near the given co-ordinates, BUT not anywhere that one looking for it would impede traffic, or be a safety hazard. 

I tested it.  My net book was stolen shortly there after so I no longer have the serial number.. ( If anyone finds my blue Acer One...My net book had the serial number.)

I figure that a drive by at about 10mph would be long enough to exchange data.  22 feet/sec. = 15 mph.

Safe parking spots are usually available to the northeast of the Chirp.

I'm new to Chirps.  Please email me: cactusmitch@cactusmitch.info

EXTREME STEALTH IS REQUIRED BASED UPON SOME CACHERS' EXPERIENCE (ALTHOUGH NO ISSUES WHEN PLANTING THE CACHE) 

 Treebeard is the oldest of three remaining original Ents. He is said to have once roamed all of the forests in Middle-earth, which included the Misty Mountains, Mirkwood, and the Blue Mountains. After the loss of the Entwives by the end of the Third Age, he and the remaining Ents dwelt in the Forest of Fangorn. This led the remaining Ents into isolation and all information from the outside world was cut off. The arrival of Merry and Pippin shifted Treebeard's attention to take action against Saruman for hacking down his trees. He led the Ents to war against Saruman and his Orcs. Treebeard later realised that while Saruman had learned much from him, the Wizard had shared no useful information of his own.
&quot;One felt as if there was an enormous well behind them, filled up with ages of memory and long, slow, steady thinking; but their surface was sparkling with the present: like sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast tree, or on the ripples of a very deep lake. I don't know but it felt as if something that grew in the ground — asleep, you might say, or just feeling itself as something between root-tip and leaf-tip, between deep earth and sky had suddenly waked up, and was considering you with the same slow care that it had given to its own inside affairs for endless years.&quot;

 This cache is in memory to our mom Ramona.  We tried our best to find a spot on Ramona Street to recognize her and this was the best I could do.  I know everyone hates ivy hides, so this is in as little or no ivy as possible - just look for the signs and you will find the cache.  

It is in a camo dressing - please re-wrap it after you find it.  Inside the camo is a pink container with many pink items, pink ribbons, a trackable, some coins, and other goodies inside.  The color is special for our mom's cache.  For the first few there are a couple plush pink items connected to the outside of the container - they are to be taken.  After the second one is gone, please also take the plastic baggie with you that is covering the cache as it is no longer needed.

Details:  WE KNOW - IT IS NOT A GREAT SPOT BUT WE WANTED THIS ON RAMONA STREET AND IT WAS REALLY THIS OR NOTHING.  WE SUGGEST THAT WHEN YOU FIND THE CACHE TAKE IT TO YOUR CAR OR WALK UP THE BLOCK WITH IT TO DO THE ITEM EXCHANGE AND LOG SIGNING AND THEN RETURN IT.  THERE ARE MUGGLE HOUSES ON EITHER SIDE (ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT ON RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY) AND TO THE WEST HOUSE YOU WILL BE IN PLAIN VIEW UNLESS YOU PARK YOUR CAR CORRECTLY.  EXTREME STEALTH IS NECESSARY.</groundspeak:long_description>

PLOT SUMMARY:
The Undead terrorize geocachers in historic Palo Alto. 
OPENING SCENE:
(Voice of Announcer): It is of great fear that we must report Zombies are roaming the streets. You may not be safe in your own home - as Zombies are everywhere. How do you protect yourself?

Know these simple guidelines:

1) Zombies move slow.....but they keep moving no matter what.
2) Zombies enjoy a snack or two....usually it is someone you know (the snack that is....or the Zombie....worse case is when it is both).
3) Zombies can easily be detected if you are downwind from them.
4) Never give a Zombie a helping hand or a piece of your mind....it only makes them stronger (and probably hurts you).
5) To distract a Zombie...toss one of your friends in front of it and run!

THE LOCATION:
This cache is hidden in an historic theatre on California Avenue in Palo Alto. Originally named for a small community, Mayfield, which was later annexed to Palo Alto, this theater was originally a simple Spanish Mission style structure, but was given a plain Moderne facade and marquee in the Fifties. The last chain to operate it was Renaissance Rialto. Today the marquee is a well known fixture on souther California Avenue - bringing back memories of Saturday horror movie matinees.

Closed in the late 1980s, the building is now reopened for the public. The marquee still reads Fine Arts in neon, and the original facade still exists in part behind the Fifties era fascia. It is sure to bring back memories of those who watched zombies and other monsters in old movies of the past in this theater.

Hours to access the cache are: Tue-Fri 11am-6pm; Sat 12pm-5pm; Sun 10am-2pm


STORYLINE:
Simply go inside and seek out the zombie supply box (an ammo box for the undead). It is in plain view. There is no purchase necessary and the owners have agreed to allow this cache to rest in peace in their location. But please be respectful of the location, employees and the patrons. Please look around and you will see the framework of the old theatre and how some old theatre chairs are now being used. The old wood theatre floor is still intact and the stage is the rear stock room area.

MOVIE RATING:
Bring the mini-cachers as this cache is really full of fun goodies and is intended as a true family cache. We brought back to life about half of the goodies we have ever recovered from caches around the world....thus even the cache contents themselves have been given a second chance to walk the earth. Please leave something if you take something and be sure to sign the Log Book Of The Undead.

SPECIAL EFFECTS:
For the First-to-Find a California Zombie Hunter patch or Zombie Hunter bracelet or many other undead, horror things to choose from. This is wheelchair accessible.

you'll be looking for a black taped peanut butter jar. original contents include a log book and pen (although you should bring your own just in case), a $5 gift certificate for the FTF, circus circus keychain, guitar pick, play handcuff key, behringer sticker, gardening club keychain and 2 animal toys(monkey and a wolf)

start at the parking lot at the quarry in el granada. here they just updated the children's park and picnic area ( there are tables and barbecues) follow the signs up the Harbor View trail. This 1.2 mile out and back hike is easy, although there is one short moderate climb. Total elevation change is about 400 feet. Park is open from dawn to dusk. Dogs are permitted on leash only. Fire roads are multi-use, while the park paths are open to hikers and equestrians only. watch out for ticks and poison oak. for more info about the park go to http://www.bahiker.com/southbayhikes/quarry.html or http://www.mpl.sanmateo.org/qpinfo.html </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Blue Lady is the ghost of a woman reportedly seen in and around the Moss Beach Distillery Cafe in Moss Beach, California; she is so-named because she usually dressed all in blue. She is said to originate from the Prohibition era. 

 When the Distillery (known in its early years as &quot;Frank's Place&quot;, after its builder and owner, Frank Torres) was first built in 1927, it was one of the main receivers of alcohol that was smuggled into California from ships that supplied liquor from Canada; following Prohibition, the San Francisco area, among other places in the United States, smuggled alcohol into the country in any way possible. As Frank's Place was located on an isolated bluff and was a classy restaurant, it was allegedly never raided by police.

Whatever the story, the Blue Lady still frequents the Moss Beach Distillery, sometimes inside the cafe, sometimes wandering in reverie on the bluffs that overlook the sea, her clothing either bloodstained and cut, or intact and clean.

The cache is hidden in the parking lot of the Moss Beach Distillery.  This parking lot also serves as a scenic overlook.  Combined this means HEAVY MUGGLE ACTIVITY (and it is visible from the back of the Distillery where the kitchen staff takes breaks). THIS IS A VERY VERY BUSY AREA (SORRY) SO EXTREME STEALTH IS IMPORTANT TO AVOID PATRONS, STAFF, NEIGHBORS, DOG WALKERS, VIEW SEEKERS AND OTHERS,

There is a real $1 for the FTF and a real $0,25 for the STF  (OK, we are cheap).  Some fake gold coins and insects for all others.  Stop by, sign the log and watch out for ghosts and other spirits (definitely some spirits in the bar).  Also, really cool....the Distillery is dog friendly, so bring the mutts and enjoy the back patio complete with fire pits and blankets with a great Pacific view!

Congrats to the Voucher for FTF!   (

Had to replace cache - no longer a nice sized one.  (darn muggles).  It is a blinkie.</groundspeak:long_description>

 An Army Major who likes to butt heads with his superiors, is being &quot;given&quot; a new assignment, to train 12 men who are either sentenced to death or life imprisonment, to go behind enemy lines raid a chateau that the Germans are using as an R&amp;R center and kill as enemy officers as they can and disrupt the German chain of command. Now he not only has to train them; he has to get them to start acting like a unit.  

Joseph Wladislaw (Charles Bronson) – Sentenced to death by hanging for shooting a deserting officer.

This is the third cache in a series. We have decided to make a 13 cache series (the Dirty Dozen plus the Major) - each one (we believe) evilly difficult or fun to find. 

Congrats to Olivia Noelle for the first to find and log all 13!!!  Congrats to BThomas for the second to find and log.  HMB Lipripper is coming up fast for a possible third.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Camo'd micro...also pretty hidden.  

You may want to bring some music in your MP3 to listen to while searching...it took us awhile and I listened to almost all of Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; while hiking and placing the cache. I love rock music so it helped pass the time. The mini gc'ers however preferred &quot;She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes&quot;....I heard the hole thing so many times!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&quot;Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eye are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind's eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye.&quot; 

 Flowers for Algernon is a science fiction short story and subsequent novel written by Daniel Keyes. The short story, written in 1958 and first published in the April 1959 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction, won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 1960. The novel was published in 1966 and was joint winner of that year's Nebula Award for Best Novel (with Babel-17).

The titular Algernon is a laboratory mouse who has undergone surgery to increase his intelligence by artificial means. The story is told as a series of progress reports written by Charlie, the first human test subject for the surgery, and touches upon many different ethical and moral themes.

This cache is a tribute to one of my favorite books I read in elementary school.  It has alot of toys and prizes in a camo'ed box. It is in the corner of a park - there is a dog run nearby so beware of dog-walking muggles.  Please re-hide carefully.

Congrats to Paco49er on his first cache find!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&quot;The Dark Lord was suddenly aware of him, the Eye piercing all shadows... Its wrath blazed like a sudden flame and its fear was like a great black smoke, for it knew its deadly peril, the thread upon which hung its doom... its thought was now bent with all its overwhelming force upon the Mountain...&quot; 

 Throughout The Lord of the Rings, &quot;the Eye&quot; (the Red Eye, the Evil Eye, the Lidless Eye) is the image most often associated with Sauron. Sauron's Orcs bore the symbol of the Eye on their helmets and shields, and referred to him as the &quot;Eye&quot; because he did not allow his name to be written or spoken, according to Aragorn (a notable exception to this rule was his emissary, the Mouth of Sauron). Also, the Lord of the Nazgûl threatened Éowyn with torture before the &quot;Lidless Eye&quot; at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

In the Mirror of Galadriel, Frodo had an actual vision of this Eye:

&quot;The Eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself glazed, yellow as a cat's, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing.
&quot;
Later, Tolkien writes as if Frodo and Sam really glimpse the Eye directly, not in any kind of vision. The mists surrounding Barad-dûr are briefly withdrawn, and:

&quot;one moment only it stared out...as from some great window immeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of red, the flicker of a piercing Eye... The Eye was not turned on them, it was gazing north...but Frodo at that dreadful glimpse fell as one stricken mortally.&quot;

This is a simple cache  in the Tolkien series.  You must be careful of the orcs and trolls around - they are known to spy on cachers and plunder known caches. Being Sauron's Eye it is appropriately placed next to the famous chocolate factory: See's.

It is magnetic (on one end despite magnets on both ends - so replace so that magnets do hold it).</groundspeak:long_description>

 The Return of the King

The hosts of Mordor, led by the dreaded Witch-king of Angmar, succeed in breaking through the gates of Minas Tirith, but are in turn crushed by the arriving cavalry of Rohan. The battle is also joined by a &quot;black fleet with black sails&quot;. The forces of Mordor initially rejoice at its arrival; and then are horrified to see the banner of the King upon the ships. Aragorn has succeeded in using the Oathbreakers to defeat the Corsairs of Umbar; the men of Gondor who were once slaves on the ships are brought back to fight the host of Mordor. In the following Battle of the Pelennor Fields the Witch-king is slain by Dernhelm, revealed to be Éowyn the niece of King Théoden, with help from Merry. Thus the siege is broken, but at heavy cost: many warriors of Gondor and Rohan fall, among them King Théoden. Denethor immolates himself and Faramir on his funeral pyre, but Gandalf and Pippin succeed in saving Faramir, who is subsequently healed by Aragorn. Aragorn also heals Merry and Éowyn, who were hurt by the Witch-king before he fell.

Knowing that it is only a matter of time before Sauron rebuilds his forces for another attack, Aragorn and Gandalf decide to draw out the hosts of Mordor with an assault on the Black Gate, providing a distraction so that Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee may have a chance of reaching Mount Doom and destroying the One Ring, unseen by the Eye of Sauron. Gandalf and Aragorn lead an army to the Black Gate of Mordor and lay siege to Sauron's army. The battle begins and the body of a troll he had killed falls onto Pippin, and he loses consciousness just as the Great Eagles arrive.


This cacher is hidden along KING Drive, although you may find access easier by turning south on Callan and driving to the walled field.  

Good luck in the Fields of Pelennor.</groundspeak:long_description>

 We decided to try and place a 4.5/4 star cache.   The terrain rating reflects getting there and getting back.  The overall difficulty reflects having to hunt a multi in some hard to find areas with the final being a bit evil.   Please let us know if you agree with the 4.5/4....if not we already have some &quot;fun&quot; ideas to address this.  :)

This cache will offer you a fantastic view of the south and east bay (once you get there).  I tried to place it away from any poison oak, but I am sure there is plenty around so be careful.

 We were in Placerville not too long ago and came across a great surplus store.  To me that meant cache supplies and they had ammo boxes.  This is our first ammo box hide.  Nothing tricky, although it is camo'ed a bit.  Fresh log and pen.  Some goodies already in place.  FTF gets choice.  No need to trample any growth - but beware of poison oak, it is all over that mountain.</groundspeak:long_description>

 When Frodo and his companions found themselves in Farmer Maggot's fields as they made their way to Crickhollow on September 25, 3018 of the Third Age, Maggot remembered Frodo but did not make good on his threat. Instead, the Hobbits were treated to a meal including a dish of mushrooms and bacon.

This cache is located on a side trail on San Bruno Mountain.  The terrain difficulty is rated high - but you will learn why when you climb back up.  If it is a warm day, bring water.  I spotted two turkey vultures, a red tailed hawk and some hummingbirds in the first 5 minutes I was there.  No nazgul though.

Congrats to Dyknomight for the FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

I told Gandalf I would keep you safe and, safe is where I'll keep you. I believe you will enjoy this next one. It is one of my own compositions. Right, ahem.&quot; 

 The Two Towers:

Frodo and Sam depart for Mordor with the Ring of Power. Boromir dies trying to stop a band of orcs from kidnapping Merry and Pippin. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue the orcs. They travel into the land of Rohan and see that the band of orcs is traveling very quickly toward Isengard, the fortress of the once good wizard, Saruman. They meet Eomer, a marshal of Rohan who hears their tale and offers them horses to look for the hobbits even though his men just killed the orcs.

 Merry and Pippin are hauled around by the orcs for several days. When the Riders of Rohan surround them, one of the orcs tries to get away with them but is killed. They escape and flee into the forest. There, they meet the ent, Treebeard, who takes them to his home and listens to their stories. He is enraged by the tale of the evils around and gathers the long dormant ents. They elect to rouse the forest and attack Isengard themselves.


This tale continues at San Bruno Mountain under the many antenna TOWERS (more than two but so be it).  The cache is a micro - the log is in a BLINKIE. Good luck and please re-hide carefully.

Beware of orcs, nazgul and trolls.</groundspeak:long_description>

 It is located in the heart of the black land of Mordor and approximately 15,553 feet (4.7 km) high. Alternative names, in Sindarin, include Orodruin (&quot;fiery mountain&quot;) and Amon Amarth (&quot;mountain of fate&quot;). The Sammath Naur (&quot;Cracks of Doom&quot;) is a chasm located deep within the mountain.

The mountain represents the endpoint of Frodo Baggins' quest to destroy the Ring which is recounted in The Lord of the Rings. The chasm is the site where the One Ring was originally forged by the Dark Lord Sauron and the only place it can be unmade.

This cache is located on top of our local Mount Doom...well, San Bruno Mountain.  No need to toss in any gold ring.</groundspeak:long_description>

 The Dwarves, or Khazâd in their own tongue, were beings of short stature, often friendly with Hobbits although long suspicious of Elves. They were typically blacksmiths and stoneworkers by profession, unrivaled in some of their arts even by the Elves. 

While there were several tribes (Houses) of the Dwarves, the most prominent had been that of the Longbeards.

 The Fellowship located the entrance to Moria: the Doors of Durin. The Doors were protected, allowing no entrance, requiring a password to be spoken. The Fellowship could not enter until Gandalf answered the riddle on the gates. Unknown to the Fellowship, something resided in the lake outside the gates, the &quot;Watcher in the Water&quot;.

The Watcher attacked Frodo as the Fellowship was about to enter Moria. The creature grasped Frodo with a long, pale green, luminous tentacle. Samwise Gamgee drove the tentacle off with his sword, but twenty other tentacles emerged from the water. The Company retreated into Moria as the tentacles hurled the enormous stone doors shut and uprooted the trees that grew on either side of the entrance. The doors were sealed off, trapping the Fellowship in the mines. The Fellowship had no alternative but to go through the mines and exit them on the other side via the Dimrill Gate. Gandalf and others of the Company noted that the Watcher had grabbed only Frodo, the Ringbearer. Frodo and Gandalf were not sure whether it was one creature or many. As Gandalf commented, &quot;Something has crept or been driven out of the dark water under the mountains. There are older and fouler things than orcs in the deep places of the world.&quot;

This Watcher in the Waters is watching the entrance to a location of much water.  Be careful not to disturb it or be seen by the muggling orcs.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium features dragons closely based on those of European legend.

Besides dragon (derived from French), Tolkien variously used the terms drake (the original English term, from Old English draca, in turn from Latin draco) and worm (from Old English wyrm, &quot;serpent&quot;, &quot;dragon&quot;). 

 Although he cannot see Bilbo because of the ring, Smaug smells Bilbo and greets him mockingly. Bilbo is smart, though, and answers Smaug only in riddles, which amuses the dragon enough to quell his anger for a while. Cleverly, the hobbit flatters Smaug into displaying his thick-skinned underbelly, revealing an open patch in Smaug’s scaly armor above his left breast.

This cache is located next to a local restaurant and lounge, the Jade DRAGON.  Like Smaug in the novel, this one may have a weak patch on its underbelly.  Beware of local townfolk.</groundspeak:long_description>

 I found this small park during a run one evening.  It is a little hidden in Daly City and I thought it would be a good place to place a cache.

The area will have many muggles so be careful and hide it well when done.  It is full of many trinkets and items.  There is a log book but be sure to bring a pen because the ones I placed in there may be taken as tokens.

Congrats to LookingintheFog for the FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>There is a small asphalt path in the back of the park.  Near the top before it gets to the stairs there is a small &quot;grove&quot; of a few trees/shrubs.  It is in the shrubs at the base of a tree on the downward slope facing the open lawn area.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A cache in honor of the man who gave us the first Oakland Raiders Superbowl win. 

 From Wikipedia: John Earl Madden (born April 10, 1936) is a former American professional football player in the National Football League, a former head coach with the Oakland Raiders in the American Football League and later the NFL, and a former color commentator for NFL telecasts. In 2006, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in recognition of his coaching career. He is also widely known for the long-running Madden NFL video game series he has endorsed and fronted since 1988.

Madden broadcast with Pat Summerall in the 1980s and 1990s, on CBS and later Fox. He was also the last color commentator for ABC's Monday Night Football before it moved to ESPN in 2006. His last regular role was as a commentator for NBC Sunday Night Football.

Building on that success, Madden was hired by Al Davis as linebackers coach for the AFL's Oakland Raiders in 1967, putting him in the Sid Gillman coaching tree. He helped the team reach Super Bowl II that season. A year later, after Raiders head coach John Rauch resigned to take the same position with the Buffalo Bills, Madden was named the Raiders' head coach on February 4, 1969, becoming professional football's youngest head coach at the age of 32.

Madden's Raiders reached and lost five AFC title games in seven years, which left the Raiders with the same image that the Dallas Cowboys had previously had—as a team unable to &quot;win the big one.&quot; Despite a 12–1–1 mark in 1969, the team lost 17–7 to the Kansas City Chiefs in the final American Football League championship game. Three years later, in what appeared to be a last-minute victory over the Steelers instead became a part of football lore when Franco Harris' &quot;Immaculate Reception&quot; gave Pittsburgh a 13–7 win. Then, in 1974, after defeating the two-time, and defending Super Bowl champion Miami Dolphins in dramatic fashion, the Raiders lost again to the Steelers in the AFC Championship game.

In 1976, the Raiders went 13–1 in the regular season, and escaped the first round of the playoffs with a dramatic and controversial victory over the New England Patriots. In the second round of the playoffs they defeated the Steelers for the AFC Championship. On January 9, 1977, Madden's Raiders finally captured their first Super Bowl with a convincing 32–14 win over the Minnesota Vikings.

Madden retired as a Super Bowl winning head coach and was the youngest coach ever to reach 100 career regular season victories, a record he compiled in only ten full seasons of coaching at the age of 42.

Madden's overall winning percentage including playoff games ranks second in league history. He won a Super Bowl and never had a losing season as a head coach. Madden has a winning record as a head coach against other future Hall of Fame head coaches

From CACCBAG: John Madden graduated from Jefferson High School in Daly City, California.  He has since donated the funds to light the school's track and football field - now dubbed &quot;The Madden Lights&quot;.

This cache is to recognize his connection with his former high school.  Per Geocaching rules, it is NOT on school property.  However one can easily see Madden's former high school and the Madden Lights from its location.

It is, I believe, well hidden. The cache container is small and it took effort to place it in its hiding spot. Please use your best efforts to return it to the same spot. Because the area is usually swarming with muggles, stealth is your number one priority.

For the First To Find, a special FTF prize.  While you can't retire off of it or even feed a cricket from its sale, it will be unique in its relation to this cache.  The directions for finding the FTF prize are in the cache  (basically turn 180 degrees and look down.....not a bad clue either in finding the cache in case you find the prize first).  It is the easiest terrain accessible to all - thus the one rating.  But finding it may take a little effort.

Again,  muggles everywhere.  Please be careful in not being seen and re-hiding.  It is NOT on school property and you have no reason to enter school property for this hunt.</groundspeak:long_description>

He sees thousands of black butterflies and looks at the black emperors for a long time and enjoyed the feel of the breeze in his hair and on his face. 

 Mirkwood was the great forest east of the Anduin in Wilderland. It was originally called Greenwood the Great until the shadow of Sauron fell over the woods. The forest became dark and filled with evil creatures, but the great Woodland Realm of the Elves endured. During the War of the Ring, Legolas of Mirkwood gained renown as a member of the Fellowship, and after Sauron's downfall the forest was free of the shadow of evil once more.

This cache is located in a small clearing off a trail on San Bruno Mountain.  Please note there are certain elements of the cache around the GZ.  If you have a child with you please take one (not the cache). You will have to clean off the element a bit - but should be pretty easy. Please post it.  As those elements decrease in number I will replinish.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Bilbo hid his treasure he took from Smaug....can you find it? 

 In this cache you will need to find Frodo's friend's Merry and Pippin.  They will help lead you to Bilbo's treasure.  

Find Merry first and he will tell you where Pippin is resting.

Pippin will be more than happy to tell you where the treasure is....but you need to find him first.

To get to these caches, you will need to be a an expert at the Hobbit trivia, or bring a copy of the book with you....or be able to view Google through your own palantir.  PLEASE LEAVE THE CLUE SHEETS IN EACH CACHE (you will probably need to bring some paper and a pen to write down the clues). 

The first cache is not at these coordinates, but nearby.  To get there go here:

37. 41. A B C
122. 27. D A E

A= The number of years Belladonna Tuck dies after her husband died minus one.
B=Bilbo asked a riddle that had the answer &quot;teeth&quot; - what number was this riddle in his series of riddles  - then add the value of A above?
C= The address of the Gamgees at Bagshot Row plus one.
D=The number of times &quot;eye(s)&quot; is mentioned in the riddle that had &quot;sun&quot; and &quot;daisies&quot; in the answer.
E= The sum for B above minus the value of A above.

(If you don't want to or can't figure out the location for Merry's cache, it is in the Hint/Spoiler below.  But you are on your own for the next two

SUM CHECKS (last 3 digits of coords):
Merry N: 19 W: 13
Pippin: N: 14 W: 13
Bilbo's Treasure: N: 12 W: 14

Find both Merry and Pippin and then find Bilbo.  If you do this, Bilbo will offer to share his treasure with you.  If you look around at the first two caches, you might spot Merry at one and Pippin at the other.  THEY ARE NOT THE CACHES - so no need to move them or even touch them.  They are there to guard the caches and to help you on your quest.

I took no less than 3 measurements at each location with the Garmin. I tried to confirm with Google Earth but, as you will see, on site tree cover made that almost useless. The caches are located at trees (base, trunk, roots, etc.).  Feel free to write us with any questions, coord guesses, etc. 


In the each cache location, please be very aware of muggles strolling near the cache.  Hobbits are very quiet while the Big People are loud and very nosy and they can sneak up on you.  Pippin's cache is the most visible, but of course it is Bilbo's treasure that must be guarded with all stealth.

Final cache has a One Ring to rule them all for the FTF, STF and TTF....(yes, we know...three people each get the One Ring.   But you are looking for hobbits so don't question our reasoning).  I tried to clear all briars away and do not believe there is poison oak near, but please be careful in case I missed any.

There is also a Lord of the Rings geocoin and an Alphonse travel bug......................and tons of gold, gems, jewels, and other treasure.

Please be careful with the caches and please re-hide carefully.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Across the width and height of the tunnel a vast web was spun, orderly as the web of some huge spider, but denser-woven and far greater, and each thread was thick as rope.
    Sam laughed grimly. 'Cobwebs!' he said. 'Is that all? Cobwebs! But what a spider! have at 'em! Down with 'em!'
    In a fury he hewed at them with his sword, but the thread that he struck did not break. It gave a little and then sprang back like a plucked bowstring, turning the blade and tossing up both sword and arm. 

 There agelong she had dwelt, an evil thing in spider-from, even such as once of old had lived in the Land of the Elves in the West that is now under the Sea, such as Beren fought in the Mountains of Terror in Doriath, and so came to Lúthien upon the green sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight long ago. How Shelob came there, flying from ruin, no tale tells, for out of the Dark Years few tales have come. But still she was there, who was there before Sauron, and before the first stone of Barad-Dûr; and she served none but herself, drinking the blood of Elves and Men, bloated and grown fat with endless brooding over her feasts, weaving webs of shadow; for all living things were her food, and her vomit darkness.Hardly had Sam hidden the light of the star-glass when she came. A little way ahead and to his left he saw suddenly, issuing from a black hole of shadow under the cliff, the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld, horrible beyond the horror of an evil dream. Most like a spider she was, but huger than the greatest hunting beasts, and more terrible than they because of the evil purpose in her remorseless eyes. Those same eyes that he had thought daunted and defeated, there they were lit with a fell light again, clustering in her out-thrust head. Great horns she had, and behind her short stalk-like neck was her huge swollen body, a vast bloated bag, swaying and sagging between her legs; its great bulk was black, blotched with livid marks, but the belly underneath was pale and luminous and gave forth a stench. Her legs were bent, with great knobbed joints high above her back, and hairs that stuck out like steel spines, and at each leg's end there was a claw.
    As soon as she had squeezed her soft squelching body and its folded limbs out of the upper exit from her lair, she moved with a horrible speed, now running her creaking legs, now making a sudden bound</groundspeak:long_description>

When Bilbo and his companions came to the Lonely Mountain in 2941 of the Third Age, Roac was 153 years old. He was bald and nearly blind and hardly able to fly, but he remembered the tales his father had told him about the friendship between the ravens and the Dwarves. 

 Thorin led the company to the Front Gate and out to Ravenhill. There they met an old Raven named Roac who told Thorin that Smaug was dead. Roac also brought the news that the Lake-men and the Wood-elves were coming to the Lonely Mountain seeking a share in the treasure. Roac advised Thorin to trust Bard of Lake-town, but Thorin was angry at the thought of anyone trying to claim part of the treasure. He asked Roac to send for help from Dain Ironfoot in the Iron Hills, and then Thorin &amp; Company returned to the Lonely Mountain and began to fortify the Front Gate.</groundspeak:long_description>

 Gollum, originally known as Sméagol (T.A. c. 2430 – 25 March 3019), is a fictional character from J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. He was first introduced in the author's fantasy novel The Hobbit, and later became an important supporting character in its sequel, The Lord of the Rings.

Gollum was a Stoor Hobbit of the River-folk, who lived near the Gladden Fields. They loved the river, and often swam in it, or made little boats of reeds. Smeagol (aka Gollum) was the most inquisitive and curious-minded of the family. He was interested in roots and beginnings; he dived deep into pools; he burrowed under trees and growing plants; he tunnelled into green mounds; and he ceased to look up at the hill-tops, or the leaves on trees, or the flowers opening in the air: his head and eyes were downward. He had a friend called Deagol, sharper-eyed but not so quick and strong. Once they took a boat and went down to the Gladden Fields, where there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds. 

Originally known as Sméagol, he was later named Gollum after his habit of making a horrible swallowing noise in his throat. His life was extended far beyond its natural limits by the effects of possessing the One Ring, and he became obsessed with the Ring that had enslaved him, to the point that he pursued the Ring for the rest of his life after losing it to Bilbo Baggins.

Gollum had lived under the Misty Mountains for centuries, living on a small island in the centre of a lake at the roots of a mountain. He survived on cave fish, which he caught from his small boat, and small goblins who strayed too far from the stronghold of the Great Goblin. Over the years, his eyes adapted to the dark and became 'lamp-like', shining with a sickly pale light in the dark.

One of his riddles to Bilbo was:

Alive without breath,
As cold as death;
Never thirsty, ever drinking,
All in mail never clinking.

This cache is a blinkie.  There are gold Middle Earth coins for the first 5 to find (one each please).  Please please use stealth and re-hide carefully!!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Bring a towel, but you don't need to swim. I believe Gollum would take a boat to the center of a lake and catch fish by hand. You won't need a boat though.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">He was tall as a young tree, lithe, immensely strong, able swiftly to draw a great war-bow and shoot down a Nazgûl, endowed with the tremendous vitality of Elvish bodies, so hard and resistant to hurt that he went only in light shoes over rock or through snow, the most tireless of all the Fellowship. 

 Legolas Greenleaf is a Sindarin Elf who became a part of the Fellowship of the Ring. Legolas, son of the King Thranduil of Mirkwood, is the Prince of Mirkwood, and also a messenger, and master Bowman. With his keen eyesight, sensitive hearing, and excellent bowmanship, Legolas was a valuable resource to the other eight members of the Fellowship. His age is never stated by Tolkien but is estimated by some to be between 500 and 3,000 years old. 

After the destruction of the One Ring and of Sauron, the tree-loving Legolas and the stone-loving dwarf Gimli went off traveling together through Fangorn Forest and then later traveled to the Glittering Caves at Aglarond as he and Gimli had agreed. Eventually, Legolas came to Ithilien with some of his people, with his father's leave, to live out his remaining time in Middle-earth helping to restore the devastated forests of that war-ravaged land.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Today is Cori's birthday so we planted a cache in her honor. 

 The location once held another cache that appears to have been muggled and the cache archived.  So we took this opportunity to replace it while honoring the birthday of our mom, wife and friend Cori.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU - THIS CACHE IS NEAR THE ZOO - IT IS ALONG THE LAKE SHORE TOO - HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR CORI - HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU

So....we know the last cache here was muggled.  This means - STEALTH!  The cache is full (really full) of toys and goodies.  It is a camo'd plastic container. Please be very cautious grabbing and re-hiding so that this cache lasts a long time.

FTF gets a real money $5 bill.  STF gets a real money $1 bill.  Log is there but I forgot to include a writing instrument so you may wish to bring your own.

Tree cover was playing tricks with our GPS but you should be able to locate - despite the many possible hiding spots.  We never actually found the prior cache as it was muggled prior to us locating it but I believe it is not the same hide.</groundspeak:long_description>

 Going to visit our grandparents as kids, one of the highlights was seeing this plane in a playground along 19th avenue.  Although we never stopped or played on it, we all thought it was great.

Years later it was removed due to all the lead content in the paint. 

This cache is a few feet away from the &quot;landing strip&quot; of this ol' plane.

It is not on/in (or not really even close) to any plants so please do not trample or touch any of the plants.</groundspeak:long_description>

 The cache is located after a very short hike from the street - but lots of roots and it is slippery when wet.  (Parking my be tough, so if you have to park down the hill and walk up - add a star to the rating ....in your mind anyway)

The tree cover is bad so we hope the coords are good (used 4 measurements and averaged them and 2 were identical and one only 2 seconds off).

But, to help, look for a headless tree.  Although there is ivy everywhere, this one is basically not an ivy hide (mostly).</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Really, you want have to search in ivy plants, but you may have to push some aside.


The title.......but don't pull it please.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

 AlcatrazMedia planted a cache at a somewhat &quot;fair&quot; law school called Hastings.  I decided to borrow the name and place a cache at a much superior law school (no bias of course....just because I got my law degree from this one).

The cache is not on school property, but you will have a front row view of the many soon-to-be lawyers studying,  Use extreme stealth - people coming from St I chrcurch across the street and other muggles have a clear view.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A small cache with a view of Liguria Bakery. 

 My grandparents went here, my parents went here, now I go here.  They sell one thing and one thing only: foccacia bread.  Foccacia is an Italian flatbread with various toppings.  This small hole in the wall makes the best foccacia.  We have traveled through Italy including the Liguria region itself and tasted various foccacia - but this old family establishment makes the best.  They will be celebrating their 100 year anniversary in 2011.  (Note: The cache is not in the bakery, touching the bakery or even on the same block as the bakery so there is no need to buy anything....but the bakery is in full view from the GZ). 

On the day before Thanksgiving and the day before Christmas people line up to purchase their foccacia for the holiday meals.  If the bakery opens at 8, the line starts forming before 5:00am and by 8:00 it is two blocks long.  I placed this cache after getting our Christmas foccia this morning.

The cache is in Washington Square park. That is across from Saint Peter and Paul Church and just downhill from Coit Tower. If you are lucky you will see the wild parrots of Telegraph Hill that fly around the park. Info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Parrots_of_Telegraph_Hill 

It is a camo'd bison tube.  In the early morning many people are there doing exercises, so you may want to avoid the muggle-heavy time.  But no matter what time you go, there will be many many muggles - that adds to the difficulty rating.  

PLEASE USE EXTREME STEALTH - AND PLEASE PLACE IT BACK EXACTLY WHERE YOU FOUND IT.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is a piece of PVC pipe (log only) with two caps on its end, that's all. The area it is in is a nice place for hiking, and a huge jackpot for geocaches. I suggest you look it up for geocaches, and you'll find a lot. Bring the kids along, it's a nice hike.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Weirdness on the Albany Bulb. Terrain is a fairly easy walk of about 1 km. This small cache is the fourth-generation cache in this place; the previous three were pillaged.

Take a nice bike ride or easy hike across the meandering landscape that is the Albany Bulb. This ex-industrial waste dump is now a park littered with bizarre and beautiful artwork.

If you have a camera, bring your telephoto lens for pictures of the avian life, and bring your regular lens for pictures of the crazy sculptures.

After you locate the cache, you'll probably want to inspect the array of constructions just east. Also it's worth your time to follow this find with a walk down the path to the northwest, then cut north at the water. (Low tide recommended!) On the northwest and north edges of the 'Bulb, you'll find all kinds of good stuff!

This is a camo-taped small-sized cache, but with enough room for a few goodies. I left a euro or two in the cache when I placed it.

(This cache used to be called Bullsi, due to a large painting of a target nearby. The cache was stolen, and the owner moved far away. I replaced it with a new cache called Stay on Target, so-named for the same nearby painting. The nearby painting had since been painted over with faces. Then a skatepark was built, and the slab was removed and the cache, which had been chained below it, was pillaged; so I put a new cache on a nearby overlook. And then, as if the story could possibly be over, the cache was pillaged again from the overlook. The beautiful and lovingly-crafted skatepark, too, has been demolished, probably by the State which recently acquired the land--that's just not right, I say, even if the skaters were in any way responsible for the original pillaging.)</groundspeak:long_description>

Along the way I found a beautiful place for a new cache. It over looks the golf course and there are no caches in this area. a nice hike up but a hard hike down.</groundspeak:long_description>

This little BUGer is set to mark the trail head that leads straight up the hill to Chicken ranch. Maybe others will add their own caches to this area. 

After a reliable cacher DNFed this listing I checked my position listing in google earth and it looked good So i went back with all of my GPSr to get a real position. 
The rino with current firmware was 5 feet to the east. My Iphone was 46 feet north east. The Garmin legend was like the Iphone 36 feet north east. The worst was the Garmin Etrex was 86 feet all over the place. I took 8 marks 20 feet apart in all directions and averaged them to the new location.</groundspeak:long_description>

A nice climb to the top of this mound will give a great view of the old Air force base. It also overlooks where I spend most of my days.

This is a great place for a cache and I liked it the first time I climbed it.

A previous cache has gone missing so I devised a better camo for this area and have placed this for all of you out there to find.
It will hold many quarter sized objects and the log is rolled up in a small tube which will keep it dry.
I didn't have a small enough pen for this can and you will need to bring a pen.

A First To Find Coupin was grabbed by GeoJammers. Great Job!</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; ~ 6 squirrels, quartered&lt;br/&gt;
~ 6 oz your favorite dry rub&lt;br/&gt;
~ 3 tbsp salt&lt;br/&gt;
~ 2 tsp pepper&lt;br/&gt;
~ 9 oz your favorite BBQ sauce&lt;br/&gt;
~ 3 tsp garlic powder&lt;br/&gt;
~ 5 tsp onion powder&lt;br/&gt;
~ 2 large handfuls hickory chips&lt;br/&gt;
~ a dozen or so charcoal briquettes&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In a large pot, boil the squirrel in water seasoned with the salt,
pepper, garlic powder and onion powder for 1 hour or until
tender.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In the meantime, soak the hickory chips in water. Light the
charcoal and let them get white hot. Place them to one side of your
grill.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Remove the squirrel from the water and pat dry. Coat with your
favorite dry rub.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Add one handful of wood chips to the hot coals.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Place squirrel on grill across from the hot coals. Cover and smoke
for 1 hour. Add a handful of wood chips every half hour.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Add last of the wood chips and baste squirrel with BBQ sauce.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Smoke for another half hour basting another 3 - 4 times.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Serve with mashed potatoes, sweet corn and buttermilk
biscuits.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;

I've been looking for a location like this one for a hide like this one. Its a larger type of hide but don't let that deceive you this cache is hidden.

A chain saw is not required and wading through the wood pile is not a requirement but at the time of this cache setting cow pies were a issue as well as the sleeping cows chewing their cud.

(Note; Cud is the ingredient of cow pie)

Good luck all and replace the cache as it was found and don't be lazy.

A FTF Kupin was left with the other assortment of stash. the log is in a small tube but I don't think I put a pen in.... DOOH....</groundspeak:long_description>

On my way down from My First First to find I decided this was a great place for a log only micro I made awhile back. The camo is blends in very well and was hard for even me to see after I placed it.
Its not far from the parking area and will allow you to search without too much hill climbing.

Don't forget to bring a pen.

Congratulations to GeoJammers for the First To Find glad to help get you moving!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">It's now been two years since Julie (Cheryl-MuggleN0More) and I (Zop)had to actually admit to all of our Geocaching friends that yes.. We are a couple :-) Funny how most of you knew it before we did!

Since then we've racked up some 4000 fun and challanging hides and a whole bunch of not so fun or challanging hides. Today to celebrate these two awesome years, we decided to take a short Kayak ride in the Walker Creek and decided to leave a fun little surprise behind for the rest of you thrill seekers to tackle.

If you look at the cords with Google Earth, Yes, that's pretty darn accurate! So.. Plan accordingly! You will need a way to get there and we recommend high tide! You will then also need to either have a long grabbing tool or have the spirit of a simian (and the agility too!) to retreive this cache and to replace exactly as found.

The difficult rating is because of the inherent danger associated with retreival and replacement, the Terrain rating is because you will need some sort of watercraft or be a fairly adept swimmer.
Photos of your adventures are welcomed and encouraged!

We accessed the creek with our Kayaks about .40 miles up the creek from GZ at the Key's Creek Fishing lot. You probably can too.
As always, be safe and have a blast!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This two-stage multicache is a replacement for the now archived traditional geocache http://coord.info/GC292A

To find this multicache, you will need to do a little onsite investigation. 

Your mission!
To obtain information which can be found at or very near the posted coordinates that will lead you to a treasure box a little ways away.

Stage-1 - Virtual 
Stage-2 - Cammo'd Ammo Can.

When you arrive at Stage-1 you will be entering the interpretive room where you will find a wall mounted display interpreting the Petaluma Adobe.

To find Stage-2, you will need find out which period this sign is interpreting. NNNN-WWWW

From this information, some very basic math is required such that:

NNNN - 1421 = ABC
WWWW - 1810 = DEF

Stage-2 is located at N38° 15.ABC W122° 35.DEF

The coordinates for Stage-2 were averaged but tree cover may warrant using your eyes more than the GPS when you get within 10 feet of GZ.

PLEASE NOTE:
This cache placed by permission granted by the Park's resident Ranger. 
Please abide by all posted rules and park hours.

Petaluma Adobe State Historic Park is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
However, the park is closed on New Years Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.

There are admission fees to visit the park, the fees are $3.00 for adults, $2.00 for children between 6 and 16, and children under 5 are free. The paid admission is also good, on the same day, at Sonoma State Historic Park (which includes the Barracks, Mission San Francisco Solano, and the General Vallejo Home) in Sonoma.

Original contents:
StarTrek VHS Movie collection, a Teddy Bear bank, misc geocaching related swag etc...

Have fun out there!

UPDATE 3/9/08
Replaced container a few days ago. The new container is the container that used to be Highway 116 Quickie, that I had to archive do to PO. Sorry the log was so soaked. The opening tab had been broken off the old container. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cannot be found at the posted coords. Solve this little puzzle
to gain what you need.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Enter Agent Otto Von.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly trained communications specialist yet
bumbling oaf of a secret agent from a little known country, located
somewhere between Chaos and Order. His pursuers call him Agent
“0” Yes, that’s a Zero, Not an Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otto Von seems like such an unlikely character
to pull off such an important task but it appears that he has
managed to stay one step ahead of the local G-Men who have been hot
on his trail since capturing his trusty comrade, Flash Override,
also known as Agent “A”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before Agent “A” was
captured, he somehow managed to get a message to Agent
“0” who has been artfully dodging the authorities ever
since. Luckily for you however, the bumbling oaf “0”
seems to have dropped a note on which we believe to be some sort of
cryptic instructions on how to find the location of a secret
drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several minutes of bell torture, Agent
“A” gave up this tidbit of information: N38º 20.ABC
W122º 41.DEF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now need your skills to decipher this note
and locate the secret drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
A = SP0+1IGS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
B = YH1+1FDN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
C = VLA+1DEM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
D = NWP+1HSP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
E = NYS+1C0W&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
F = PS0+1B0X&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mission is to crack this code and find
the area where Agent “0” is heading for his drop and
leave him a little note letting him know that we are on to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and make it back safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hints may be posted soon&lt;/p&gt;

Cache is now a camo'd pill bottle.  You will need to bring a pen or pencil.  During school hours you will need to be very steathly as many students will walk past here.  

No need to bushwack (much) or disturb the neighbors on the other side of the fence.  Please replace the cache better than you found it and be sure to take advantage of the natural cover.

Getting coordinates for the cache was difficult due to tree cover so I have added a spoiler hint. </groundspeak:long_description>

Most Monkey's really don't like falling into the drink so... plan your adventure accordingly. 

You are looking for a magnetic candy tin which may be visible from the correct angle but how are you going to get it?

I am the cacher who walks alone
 And when I'm walking a dark road
 At night or strolling through the park 
When the light begins to change
 I sometimes feel a little strange
 A little anxious when it's dark
 
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
 I have constant fear that something's always near
 Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
 I have a phobia that someone's always there
 
Have you ever been alone at night
 Thought you heard footsteps behind
 And turned around and no one's there?
 And as you quicken up your pace
 You find it hard to look again
 Because you're sure there's
 someone there
 
Watching horror films the night before
 Debating witches and folklore
 The unknown troubles on your mind
 Maybe your mind is playing tricks
 You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
 On dancing shadows from behind
 
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
 When I'm walking a dark road
 I am the cacher who walks alone

This night cache will take less than a half hour. Placed so the whole family can be scared together.
 
To find this cache start at the posted coordinates at night with a strong hand held light source. Look for a reflective tack. Each subsequent tack you find will bring you closer to the final destination. You are at the search site when you see three reflective tacks.

Cheryl-MuggleN0More and I came by here shortly after the cache was published last night and pretty thoroughly searched some of the likely areas but then the cold and the late hour got the best of us.

We vowed to return again today once we both came home from work and that’s just what we did!

When we first arrived today, there was Atomic Dog and Aiko’s dad searching diligently in the same areas we searched last night. Being that we were still more or less on a recon mission to confirm my hunch, we shamefully avoided letting them in on our quest. Once we found the right spot though, we quickly realized that we were not quite as equipped as we wanted to be so we took off back home and as we passed again, there was Atomic Dog letting us know that we were seen!! It’s those cache page pics we frequently upload that gave us away for sure .
Anyway, we zipped on home, got what we needed and snuck back on in from a different angle and made our attempt. Well, as luck would have it, we were seen… Not only by a handful of Muggelettes, but Atomic Dog was still on the scene and came over after we were well under way. 
After struggling our way to GZ and keeping ourselves as safe as possible... I have so much more to say about that adventure but maybe later once this has been found a few times as to not give too much away. So.. There we were! There was the geocache! We did it! We found our way there! Only.. Since you placed the hide, a fat juicy Black Widow has made that spot her home! 
Yes! This one is definitely going to be difficult for some. Being a former Black Widow owner, (RIP Alice) they don’t really bother me much anymore so I volunteered to be the sacrificial lamb and reached out for the grab. 
After congratulating each other, we could hear from afar, the others who dared not follow, also speak a word of congrats. Or did they call us crazy? I dunno.. It’s kind of hard to tell at that distance 

So after signing the virgin log, we trudged back the way we came trying to avoid all the pitfalls along the way. Once back on safe ground it was very nice to meet Atomic Dog who was still there rooting for us. Sorry to see that we missed Aiko’s Dad yet again. Perhaps one day soon.
Fear not about the Mugglettes though, they made it pretty clear that they in NO WAY wanted to follow our footsteps 

Mr. Moo, thank you for the awesome FTF adventure!! This one seriously earned a favorite point for the both of us! Keep up the good work! If you had half as much fun placing this as we did finding it, you must have had a BLAST!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Who says I cannot get ready for a special occasion in 5 minutes!? Heck when a 5/5 FTF is the finale I'll get ready in 3!All day long I was wondering who would get this cache first... By 3:45 I texted Zop to see if anyone had posted a find log yet. Once I learned there had not been the clock to get home from work could not have moved slower. I squirmed in my desk chair from 4 until I could leave. When I did I was so excited! Then I got behind drivers (EVERY ONE OF THEM!) who drove 40 mph. I usually take my commute at 60! So I chillaxed and spent my commute meditating and visualizing the cache. Once I had two feet inside our home Zop and I left to get this thing! We are not dilly dalliers. We drove up the GZ and there were two people with cute dogs loitering. They kept looking up at the sky and looking down at their GPSrs. OH! NO! Geocachers are already here! Zop and I decided to walk right past them as I stowed GPS and other TOTTS needed for this cache in my slacks pockets. Zop and I then walked to another place that we thought would help us get a better angle on the cache and we saw something we DID NOT EXPECT. We walked right back to the car post haste so I could get a change of clothes. I was not happy. I had waited long enough. (MIND you Zop had waited even longer for me to get home from work so we could get this one together so I have nothing to complain about. Thank you Zop.)We did our best to walk back to Stango Bango nonchalant but as we drove away one of the cachers at GZ gave us a knowing acknowledgement. The race was ON! Zop got me back home and I changed clothes faster than Clark Kent to change into Superman! I would say we were back where we wanted to be in less than 12 minutes. Then we went for it. When we did quite a crowd formed asking what we were doing and taunted and rooted us on. It was not an easy thing to do and their presence bolstered my conviction. We were not coming away with this without a find. NO WAY. NO HOW. Not with a crowd. Once we did finally find it I felt like we were on top of the world. The crowd was amazed and curious and quite honest concerned. WTF must have been at the forefront of their minds. Once we were done we had the pleasure of meeting the cacher with the knowing glance that was there when we arrived. Atomic Dog, it was a pleasure to meet you. What an EPIC cache. This is up there with THE BEST caches to date. Mr. Moo you have impressed me to no end. You have set a bar for geocaching and yourself. Thank you with all of my wacky geocaching filled heart. Thank you.</groundspeak:text>

The posted coordinates are only for parking.
To find this cache, you will need to venture into the unknown. Do you go East? Do you go West? North? South? Up? Down?? How far should you go? Well, you know it can't be here... At least 500 feet? 1000 feet?? 1500 feet? 
Into the Dark or into the Light?

Do you have what it takes?

Note: This adventure should NOT be attempted during or after heavy rains. Yes. That IS a major hint.

You are looking for a black bison tube.

When I heard Geojammers was coming over for dinner and some evening geocaching I was hoping I could interest him in this one in particular. After finding several others we were ready to have this adventure. Zop drove us to the staring point and we knew just what to do. What a super cool location. I was very glad to see Geojammers and I did not have to wade to GZ. At one point there was the sound of a car and Geojammers got spooked. It was Hilarious! 

When we finally got to GZ we discovered some bats! It was the only wildlife we encountered.

I convinced my dad and friend to go for this one, so after some long errands, we went for it. Upon arrival at GZ, we looked around and almost started off in the wrong direction after thinking we would need more equipment for our first idea. We then realized that we could, in fact, do it. It was katiegirl's first cache of this type, and she was a little nervous. She enjoyed it, though.

It wasn't too hard to get to, but I imagine during the winter it will be a different story.

This is just going to be one of those caches. Not your typical Lamp Post hides nor a magnet on the guardrail. No, it's not in a mile marker nor hanging from a tree. All you have to do is look. Visible from several yards away at the right angle. Use your power of observation! 
No tools required, no strings attached. Bring your own pen/cil.

No hints until logged as a DNF.

UPDATE- 8/20/07
Replaced the container. The building has been sold so the cache might not last quite as long.

UPDATE 6/28/08
I replaced the container once again... Hopefully it won't disappear. </groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt; 5/6/09 - Please do not park at the cemetary! The
owner of the road would like to keep the way clear at all times.
Instead, please park near the mailboxes near the included coords.
&lt;b&gt;N 38° 23.768 W 122° 51.803&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been looking around the area for a nice location for a
cache when I stumbled upon this little known plot of forgotten
history… After finding out about this place and confirming that
even though the large road sign on your left as you enter the dirt
road states private, public access is allowed as far as you need to
go. In fact, you will most likely notice the sign just a bit
further down the lane that advises you to go no further. The
location will be obvious once you get there and you will park on
the shoulder near the Spring Hill sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please do &lt;u&gt;NOT&lt;/u&gt; visit this site at night as lights will
certainly draw attention.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Once you have found this little plot, you will want to wander a bit
and read a little about many of those who passed before you. CITO
is welcomed and my research has taught me that volunteer clean-up
crews visit annually! For them, let’s help keep this place as nice
as can be. While I had considered making this one an evil puzzle, a
second thought convinced me to make this cache as easy as possible
as to not raise too much attention to those who come looking. The
hint will be a spoiler so avoid it is you want any challenge. As
always, BYOP, maybe a little swag and have fun! Watch your
step!&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK1PFR3 - PLEASE PARK NEAR HERE&lt;br/&gt;N 38° 23.768 W 122° 51.803&lt;br/&gt;PARKING - Please park near the mailboxes and walk in - only a few hundred feet.</groundspeak:long_description>

Always a Crook. 

Here lays an unknown Crook to you and me. His name is a double whammy! For more than 100 years he has rested here waiting for you to visit. Come and share his stash of goodies! Antique glass Piggy Bank for FTF.

the terrain rating is due to the lack of even pavement but may be accessible by chair. could be a tough reach though.

Any speculated references to this Crook being a crook are unfactual and merely for fun and games. I sure hope he doesn't get upset with me!!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This placement is a small Ammo Can that travelled to the top of Mt. St Helena on the trailpuppy memorial hike last month. Its purpose was initially to be the container for that cache. Well, once at the top, it was noted that there no less than four other ammo cans in the crowd and they were all bigger! So..  Back down the mountain it goes to show up here on another little hill dwarfed by St. Helena off in the distance.

The trail to get to this cache will not be an easy one to find if you go the same way I did. I came in from the North off Marsh Trail but ventured South at one of the switchbacks only to find a hidden trail that used to be a road by the looks of it. Anyway, follow this road on up to the trail that takes you to the top of a knoll near N38 25.150 W122 37.900 that overlooks Santa Rosa and the Bennett Valley. Take a look around, this is a great area to take some pictures. From there follow your GPS. The trail narrows and eventually you will find a gate and fence separating the parklands from private property. DO NOT CROSS THE FENCE. Take a break right here though. I sure needed one.
Just around to the left, you will spot a narrow trail that will take you to the Bennett Rest Stop or some alien crop circle made of stone at 38 24.795 122 37.458. The trek here only took me about 1.5 hours from my parking spot on Sky Crest. Sit down and enjoy the serenity of the area. Once you're rested up go find this ammo can and sign in.

To keep this one a 2 difficulty, you will receive no hints.</groundspeak:long_description>

After a long rocky uphill bike ride I almost passed out from lack of oxygen. This shady little rest stop was in need of a good size cache so I planted a large container that will hold most items.
Take a moment to catch your breath looking for this cache and watch as other riders pass out from exhaustion as they try to peddle past this rocky mountain.</groundspeak:long_description>

This twisted sidewalk is a fun change from the norm found throughout the city. I find this path a great walk but a even better bike ride as you twist amongst the trees.
This part of the side walk is well secluded for easy access to the cache.
The open space backs up to a snooty elite housing community that are not friendly to off trail adventure. So please be quiet when looking for the cache.
Thanks to DadFish for the heads up on this placement issues.

Along the Santa Rosa Greenway Trail their are few palces to rest. We found this one when we needed to take a break after a fast paced bike ride to the down town area. 
It was here we decided to plant a evil little bugger for the cache community to try to find.
Its visable from the rock but well camoed.
Camo is a bit fragile so please be gentle.

Kenny doesn't die in this episode. And Cartman could probably find this cache without too much of a problem.

Container contains:
Small toy car
squirter fish
&quot;Snuffer Wuffer&quot; TB
&quot;Not another Micro&quot; Geocoin
Log and pencil
I forgot to put a geonote with it so maybe the FTF could put one in there for me.

Parking can be had at Doyle Park or nearer the cache there is a small parking lot but it will be full during school hours.(I believe it is a teacher parking lot)

Please return the cache exactly as found!

Have fun and good luck!

Spring Lake is a great area for summer fun and this jogging trail leads to both easy and hard caches.

I've hiked many of the trails with mixed success and have seen most of this park. One of my very first finds in 2001 is just up the hill from this easy log only cache.

Some will find it faster then others but it is designed to blend in and yet be a easy grab. Please remember to bring your own Pen

While your out there take the Rough Go.

After setting a cache along this route and finding from a fellow cacher the swarm of ticks that almost ate him alive. I decide to name this one accordingly.
The cache is located in a very secluded section of Laguna Santa Rosa along the Sebastopol creek. The cache is in a flood plane so it had to be placed above the water line.
In winter a boat will be needed but in summer you will be eaten alive.
Use plenty of tick repellent or wait until the right day and weather to make this quest to Tick Fest 2011.

A FTF Kupin of doom is awaiting the brave soul. :-)~</groundspeak:long_description>

A small road extension runs along the creek side of a waste treatment pond at the junction of Laguna creek and the Santa Rosa flood channel. This is the unpaved end of the Santa Rosa Greenway Trail.
The cache is located on a Flooded section of the creek in winter but can be reached in summer. The Pier is washed with mud and last years water line could be seen.
Their is a lot of wild life in this section of the creek trail and Bobcats hunting were seen in the early morning at this location.
Its a good place for a cache.
 A First to Find Kupin is awaiting. Enjoy the walk.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Hidden in the trees of
the Youth Community Park of Santa Rosa Ca. is a little bike play
ground where the dirt is shaped for air. Where only the Girls
ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other places
to ride in this park and once a year there is a mud fest ride
through this area but even they don’t go for this
air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to “The
Girly Jumps” A place where Xgames
could be held or might be some day. I wonder. This area was shaped
by the city for the youth in this area but I can’t find a
single story about this playground of air. Where supergirl was perfected and I bet the first
360’ back flip was tried. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;       
Ok now for why you’re here. The
Cache. GZ is right above the cache use your geosence to find the most likely place for a large
Costco trail mix container. Do everything you can to keep this
camoed to the max just like the air I
want pictures of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;       
So get out there and get some air on “The Girly
Jumps!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special Girly jumps
Kupin for the FTF on this
one.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Tales from the Crypt - A Geocachers story...
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Many years ago I was visiting the Mt. Olivet Cemetery in my home
town of Terra Linda with two of my friends. Shortly after paying
respects to my father who had been laid to rest there some 15 years
earlier, three of us walked about admiring the crypts and tombs in
the moonlight. Oh.. Did I mention that it was about 2:00 AM?
Well... to make a long story short, my two friends just happened to
be aspiring singers! Well, I really did not know just how good the
were in song so they decided to show me. The began an incredible
harmonic &quot;Don't try suicide&quot; by Queen. Needless to say, I was blown
away! As I stood there with my jaw somewhere near my belt line we
heard a rather peculiar sound from the tree area below...
&lt;p&gt;Apparently a (mall) security guard from Northgate was not
exactly where he should have been at 2:00 AM and was startled awake
by the singing - And he he must not have been very comfortable with
the singing emanating and reverberating from the crypts above where
he was trying to take a nap and he took off in QUITE the hurry!!!
Well, true story and all, this really has very little to do with a
cache in a similar cemetery so far to the north but it had me
thinking. This is not an ALR cache as they are no longer permitted
but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not share a little Cemetery story with us in your logs. Be
it comical, serious, or even just a fond or fearful memory, we'd
all love to hear about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be looking for a Decon at ground level nowhere near a
grave in this nice quiet little corner of Mt. Olive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no posted hours but use your good sense to visit at a
time where you can enjoy all of the sights (and sounds) of this
peaceful place.&lt;/p&gt;
By the way, the main gates are always closed. You access the
cemetery another 200 feet to the SW of the main gate.
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and be safe!&lt;/p&gt;
Favorite log so far:
&lt;p&gt;June 25 by mytachem (3081 found) After arriving in kilt et al to
pipe at a graveside service for someone I didn't know, I noticed
the vault ready to be placed in the grave by several nearby workers
and also some on-lookers standing, waiting for the service. I began
to play my soul out : &quot;Going Home&quot;, &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot;,
&quot;Amazing Grace&quot;. I felt I had provided a wonderful send-off. I paid
my respects and slowly walked away. Then I heard a nearby on-looker
turn to another and say, &quot;Well, I've been putting in septic tanks
for 30 years, and I've never seen anything like this before!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">At my grandmother's grave the service was over but no one was leaving. Finally the grave diggers started filling in the grave thinking this would encourage the family to move onto the wake. Instead the great grandchildren (all 10+) ran forward and waved like the were waving a Mickey Mouse at Disneyland cooing &quot;Bye Bye Grandma!&quot; The grave digger's jaws dropped as they paused until the family gathered up the young ones. It was time to celebrate the Matriarch of a loving family with a BBQ, swimming and fun loving stories of her 90 year long life on familial hallowed grounds. I love you Mama. May you be dancing to Nat King Cole in Popeye's arms while Popeye sings full lunged and off-tune. Life after death MUST be good.</groundspeak:text>

Named for the alder trees growing around the springs. The post office at this site 19 miles northwest of Elk Creek on the Alder Springs Road, was changed from Oriental to Alder Springs on November 20, 1917, but discontinued on June 15, 1940.

Alder Springs was the home of the Mendocino Hotshots, established in 1941.  The cache is located outside the entrance and obviously you will not where to find this pill bottle.  BYOP</groundspeak:long_description>

The Tehama Colusa Canal is 110 miles long and serves 14 water districts. The system was designed to divert water from the Sacramento River into the settling basin by virtue of a dam across the Sacramento River located in Red Bluff, California. And although the system operated in this manner for some years, environmental concerns and regulatory requirements have altered the operational practices of the dam. Where, at one time, the dam could be counted on to divert water as early as March, current regulations generally prevent the dam gates from being lowered until May 15th.

To overcome this limitation and provide water to irrigators, the Bureau of Reclamation installed three pumps in the latter half of the 1990's, each with a capacity of between 80 and 100 cfs (cubic feet per second), with provisions for the placement of a fourth pump. The installation of the fourth pump occurred in 2006. However, irrigation demand can reach between 800 and a 1000 cfs before May 15th, when the dam becomes operational.

To overcome this limitation, current practice is to dam up Stony Creek in Orland and back flow water through canal gates that were actually intended to let water out of the canal into Stony Creek. Between the pumps on the Sacramento River at Red Bluff, and the reverse flow diversion at Stony Creek, the demands of irrigators have been met, but generally without any reserve.</groundspeak:long_description>

There a bunch of mailboxes, just turn up the road and follow the main road till your gps says stop! Congratulations daveydude and Freedon Queen on being FTF. I put in a few goodies.

Cruised through Jacksonville and snatched up a few new ones on the way.  Had a great time of sliding the car sideways, blowing through puddles and making rooster tails, screaming at enormous lizzards, running and shoving each other to find the caches first and much more!

BYOP.   VERY SMALL pulloff area, but you may have to walk a little.  Originally I had this cache inside the city limits, but because of the train rule, I had to move this just a few hundred yards outside the city limits.

Nearly 9 months ago I made my first cache find, Conde Creek Road. I haven't stopped since. Over 600 caches later and still going strong. I decided I needed to hide a cache near my beloved first find in hopes of getting some of the city cachers out into the woods where the good caches are!</groundspeak:long_description>

A'vast Ye mateys! Arrrr! My name be Scurvy Joe Watson, the most cut throat and blood thirsty pirate that ever sailed the high seas! I've been gathering my swag now for many a fortnight and have come to port in this here fair valley. Shiver me timbers, I had been here long before I was hornswaggled by me old mates after me treasure. They had a hempen halter all stung up and waiting for me, but I wasn't ready to dance the hempen jig just yet. I put some led from my musket into their dungbies and made my escape. I'm just glad were to far inland for the picaroons to make me walk the plank!
Its become to dangerous 'round here for me and my treasure so I had to hide it, but in all the chaos I forgot where I hid it. Thats where ye landlubbers come in. I've hidden clue to the where abouts of me treasure 'round the valley. Problem is I can't remember where they are either or even what they are. You'd think I would have used clues I could easily remember. So All hands Ahoy! get out there and find me treasure!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>clues: even if we can't remember maybe our sub-conscience secretly does. Might come out in a story. Cache placement: scrub oaks near some powerlines</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Wow!  &quot;A new speed caching run&quot; you may think.  But before you bolt out the door and fly like a bird from your nest to Old Stage road, you may want to remember who placed these caches!  Yup, you're right!  So, drop in a stick of gum and slow your roll for these dEVILed eggs. After looking for a while, you may feel as dumb as a rock; just say, &quot;Rats!&quot; and move on the next cache.  Be careful when sticking your hands in dark places; spiders and snakes have been known to bite! Lastly, you'll probably need some music, so we'd recommend &quot;Brick House&quot; by the Commodores.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This IS the Great Amazing Cache! This is a 15 stage Multi-Cache.  You must find the first 14 stages in order to reach the Log Book.

This cache covers about 1.5 to 2 miles of distance in downtown urban Central Point.  There are several twists and turns, which we've spent the last year making.  There might be things you see, that aren't as real as they appear.  
You are going to want to write EVERYTHING down.  You don't want to dismiss anything, otherwise, you may be going back!
On many of the stages, you will not have to open the container.  You just need to write down everything you can see.  One more thing, there are some &quot;bad&quot; coordinates too that will take you to the wrong places, so watch out for those as well!  GOOD LUCK!
This cache is out for the Great Amazing Caching event on July 16th, 2011.  Once the event is over, you will be able to go out there and find it.  Take your time, or this cache may swallow you whole!  The question truly is...DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES to finish the Great Amazing Cache?!

Wow!  &quot;A new speed caching run&quot; you may think.  But before you bolt out the door and fly like a bird from your nest to Old Stage road, you may want to remember who placed these caches!  Yup, you're right!  So, drop in a stick of gum and slow your roll for these dEVILed eggs. After looking for a while, you may feel as dumb as a rock; just say, &quot;Rats!&quot; and move on the next cache.  Be careful when sticking your hands in dark places; spiders and snakes have been known to bite! Lastly, you'll probably need some music, so we'd recommend &quot;Brick House&quot; by the Commodores.

BTW, many of these will be 5's and few would probably be 6's in difficulty.  3 on Terrain in case someone falls in the creek, at least it will be worth it!  (Psst, one of the Mysterious Finders placed it for me...he he he)</groundspeak:long_description>

Wow! &quot;A new speed caching run&quot; you may think. But before you bolt out the door and fly like a bird from your nest to Old Stage road, you may want to remember who placed these caches! Yup, you're right! So, drop in a stick of gum and slow your roll for these dEVILed eggs. After looking for a while, you may feel as dumb as a rock; just say, &quot;Rats!&quot; and move on the next cache. Be careful when sticking your hands in dark places; spiders and snakes have been known to bite! Lastly, you'll probably need some music, so we'd recommend &quot;Brick House&quot; by the Commodores.

Wow! &quot;A new speed caching run&quot; you may think. But before you bolt out the door and fly like a bird from your nest to Old Stage road, you may want to remember who placed these caches! Yup, you're right! So, drop in a stick of gum and slow your roll for these dEVILed eggs. After looking for a while, you may feel as dumb as a rock; just say, &quot;Rats!&quot; and move on the next cache. Be careful when sticking your hands in dark places; spiders and snakes have been known to bite! Lastly, you'll probably need some music, so we'd recommend &quot;Brick House&quot; by the Commodores.

Decided I was going to set them out on Tolo Rd this time.  Just so everyone knows, there are cachers who are replacing the caches in more conspicous and easier positions.  This makes a true 5 rating cache more like a 1 or 2.  Please replace these caches exactly as you found them so everyone can have fun finding these!  Also, 2 of the special Diablo cache containers have gone missing, one of which could only have been a cacher.  Please respect these caches and know that you are looking for HARD caches in this series!</groundspeak:long_description>

Wow! &quot;A new speed caching run&quot; you may think. But before you bolt out the door and fly like a bird from your nest to Old Stage road, you may want to remember who placed these caches! Yup, you're right! So, drop in a stick of gum and slow your roll for these dEVILed eggs. After looking for a while, you may feel as dumb as a rock; just say, &quot;Rats!&quot; and move on the next cache. Be careful when sticking your hands in dark places; spiders and snakes have been known to bite! Lastly, you'll probably need some music, so we'd recommend &quot;Brick House&quot; by the Commodores.

Wow! &quot;A new speed caching run&quot; you may think. But before you bolt out the door and fly like a bird from your nest to Old Stage road, you may want to remember who placed these caches! Yup, you're right! So, drop in a stick of gum and slow your roll for these dEVILed eggs. After looking for a while, you may feel as dumb as a rock; just say, &quot;Rats!&quot; and move on the next cache. Be careful when sticking your hands in dark places; spiders and snakes have been known to bite! Lastly, you'll probably need some music, so we'd recommend &quot;Brick House&quot; by the Commodores.

Decided I was going to set them out on Tolo Rd this time.  Just so everyone knows, there are cachers who are replacing the caches in more conspicous and easier positions.  This makes a true 5 rating cache more like a 1 or 2.  Please replace these caches exactly as you found them so everyone can have fun finding these!  Also, 2 of the special Diablo cache containers have gone missing, one of which could only have been a cacher.  Please respect these caches and know that you are looking for HARD caches in this series!</groundspeak:long_description>

Decided I was going to set them out on Tolo Rd this time.  Just so everyone knows, there are cachers who are replacing the caches in more conspicous and easier positions.  This makes a true 5 rating cache more like a 1 or 2.  Please replace these caches exactly as you found them so everyone can have fun finding these!  Also, 2 of the special Diablo cache containers have gone missing, one of which could only have been a cacher.

Just so everyone knows, there are cachers who are replacing the caches in more conspicous and easier positions. This makes a true 5 rating cache more like a 1 or 2. Please replace these caches exactly as you found them so everyone can have fun finding these! Also, 2 of the special Diablo cache containers have gone missing, one of which could only have been a cacher. Please respect these caches and know that you are looking for HARD caches in this series!</groundspeak:long_description>

Roosevelt Elk The Roosevelt Elk is the largest of all elk species. A mature bull can weigh up to 1,000 pounds where a mature cow can weigh up to 600 pounds. Roosevelt elk are found in Oregon and Washington but some inhabit northern California and British Columbia. The Roosevelt Elk is darker than the American elk and some say they are the toughest species to hunt because they often don't bugle as much as American elk. The terrain they live in can be extremely rugged and wet because many of them inhabit the rain forest located in Oregon. The greatest difference between Roosevelt elk and Rocky Mountain elk is in their habits and distribution. Roosevelt elk choose to live in the rain forests of the Pacific coast. They prefer the logged and burned over areas of the coastal mountains and the western slope of the Cascades. Upon finding an area which meets their needs they spend their entire lives there</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A fairly simple multi-stage find with a bit of local history tossed into the mix. I've recently recalculated the math for the cache and hopefully this will make the find a little easier.

This is our first cache and was inspired by a confluence of events when we read a local newspaper article that mentioned the well known Willamette Meteorite, now residing in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. However, we found out that this 15 1/2 ton meteorite, the largest ever found in the United States, was discovered and began its not so humble journey to NYC very near where we used to walk our dog, Maia, almost daily.

The coordinates above will take you to a local historical marker that most people drive right by without notice. Take a look at this marker and read it carefully so you can answer the questions below to find the next coordinates and the cache at the site near where the Willamette Meteorite, known as &quot;Tomonowos&quot; or &quot;The Heavenly Visitor&quot; by the local Native Americans, was found in 1902. The local parks department is soon to place some displays regarding the Willamette Meteorite in the meadow near this cache. Go explore and learn about it!</groundspeak:long_description>

have read of Perle Mesta, the 1950’s Washington D.C. hostess with
the mostest. Another cache dedicated to Perle is GC NKZ9. Perle is
having another party and needs to make sure she has all the
ingredients to make it successful. Her liquor cabinet is well
stocked with all the cordials, flavorings and garnishes needed to
make any cocktail desired. Her staff’s main concern is that they
have all the right stock of alcoholic liquids. Perle has given the
butler a list of guests and their favorite drinks. From this list
he needs to purchase the correct liquor. Here is the note from
Perle. Huge Reilly Kares, Governor of California drinks only Colt
45 Malt Liquor. The Director of Housing, Fannie Mae is a real
boozer and will ask for Beal's Cocktail, Suissesse Cocktail, and a
Baltimore Bracer. And that divine Mr. Bello Uomo, the Italian
Ambassador, likes a Bellini. Of course the Mexican Ambassador,
Pedro Cuervo will ask for Mexicola. We must prepare Blarney Stone
Cocktail for the Speaker of the House, Mi-Mhacantact. CIA Director,
I.M. Espy drinks both the Moscow Mule and Ping Pong Cocktails.
Rumour has it that Movie Director, Red D. Action drinks a lot and
prefers Widow's Dream Cocktail and Mint Highballs. Leylys
Gutierrez, the wonderful ambassador from Peru, will prefer Pisco
Sour. The Australian Adjunct General, Sidney Arbor, will ask for
that awful Kangaroo Cocktail and Vice Admiral Bleu Waters will
naturally drink the Commodore Cocktail. Last but least, IRS
Director, B. Lud Sucker will want his Income Tax Cocktail. Go to
the determined coordinates. Travel 50 feet at a 25 degree magnetic
north bearing and find the cache. BE EXTREMELY STEALTHY AND BRING
YOUR OWN PEN.

This is Team Pals first Cache. It fits it's name because it is located where my neighborhood ends and the forest begins again. If you park at the appropriate cords and walk east you will find a small path through the berry bushes. Once through the berries you will be on your way. The cache is small but big enough to hold small trade items, TB's and coins. Have fun. </groundspeak:long_description>

The animal is known only from a partial skull, which displays unusual features, such as structures indicating sensitive hearing.

This is another cache put out for my daughter (little dinogirl) who obviously loves dinosaurs.

This cache shouldn't be to hard to find. It is just a few steps off the pavement.

Don't try and enter the park from Cambridge Dr as that entrance is no longer available.

You can get to this area from Durham City Park , Cook Park or Tualatin Community Park.

While here enjoy all the other caches in the park.

YOU DO NOT NEED TO GET NEAR THE RR TRACKS THE CACHE IS NOT THERE.

The tracks are fenced in and there is a paved park trail that goes under them.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True"> The Natterjack Toad is a toad native to Northern Europe. Adults are distinguished from the common toad by a yellow line down the middle of the back. They have relatively long legs, and this gives them a distinctive gait, contrasting with the hopping movement of many other toad species.They can live up to 15 years.

This should be a fairly easy cache.
It is a dreaded nano.
Enjoy the view from this lookout location.
You can enter this part of the park from any of the three parks located around it Cook Park , Tualatin Community Park or Durham City Park.

In 1853, Samuel Galbreath began a ferry service crossing the Tualatin River from

a village he called &quot;Galbreath&quot;. The town's name was changed to &quot;Bridgeport&quot;
when Galbreath built the first bridge across the Tualatin River in 1856.

Located along one of the first &quot;improved&quot; roads, Boone's Ferry Road, Bridgeport thrived
by attracting business from Portland throughout the Willamette Valley. The
Community's accommodations were simple: a blacksmith shop, boarding house,
general store, and saloon.

In 1886, the Portland &amp; Willamette Railway Company purchased a right-of-way
through John Sweek's land on the Tualatin River's west bank opposite Bridgeport.

Profiting from the sale, Sweek took advantage of the railroad's location and
platted a town around the depot - he called the new town Tualatin.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True"> Xiaosaurus ( Zhou-SAWR-us ) was a small plant eating dinosaur. It ran on 2 legs with its tail held stiffly out behind him. Its name means little reptile and its head would have come up to an adult human's knee.

I decided to name a few caches after dinosaurs since my daughter little dinogirl loves them.

This cache is located in a nice park with paved trails. There is a dirt path leading to the cache about 70 ft off the paved trail.There may be alot of signal bounce due to tree coverage.

Don't try to enter the park from Cambridge Dr that entrance is now closed off. While here enjoy the other caches in the park.

You may also enter the park from Cook Park or Tualatin Community Park.

Please rehide this cache with the provided cover or rehide better so the muggles don't see it.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>  
Look for an obvious hiding spot. Think tree center. </groundspeak:encoded_hints>

social issues, and economic conditions regarding their local city. One day a 
trio of winos spent many hours discussing and debating such topics right here at 
this pond.

    Now please do not stereotype a wino. This trio came from very educated 
backgrounds. One had a degree in metallurgy, the second had a degree in 
mycology, and the last was a geologist.

    However, they were winos, and when the debate ended all they could agree 
upon was to start up a flea circus for the conditions seemed right for such an 
endeavor.

coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;To qualify and to claim this find
you need to create a public bookmark, which lists a minimum of 15
found cache titles that refer to ornithology or list the 15 caches
in your log.&lt;br/&gt;
You can use
rooster, hen and chick, as well as generic bird names; ie. Robin,
Dove, etc.&lt;br/&gt;
#2 For The Birds
Challenge will follow so keep your bookmark list for future use.
Don't forget to bring a pen to sign the log. Best access is from
Fischer
Road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wizard inadvertently put me onto this clever and ingeniously
evil idea for a challenge, and I am now sharing with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to log this cache you must have posted 50 DNF logs that
are rated 1.5/1.5 or lower D/T rating OR 100 DNF logs of D/T rating
3.0/3.0 or lower, and bookmark your list with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) The &quot;GC&quot; code/cache name; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) What date the DNF was logged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will verify and confirm with you via e-mail that you have met
the criteria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF will have an unactivated coin at the following CGA monthly
event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

A large congrats and a huge thank you to Lady
Orca on FTF!&lt;br/&gt;

So you drain your savings and find ways to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's what Jim Wizer did 80 years ago when he opened Wizer's Fine Foods in Portland, Oregon. That store closed in 1947 and a new location was opened in Lake Oswego, Oregon in 1948. Wizer's relocated to a new facility in 1960 where it is currently located and remains family owned and operated serving fourth generation customers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our family shopped here for years and our son even held his first job here until they closed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now that they have closed their Lake Grove location we felt it was time to place a cache nearby. The original location is still in downtown Lake Oswego, however, the Lake Grove location is now empty and very lonely. This cache includes a twist for us. So put on your thinking cap, follow the GPS to GZ and have fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BYOP there isn't one in the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please replace the cache just as you found it so the next cacher can enjoy this hide the same as you did.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We went to check on this one and decided to leave the cache in a postion to make it easier to access until the cold weather is over. So for now no superhuman strength required. </groundspeak:long_description>

Since we are visiting from the area, we don't know the local cachers so apologize in advance if we are suffering delusions or signing log sheets while sleep walking.  Oh Thank Heaven, we found it and across from where the big event was held.

Your cache is greatly appreciated!  [:D]

This was a favorite area for me as a kid growing up fishing here all the time.  It does not exist anymore, but the memories are still with me.  This is an easy walk from a small parking spot.  You are looking for an ammo box.  It is not the traditional green.  I redid the entire box to help celebrate my first hide.  I hope you like it.  As always, please rehide as to the muggle activity looks to be high.  Good hunting</groundspeak:long_description>

For those who had discovered my ‘Prevent POO-LUTION' (GC1HKVT), which is now archived, should be very familiar with this hide. You can grab this cache from the side walk and the container is only small enough for the log. 
Stay on the sidewalk and do not go behind the chain link fence.

THIS SPOT IS A VERY HIGH TRAFFIC MUGGLE ZONE, SO PLEASE PRACTICE THE VERY BEST OF GEOCACHING ETHICS.

Parking is available along SE Salquist RD. Some bushwhacking on the trail may be required. This spot will be very wet and muddy during the rainy seasons. I would recommend that you use the compass mode for better navigation because the canopy of the trees will affect your GPSr signal. 

The cache is a Loc-N-Loc type container located down a small trail that starts at the east end. It is hidden among the trees and near Kelly Creek. It is large enough to trade small TB's and coins. If you use the hint then please tell me in your log so I can better the cache.

Stay to the right of the black cloth construction fence, the west side is private property. I would recommend that you use the compass mode for better navigation because the canopy of the trees will affect your GPSr signal. There are lots of vines and a creek side nearby so be careful. 

I was inspired to build this cache after finding one very similar up North on Camano Isl. Called Hydro-Oboe (GCQK1K). I didn’t want to copy it so I tried to build one just a little bit different, I hope you enjoy it. 
I have placed a bucket next to the cache but YOU MAY WANT TO BRING YOUR OWN BUCKET OR AT LEAST ONE GALLON OF WATER WITH YOU just in case my bucket has disappeared or the creek has dried up. Oh yes, and don’t forget to bring something to write with and please POST SOME PICTURES if you can. ***DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN THE CACHE CAP*** Just finger tight will work. It a real bear to remove when it gets screwed on too tight.

Finally, please let me know if there are problems with either the cache or its coordinates. The hint is a spoiler and explains what you need to do to retrieve the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

You will find a Loc-N-Loc container that I have set up to trade awareness items. These items can be coins, bugs or material that will bring awareness to your favorite charity or cause. 
THIS SPOT IS A HIGH TRAFFIC MUGGLE ZONE, SO PLEASE PRACTICE THE VERY BEST OF GEOCACHING ETHICS.

This is a small tupperware container about 7 x 7 x 3 with a pink lid.  Please note that there is absolutely no direct freeway access to this cache.  You will want to follow the dead-end road from a residential neighborhood.

There are cement barriers that restrict driving right up to the cache.  There are places to park along the street and you can hike in.  The walk is less than 1/4 mile.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Green Day was originally part of the punk scene at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases for the independent record label Lookout! Records earned it a grassroots fanbase. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime, The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac, Nimrod, and Warning did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status. Its rock opera American Idiot (2004) reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009.

Few other bands have had such political inluence in the late 90's and 2000's than Green Day. With their carefully sewn lyrics and calls for action; they have brought anti-war sentiment back into mainstream music for the first time since the 60's.

Urban legend has it that when an intern uploaded Green Day music onto President Bush's iPod, he listened to one song, and threw the iPod into the Potomac.

Have fun, and good luck! </groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is magnetic and is hidden at the base of the large green box that lays near the center of the garden. The cache holds a logbook, and there is room for some very small items. Good luck, and have fun!</groundspeak:long_description>

Tips and hints: 1) For the listed location, think cat height. 2) My cat can jump really high. 3) My cat has a nature allergy, so she can't go anywhere near plants. 4) I accidentally dropped my cat in a vat of radioactive waste awhile back, thus she is now magnetic. 

ALSO A LETTERBOX-HYBRID! So feel free to stamp your own personal logbook with the stamp in the cache, but please, do not take the stamp! Good luck, and have fun! Do you have a cat? If so, post an picture of him/her to keep my cat company!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
A few words of advice on this cache series:
&lt;p&gt;1) Muggles, Muggles everywhere so your best stealth is
required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Rehide the container as good or better than you found
it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Did I mention MUGGLES?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) If a cache is unobtainable due to muggle infestation then
please come back for it on a future attempt. Hiding them is a joy
for me, replacing a container is not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am taking this opportunity to introduce some of my own five
star evil into the Portland metro area. This one is in the spirit
of some other difficult micro caches in the area. I have enjoyed
making three or four trips back to hunt some of the really &quot;crazy&quot;/
&quot;Vicious&quot; and &quot;Shady&quot; micros... ACTUALLY I have not enjoyed making
the return trips back at all... I was lying about that...and I have
wished harm on all of these cache owners at times for these
monstrously hard to find caches... I guess some might enjoy the
headache they get from a lengthy search and the thought of a DNF
failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I despise impossible hides and yet I find myself in the middle
of the night making these ugly little nightmarish devices. This
sign only micro was slated to be a hard 3.5 star difficulty
however, while searching for a suitable location, I came across
this area and had a much more wicked idea of how to arrange this
one. I am not providing a description of the container nor will I
be giving a hint. I will tell you that the container is
approximately two inches wide and six inches tall at its widest
points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an added irritation, light tree cover may play with your
GPSr signal a bit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coords are taken from a 2100 average.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to bring a pen to sign the log.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muggles may be present at times making this one impossible to
hunt...this only adds to the challenge. Due to the location and
nature of this hide, please rehide this one as well as or better
than you found it. This will insure that it will have staying power
and it will also make the next hunter &quot;earn their five stars&quot;. I
hope you enjoy this extremely frustrating and horribly devious
micro as much as I had altering it and placing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scream, curse, stamp your feet, throw a tantrum...if it makes
you feel better...but it will not help you find it...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE DO NOT GIVE HINTS OR SPOILERS IN YOUR LOGS! I DO NOT WANT
TO DELETE ANYONE, HOWEVER, IF YOU DO, I WILL BE FORCED TO REMOVE
THE LOG TO PROTECT THE SPIRIT AND INTEGRITY OF THE CACHE. ALSO, I
WILL BE CHECKING THE LOG SHEET OFTEN SO PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR
NAME IS ON IT BEFORE POSTING A FIND! AGAIN, IF YOU DO NOT SIGN THE
LOG, I WILL BE FORCED TO REMOVE YOUR FIND.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you hunt this one and do not find it, please post a DNF log
for every seperate visit. I would like to keep track of it
all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
A few words of advice on this cache series:
&lt;p&gt;1) Muggles, Muggles everywhere so your best stealth is
required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Re-hide the container as good or better than you found
it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Did I mention MUGGLES?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) If a cache is unobtainable due to muggle infestation then
please come back for it on a future attempt. Hiding them is a joy
for me, replacing a container is not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the location and nature of this hide, please re-hide this
one as well as or better than you found it. This will ensure that
it will have staying power. Scream, curse, stamp your feet, throw a
tantrum...if it makes you feel better...but it will not help you
find it...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE DO NOT GIVE HINTS OR SPOILERS IN YOUR LOGS! I DO NOT WANT
TO DELETE ANYONE, HOWEVER, IF YOU DO, I WILL BE FORCED TO REMOVE
THE LOG TO PROTECT THE SPIRIT AND INTEGRITY OF THE CACHE. ALSO, I
WILL BE CHECKING THE LOG SHEET OFTEN SO PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR
NAME IS ON IT BEFORE POSTING A FIND! AGAIN, IF YOU DO NOT SIGN THE
LOG, I WILL BE FORCED TO REMOVE YOUR FIND.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The name should be the only clue you need unless you approach it from the West side. There is parking at the 201st Ave. access. I do not recommend parking on the shoulder of I-84 this is a dangerous highway. There really is no parking on the 181st Ave. side either.

Come to find out, both this one and the other were hidden in 2009 so I'm guessing this is why I wasn't able to find them. I'm guessing this is long gone but if you know otherwise then please let me know.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Old Shipwreck conceals cache, surrounded by aliens. Use this cache
to exchange state quarters.

On November 25th, 1852 the iron ribbed schooner, Machigone
(pronounced Ma-CHIG-oh-nee) left Fort Vancouver laden with goods
from the Hudson's Bay Company. She never reached her destination.
While crossing the Columbia bar, a mighty gale blasted the ship.
The crew fought valiantly but the ship broke apart in the swells
and 9 of the crew perished including the captain, Horace Simpson of
Astoria. The gale blew for several days growing into a hugh storm
of typhoon proportions. Tremendous flooding washed the remains of
the ship many miles inland where it lay buried for over 100 years.
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1969, James Harrison, a building contractor working in N
Portland discovered an old piece of iron ribbing in the area where
he was digging a foundation. Further excavation revealed the
twisted remains of the Machigone. Harrison had an interest in
history and a flair for art so he supervised cleaning up the
remains of the old ship leaving most of it right where he found it.
It remains there today, a monument to the brave sea captains who
plied the dangerous waters of the Pacific bringing commerce to the
NW. Its rusty iron ribs and keel are a testimony to the skill of
American ship builders of that era. Ironically, the only survivor
of the shipwreck was the ship's doctor, William Kaiser
Albright.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Find the ship, then find the cache. Beware, aliens are abundant
during weekdays, scarce on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is a duplex container, two M&amp;M's taped together. In
one side is a log. In the other side is a stack of quarters.
&lt;p&gt;Find the cache and sign the log then add one or more quarters to
the other container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the coin container is FULL then it is your turn to help the
homeless. Take all the quarters except for one and then do
something creative with the rest to help the homeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't think of anything to do, just look around and you
will see some transients near by hitch hiking or pan handling. You
could just hand them the stack and call it good. It would be better
if you found something more creative but that is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU DO NOT HAVE TO OPEN ANY DANGEROUS LOOKING CONTAINERS TO FIND
THE CACHE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache has been resurrected once again from Muggledome.
Please make sure you hide it completely out of site. There is a
black backup cache hidden there two. It has no quarters.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

My lil family and I went on out there to try and find it and looked for a good half hour with no avail. Very dissappointed since we only went for two that haven't been found yet and could find either one....  
I wonder if you could email me any hints or if you've been back there since you placed it.
I really want a FTF and was hoping this would be the first. Oh well, had fun anyway other than the wifey getting eaten by the bugs :)</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Gardner Oaks Park. Navigation Pinball.

This cache is located in one of Battle Ground's many undeveloped
parks. Someday this land will be a beautiful place with lovely oak
trees. The park is a little hard to get to because no access has
been developed and it is surrounded by either fields, fences, or
houses. I asked the city officials if it was OK to use the park for
hiking, etc, and they said it is fine to do so. There is a No
Trespassing sign posted near the city water well, so stay away from
that area. Since the park is large, that is no problem. You can
park at the end of SW 12th Street and walk through a gate into the
park.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
For this cache you need to have a simple magnetic compass. Most any
kind will do, but the best ones have some kind of sighting device
on them to allow you to site a course and accurately read off the
degrees. I used an old Korean War vintage army surplus compass with
a flip-up site and glass eyepiece to sight the courses. My GPS has
a magnetic compass built into it but I find that it is easier to
use the army surplus compass. If you use a electronic compass, make
sure it is set to MAGNETIC, not TRUE.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is medium size and dark in color. To find the cache you
have to play &quot;Pinball Oaks&quot; and YOU are the ball.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Start at the coordinates shown above. Stand on the path next to the
fence post in front of the ditch and get out your compass. Follow
these directions to ricochet to the cache. The pacing is not really
necessary since each heading leads to a tree, but pacing provides a
nice cross check on your direction.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
1. Sight a course of 242 Degrees and walk 74 paces to a &quot;Small
Oak.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
2. Sight a course of 340 Degrees and walk 63 paces to the &quot;Twin
Oaks.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
3. Sight a course of 202 Degrees and walk 51 paces to a &quot;Lone
Oak.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
4. Sight a course of 276 Degrees and walk 68 paces to a &quot;Crooked
Oak.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
5. Sight a course of 42 Degrees and walk 26 paces to a &quot;Wounded
Oak.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
6. Sight a course of 270 Degrees and walk 52 paces to a &quot;Roped
Oak.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
7. Sight a course of 323 Degrees and walk 54 paces to a &quot;LARGE
Oak.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
8. Sight a course of 34 Degrees and walk 14 paces to a &quot;Straight
Oak.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
9. Sight a course of 124 Degrees and walk 15 paces to the
Cache&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is easier than it sounds. Please report the condition of the
cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The park is rather slushy during rainy season, but it is normally
dry in summer.
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a magnetic key locker. Please replace it
correctly USING the magnet. This cache has a serious muggle problem
so place it completely out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: TCGPEA - Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

Well, its not so easy anymore. You are looking for a capsule about
the size of a bison.
&lt;p&gt;This park is not very well known. I call it Dorky Park, because
it is sort of a dorky park. What do you think? It is big enough for
one family to have a picnic and almost large enough for you to play
frisbee with your Chihuahua. There is a scenic stream and a nice
footbridge. There is also a nice view of the backside of several
houses. Believe it or not, they used to have a tiny baseball
diamond here with permanent bases and a pitcher's mound. When I say
tiny I mean there was about 30 feet between 1st and 3rd.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is a clean cache. No need to get wet or dirty. Beware of
spying eyes from every direction. It is within reach of the path
but hard to spot.&lt;br/&gt;

This is probably the best view point in SW Washington. On the map
it is called Lookout Mountain and it used to have a fire tower on
it. Go to this cache on a clear day and you can see Mt. St Helens,
Mt. Rainier, Mt. Adams, Mt. Hood, Mt Jefferson and The Sisters.
Rainier appears very bold next to Helens.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cache is a 50 Caliber Ammo Box. An easy find.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is dedicated to my dog who is buried up here. She was
the best dog I ever had.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To get to the cache:&lt;br/&gt;
Turn right through the camping area at sunset falls and cross a
bridge, then turn left onto the forest road. Follow this road until
you get to N45.48.143 W122.06.833. This is the turn off to the
cache. Now...decide if you want to drive up to the cache or
walk...it is 1.04 miles uphill all the way. There is NO turn around
until you get to the top. The road is steep and rocky and bumpy. I
recommend taking a 4 wheel drive vehicle, but I once made it up
there in my Chevy Suburban with 2 wheel drive. Good ground
clearance is the key. The climb is from 3440 to 4206 elevation. Due
to the elevation, this cache may be blocked by snow at times.
During the winter you can take a northern route to this cache by
going straight at sunset falls and following the main road past
Cougar Rock, then follow the fork to the right. A map of the forest
is handy. The forest roads are pretty nice gravel. It looks like a
long way, but it is actually only 34 driving miles from the center
of Battle Ground and well worth the trip.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

This is a beautiful, round, volcanic crater lake surrounded by tall
trees. In this 280 acre park there are 10 miles of hiking trails
and bike trails, 5 miles of horse trails. In addition, there are
picnic, play and camping areas. Park in the main parking lot at the
state park. There is no longer a fee.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also park on a side road at 45.47.962, 122.30.036, then
walk through the horse parking area, across the field and down the
trail.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Tree cover might mess with your GPS especially on a cloudy day.
Look for a very large fire damaged tree about 30 feet uphill from
the lowest trail but the cache is not at the tree.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is a 50 Cal. ammo can with lot of room for goodies.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

God has seen fit to increase the difficulty of this cache so I am changing the number.  It used to be fairly easy to spot after you scrambled up the fairly steep trail.... now it is a different story.  You can stand there and stare right at it and never see it.  If you gently poke around, you'll find it.</groundspeak:text>

Watch out for stinging nettle when you find this cache.  It can be avoided if you are careful.  The cache is a, round medium sized tupperware, big enough for large travelers.  As always, beware of aliens because this is a popular trail.

Take time to hike the whole park, it is a nice one.

There is a small fee during the summer if you drive in, but you can park just outside the booth in a small parking area and walk in for free.  During the winter months there is NO parking fee and you can drive closer to the cache. </groundspeak:long_description>

This is a lovely setting in a forest park. You can camp there for a
$5.00 fee with running water, out houses, pull through sites and
tent sites. The camp ground is small. Day use parking is also $5.00
but the day use parking is rarely busy and you can probably park
long enough to find the cache with no problem. You can also park up
the road a short way and walk in for free....perfectly legal. There
is no attendant on duty.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The water here is cold and clear. Bring a swim suit if you dare,
you can jump off the falls into a beautiful clear pool of icy
mouuntain water.&lt;br/&gt;

Rated 3 for being a poor reception area and for some rocky terrain,
this cache is located in beautiful Moulton Falls Park. It is the
second in my Moulton Madness trilogy of caches and is located very
close to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GCh31b&amp;amp;Submit6=Find&quot;&gt;
&quot;Ring of Wonder&quot;&lt;/a&gt; cache.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final approach to this cache is rocky and may be slippery if
it is wet so watch your step! No cliff climbing, tree climbing or
scuba diving is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPS coverage is poor in this area so don't expect exact coords.
Accuracy showed 39' using the best of 3 gpses on a clear day. Ahh!
That's close enough just follow your nose. Think like a bat and
you'll find it. The cache is a standard ammo can. If you find
yourself bumping your head as you walk around, you are probably in
&quot;Cougar Haven&quot; not &quot;Bat Haven.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Inside the cave, look high and left.  A flashlight helps. Replace it in the same manner.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

The entry to this area is locked up during some of the winter
months, but it is a lovely area so even if it is locked up, you'll
have a nice trip. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There is a boat launch and a nice swimming area and some picnic
tables. The lake is a great place to fish, ski, sail or yak.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
From reading the logs I see that the park has now imposed a $3.00
entry fee. Some people have evaded the fee by either walking in or
by pleading with the gate attendant stating that they just want to
look the place over...a short visit. I'm enhancing the clue to keep
visits short.</groundspeak:long_description>

Posting Photos with the cache in them is ok. 

This cache is on private property.  Permission was given to place this cache here, but please respect the property and do not explore past Ground Zero and do not leave any trash.  You can park either on 200th ST E across from the cache or on 107th Ave CT E.  If you park on 200th ST E, please be very careful crossing the street, because it's a busy road.  Parking on 107th Ave CT E, is safer, but it's a little longer of a walk.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the area as heard of Cascadia it was suppose to be
the largest planned community in Washington state near Bonney Lake
but it never actually happened. Roads, a school, and 2 parks were
built but that was all that was ever done in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always thought the area was off limits but my son's school
needed remodeling this year so he was shipped off to Eismann
Elementary (in Cascadia) for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While visiting the school I noticed a sign saying there were 2
parks open to the public. I confirmed with a security guard that
the park area are open to the public during daylight hours.&lt;/p&gt;
The rest of Cascadia is off limits but the parks are open. I sure
hope they open the rest of the area one day there are over 15 miles
of nature trails that were created for the planned community and
now they are just sitting abandon
&lt;p&gt;In order to find the cache start at the posted coords and you
will find a statue. At the base of this statue you will find a
plaque. The plaque has a date which you will need to find the final
coords. If it's a sunny day from this statue you will have a
beautiful view of Mt. Rainier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
MM = A&lt;br/&gt;
DD = B&lt;br/&gt;
YYYY = C&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Add (B+B+1)/1000 to the north coordinates&lt;br/&gt;
Add (A-6)/1000 to the west coordinates&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area is only open from dawn to dusk so please be respectful
and don't go after this one at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you get stuck and need a hint feel free to send me a message or
you can always call
me.&lt;br/&gt;

FTF&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

the largest planned community in Washington state near Bonney Lake
but it never actually happened. Roads, a school, and 2 parks were
built but that was all that was ever done in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always thought the area was off limits but my son's school
needed remodeling this year so he was shipped off to Eismann
Elementary (in Cascadia) for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While visiting the school I noticed a sign saying there were 2
parks open to the public. I confirmed with a security guard that
the parks are open to the public during daylight hours.&lt;/p&gt;
The rest of Cascadia is off limits but the parks are open. I sure
hope they open the rest of the area one day there are over 15 miles
of nature trails that were created for the planned community and
now they are just sitting abandon
&lt;p&gt;Da Vinci Park is a kid friendly neighborhood park (without the
neighborhood). It's geared towards little kids which is great for
me. There are picnic tables and brand new play toys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park is only open from dawn to dusk so please be respectful
and don't go after this one at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you get stuck and need a hint feel free to send me a message or
you can always call
me.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS to road trip for another great
FTF&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Just follow the Signs to the &quot;Sky Stone&quot; when you enter the Neighborhood. There is one parking space near the park. Check out the big rock while you are here. This should be a fairly easy find for most. The container is small, just a log, pencil and a crisp $1 bill for the FTF. Stealth will be required at times. Lots of small muggles playing at the park at times.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;After his sister hid her first cache, he insisted that he needed
to have a cache too. And it needed to be full of boy stuff. So,
here's a cache filled with stuff that a boy would like. Initial
contents include a foam dart gun, some matchbox cars and, of
course, some dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located off the southern section of the Buckley
Trail. It's a nice place to come and have a picnic and listen to
the birds. Trail is paved to within 30 feet of the cache. GPS was
bouncy due to all the tree cover, but should be close.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm pretty sure they are good. As always comments on Terrain and

have been muggled. There are lots of kids in this neighborhood so
please keep an eye out I would hate to see this one get muggled.
Hopefully, this one will be a little harder to get to and should
keep them at bay.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
While the cache is available 24/7 I would not advise doing it at
night. I would hate to see someone get hurt. Even during the day
please be careful in retrieving the cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I don't think kids will be able to make it to the actual cache. Be
caution as there is a stream nearby but there is plenty of room for
them to watch someone retrieve the cache container.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you can't reach the cache, need a hint, or get stuck and can't
get down feel free to send me a message or you can always &lt;a href=&quot;http://dl.dropbox.com/u/386320/Geocaching/Gadgets/Call.html&quot;&gt;call

This is a replacement for the original cache. It is similar to the old, just relocated. There is a large turnout along side the road.  Once you find the designated &quot;fishing hole&quot;, you must then search for the means to &quot;pole&quot; out the cache.  Please return everything as you found it. There is NO NEED TO DIG. Everything you need is right there  There's $1 for the FTF.  Good Luck!</groundspeak:long_description>

Ran into fozroc who was only about a minute late I was just walking back to my car when he pulled up.  I also got to meet cougarfan75.  Nice to meet everyone love the FTF parties.

give him a fun cache. I wouldn't do this cache at night as you will
have to cross a creek about 18&quot; deep and there isn't much more then
a deer trail to follow so have fun bush whacking.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There are many different trails in this area the one I marked below
is just the one I used. If you know of a better trail feel free to
use it, but you might miss out on the fun in getting wet crossing
the creek. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The coords might be a little jumpy, but I don't think it will cause
anyone problems once you are between the 2 large Cedar trees you
shouldn't even need your GPSr. As always comments on Terrain and
Difficulty are welcome, if you come up with better coords please
post them in your logs. I will keep an eye on the comments and make
adjustments as needed.&lt;br/&gt;

birthday. Since my boys love large caches I had to come up with a
spot big enough to fit their favorite type of cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a new nature trail in Bonney Lake. The city just opened
this area to the community on Arbor Day. Here is a pretty cool
slideshow of people cleaning up the area before the opening.

birthday. Since my boys love large caches I had to come up with a
spot big enough to fit their favorite type of cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a new nature trail in Bonney Lake. The city just opened
this area to the community on Arbor Day. Here is a pretty cool
slideshow of people cleaning up the area before the opening.
(Link)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature trail is only open from dawn to dusk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a large clear lock 'n lock with a superman
on the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Happy Birthday Oliver&lt;/b&gt;

You are looking for a micro in the woods. No sense trying to deny
it. I'm really not sure about the difficulty I know for me it would
take me a while , enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The coords might be a little jumpy, I let it average for a good
long while. As always comments on Terrain and Difficulty are
welcome, if you come up with better coords please post them in your

&lt;p&gt;Viking Park is the first site for an off-leash dog park in
Bonney Lake. The fenced park is in a wooded area with a trail,
waste station, picnic tables and a water station. The fenced areas
are accessed through a double-gated entry system designed to allow
dog owners the opportunity to remove or fasten dog leashes prior to
entering or exiting the facil! ity. The dog park is open free to
the public each day from dawn until dusk. Area dog owners are
encouraged to read the rules of conduct when visiting the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area is only open from dawn to dusk so please be respectful
and don't go after this one at night.&lt;/p&gt;

place to go especially on a hot summer day. However, Bonney Lake
has 8 parks and I wanted to bring people to some of the other
lesser known parks.
&lt;p&gt;Madrona Park is a 'pocket park' at the corner of 80th St and
182nd Ave. Amenities include a half-court basketball court, play
toys, a small picnic area with water fountain, and a view of Mt.
Rainier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park is only open from dawn to dusk so please be respectful
and don't go after this one at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a small clear Lock 'n Lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;YOU MUST PARK ON THE
STREET!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The neighbors seem quite nice but they don't want you parking in
their drive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Well I have some really bad news they are converging in a rural area of Mason County. Last time I was this worried was when Fish Bait was taking over the Summit Lake area. While out walking my dog with my wife we came upon a 35mm breeder of sorts. I don't know what to make of this but after 720+ caches I am positive this is part of the Micro Epidemic we are facing today. Remember friends don't let friends hide micros!!!!!!

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: THANKS TO SOME HUNTERS, THERE IS A HUGE MESS HERE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would suggest waiting for a few weeks to let the coyotes
wander off with some of the bones and stuff sitting here. If you
dont mind it then go for it though by all means! LOL. If i can get
up there in the next few days or so i will get rid of some of the
mess.&lt;/p&gt; 

 Growing up we used to come down to play and fish under the bridge
nearby. If you want to go under the bridge be aware that it is very
steep and loose. I will not be held liable for anyone falling or
getting hurt. ( Consider yourselves warned! LOL) CONGRATS TO:

Decided to see if we could spot this freestyle.(No GPSr) Had it in hand in a matter of minutes. The darkness was the only thing that made this a longer find time. We started looking to the west a bit and made our way in the correct direction, when my geo senses started going crazy I was able to locate two dead give aways and had the cache in hand almost instantly.

We found this spot up on a dead end road near what used to be camp Corliss. The Cub scouts used the camp for end of year ceremonies. Last year all the trees were logged, and the camp went away. We were checking it out when we stumbled on the spot.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">After I told Thing One and Thing Two that we had to temporarily diasble Thing One and Thing Two are Doing it for The Kids, due to construction in the area, they wanted to go check on it. When we got there and they saw that people had been pulling at the orange barrier to get past to the cache they asked &quot;Why do grownups not know the rules? They made a huge mess of this fence! Thats not cool! Theyre going to ruin it for all of us.&quot;

Thankfully it didnt take long to refocus their energy into putting a new cache together, and getting it hidden, not far from one of their earlier hides.

Again, placed with the kiddos in mind, this cache is filled with small, fun trinkets and toys for the little ones.

Please take care to rehide the container as well or better than you found it.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Mary and Charles Curran purchased a 7.33 acre parcel of land in 1951 and transformed it into an apple orchard with 250 Gravenstein, Macintosh and Golden Delicious apple trees that quickly became a popular local landmark. The Curran's two horses, Brewster and Christopher, also enjoyed visits from local children.

In 1993, the University Place Community Council successfully obtained Conservation Futures funds from Pierce County to preserve the orchard forever as a park. Today, Volunteers from CORE (Curran Orchard Resource Enthusiasts) continue their efforts in working with the City of University Place to develop the orchard into an &quot;urban, edible&quot; outdoor classroom.

Interested people can adopt a tree for one harvest season at a time for a small fee. The adopter is encouraged to prune, thin and harvest their tree. FREE Pruning classes and trained volunteers are available to provide guidance.

The Pavilion at the orchard is a favorite spot for weddings and small gatherings, especially during beautiful Spring days like the one we chose to hide this cache.

Bring your own pen, and PLEASE make sure to cache completely.

NOTE : The apple orchard itself is a wonderful area for kids, with a small area for them to play and picnic tables. The cache itself is not the most kid friendly however.

Grabbed a brochure, look forward to reading more later. My Mom is a Master Gardener, I'll have to show her this place one of these days. Liked the stage! Bet this is a wonderful place to hang out at in the summer. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

There is little traffic on this road and it is easy enough to park along the top segment.  This cache would not be wheelchair accessible.  I have not seen a cache like this but let me know if any of you have.  BYOP!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to KC Geo Clue!

In this cache series you will find extra large bison caches that will give you clues to find the final puzzle cache. If you have ever played the game Clue, you shouldn't have any problem with this cache series. Thanks to California Cacher &quot;Winkster&quot; for allowing me to steal heavily from his idea.

King County will serve as the &quot;board&quot; for this game. There will be a series of 6 caches representing each of the Clue suspects spread throughout King County as well as the final puzzle cache. You, are the star Medina Police Detective. You have been summoned to a large mansion on the Medina waterfront  to investigate the death of Mr. Boddy, a local multi-millionaire who suddenly and tragically passed away during a dinner party. Your job as the detective will be to &quot;investigate&quot; each of the &quot;suspects&quot; (caches) when you visit the cache and log the find. Inside each suspect cache you will find information that will help you narrow down who done it, with what weapon and in what room the evil act took place. Each cache will have a laminated card with SWR numbers as well as a separate three digit number. These SWR numbers correspond to the numbers on the Detective Note Pad that is attached to each cache. The &quot;S&quot; numbers are the suspects, numbers S1 - S6 which represent the all of the game characters. On the Detective Note Pad, Ms. Scarlet, for instance is S1. The &quot;W&quot; numbers will be for the weapons, W1 - W6. The knife is W1 on the Detective Note Pad. The &quot;R&quot; numbers are the rooms, R1 - R9. The Hall is R9 on the note pad.  During your &quot;investigation&quot; of the &quot;suspect&quot;, you will want to write down the SWR and three digit numbers you find in each cache on your detective note pad there by eliminating the suspects, weapons and rooms. Please note that you will need ALL THE NUMBERS on the laminated card to find the final puzzle cache! Also, PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE LAMINATED CARD THAT HAS THE SWR NUMBER PRINTED ON IT! The final puzzle cache will give you instructions as to what to do with the information you obtained from each suspect (cache). 

Mrs. White 

As you make your way to Mrs. White, you see that she is dressed in a typical maids uniform. During the course of your interrogation of Mrs. White, you find Mrs. White to be quite upset about Mr. Boddy's untimely departure. Mrs. White tells you that she has worked for Mr. Boddy for 15 years now as live in maid. Mrs. White is quite tearful and sobbing about what happened to her employer and can not imagine who would do such a thing to Mr. Boddy. Further interrogation reveals that Mrs. White got a bit aggitated when the subject of pay came up. It seems that during her 15 year employment history with Mr. Boddy, she NEVER has received a raise for all of her hard work. You have a funny feeling that Mrs. White may be putting on act about the loss of Mr. Boddy and you think that she may be playing you. You wouldnt put it past Mrs. White to have a grudge against Mr. Boddy and with her easy access to  the plentiful steak knives in the kitchen you could vision Mrs. White making stabbing gestures towards Mr. Boddy!

Mrs. White &quot;hanging out&quot; at a location she feels a connection with. Its a place that she enjoys to walk at and the sound of running water can be heard nearby. You should have no challenges finding her. 

Happy sleuthing!

&lt;p&gt;Ninety percent of the apples grown commercially in the world
have six parents and two of those are the parents of the
others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wild varieties of apple have a wide range of flavors, but most
are unappetizing &quot;spitters&quot;. If you were to bite one of the apples
pictured above, you would know instantly that this is an apple
fully justifying its appellation. You may find most spitters
inedible, but they are actually some of the best cider apples.
Since colonial times, spitters have been used to make a strong
alcoholic beverage called applejack. George Washington was rather
fond of applejack and Johnny Appleseed knew a thing or two about it
as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teetotalers will find other trees nearby bearing Yellow
Transparent apples, which can be used to make an outstanding
applesauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture and descriptive text are exactly what they appear
to be and will not guide you to the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;47 23.XXX 122 24.XXX. A purist might say the answer should be
divided by 1000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could check your answers for this puzzle on
geocheck.org, if Garmin would let you.  12 correct guesses and 196 incorrect
guesses had been made prior to 2009-09-07 when the switch from
GeoChecker to GeoCheck was made.&lt;/p&gt;

GPSr reception in this area is a little shaky. We had different units showing everything from 8 ft to 40 ft away at the same time.

Your feet should not have to leave the concrete. Please stay on the trail because you are surrounded by wetlands. Some stealth is required.

Parking may be the biggest headache in getting this cache. There isn't any legal parking close by. Please take a look at the parking co-ordinates supplied below.

Lion Stretching

The word stretch has many different meanings. Perhaps one of the definitions below will help you find this cache. It shouldn't be 7b and I hope you don't want to 10 me.

1. To lengthen, widen, or distend: stretched the sweater out of shape.

2. To cause to extend from one place to another or across a given space: stretched the banner between two poles.

3. To make taut; tighten: stretched the tarpaulin until it ripped.

4. To reach or put forth; extend: stretched out his hand.

5.   a. To extend (oneself or one's limbs, for example) to full length: stretched her calves before running.

      b. To extend (oneself) when lying down: she stretched herself out on the couch.

      c. To put to torture on the rack.

6. To wrench or strain (a muscle, for example).

7.   a. To extend or enlarge beyond the usual or proper limits: stretch the meaning of a word.

      b. To subject to undue strain: to stretch one's patience.

8.   a. To expand in order to fulfill a larger function: stretch a budget; stretch a paycheck.

      b. To increase the quantity of by admixture or dilution: stretch a meal by thinning the stew.

9. To prolong: stretch out an argument.

10. Informal: To fell by a blow: stretched his opponent in the first round.


Again, your feet should not have to leave the concrete. Please stay on the trail because you are surrounded by wetland.

Bring your own writing instrument, there isn't one in the cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to KC Geo Clue! 

In this cache series you will find extra large bison caches that will give you clues to find the final puzzle cache. If you have ever played the game Clue, you shouldn't have any problem with this cache series. Thanks to California Cacher &quot;Winkster&quot; for allowing me to steal heavily from his idea.

King County will serve as the &quot;board&quot; for this game. There will be a series of 6 caches representing each of the Clue suspects spread throughout King County as well as the final puzzle cache. You, are the star Medina Police Detective. You have been summoned to a large mansion on the Medina waterfront  to investigate the death of Mr. Boddy, a local multi-millionaire who suddenly and tragically passed away during a dinner party. Your job as the detective will be to &quot;investigate&quot; each of the &quot;suspects&quot; (caches) when you visit the cache and log the find. Inside each suspect cache you will find information that will help you narrow down who done it, with what weapon and in what room the evil act took place. Each cache will have a laminated card with SWR numbers as well as a separate three digit number. These SWR numbers correspond to the numbers on the Detective Note Pad that is attached to each cache. The &quot;S&quot; numbers are the suspects, numbers S1 - S6 which represent the all of the game characters. On the Detective Note Pad, Ms. Scarlet, for instance is S1. The &quot;W&quot; numbers will be for the weapons, W1 - W6. The knife is W1 on the Detective Note Pad. The &quot;R&quot; numbers are the rooms, R1 - R9. The Hall is R9 on the note pad.  During your &quot;investigation&quot; of the &quot;suspect&quot;, you will want to write down the SWR and three digit numbers you find in each cache on your detective note pad there by eliminating the suspects, weapons and rooms. Please note that you will need ALL THE NUMBERS on the laminated card to find the final puzzle cache! Also, PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE LAMINATED CARD THAT HAS THE SWR NUMBER PRINTED ON IT! The final puzzle cache will give you instructions as to what to do with the information you obtained from each suspect (cache).  

Mr. Green.  

In true fashion, Mr. Green is dressed for the occasion looking dapper in his green suit. Mr. Green, has seen and heard some things while in the Mr. Boddy's mansion and is most willing to help you out during your investigation. Mr. Green says he's Mr. Boddy's long time banker and over the years has become good friends with Mr. Boddy. Mr. Green seems all to eager to help you with your investigation. He says he has &quot;nothing to hide&quot; but you wouldn't put it past Mr. Green raising the wrench over Mr. Boddy's head! 

You will find &quot;Mr. Green&quot; &quot;hanging out&quot; in a most appropriate location. NOTE: THIS IS NOT A NIGHT CACHE! Please do not attempt this cache after dark. I have permission from the property owners to have this cache at this location. The area is patrolled after dark by rent-a-cops. They are dispatched out of one of the near by buildings. They will hassle you if you are spotted at night at this location!  The cache is located just steps off of the nearby, well known trail (that seems to have a tie-in with this name of this cache and the river nearby). Please do not go into the vegetation to get this cache. The cache can be reached from the dirt trail next to the paved trail. Just unscrew the cap to obtain the log. Do not remove the cache from this location as it is secured and can not be removed by hand.  

Please follow these simple cache rules. If the area gets torn up by cachers or if I find out folks are visiting this at night, I will archive this cache and therefore the fun gets spoiled for everyone.  I have a very descriptive hint below if you cant find this one. If you are still lost, email me and I will help you, even physically show you where the cache is if need be. This is not meant to be a hard cache to get and I do not want folks tearing up the vegetation trying to get this one. 

Thanks for following my rules on this cache. 

PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE LAMINATED PAPER WITH THE CODES ON IT!

Happy sleuthing!

Mrs. Peacock. 

Mrs. Peacock, the old spinster who lives alone with her three cats. Her hubby died in the war many 30 years ago and she never remarried. Peacock claims that she is Mr. Boddy's distant Aunt who was summoned to Mr. Boddy's mansion for the dinner party. She became &quot;distant&quot; due to a family squabble with Mr. Boddy's mother who is Mrs. Peacocks sister with the squabble being over inheritance issue. Mrs. Peacock, dressed in her bright blue dress and jewel studded rings, claims that she has no family issues with Mr. Boddy, but her eye for shiny gold jewely and her nervous shifty eyes leads you to believe otherwise and its not too far fetched to envision Mrs. Peacock swinging that heavy candlestick!  You will find Mrs. Peacock hanging out in a concealed spot where a lot of liquid move beneath her. 

Happy Sleuthing!

This was going to be our last cache of the evening, but it turned out to be the first!  As we headed up the trail at the start of our traverse over the mountain we started looking for likely hiding spots and shortly we had this cache in hand!  I took Markta's &quot;Blast of Sun&quot; Sunflower Geocoin and left an Arizona Geocoin.  Thanks for the hunt!</groundspeak:text>

Why, because it was there and it was listed on every cache listing site I use.  Kinda makes it unique that way.  Had an easy time of it once I was able to melt the frost ice out of the dial using my hands.  TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is located in East Port Orchard, WA. of Kitsap County within an 83 acres park, much of which is still heavily wooded and the rest fairly open grassy fields.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Park Description: Historic farm, walking trails, off-leash dog area.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Park Directions: From Tacoma, WA., take Hwy 16 to Sedgwick(SR-166). Travel east on Sedgwick about (3)three miles to Long Lake Road. Turn Left onto Long Lake Road and go North. Just past Woods Rd. you will see a sign for Howe Farm Park. If you come to Mile Hill Drive you went to far.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Park Rules: http://www.kitsapgov.com/parks/Parks/Pages/regionalparks/Howe_park_rules.htm
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
INSTRUCTIONS:
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Once you have arrived at the park, go to the South entrance and park your vehicle near the steel gate.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Proceed around the gate and onto the trail that continues East downhill and across a stream. Look for a small cut in the brush on the South side of the trail, leading into a large grassy filed. Follow the tree line along the stream until you reach a point near the coordinates listed at the top of the page. What you seek is held within the arms a land-creature next to the stream.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
BTW, if you are involved in the Geocaching.com, GPS Games.org, Letterboxing.org, OpenCaching.us and Terracaching.org websites, you will find one or more &quot;treasures&quot; to seek within this park.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Good Luck &amp; Happy Hunting!

Lots of Muggles &amp; Noxers out and about walking their dogs throughout this park!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, PLEASE make sure no one sees you remove and return the boxes from their hiding places!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Once upon a time, Mr. and Mrs. Howe lived happily on a farm in Port Orchard, WA. One day, she decided to bake some treats for her Grandson, who was coming for a visit that day. So, she carefully mixed up the batter, rolled out some of the dough and cut it into a perfect Gingerbread Man and put him into the oven to bake.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;A short time later, she opened the oven door and saw the Gingerbread Man was done. So, she set the cookie sheet upon the counter and remarked, &quot;What a fine looking Gingerbread Man you are!&quot; After cooling, she gave him sugar icing for his eyes and mouth and dressed him smartly with a green candy bow-tie and buttons made of yummy red cinnamon drops.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE GINGERBREAD MAN: As the Old Woman turned away for a moment, to retrieve more dough to bake some cookies, the Gingerbread Man quickly jumped off the counter, and as he ran out the back door, he said, &quot;I won't be anyone's snack today, I am going to run away!&quot; He ran &lt;i&gt;North past the Barn&lt;/i&gt; hoping to find a place to hide. He came to a &lt;i&gt;Pump-House&lt;/i&gt; with a small &lt;i&gt;Pile of Rocks&lt;/i&gt; at the &lt;i&gt;NW Corner&lt;/i&gt;, where he decided to rest for awhile.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE OLD WOMAN: The Old Woman ran after him, but when she reached the &lt;i&gt;Door at the Southeast Corner of the Barn&lt;/i&gt;, she sat down next to it to rest. As the Gingerbread Man ran out of site, she could still hear him singing and saying, &quot;I won't be anyone's snack today. So, run, run, as fast as you can! You can't catch me! I'm the Gingerbread Man!&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE BOY: After hiding and resting for awhile, the Gingerbread Man started walking &lt;i&gt;Eastward&lt;/i&gt; towards a &lt;i&gt;Big Cedar Tree&lt;/i&gt;. At the tree's &lt;i&gt;South Side by a Rock&lt;/i&gt; he encountered the Old Woman's Grandson. Upon seeing the Gingerbread Man, the Boy yelled, &quot;Stop, Stop!&quot; Hearing that, the Gingerbread Man ran South as fast as he could saying, &quot;I ran away from home, And I ran away from the Old Woman, And I can run away from you! Yes, I can!&quot; As he ran, he said, &quot;Run, run, as fast as you can! You can't catch me! I'm the Gingerbread Man!&quot; The Boy ran after the Gingerbread Man, but he could not catch him. The Gingerbread Man continued running, laughing and singing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE HORSE: The Gingerbread Man ran &lt;i&gt;Southeast&lt;/i&gt; to a &lt;i&gt;Big Maple Tree&lt;/i&gt;, whereupon he saw a Horse grazing. &quot;Neigh,&quot; said the Horse, &quot;You look mighty tasty. I think that I would like to eat you.&quot; &quot;But you can't!&quot; said the Gingerbread Man. &quot;I ran away from an Old Woman, I ran away from a Boy, And I can run away from you! Yes, I can!&quot; As he ran, he said, &quot;Run, run, as fast as you can! You can't catch me! I'm the Gingerbread Man!&quot; The Horse galloped after the Gingerbread Man, but he could not catch him. The Gingerbread Man continued running, laughing and singing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE COW: The Gingerbread Man continued &lt;i&gt;South&lt;/i&gt; past a &lt;i&gt;Window Tree&lt;/i&gt;, whereupon he met a Cow standing by an &lt;i&gt;Old Apple Tree&lt;/i&gt; with a &lt;i&gt;Broken Trunk&lt;/i&gt;. &quot;Moo,&quot; said the Cow. &quot;You look very fine! Fine enough to eat!&quot; And the Cow started to chase the Gingerbread Man. But the Gingerbread Man ran faster, saying, &quot;I ran away from an Old Woman, I ran away from a Boy, I ran away from a Horse, And I can run away from you! Yes, I can!&quot; As he ran, he said, &quot;Run, run, as fast as you can! You can't catch me! I'm the Gingerbread Man!&quot; The Cow ran after the Gingerbread Man, but she could not catch him. The Gingerbread Man continued running, laughing and singing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE CHICKEN: Soon the Gingerbread Man came to a nice &lt;i&gt;Trail&lt;/i&gt; going East. He crossed over an old culvert and up a hill and turning left by a &lt;i&gt;Big Rotting Stump&lt;/i&gt;. As he walked down the trail, curving to the right, he saw a Chicken scratching around behind a &lt;i&gt;Double Fir Tree&lt;/i&gt;. &quot;Cackle, cackle,&quot; said the Chicken, &quot;You look fine enough to peck for dinner and I'm going to eat you!&quot; The Gingerbread Man laughed at the Chicken, as he ran back on the trail he had been on, yelled at the Chicken, &quot;I ran away from an Old Woman, I ran away from a Boy, I ran away from a Horse, I ran away from a Cow, And I can run away from you! Yes, I can!&quot; As he ran, he said, &quot;Run, run, as fast as you can! You can't catch me! I'm the Gingerbread Man!&quot; The Chicken ran after the Gingerbread Man, but she could not catch him. The Gingerbread Man continued running, laughing and singing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE PIG: The Gingerbread Man ran back to the &lt;i&gt;Intersection of the Trails&lt;/i&gt; and decided to continue &lt;i&gt;East up the Hillside&lt;/i&gt; and deeper into the woods. As he reached the top of the hill, he came to an overgrown clearing. Just to his right, he saw he a Grumpy Old Pig rooting about behind a mossy old &lt;i&gt;Octopus Tree&lt;/i&gt; . The Pig grunted at him and said, &quot;Stop! Stop, I'm hungry and I want to eat you!&quot;. Scared of being eaten, the Gingerbread Man ran back down the hill saying, &quot;I ran away from an Old Woman, I ran away from a Boy, I ran away from a Horse, I ran away from a Cow, And I can run away from you! Yes, I can!&quot; As he ran, he said, &quot;Run, run, as fast as you can! You can't catch me! I'm the Gingerbread Man!&quot; The Pig ran after the Gingerbread Man, but she could not catch him. The Gingerbread Man continued running, laughing and singing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE DOG: The Gingerbread Man kept running and running. He passed some &lt;i&gt;Rotting Logs by a Big Fir Tree&lt;/i&gt;, but he didn't stop. Suddenly, a Big Dog came out of the bushes, &lt;i&gt;Right&lt;/i&gt; by another &lt;i&gt;Big Fir Tree&lt;/i&gt; and frightened him. &quot;Woof, Woof!&quot;, said the Dog, &quot;You look fine enough for a snack and I'm going to eat you!&quot; But the Gingerbread Man just said, &quot;I ran away from an Old Woman, I ran away from a Boy, I ran away from a Horse, I ran away from a Cow, I ran away from a Chicken, I ran away from a Pig, And I can run away from you! Yes, I can!&quot; As he ran, he said, &quot;Run, run, as fast as you can! You can't catch me! I'm the Gingerbread Man!&quot; The Big Dog ran after the Gingerbread Man, but he could not catch him. The Gingerbread Man, being frightened of the Big Dog, reversed his course.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE FOX: The Gingerbread Man headed South, but shortly thereafter realized his mistake, because the &lt;i&gt;Trail ended at a Creek&lt;/i&gt;. As he stood there by a &lt;i&gt;Pile of Rocks&lt;/i&gt; to his right, he cried out &quot;Oh, no!, They will catch me! I must find a way across this creek.&quot; At that very moment, a Big Red Fox came out of the bushes and said, &quot;I can help you! All you have to do is jump upon my back and I will take you across to the other side. I'm going that way anyway.&quot; The Gingerbread Man replied, &quot;I don't trust you! You just want to eat me like all the others.&quot; In response, the clver Fox said, &quot;Of course not, young man,  I have already had dinner!&quot; So, the Gingerbread Man jumped upon the Fox's back.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Just before the Fox started across the river, he said:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;This river does get very deep ahead,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;So you better jump up on my nose instead.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;So the Gingerbread Man jumps onto his nose.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;And suddenly, the clever Fox quickly throws,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Gingerbread Man very high into the air,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;And with a  'Snap!', the Fox caught him with care.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;He was a tasty morsel after all,&quot; thought the Fox.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;As all the farm animals gathered at the edge of the creek, they saw the Fox crawling out and onto the far bank still licking the crumbs from his lips.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;~~~ T H E ~ E N D ~~~&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE MORAL OF THIS STORY: The Gingerbread Man was too proud and overconfident, being chased by life's troubles and he was too quick to accept the help of someone pretending to be a friend. However, the Fox didn't have to do anything particularly clever, he just happened to be better than the others. So, to sum it all up: No matter how good you are at something, there is always someone who is better!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;REMARKS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. There are several versions of The Gingerbread Man over the last many decades since it's inception. I have taken the liberty of combining various portions of different versions, to include a few enhancements of my own, within this letterbox.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to KC Geo Clue!

In this cache series you will find extra large bison caches that will give you clues to find the final puzzle cache. If you have ever played the game Clue, you shouldn't have any problem with this cache series. Thanks to California Cacher &quot;Winkster&quot; for allowing me to steal heavily from his idea.

King County will serve as the &quot;board&quot; for this game. There will be a series of 6 caches representing each of the Clue suspects spread throughout King County as well as the final puzzle cache. You, are the star Medina Police Detective. You have been summoned to a large mansion on the Medina waterfront  to investigate the death of Mr. Boddy, a local multi-millionaire who suddenly and tragically passed away during a dinner party. Your job as the detective will be to &quot;investigate&quot; each of the &quot;suspects&quot; (caches) when you visit the cache and log the find. Inside each suspect cache you will find information that will help you narrow down who done it, with what weapon and in what room the evil act took place. Each cache will have a laminated card with SWR numbers as well as a separate three digit number. These SWR numbers correspond to the numbers on the Detective Note Pad that is attached to each cache. The &quot;S&quot; numbers are the suspects, numbers S1 - S6 which represent the all of the game characters. On the Detective Note Pad, Ms. Scarlet, for instance is S1. The &quot;W&quot; numbers will be for the weapons, W1 - W6. The knife is W1 on the Detective Note Pad. The &quot;R&quot; numbers are the rooms, R1 - R9. The Hall is R9 on the note pad.  During your &quot;investigation&quot; of the &quot;suspect&quot;, you will want to write down the SWR and three digit numbers you find in each cache on your detective note pad there by eliminating the suspects, weapons and rooms. Please note that you will need ALL THE NUMBERS on the laminated card to find the final puzzle cache! Also, PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE LAMINATED CARD THAT HAS THE SWR NUMBER PRINTED ON IT! The final puzzle cache will give you instructions as to what to do with the information you obtained from each suspect (cache). 

Ms Scarlet

You find Ms. Scarlet &quot;lounging around&quot; in the lounge. During your interrogation of Ms. Scarlet,  you learn that Ms. Scarlet is a business associate of Mr. Boddy's and met while on a business trip in Saigon. As you talk with her you notice that she talks in general terms and does not go into a lot of detail regarding her relationship with Mr. Boddy. She claims she will help anyway she can to find Mr. Boddy's killer, but can you really trust a woman who uses a cigarette holder? You could easily see Ms. Scarlet craftily putting the rope around Mr. Boddy's neck!

Ms. Scarlet is &quot;lounging&quot; in a nice comfy &quot;fuzzy&quot; spot next to a trail appropriately named. Ms. Scarlet would never dream of being laying on the ground and she does have a fear of heights. To reach Ms. Scarlet, park at the established trailhead and take a nice walk .41 miles to Ms. Scarlet's hiding spot. The terrain rating is for the length of the walk, which portions of it are up hill, but not a very steep climb.  There is no need to go more than a couple of steps off the well established trail. Trail blazing IS NOT needed to find Ms. Scarlet and is NOT recommended in this park. When this cache was placed, the sat coverage was limited due to tree cover. Thus I have put a picture hint on the page if you cant find it based upon all of the hints already posted above. Please obey the park rules and do not attempt this cache at night.

Happy sleuthing!

This is the only peak within Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park that you can actually drive to! Up here you will find kiosks giving you information regarding the old Nike Missile site that was here in the 50's. Relics of the old site can still be seen including a stairway that really leads to no where. Here you will find an extra large bison tube hidden in a most obvious spot.

While in the area, there are other caches not far and several trails that you can take that will take you much deeper into this awesome park. Do spend some time here.

Enjoy this incredible park. Happy caching!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is located on a lightly-used, but immensely convenient pedestrian trail connecting West Lake Sammamish and Eastgate in Bellevue.  While it is handicap-accessible (handicache rating: H41211), the nearest parking is 0.7 miles away.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The find is not intended to be difficult. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking: &lt;br/&gt;N 47° 34.203 W 122° 06.677 (pullout) - after crossing the pedestrian bridge, - 1.4 mile round trip on a paved pedestrian path.&lt;br/&gt;N 47° 34.650 W 122° 07.685 (trailhead) - 2.2 miles round trip on a paved, pedestrian path&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearby caches:&lt;br/&gt;    Kiersolvd's &quot;Looking Forward to the Sunrise&quot; (GCMXM4) starts at a pocket park 1.1 miles to the west. There are five parking spots.&lt;br/&gt;    The starting point for TeamIDFC's &quot;The Easiest Multi In Recent Memory&quot; (GC1FXV1) is 0.3 miles away.&lt;br/&gt;    Cruiser guy's diabolical &quot;Over the Top&quot; (GCJM4Y) multi begins at the bridge over I-90. There is a little pullout on Newport way, on the south side of the bridge. From there, it would be approximately 0.7 miles.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is encased in a medium-sized Tupperware container. Inside the cache is a free t-shirt for the first lucky cacher to find it (if you take it, please leave something fun for the next cacher). There's also a Travel Bug that is aching for a fun trip.</groundspeak:long_description>

Find the cairn, always a good marker. Now look for another down low.

Fun things inside. Please leave a note and share with others.

always stop here for a cup of coffee. In order to solve the puzzle
you will need 2 dates.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
All Dates are in MM/DD/YYYY format.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Date the tunnel first open to public bus traffic = AB/CD/CBBA&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Date the tunnel first open to public light rail traffic =
AE/CF/GAAB&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The final coordinates are N 47° (F-D)D.BGA W 122° CB.(E-C)EE&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Bring your own pen/pencil. Getting good satellite reception is
difficult here, but google maps puts the final coords pretty close.
As always watch out for muggles.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I almost posted another hint but decided not to for now, if you get
stuck just send me a 
message or you can always call
me.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to KC Geo Clue!

In this cache series you will find extra large bison caches that will give you clues to find the final puzzle cache. If you have ever played the game Clue, you shouldn't have any problem with this cache series. Thanks to California Cacher &quot;Winkster&quot; for allowing me to steal heavily from his idea.

King County will serve as the &quot;board&quot; for this game. There will be a series of 6 caches representing each of the Clue suspects spread throughout King County as well as the final puzzle cache. You, are the star Medina Police Detective. You have been summoned to a large mansion on the Medina waterfront  to investigate the death of Mr. Boddy, a local multi-millionaire who suddenly and tragically passed away during a dinner party. Your job as the detective will be to &quot;investigate&quot; each of the &quot;suspects&quot; (caches) when you visit the cache and log the find. Inside each suspect cache you will find information that will help you narrow down who done it, with what weapon and in what room the evil act took place. Each cache will have a laminated card with SWR numbers as well as a separate three digit number. These SWR numbers correspond to the numbers on the Detective Note Pad that is attached to each cache. The &quot;S&quot; numbers are the suspects, numbers S1 - S6 which represent the all of the game characters. On the Detective Note Pad, Ms. Scarlet, for instance is S1. The &quot;W&quot; numbers will be for the weapons, W1 - W6. The knife is W1 on the Detective Note Pad. The &quot;R&quot; numbers are the rooms, R1 - R9. The Hall is R9 on the note pad.  During your &quot;investigation&quot; of the &quot;suspect&quot;, you will want to write down the SWR and three digit numbers you find in each cache on your detective note pad there by eliminating the suspects, weapons and rooms. Please note that you will need ALL THE NUMBERS on the laminated card to find the final puzzle cache! Also, PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE LAMINATED CARD THAT HAS THE SWR NUMBER PRINTED ON IT! The final puzzle cache will give you instructions as to what to do with the information you obtained from each suspect (cache). 

Prof. Plum. 

Prof. Plum is nicely dress in a dark purple dinner jacket that looks well worn. Prof. Plum claims he is a tenured professor of business economics at the nearby university. The professor claims that he came to know Mr. Boddy during some philanthropic dealings with the university and has had him as a guest speaker during his classes. Prof. Plum is an avid &quot;kayaker&quot; frequents the GZ with Mr. Boddy who is also a &quot;rower&quot;. The professor claims he cant imagine why anybody would want to kill Mr. Boddy and is very eager to assist you in any way he can. If the professor can handle a paddle, you can easily see him handling a lead pipe!

You will find the good professor &quot;hanging out&quot; in a most appropriate place for a man of higher education. I have provided parking coordinates for this one as well as a hint. I have set the terrain rating higher than the rest in this series but thats for the 30 feet. The rest of the route from the parking to GZ is a 1.5. The sat reception in the GZ was challenging given the tree cover. Hence, I have posted a spoiler photo along with the hints I have already posted in the story above.

Happy sleuthing!

 Ever since finding my first cache under these I've always been amazed that before then I've never even noticed that they existed.  Since then I have found spiders, ants, and other insects, various types of garbage, small toys while looking for caches.  What have you found?  

This only fits in the hiding spot in one way, please return it to it stays hidden.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">If you are looking for a quick and easy find, this cache isn't for you!

DRIVING INSTRUCTIONS:

From SR-3 North or South - Exit at Kitsap Mall Blvd., then go South on Kitsap Mall Blvd. to Silverdale Way NW. Turn Left/North and continue to NW Schold Lane and turn Left/W. following it to Schold Road NW. Turn Left/South for about 1/4 mile to the Schold Farm Park entrance sign.


ABOUT THE CACHE:

The purpose of this cache is to teach you how to use several functions found in your GPSr, such as Waypoint Projection, the Metric System and the Degrees - Minutes - Seconds format.

Since you will be going to several places within Schold Farm Park, you have a choice of either walking the trails or riding your bicycle, if you have one, to each of the waypoints below.

If you bring and ride your bicycle, please be respectful of those who frequent this park for their morning and afternoon walks, sometimes with their dogs.

Since you may be here for awhile looking for other caches in this park, bring the kids, the dog and a picnic lunch while you enjoy the wide open fields and trails.

The cache container is a Camouflage painted Ammunition Can. It has been secured to a Multi-Trunked tree with a Steel Cable and a Keyed Lock.


WHAT'S IN IT:

At this time, there are no restrictions to the cache contents. However, I do suggest that you don't clutter up this cache with Personal Trademark Items, such as Stickers and Buttons et cetera, as cache trade items.

Due to the difficulty of this cache, placing a Travel Bug or GeoCoin into this cache may not be a good idea, since this cache isn't found as often as most other caches.


PARKING COORDINATES:

WP-#1: N 47° 40' 17.0&quot; @ W 122° 40' 56.3&quot;

Once you have parked your vehicle, Please Read the Signboard at the entrance to the park, then warm up your GPSr and go to Waypoint #2 and get ready for the hunt!


WP-#2: N 47° 40' 17.1&quot; @ W 122° 41' 08.1&quot;

PROJECT: Bearing: 014° / T @ Distance: 0.19 Km. The BEARING for the Final Cache is written in Black Marker.

HINT: Sit down and take the load off the ground!


WP-#3: N 47° 40' 17.1&quot; @ W 122° 41' 08.1&quot;

PROJECT: Bearing: 215° / T @ Distance: 0.13 Km. The DISTANCE for the Final Cache is written in Black Marker.

HINT: You need a different point of view!


WP-#4: N 47° 40' 17.1&quot; @ W 122° 41' 08.1&quot;

Starting at this location, you may now Project the Bearing &amp; Distance information you found at WP-#2 and WP-#3. Now place your answers into the Final Cache Coordinates shown below:


WP-#5: THE FINAL COORDINATES

N 47° ____' ____&quot; @ W 122° ____' ____&quot;.

The shortest distance between two points is not always a straight line!
If you are on the boardwalk and find a bat symbol, you're in the wrong place!


SPECIAL NOTES:

Now that you have all the information you need, be careful of the pathway you choose to find the cache. It's completely off trail and you may encounter Marshy Ground, Tall Grass and Stickers along the way. The boardwalks are there for a reason, because some of the land becomes flooded in the rainy season. So, Please watch your footing, whichever way you go, and wear sturdy hiking shoes or boots and long pants!

If you see a Bat Symbol, You're in the Wrong Place!

GOOD LUCK &amp; HAPPY HUNTING !!!

I spent many weekends here as a teenager, as the sunset.  It's usually pretty quiet, peaceful, and tranquil.

I wanted to make this my first hide, as I think it's beautiful at dusk, but a little out of the way, so not everyone knows about it.

Any feedback is welcome.</groundspeak:long_description>

Congratulations to pyrraxis for the FTF :)

This is a steel truss cantilever bridge that carries State Route 305 from the north end of Bainbridge Island over Agate Pass to the mainland part of Kitsap County. The bridge replaces a car ferry service dating from the 1920s. The Agate Pass Bridge operated as a toll bridge until October 1, 1951.


The Agate Pass Bridge cost $1,351,363 to build. Construction costs were paid out of the motor vehicle fund, and were repaid by a bond issue passed by the 1951 State Legislature. 

Tolls generated by traffic across the bridge repaid the bond. The toll was 35 cents per car plus driver and five cents per passenger. The Toll Bridge Authority managed the bridge during the one year it took to repay the bond.

State Highway Director William A. Bugge opened the bridge by fitting a giant wooden key into a large lock suspended over the bridge roadway. Next on the Highway Department’s agenda was “straightening, widening, and relocating 4.7 miles of highway from near Poulsbo to the north end of the bridge and 4 miles from the south end of the bridge to near Winslow. The [existing] narrow winding roads … are dotted with signs: '20 M.P.H.'” (The Seattle Times).

The Agate Pass Bridge provided (and continues to provide) a direct route between Seattle, via the Seattle-Bainbridge Island ferry, and the Kitsap and Olympic peninsulas. The bridge spans Agate Pass 75 feet above the water and has a channel clearance of 300 feet between piers.

Before I picked up the cache, I watched a Great Blue Heron perched on a post on the other end of the bridge.   I found the cache completely out in the open and replaced it where I thought it should go, according to the cache page description.  I've been to this area before for other caches, and I can tell you that the bridge deck is VERY slippery when icy or frosty (about 5% of the time) or wet (the other 95% of the time).  Parents who let their kids run on ahead (a bad idea in caching anyway) be warned!  I took the TB to move along and left a pathtag.  Nice job on your first cache--thank you!</groundspeak:text>

Replace exactly as found. Go easy on the magnets as they tend to fall off. 
This is my first try at Opencaching so I'm just listing a cache I originally hid on geocaching.

Why? 1 It is not too hot (unlike parts of the SF Bay Area) plus 2 There are these places called &quot;tree farms&quot; where dogs are allowed off-leash equals = They get to run around in the forest off-leash, play in mud, tree squirrels, and pretend we are wolves!

moved the container see new coords

&lt;b&gt;Silver Lake in Everett is the place to be.
I decided to place a cache here since this is a great place to cool
down. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Puget Sound temps lately have set
records and today was still pretty hot. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Located away from high traffic areas so
extreme stealth will not be required. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have fun and happy
hunting.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take me out to the
ballgame&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summer time you will find games played almost all
the time.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best time to seek cache is early weekday mornings.
I used to&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;play coed softball here and would like to again.
Kasch park&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;is awesome. Soccer fields here too. Happy hunting
and dont&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;get snagged by the berry
bushes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking available in main softball area just
NorthWest of QUAD.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Easiest way to get to cache now is from quad
entrance, walk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;around outfield fences clockwise until your GPSr
needle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;takes a left turn. Boots or hightops will make
your journey safer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Berry bushes are in full growth summertime, so
come with&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;armor or snipping tools.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The groundskeeper looked at us funny as we sidestepped all along the fence, but he must see people doing this often because there had been a lot of other people at the cache recenlty before us.  :)  Had a nice walk on a beautiful August day and the kids played in the park after.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&quot;It's been (over 60) years since U.S. Route 2 was built through the
old cemetery....&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
Snohomish Pioneer Cemetery - A controversial piece of land.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I came across the information on this while doing some local
genealogy research. The grassy piece of land uphill, just NW of the
cache used to be the southern two-thirds of the Snohomish
Pioneer/Indian Cemetery. The other third is under the old highway 2
cut (2nd street) and the fenced off property north across 2nd
street. Lots of drama unfolded when claims were made that the
Senior Center &amp; parking lot were built over the top of graves
that had not been moved to other cemeteries. The city was forced to
check for remains and the results came back positive that there
were people still buried here. Since the remains were found, the
Senior Center and parking lot were removed. All that is left now is
a nice grassy lot.
&lt;p&gt;It's sad to see that there are no longer monuments to identify
those still buried here. It's almost a certainty that there are
graves still remaining in the unexplored north portion of the
cemetery across Second Street within the old Pioneer Village site
(look for the old cabin), under Cypress Avenue and the road leading
into Pilchuck Park, along the south rock wall at the entrance to
Pilchuck Park, and the far east part of the bluff overlooking
Pilchuck River. The old maps indicate graves were located in these
areas. Kinda gives you goosebumps, eh?!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the north side of 2nd street, in what used to be the Pioneer
Village replica site, sit some of the tombstones that were hauled
over when the highway was cut through. These tombstones are not
sitting atop their graves as one would assume. They were arranged
in a &quot;fake&quot; cemetery for the replica village.&lt;/p&gt;

Decertification Attempt-&lt;/a&gt;This is an absolutely fascinating Adobe
document with maps and pictures of the site. I'll warn you though,
it is large.&lt;br/&gt;
The Rootsweb website also has a lot of information on the protest
&amp; removal of the senior center that was built atop this
cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a bison in about the only place one can be
hidden at GZ. You may need a tool to get it. Please be stealthy and
make sure the cache is well hidden before you leave. Please let me
know if there are any problems with the cache or the
coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A micro that'll give you the chills.  OK, maybe not.

There are many interesting facts about Lake Stevens, but one little piece of information I found particularly chilling.  As the story goes, a woman died when she drove through a railing into the lake.  People have claimed to see her floating above the water, staring at them as they drive by.  

I can't imagine how I would feel upon seeing this apparition, but it would make me hesitate to drive in that area again.  Oooooo, creepy!  I've hunted for more details on this, but can't seem to find out anything more.  I'm not even sure which road around the lake that this occurred, or if this is just urban legend. 

Look for a small waterproof match container.  I've upped the difficulty on this - seems its very hard for people to spot - the hide is not particularly clever.  Remember to bring your own writing instrument and Happy Haunting (oops, I meant &quot;Hunting&quot;). </groundspeak:long_description>

charges just killed me (Island County didn't have any local access
numbers way back then).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used to put a lump in your throat when you heard those three
little words - wow, I've got email!! Now, with all the spam out
there, it can be a chore to weed through it all. And if you have a
friend or relative who just discovered the internet, your inbox can
be flooded with every joke, picture, tip, and chain letter known to
man.&lt;/p&gt;
The find should be fairly easy, but parking nearby will probably
not be. GPS reception wasn't the best when I hid this.  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the site of Hartford - a stop on the Everett &amp; Monte
Cristo Railway - later renamed the Hartford Eastern Railway.


&lt;p&gt;On March 23, 1936, workers began the removal of rails on the
abandoned Hartford Eastern Railway line between Hartford and Monte
Cristo to make way for the new forest service automobile road. You
can still see remnants of the old railbed along Highway 92 in some
areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decades earlier, the Everett &amp; Monte Cristo Railway Company
purchased the partially constructed Snohomish, Skykomish, and
Spokane Railway (called the &quot;3 S&quot;) line between Snohomish and
Lowell. They then constructed their own grade from Hartford
Junction (this cache site) near Lake Stevens to Monte Cristo via
Granite Falls, Robe Canyon, and the mines at Silverton. After
weather and flood delays, the line finally reached its destination
in September 1893. Between Snohomish and Hartford, the company
leased trackage rights from the Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern
Railway. This is the present day Centennial Trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to tell just where the old depot was located. The site
is not obvious and a few hours research have not turned up
anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is now a small round tin with room for little items &amp;
the log. *It is not weatherproof. Please make sure it is placed
back inside ziploc before re-hiding.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

not park on the south side of the river! If it's hot out, bring
your swimsuit! 



Cache container is once again an ammo can. Some cliffs in the area
of the cache -- please be extra cautious! Lots of muggles in
summer. 
&lt;p&gt;Park Features: * River Swimming Area * Portable Restrooms *
Picnic Tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary feature of this small park is a pedestrian
suspension bridge across the South Fork of the Stillaguamish River.
A path leads to the river shore where visitors can swim and relax
during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
Park History: The Jordan Bridge was first constructed in the early
1900's. The swinging bridge was historically used as the northern
access to the Jordan Bridge community. The bridge was built to
provide access for children attending school at Jordan, and to
provide a shorter route to Arlington on the south side of the
river. The bridge was condemned in November of 1972 due to its
dilapidated condition. It was rebuilt in the &quot;swinging bridge&quot;
style in the 70's and closed again in 90's for repair. It was then
rebuilt as a semi-solid structure by Snohomish County parks.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKPRPH - a good place to put your car&lt;br/&gt;N 48° 08.885 W 122° 02.281&lt;br/&gt;More parking available further west (north?). </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The coordinates lead you to a parking lot in a little known neighborhood pocket park. Rock Hill Park is in the heart of the York neighborhood. 

The difficulty level and terrain rating are pretty easy. There are about 10 stairs to climb, and a small hill to get up to the rock (which you will want to climb for the view of I-5!)

The final is a film canister inside of... something. Remember to bring your own pen!

------

This is a four stage multi-cache all contained within Rock Hill Park. Each coordinate will lead you to a different part of the park.

At the first coordinates, N48 44.758 W122 27.991, count how many letters and trees are on this sign. Subtract one, and fill in XX with your number:

N48 44.752 W122 28.0XX

IF the park sign is missing (it gets stolen from time to time), you can alternatively count the number of posts that previously held the sign, add 1 and multiply by 3.

In other words, (Posts previously holding sign + 1) x 3=XX
Plug the XX in for XX in the above coordinates and hike on!

-----

At this location, take a moment to pause and reflect on life and enjoy an object placed in the memory of others. Multiply the last two digits of Helen's birth year and add one. Plug this in for SS below. Then, add the first and last digits of Mark's death year and insert for H.

N48 44.7SS W122 28.00H

-----

Make sure you take a look at the incredible view from up atop the park's primary feature. Look for a year carved into this object from long ago. Subtract 1257 from this number and plug in for ZZZ to take you to the final!

N 48 44.ZZZ W 122 28.012

----

While this part of the park is even less used, it would be a great spot for people watching or a picnic with friends!</groundspeak:long_description>

Hello Opencachers,

I need your help.  My rich, adventurous, and eccentric uncle has disappeared again and has stayed missing longer than usual.  I've been trying to track him down for several weeks now, but following his travels has led me into getting stuck in an old research station near the North Pole.  I have plenty of fuel and provisions, and the Russians have promised to rescue me in the spring, but I'm afraid that without your help, the trail I've been following to find my uncle will become colder than the air outside my hut.  Fortunately, my associate has found a log-book of his caches in a cabin my uncle built on an island off the coast of northern BC; I will share the first cache here.

The cache appears to be in a park in Langley, BC.  My uncle's notes describe the contents as some money from countries that he visited: two coins from adjacent countries, and a paper bill.  The first to find can keep the paper bill, it's supposed to come from a former communist country  with some interesting communist slogans on it (&quot;Freedom! Factories! Land!&quot; &quot;Proletarians of all countries, unite!&quot; &quot;Proletariat, organ of the international, socialist-revolutionary party&quot;).  The two coins can be traded for other, interesting coins.  I ask only that you let me know where the paper bill and the coins came from, and what coins you are leaving in trade.

It appears the listed coordinates lead to the general area of the cache, where you can get a clue for more specific coordinates:

{Rosamond Sarles lived to a ripe old age
Before she died, on her birthday
Subtract 81 from her age to get Y
And 64 from her age to get X
Find a small jar at 49 02' 7.Y and 122 39' 27.X
(NOTE: these coordinates are in the DD MM' SS.ss format)}

Good luck, and please let me know as soon as you figure out where the bill and the coins in the cache come from, it will give me important clues in the search for my uncle.     </groundspeak:long_description>

 It blows the bait in the fishes' mouth;

I really don't believe that none of those prolific FTF seekers in Abbotsford have not gone looking for this very creative and well done hide, We looked high and low trying not to leave any trace as to where we had actually looked and finally Solonm come up with the goods.

Very well hidden cache.

Thanks for the adventure and the FTF

Sometimes in that same description there are other superlatives used to enhance the point we are trying to make.&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes the description really has nothing to do with CRAP at all, such as $()%$$* CRAP, and !@@)@*$) CRAP. We cannot use the real words here because of  censorship, however you get the picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you walk, bike or run along the Rotary Trail and parts of our local dike system, you will encounter all kinds of CRAP, the little Rabbit droppings in the bush are unobtrusive, the odd Coyote scat is also part of nature and often tells us what they had for lunch, stuff from above is of no concern unless it lands on us, we also have the Doggy Do Do, left behind because the owner won't pick up after their pet. Then there is the large piles of Horse Crap, now this should not be confused with Bull Crap, which is most abundant during fishing season. However none of this Crap should be left on the trails for other users to dodge and pets to eat and roll in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's keep our wonderful trails crap free...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache has been placed an appropriate distance from any other cache listing.</groundspeak:long_description>

extreme stealth as there are often many people here on a nice warm
summer day. Cache is a small/regular size Lock'n Lock covered in
camo tape.
As always around water, please keep a close eye on young
kids.
A little farther north up the creek there is lots of clay in the banks, which
can be loads of fun for youngsters.
Bring a towel and go for a dip........
Please use the hint if searching for this during the summer
months as there is often many people enjoying this fun area. Cache
has been replaced with a new one that has a magnet on it to
hopefully keep it safe in its hiding spot.

Lots of things to do here - tennis courts, playground, soccer &amp; baseball fields, and well-used trails (well actually, you almost can't tell where the trails end and the bush starts, there is so little bush here).
 

This is a busy park - you will have to be stealthy and also choose a time where is not swarming with Muggles and Mini-Muggles.
 
Please take a moment to rehide this cache well, or it will get Muggled.
 
Please bring your own pen.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other small tradeables and trackables also welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

Mid day feeding during the week is an especially active time.

*** Warning: As long as the animals are behind the fence or the bars you are safe and may cache away. If for any reason one or more are on your side of the fence just act naturally and they will ignore you and pass right on by. ***

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what you'll be thinking. 
  You'll be looking at this waypoint on a map and thinking why. Why would anyone 
  put a cache there? But you know what? You'll jump in your cachemobile and drive 
  out there anyway just to find out. And when you get there, you'll be happy to 
  discover that I didn't just drag you out to some industrial wasteland for a 
  'drive-up' nestled in between a couple warehouses so you can get your numbers 
  up. No, sir. Because nestled between the warehouses and factories is a full 
  fledged bird sanctuary complete with duck pond and lookout tower. The trick 
  is, how do you get there? But since this cache is more about why than how, you'll 
  just have to figure that out for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you reach the given 
  coordinates, you will find an information sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A = How many billion 
    liters of water are treated each year?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;B = How many thousand 
    tonnes of biosolids are processed each year?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;XXX = A - 290&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;YY = B + 36&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located at 
  N49 10.XXX, W122 57.0YY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a 500ml camo-painted 
  Lock &amp; Lock. Because the cache is relatively small, please only bring small 
  trade items and please do not try to overfill the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first person to find 
  this cache will find a shiny, new, unregistered TravelBug that is theirs to 
  keep - no trade necessary.

Traffic was tied up on the bridge and I was right at the Annacis exit, so I decided to do this one, my last cache on this island. Finding the path in is quite a challenge, but putting up with the smell was even harder. Glad this one has a smiley now. A place I never knew existed and will never return to.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is one of a series of caches dedicated to the history and heritage of North Burnaby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

There is a picturesque little beach on the south shores of Burrard Inlet. One hundred years ago, this small stretch of sand was popular with the townsfolk living in the eastern section of Barnet. Today, it has become all but forgotten. Few people realize that this area harbours a secretive and sinister past. Read all about it at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

http://bobbea.com/treasure/secrets.html
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Additional hints are avalable on the website.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Although this cache is located on public property designated for the Barnet Marine Park expansion, it is listed as a &quot;kayaker's cache&quot; as the easiest way to the cache is from the water. The puzzle for landlubbers is to find the one (and only one) land route to the hidden beach. The parklands in this area are not yet developed and the existing trails can be difficult at the best of times. For those cachers not interested in a hit and miss walking tour, directions can also be found on the website.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Enjoy your visit.

      largest freshwater marsh in southwestern BC and is a
      birdwatchers' paradise. Beavers, otters, Ospreys, Great Blue
      Herons and Bald Eagles are common sights. Many species of
      wetland birds including Sandhill Cranes, Trumpeter and
      Whistler Swans, coots, bitterns, rails and several species of
      ducks can be found here at various times of the year. 
&lt;p&gt;The slough
consists of a network of meandering back channels interspersed with
small sandy beaches suitable for sunning or picnicking. The slough
is a premier paddling destination and large groups of inexperienced
paddlers come here to paddle and explore the quiet, interesting
waters. Be sure to bring along your camera and
binoculars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widgeon Slough is
     easily accessible by canoe or kayak from the public dock at
     Grant Narrows Regional Park. Canoe rentals are available from
     May to September at Ayla Canoes located next to the public
     dock. Entrance to Widgeon Slough is opposite the dock across
     the Pitt River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is
not located at the listed coordinates. When you reach the
coordinates you will see a sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than
buy myself an extravagant birthday present as I am prone to do
every year, this year I decided to leverage my other birthday
tradition of taking the day off from work by treating myself to an
overnight kayaking trip up Pitt Lake to find a couple of the new
caches that have been recently placed. While packing for the trip
one of my travelling companions suggested (insisted would be more
accurate) that I plant a couple of my own caches as well. This
cache is the first of two I placed on the east shore of Pitt Lake
on my birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache
container is a sandwich-sized Lock &amp; Lock and, while it does
contain a couple of small trade items, trading is not required or
expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is
only accessible by boat and is just a couple meters off the rocky
beach. The easiest access is along the shore from the gravel beach
next to the Lipstick Beach cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are 3 islands in the south end of Pitt
      Lake. The largest, in the middle of the lake, is Goose
      Island. A couple kilometers to the northeast and just across
      the channel from Williams Landing, is Little Goose Island. A
      few hundred meters further north is a tiny island that, in
      the absence of any names on the maps and charts, we've dubbed
      &quot;Egg Island&quot;. The cache is on the southeast tip of Egg Island
      next to a pebble beach perfect for landing in a kayak, canoe
      or small motorboat. The terrain is rated as 5 because of the
      need for a boat otherwise it would be a Terrain
      2.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the
boat launch at Grant Narrows, it is about a 14.5 km journey along
the east side of Pitt Lake to Egg Island. Along the way you will
pass several easily accessible caches including Pitt Stop, Just This Side Of The Other Side, Other Side Of The Raven, Between A Rock And A Soft Place, Lipstick Beach and Gorak's Birthday Cache. Just a couple
   kilometers further north at the Osprey Creek North campsite are
   Victory At Osprey Creek, Under The Yum Yum Tree and Get Yer Rocks Off. If you are paddling, I
   would suggest making a weekend of it and camping at either Raven
   Creek, or one of the two campgrounds on either side of Osprey
   Creek.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
cache is a small, camo-painted 350 ml. Lock &amp; Lock container
hidden at the base of a large rotting stump. The cache is really
only big enough for a log book and pencils so trading is not really
required. If you feel you must leave something in the cache, please
make sure it is very small.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Starting from Deep Cove, this is a fairly ambitious paddle to the top of Indian Arm. The journey will take you approximately 20 kilometers in each direction and you'll see some of the most spectacular scenery that is easily accessible on the coast of British Columbia. Be prepared to see curious seals, jellyfish, crabs, assorted fish, and other marine life from the comfort of your kayak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The cache is located on the south side of Granite Falls near the very impressive public campground. There is no charge to use this campsite and spaces are available on a first-come basis. If all the groomed campsites are full, there is plenty of room in the common area to pitch a tent for the night. There is also another campground a few kilometers away at Bergs Landing which is on the west side of the arm near the south end of Croker Island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

It is possible to paddle to this cache and back in a single day but it will make for a very long and tiring trip. At an average pace, it will take approximately four to five hours of paddling to reach Granite Falls from Deep Cove. The journey is best suited for an overnight stay. If you don't have your own kayak, they are available for rent at Deep Cove.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

On your way to Granite Falls be certain to stop and take a look at the incredibly beautiful Silver Falls located at N49 24.457 W122 53.102 -- you'll have to keep an eye out for the falls because it's easy to miss when travelling northward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Please note that there is no dock at the south area of Granite Falls and there is no bridge from the north day area to the south campground area. If you are visiting the cache with a power boat, you may not be able to access the south side of the falls if you are unable to run your boat up on the rocky beach. It is possible to cross over the outflow of the falls at low tide but you'll probably get your feet wet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The cache is a 2.3 liter Lock &amp; Lock container and is under some old logs right near the base of a rock wall. A piece of wood is covering the cache but a small corner of the cache is visible. Please put the cache back the way that you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The cache started out with the following contents: Space Jam DVD, Genesis 'Foxtrot' CD, Doll making kit, Hair barrettes, Hot Wheels 'Tony Hawk Skate Series' car, Lady Bug Kaliedescope, Laminated geocaching information sheet, Log book, pen, pencils and a pencil sharpener.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Please sign the logbook, trade fairly, and log what you've traded on the website -- we'd like to keep the quality of trade items high for this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Make a Contribution: Cache in and Trash Out!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

You can also contribute to the beauty of this wilderness area by promoting and supporting good caching in and trashing out practices. Throw a couple of plastic bags in your kayak for carrying out bits of litter. A grocery size plastic bag won't take up much space and will stay organized if you stuff it into an empty film container.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Have fun and enjoy your trip to the top of Indian Arm!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Please tread lightly when looking for a cache. It takes a long time for a plant to grow back.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located next 
  to Granite Falls at the north end of Indian Arm. Granite Falls is the site of 
  a Marine Park and is a great paddling destination and campsite. The coordinates 
  will bring you to a large yellow sign. The cache is located 5 meters at 20° 
  magnetic from the sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a 500ml camo-painted 
  Lock &amp; Lock. Because the cache container is relatively small, please bring 
  only small trade items and please do not try to overfill the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is rated 5 for 
  terrain because of the need for a boat to reach Granite Falls. Otherwise, the 
  terrain rating would be 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

No matter what, do not give him treats or attemp to ride him.  He has a taste for unattended footwear, so remain in your shoes at all times.

Ftf   - Good Luck-

***  NOTE  ***
I have changed the size from Regular to Micro due to some muggle activity in the area.  The log was tagged with some nasty language and all the swag was removed, so...
Rather than archive this, please enjoy the find, sign the logbook (and if there are nasty notes, please tear out the sheet), but don't bother leaving ANYTHING of value!
Cache On!

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PGCAR2010: Secret Chambers and Hidden
Treasures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since I was
a student at the College of New Caledonia many years ago, I have
always know about this organization and have, at times, attended
their secret meetings. What happens behind closed doors is not for
the public to speculate, but this is one of the most active
'organizations' around this town.&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is meant to show you, the caching world, that this
secret society is at work in your community!&lt;br/&gt;
PS. Don't park in the Bus Stop!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
