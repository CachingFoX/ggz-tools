            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The Pacheco Dog Park at Pacheco Avenue and Prospect Heights was established in 2009 and is one of several off-leash parks listed in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=15273&quot;&gt;A Guide to On-Leash and Off-Leash Dog Recreational Areas in Santa Cruz County&lt;/a&gt; (pdf).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This park offers doggy drinking water, a few plastic patio chairs for tired pet-owners, and a nicely mulched doggy play area. It is also close to a nearby trailhead as well as another trail that runs behind some of the neighborhood houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the midst of plenty of dog-loving muggles, I was able to surreptitiously take several averaged waypoint samples at this geocache's location while 1) propping my foot up on it and retying my shoelaces; 2) using it as support as I stretched out my calves; and 3) casually leaning against it as I &quot;checked my messages and/or voicemail.&quot; I don't think anyone suspected my ulterior motives!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring your own pen (and you may need some tweezers to extract the log).&lt;/p&gt;

Cherry Chase is the name of the local grade school. It is named after the acres of cherry trees that once stood in this neighborhood. Even as it was being built in the 60's and earlier, many cherry trees were left in backyards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only a few of the orchards remain. 2 areas are along Sunnyvale Saratoga road near the tennis complex, and the other near the Sunnyvale Civic Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This trek is about 2 miles from start to end (following streets). How long it will take depends on your route </groundspeak:long_description>

This was our first time using the chirp for a cache. That did make it easy (until the final step). We were so excited by this new untried to us feature we forgot to check what the little things looked like. After we completed the cache we went back to the start to see one up close. Thanks for the tour. Stop 3 was our favorite.</groundspeak:text>

He is said to have once roamed all of the forests in Middle-earth, which included the Misty Mountains, Mirkwood, and the Blue Mountains. After the loss of the Entwives by the end of the Third Age, he and the remaining Ents dwelt in the Forest of Fangorn. This led the remaining Ents into isolation and all information from the outside world was cut off. The arrival of Merry and Pippin shifted Treebeard's attention to take action against Saruman for hacking down his trees. He led the Ents to war against Saruman and his Orcs. Treebeard later realised that while Saruman had learned much from him, the Wizard had shared no useful information of his own.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;One felt as if there was an enormous well behind them, filled up with ages of memory and long, slow, steady thinking; but their surface was sparkling with the present: like sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast tree, or on the ripples of a very deep lake. I don't know but it felt as if something that grew in the ground — asleep, you might say, or just feeling itself as something between root-tip and leaf-tip, between deep earth and sky had suddenly waked up, and was considering you with the same slow care that it had given to its own inside affairs for endless years.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;—The description of Treebeard in The Two Towers Volume III - Treebeard</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In memory of mom. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This cache is in memory to our mom Ramona.  We tried our best to find a spot on Ramona Street to recognize her and this was the best I could do.  I know everyone hates ivy hides, so this is in as little or no ivy as possible - just look for the signs and you will find the cache.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is in a camo dressing - please re-wrap it after you find it.  Inside the camo is a pink container with many pink items, pink ribbons, a trackable, some coins, and other goodies inside.  The color is special for our mom's cache.  For the first few there are a couple plush pink items connected to the outside of the container - they are to be taken.  After the second one is gone, please also take the plastic baggie with you that is covering the cache as it is no longer needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details:  WE KNOW - IT IS NOT A GREAT SPOT BUT WE WANTED THIS ON RAMONA STREET AND IT WAS REALLY THIS OR NOTHING.  WE SUGGEST THAT WHEN YOU FIND THE CACHE TAKE IT TO YOUR CAR OR WALK UP THE BLOCK WITH IT TO DO THE ITEM EXCHANGE AND LOG SIGNING AND THEN RETURN IT.  THERE ARE MUGGLE HOUSES ON EITHER SIDE (ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT ON RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY) AND TO THE WEST HOUSE YOU WILL BE IN PLAIN VIEW UNLESS YOU PARK YOUR CAR CORRECTLY.  EXTREME STEALTH IS NECESSARY.</groundspeak:long_description>

(also titled: Having an Old Friend for Dinner) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLOT SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The Undead terrorize geocachers in historic Palo Alto. &lt;br/&gt;OPENING SCENE:&lt;br/&gt;(Voice of Announcer): It is of great fear that we must report Zombies are roaming the streets. You may not be safe in your own home - as Zombies are everywhere. How do you protect yourself?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Know these simple guidelines:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Zombies move slow.....but they keep moving no matter what.&lt;br/&gt;2) Zombies enjoy a snack or two....usually it is someone you know (the snack that is....or the Zombie....worse case is when it is both).&lt;br/&gt;3) Zombies can easily be detected if you are downwind from them.&lt;br/&gt;4) Never give a Zombie a helping hand or a piece of your mind....it only makes them stronger (and probably hurts you).&lt;br/&gt;5) To distract a Zombie...toss one of your friends in front of it and run!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE LOCATION:&lt;br/&gt;This cache is hidden in an historic theatre on California Avenue in Palo Alto. Originally named for a small community, Mayfield, which was later annexed to Palo Alto, this theater was originally a simple Spanish Mission style structure, but was given a plain Moderne facade and marquee in the Fifties. The last chain to operate it was Renaissance Rialto. Today the marquee is a well known fixture on souther California Avenue - bringing back memories of Saturday horror movie matinees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Closed in the late 1980s, the building is now reopened for the public. The marquee still reads Fine Arts in neon, and the original facade still exists in part behind the Fifties era fascia. It is sure to bring back memories of those who watched zombies and other monsters in old movies of the past in this theater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hours to access the cache are: Tue-Fri 11am-6pm; Sat 12pm-5pm; Sun 10am-2pm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STORYLINE:&lt;br/&gt;Simply go inside and seek out the zombie supply box (an ammo box for the undead). It is in plain view. There is no purchase necessary and the owners have agreed to allow this cache to rest in peace in their location. But please be respectful of the location, employees and the patrons. Please look around and you will see the framework of the old theatre and how some old theatre chairs are now being used. The old wood theatre floor is still intact and the stage is the rear stock room area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MOVIE RATING:&lt;br/&gt;Bring the mini-cachers as this cache is really full of fun goodies and is intended as a true family cache. We brought back to life about half of the goodies we have ever recovered from caches around the world....thus even the cache contents themselves have been given a second chance to walk the earth. Please leave something if you take something and be sure to sign the Log Book Of The Undead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPECIAL EFFECTS:&lt;br/&gt;For the First-to-Find a California Zombie Hunter patch or Zombie Hunter bracelet or many other undead, horror things to choose from. This is wheelchair accessible.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">An easy cache placed to show the beautiful surroundings. Big enough to host moderate sized travel bugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Either you can park at the Stanford Shopping Center or at a Stanford Parking lot on Quarry Road (cords in waypoint). They have visitor parking there, however you have to pay Mon-Fri 8AM-4PM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I work at Stanford and bike past the Stanford Arboretum pretty much everyday, but hadn´t actually gone into the park until a couple of weeks ago. I ventured into the park and realized the treasures hidden in here. There is surprisingly little information about the mausoleum/statue/cactus garden here. There is no plaque to tell you what the building is. I told the other half of Team DoJ and when we checked it out he agreed that by placing a cache here, perhaps we could show other people this cool place. As there were some caches to close to where we wanted to originally put the cache, we had to change our plans and the cache is now actually outside the park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have time you should go into the park and check out the Stanford family mausoleum. Close by is also the Arizona Cactus Garden and the Angel of Grief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Stanford Mausoleum holds the remains of the Stanford family. The two female sphinxes in the back were originally placed in the front. However the Stanfords didn´t like them and two male sphinxes were placed in the front instead and the other two moved to the back side. Next to the Mausoleum is a statue of the Stanford family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Angel of Grief is dedicated to Jane Lathrop Stanfords brother Henry Lathrop. The statue is a copy of a statue originally found in Rome. There are a number of copies of the statue around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arizona Cactus Garden was originally planted 1880-1883 to be a part of a larger garden adjacent to the planned Stanford estate. However when Leland Stanford Jr died, the plans changed and the University was founded instead. The garden was kept until 1920 when it fell in great disrepair. In 1997 the garden restoration began and is now an ongoing project.</groundspeak:long_description>

This 1.2 mile out and back hike is easy, although there is one short moderate climb. Total elevation change is about 400 feet. Park is open from dawn to dusk. Dogs are permitted on leash only. Fire roads are multi-use, while the park paths are open to hikers and equestrians only. watch out for ticks and poison oak. for more info about the park go to http://www.bahiker.com/southbayhikes/quarry.html or http://www.mpl.sanmateo.org/qpinfo.html </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Blue Lady is the ghost of a woman reportedly seen in and around the Moss Beach Distillery Cafe in Moss Beach, California; she is so-named because she usually dressed all in blue. She is said to originate from the Prohibition era. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; When the Distillery (known in its early years as &quot;Frank's Place&quot;, after its builder and owner, Frank Torres) was first built in 1927, it was one of the main receivers of alcohol that was smuggled into California from ships that supplied liquor from Canada; following Prohibition, the San Francisco area, among other places in the United States, smuggled alcohol into the country in any way possible. As Frank's Place was located on an isolated bluff and was a classy restaurant, it was allegedly never raided by police.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whatever the story, the Blue Lady still frequents the Moss Beach Distillery, sometimes inside the cafe, sometimes wandering in reverie on the bluffs that overlook the sea, her clothing either bloodstained and cut, or intact and clean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is hidden in the parking lot of the Moss Beach Distillery.  This parking lot also serves as a scenic overlook.  Combined this means HEAVY MUGGLE ACTIVITY (and it is visible from the back of the Distillery where the kitchen staff takes breaks). THIS IS A VERY VERY BUSY AREA (SORRY) SO EXTREME STEALTH IS IMPORTANT TO AVOID PATRONS, STAFF, NEIGHBORS, DOG WALKERS, VIEW SEEKERS AND OTHERS,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a real $1 for the FTF and a real $0,25 for the STF  (OK, we are cheap).  Some fake gold coins and insects for all others.  Stop by, sign the log and watch out for ghosts and other spirits (definitely some spirits in the bar).  Also, really cool....the Distillery is dog friendly, so bring the mutts and enjoy the back patio complete with fire pits and blankets with a great Pacific view!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to the Voucher for FTF!   (&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Had to replace cache - no longer a nice sized one.  (darn muggles).  It is a blinkie.</groundspeak:long_description>

Now he not only has to train them; he has to get them to start acting like a unit.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joseph Wladislaw (Charles Bronson) – Sentenced to death by hanging for shooting a deserting officer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the third cache in a series. We have decided to make a 13 cache series (the Dirty Dozen plus the Major) - each one (we believe) evilly difficult or fun to find. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Olivia Noelle for the first to find and log all 13!!!  Congrats to BThomas for the second to find and log.  HMB Lipripper is coming up fast for a possible third.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Camo'd micro...also pretty hidden.  

You may want to bring some music in your MP3 to listen to while searching...it took us awhile and I listened to almost all of Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot; while hiking and placing the cache. I love rock music so it helped pass the time. The mini gc'ers however preferred &quot;She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes&quot;....I heard the hole thing so many times!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&quot;Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eye are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind's eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Flowers for Algernon is a science fiction short story and subsequent novel written by Daniel Keyes. The short story, written in 1958 and first published in the April 1959 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction, won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 1960. The novel was published in 1966 and was joint winner of that year's Nebula Award for Best Novel (with Babel-17).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The titular Algernon is a laboratory mouse who has undergone surgery to increase his intelligence by artificial means. The story is told as a series of progress reports written by Charlie, the first human test subject for the surgery, and touches upon many different ethical and moral themes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a tribute to one of my favorite books I read in elementary school.  It has alot of toys and prizes in a camo'ed box. It is in the corner of a park - there is a dog run nearby so beware of dog-walking muggles.  Please re-hide carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Paco49er on his first cache find!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&quot;The Dark Lord was suddenly aware of him, the Eye piercing all shadows... Its wrath blazed like a sudden flame and its fear was like a great black smoke, for it knew its deadly peril, the thread upon which hung its doom... its thought was now bent with all its overwhelming force upon the Mountain...&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Throughout The Lord of the Rings, &quot;the Eye&quot; (the Red Eye, the Evil Eye, the Lidless Eye) is the image most often associated with Sauron. Sauron's Orcs bore the symbol of the Eye on their helmets and shields, and referred to him as the &quot;Eye&quot; because he did not allow his name to be written or spoken, according to Aragorn (a notable exception to this rule was his emissary, the Mouth of Sauron). Also, the Lord of the Nazgûl threatened Éowyn with torture before the &quot;Lidless Eye&quot; at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Mirror of Galadriel, Frodo had an actual vision of this Eye:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;The Eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself glazed, yellow as a cat's, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;&lt;br/&gt;Later, Tolkien writes as if Frodo and Sam really glimpse the Eye directly, not in any kind of vision. The mists surrounding Barad-dûr are briefly withdrawn, and:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;one moment only it stared out...as from some great window immeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of red, the flicker of a piercing Eye... The Eye was not turned on them, it was gazing north...but Frodo at that dreadful glimpse fell as one stricken mortally.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple cache  in the Tolkien series.  You must be careful of the orcs and trolls around - they are known to spy on cachers and plunder known caches. Being Sauron's Eye it is appropriately placed next to the famous chocolate factory: See's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is magnetic (on one end despite magnets on both ends - so replace so that magnets do hold it).</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Soon the dwindling company, following the Isen, turned west and rode through the Gap into the waste lands beyond, and then they turned northwards, and passed over the borders of Dunland. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Return of the King&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hosts of Mordor, led by the dreaded Witch-king of Angmar, succeed in breaking through the gates of Minas Tirith, but are in turn crushed by the arriving cavalry of Rohan. The battle is also joined by a &quot;black fleet with black sails&quot;. The forces of Mordor initially rejoice at its arrival; and then are horrified to see the banner of the King upon the ships. Aragorn has succeeded in using the Oathbreakers to defeat the Corsairs of Umbar; the men of Gondor who were once slaves on the ships are brought back to fight the host of Mordor. In the following Battle of the Pelennor Fields the Witch-king is slain by Dernhelm, revealed to be Éowyn the niece of King Théoden, with help from Merry. Thus the siege is broken, but at heavy cost: many warriors of Gondor and Rohan fall, among them King Théoden. Denethor immolates himself and Faramir on his funeral pyre, but Gandalf and Pippin succeed in saving Faramir, who is subsequently healed by Aragorn. Aragorn also heals Merry and Éowyn, who were hurt by the Witch-king before he fell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knowing that it is only a matter of time before Sauron rebuilds his forces for another attack, Aragorn and Gandalf decide to draw out the hosts of Mordor with an assault on the Black Gate, providing a distraction so that Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee may have a chance of reaching Mount Doom and destroying the One Ring, unseen by the Eye of Sauron. Gandalf and Aragorn lead an army to the Black Gate of Mordor and lay siege to Sauron's army. The battle begins and the body of a troll he had killed falls onto Pippin, and he loses consciousness just as the Great Eagles arrive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cacher is hidden along KING Drive, although you may find access easier by turning south on Callan and driving to the walled field.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck in the Fields of Pelennor.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please let us know if you agree with the 4.5/4....if not we already have some &quot;fun&quot; ideas to address this.  :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache will offer you a fantastic view of the south and east bay (once you get there).  I tried to place it away from any poison oak, but I am sure there is plenty around so be careful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: EF2MNW9 - 8.5 Stars&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;The final cache.&lt;br/&gt;HC2MNW9 - You can park here and walk to the cache.&lt;br/&gt;N 37° 41.143 W 122° 26.092&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

To me that meant cache supplies and they had ammo boxes.  This is our first ammo box hide.  Nothing tricky, although it is camo'ed a bit.  Fresh log and pen.  Some goodies already in place.  FTF gets choice.  No need to trample any growth - but beware of poison oak, it is all over that mountain.</groundspeak:long_description>

He lives on a farm named Bamfurlong in the Marish region of the Eastfarthing of the Shire. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; When Frodo and his companions found themselves in Farmer Maggot's fields as they made their way to Crickhollow on September 25, 3018 of the Third Age, Maggot remembered Frodo but did not make good on his threat. Instead, the Hobbits were treated to a meal including a dish of mushrooms and bacon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located on a side trail on San Bruno Mountain.  The terrain difficulty is rated high - but you will learn why when you climb back up.  If it is a warm day, bring water.  I spotted two turkey vultures, a red tailed hawk and some hummingbirds in the first 5 minutes I was there.  No nazgul though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Dyknomight for the FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

I told Gandalf I would keep you safe and, safe is where I'll keep you. I believe you will enjoy this next one. It is one of my own compositions. Right, ahem.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Two Towers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frodo and Sam depart for Mordor with the Ring of Power. Boromir dies trying to stop a band of orcs from kidnapping Merry and Pippin. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue the orcs. They travel into the land of Rohan and see that the band of orcs is traveling very quickly toward Isengard, the fortress of the once good wizard, Saruman. They meet Eomer, a marshal of Rohan who hears their tale and offers them horses to look for the hobbits even though his men just killed the orcs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Merry and Pippin are hauled around by the orcs for several days. When the Riders of Rohan surround them, one of the orcs tries to get away with them but is killed. They escape and flee into the forest. There, they meet the ent, Treebeard, who takes them to his home and listens to their stories. He is enraged by the tale of the evils around and gathers the long dormant ents. They elect to rouse the forest and attack Isengard themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This tale continues at San Bruno Mountain under the many antenna TOWERS (more than two but so be it).  The cache is a micro - the log is in a BLINKIE. Good luck and please re-hide carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beware of orcs, nazgul and trolls.</groundspeak:long_description>

Tolkien's Middle-earth universe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; It is located in the heart of the black land of Mordor and approximately 15,553 feet (4.7 km) high. Alternative names, in Sindarin, include Orodruin (&quot;fiery mountain&quot;) and Amon Amarth (&quot;mountain of fate&quot;). The Sammath Naur (&quot;Cracks of Doom&quot;) is a chasm located deep within the mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mountain represents the endpoint of Frodo Baggins' quest to destroy the Ring which is recounted in The Lord of the Rings. The chasm is the site where the One Ring was originally forged by the Dark Lord Sauron and the only place it can be unmade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located on top of our local Mount Doom...well, San Bruno Mountain.  No need to toss in any gold ring.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Watcher in the Water is a fictional creature in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium; lurking in a lake beneath the western walls of the dwarf-realm Moria. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Fellowship located the entrance to Moria: the Doors of Durin. The Doors were protected, allowing no entrance, requiring a password to be spoken. The Fellowship could not enter until Gandalf answered the riddle on the gates. Unknown to the Fellowship, something resided in the lake outside the gates, the &quot;Watcher in the Water&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Watcher attacked Frodo as the Fellowship was about to enter Moria. The creature grasped Frodo with a long, pale green, luminous tentacle. Samwise Gamgee drove the tentacle off with his sword, but twenty other tentacles emerged from the water. The Company retreated into Moria as the tentacles hurled the enormous stone doors shut and uprooted the trees that grew on either side of the entrance. The doors were sealed off, trapping the Fellowship in the mines. The Fellowship had no alternative but to go through the mines and exit them on the other side via the Dimrill Gate. Gandalf and others of the Company noted that the Watcher had grabbed only Frodo, the Ringbearer. Frodo and Gandalf were not sure whether it was one creature or many. As Gandalf commented, &quot;Something has crept or been driven out of the dark water under the mountains. There are older and fouler things than orcs in the deep places of the world.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Watcher in the Waters is watching the entrance to a location of much water.  Be careful not to disturb it or be seen by the muggling orcs.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium features dragons closely based on those of European legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides dragon (derived from French), Tolkien variously used the terms drake (the original English term, from Old English draca, in turn from Latin draco) and worm (from Old English wyrm, &quot;serpent&quot;, &quot;dragon&quot;). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Although he cannot see Bilbo because of the ring, Smaug smells Bilbo and greets him mockingly. Bilbo is smart, though, and answers Smaug only in riddles, which amuses the dragon enough to quell his anger for a while. Cleverly, the hobbit flatters Smaug into displaying his thick-skinned underbelly, revealing an open patch in Smaug’s scaly armor above his left breast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located next to a local restaurant and lounge, the Jade DRAGON.  Like Smaug in the novel, this one may have a weak patch on its underbelly.  Beware of local townfolk.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A cache in honor of the man who gave us the first Oakland Raiders Superbowl win. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; From Wikipedia: John Earl Madden (born April 10, 1936) is a former American professional football player in the National Football League, a former head coach with the Oakland Raiders in the American Football League and later the NFL, and a former color commentator for NFL telecasts. In 2006, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in recognition of his coaching career. He is also widely known for the long-running Madden NFL video game series he has endorsed and fronted since 1988.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Madden broadcast with Pat Summerall in the 1980s and 1990s, on CBS and later Fox. He was also the last color commentator for ABC's Monday Night Football before it moved to ESPN in 2006. His last regular role was as a commentator for NBC Sunday Night Football.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on that success, Madden was hired by Al Davis as linebackers coach for the AFL's Oakland Raiders in 1967, putting him in the Sid Gillman coaching tree. He helped the team reach Super Bowl II that season. A year later, after Raiders head coach John Rauch resigned to take the same position with the Buffalo Bills, Madden was named the Raiders' head coach on February 4, 1969, becoming professional football's youngest head coach at the age of 32.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Madden's Raiders reached and lost five AFC title games in seven years, which left the Raiders with the same image that the Dallas Cowboys had previously had—as a team unable to &quot;win the big one.&quot; Despite a 12–1–1 mark in 1969, the team lost 17–7 to the Kansas City Chiefs in the final American Football League championship game. Three years later, in what appeared to be a last-minute victory over the Steelers instead became a part of football lore when Franco Harris' &quot;Immaculate Reception&quot; gave Pittsburgh a 13–7 win. Then, in 1974, after defeating the two-time, and defending Super Bowl champion Miami Dolphins in dramatic fashion, the Raiders lost again to the Steelers in the AFC Championship game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1976, the Raiders went 13–1 in the regular season, and escaped the first round of the playoffs with a dramatic and controversial victory over the New England Patriots. In the second round of the playoffs they defeated the Steelers for the AFC Championship. On January 9, 1977, Madden's Raiders finally captured their first Super Bowl with a convincing 32–14 win over the Minnesota Vikings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Madden retired as a Super Bowl winning head coach and was the youngest coach ever to reach 100 career regular season victories, a record he compiled in only ten full seasons of coaching at the age of 42.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Madden's overall winning percentage including playoff games ranks second in league history. He won a Super Bowl and never had a losing season as a head coach. Madden has a winning record as a head coach against other future Hall of Fame head coaches&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From CACCBAG: John Madden graduated from Jefferson High School in Daly City, California.  He has since donated the funds to light the school's track and football field - now dubbed &quot;The Madden Lights&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is to recognize his connection with his former high school.  Per Geocaching rules, it is NOT on school property.  However one can easily see Madden's former high school and the Madden Lights from its location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is, I believe, well hidden. The cache container is small and it took effort to place it in its hiding spot. Please use your best efforts to return it to the same spot. Because the area is usually swarming with muggles, stealth is your number one priority.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the First To Find, a special FTF prize.  While you can't retire off of it or even feed a cricket from its sale, it will be unique in its relation to this cache.  The directions for finding the FTF prize are in the cache  (basically turn 180 degrees and look down.....not a bad clue either in finding the cache in case you find the prize first).  It is the easiest terrain accessible to all - thus the one rating.  But finding it may take a little effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Again,  muggles everywhere.  Please be careful in not being seen and re-hiding.  It is NOT on school property and you have no reason to enter school property for this hunt.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Bilbo reluctantly climbs up a tree in Mirkwood forest and breaks through the canopy to the bright light of the sun. He sees thousands of black butterflies and looks at the black emperors for a long time and enjoyed the feel of the breeze in his hair and on his face. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Mirkwood was the great forest east of the Anduin in Wilderland. It was originally called Greenwood the Great until the shadow of Sauron fell over the woods. The forest became dark and filled with evil creatures, but the great Woodland Realm of the Elves endured. During the War of the Ring, Legolas of Mirkwood gained renown as a member of the Fellowship, and after Sauron's downfall the forest was free of the shadow of evil once more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located in a small clearing off a trail on San Bruno Mountain.  Please note there are certain elements of the cache around the GZ.  If you have a child with you please take one (not the cache). You will have to clean off the element a bit - but should be pretty easy. Please post it.  As those elements decrease in number I will replinish.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Bilbo hid his treasure he took from Smaug....can you find it? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In this cache you will need to find Frodo's friend's Merry and Pippin.  They will help lead you to Bilbo's treasure.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find Merry first and he will tell you where Pippin is resting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pippin will be more than happy to tell you where the treasure is....but you need to find him first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get to these caches, you will need to be a an expert at the Hobbit trivia, or bring a copy of the book with you....or be able to view Google through your own palantir.  PLEASE LEAVE THE CLUE SHEETS IN EACH CACHE (you will probably need to bring some paper and a pen to write down the clues). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first cache is not at these coordinates, but nearby.  To get there go here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;37. 41. A B C&lt;br/&gt;122. 27. D A E&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A= The number of years Belladonna Tuck dies after her husband died minus one.&lt;br/&gt;B=Bilbo asked a riddle that had the answer &quot;teeth&quot; - what number was this riddle in his series of riddles  - then add the value of A above?&lt;br/&gt;C= The address of the Gamgees at Bagshot Row plus one.&lt;br/&gt;D=The number of times &quot;eye(s)&quot; is mentioned in the riddle that had &quot;sun&quot; and &quot;daisies&quot; in the answer.&lt;br/&gt;E= The sum for B above minus the value of A above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(If you don't want to or can't figure out the location for Merry's cache, it is in the Hint/Spoiler below.  But you are on your own for the next two&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUM CHECKS (last 3 digits of coords):&lt;br/&gt;Merry N: 19 W: 13&lt;br/&gt;Pippin: N: 14 W: 13&lt;br/&gt;Bilbo's Treasure: N: 12 W: 14&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find both Merry and Pippin and then find Bilbo.  If you do this, Bilbo will offer to share his treasure with you.  If you look around at the first two caches, you might spot Merry at one and Pippin at the other.  THEY ARE NOT THE CACHES - so no need to move them or even touch them.  They are there to guard the caches and to help you on your quest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I took no less than 3 measurements at each location with the Garmin. I tried to confirm with Google Earth but, as you will see, on site tree cover made that almost useless. The caches are located at trees (base, trunk, roots, etc.).  Feel free to write us with any questions, coord guesses, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the each cache location, please be very aware of muggles strolling near the cache.  Hobbits are very quiet while the Big People are loud and very nosy and they can sneak up on you.  Pippin's cache is the most visible, but of course it is Bilbo's treasure that must be guarded with all stealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final cache has a One Ring to rule them all for the FTF, STF and TTF....(yes, we know...three people each get the One Ring.   But you are looking for hobbits so don't question our reasoning).  I tried to clear all briars away and do not believe there is poison oak near, but please be careful in case I missed any.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is also a Lord of the Rings geocoin and an Alphonse travel bug......................and tons of gold, gems, jewels, and other treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be careful with the caches and please re-hide carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: BT2FY23 - The Tolkien Series - Bilbo's Treasure&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: PI2FY23 - Pippin's Cache&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S12FY23 - Merry's Cache - GC2FY23 Stage 1&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Merry's cache.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

'Cobwebs!' he said. 'Is that all? Cobwebs! But what a spider! have at 'em! Down with 'em!'&lt;br/&gt;    In a fury he hewed at them with his sword, but the thread that he struck did not break. It gave a little and then sprang back like a plucked bowstring, turning the blade and tossing up both sword and arm. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; There agelong she had dwelt, an evil thing in spider-from, even such as once of old had lived in the Land of the Elves in the West that is now under the Sea, such as Beren fought in the Mountains of Terror in Doriath, and so came to Lúthien upon the green sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight long ago. How Shelob came there, flying from ruin, no tale tells, for out of the Dark Years few tales have come. But still she was there, who was there before Sauron, and before the first stone of Barad-Dûr; and she served none but herself, drinking the blood of Elves and Men, bloated and grown fat with endless brooding over her feasts, weaving webs of shadow; for all living things were her food, and her vomit darkness.Hardly had Sam hidden the light of the star-glass when she came. A little way ahead and to his left he saw suddenly, issuing from a black hole of shadow under the cliff, the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld, horrible beyond the horror of an evil dream. Most like a spider she was, but huger than the greatest hunting beasts, and more terrible than they because of the evil purpose in her remorseless eyes. Those same eyes that he had thought daunted and defeated, there they were lit with a fell light again, clustering in her out-thrust head. Great horns she had, and behind her short stalk-like neck was her huge swollen body, a vast bloated bag, swaying and sagging between her legs; its great bulk was black, blotched with livid marks, but the belly underneath was pale and luminous and gave forth a stench. Her legs were bent, with great knobbed joints high above her back, and hairs that stuck out like steel spines, and at each leg's end there was a claw.&lt;br/&gt;    As soon as she had squeezed her soft squelching body and its folded limbs out of the upper exit from her lair, she moved with a horrible speed, now running her creaking legs, now making a sudden bound</groundspeak:long_description>

He was bald and nearly blind and hardly able to fly, but he remembered the tales his father had told him about the friendship between the ravens and the Dwarves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Thorin led the company to the Front Gate and out to Ravenhill. There they met an old Raven named Roac who told Thorin that Smaug was dead. Roac also brought the news that the Lake-men and the Wood-elves were coming to the Lonely Mountain seeking a share in the treasure. Roac advised Thorin to trust Bard of Lake-town, but Thorin was angry at the thought of anyone trying to claim part of the treasure. He asked Roac to send for help from Dain Ironfoot in the Iron Hills, and then Thorin &amp; Company returned to the Lonely Mountain and began to fortify the Front Gate.</groundspeak:long_description>

R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. He was first introduced in the author's fantasy novel The Hobbit, and later became an important supporting character in its sequel, The Lord of the Rings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gollum was a Stoor Hobbit of the River-folk, who lived near the Gladden Fields. They loved the river, and often swam in it, or made little boats of reeds. Smeagol (aka Gollum) was the most inquisitive and curious-minded of the family. He was interested in roots and beginnings; he dived deep into pools; he burrowed under trees and growing plants; he tunnelled into green mounds; and he ceased to look up at the hill-tops, or the leaves on trees, or the flowers opening in the air: his head and eyes were downward. He had a friend called Deagol, sharper-eyed but not so quick and strong. Once they took a boat and went down to the Gladden Fields, where there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally known as Sméagol, he was later named Gollum after his habit of making a horrible swallowing noise in his throat. His life was extended far beyond its natural limits by the effects of possessing the One Ring, and he became obsessed with the Ring that had enslaved him, to the point that he pursued the Ring for the rest of his life after losing it to Bilbo Baggins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gollum had lived under the Misty Mountains for centuries, living on a small island in the centre of a lake at the roots of a mountain. He survived on cave fish, which he caught from his small boat, and small goblins who strayed too far from the stronghold of the Great Goblin. Over the years, his eyes adapted to the dark and became 'lamp-like', shining with a sickly pale light in the dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of his riddles to Bilbo was:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alive without breath,&lt;br/&gt;As cold as death;&lt;br/&gt;Never thirsty, ever drinking,&lt;br/&gt;All in mail never clinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a blinkie.  There are gold Middle Earth coins for the first 5 to find (one each please).  Please please use stealth and re-hide carefully!!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Bring a towel, but you don't need to swim. I believe Gollum would take a boat to the center of a lake and catch fish by hand. You won't need a boat though.

Legolas, son of the King Thranduil of Mirkwood, is the Prince of Mirkwood, and also a messenger, and master Bowman. With his keen eyesight, sensitive hearing, and excellent bowmanship, Legolas was a valuable resource to the other eight members of the Fellowship. His age is never stated by Tolkien but is estimated by some to be between 500 and 3,000 years old. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the destruction of the One Ring and of Sauron, the tree-loving Legolas and the stone-loving dwarf Gimli went off traveling together through Fangorn Forest and then later traveled to the Glittering Caves at Aglarond as he and Gimli had agreed. Eventually, Legolas came to Ithilien with some of his people, with his father's leave, to live out his remaining time in Middle-earth helping to restore the devastated forests of that war-ravaged land.</groundspeak:long_description>

This means - STEALTH!  The cache is full (really full) of toys and goodies.  It is a camo'd plastic container. Please be very cautious grabbing and re-hiding so that this cache lasts a long time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF gets a real money $5 bill.  STF gets a real money $1 bill.  Log is there but I forgot to include a writing instrument so you may wish to bring your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tree cover was playing tricks with our GPS but you should be able to locate - despite the many possible hiding spots.  We never actually found the prior cache as it was muggled prior to us locating it but I believe it is not the same hide.</groundspeak:long_description>

(Parking my be tough, so if you have to park down the hill and walk up - add a star to the rating ....in your mind anyway)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tree cover is bad so we hope the coords are good (used 4 measurements and averaged them and 2 were identical and one only 2 seconds off).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, to help, look for a headless tree.  Although there is ivy everywhere, this one is basically not an ivy hide (mostly).</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Really, you want have to search in ivy plants, but you may have to push some aside.


The title.......but don't pull it please.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I decided to borrow the name and place a cache at a much superior law school (no bias of course....just because I got my law degree from this one).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is not on school property, but you will have a front row view of the many soon-to-be lawyers studying,  Use extreme stealth - people coming from St I chrcurch across the street and other muggles have a clear view.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A small cache with a view of Liguria Bakery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; My grandparents went here, my parents went here, now I go here.  They sell one thing and one thing only: foccacia bread.  Foccacia is an Italian flatbread with various toppings.  This small hole in the wall makes the best foccacia.  We have traveled through Italy including the Liguria region itself and tasted various foccacia - but this old family establishment makes the best.  They will be celebrating their 100 year anniversary in 2011.  (Note: The cache is not in the bakery, touching the bakery or even on the same block as the bakery so there is no need to buy anything....but the bakery is in full view from the GZ). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the day before Thanksgiving and the day before Christmas people line up to purchase their foccacia for the holiday meals.  If the bakery opens at 8, the line starts forming before 5:00am and by 8:00 it is two blocks long.  I placed this cache after getting our Christmas foccia this morning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is in Washington Square park. That is across from Saint Peter and Paul Church and just downhill from Coit Tower. If you are lucky you will see the wild parrots of Telegraph Hill that fly around the park. Info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Parrots_of_Telegraph_Hill &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a camo'd bison tube.  In the early morning many people are there doing exercises, so you may want to avoid the muggle-heavy time.  But no matter what time you go, there will be many many muggles - that adds to the difficulty rating.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLEASE USE EXTREME STEALTH - AND PLEASE PLACE IT BACK EXACTLY WHERE YOU FOUND IT.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>In the smaller trees that make a &quot;hedge&quot; - behind the middle bench but on the sidewalk side, there should be a black rodent trap by your right foot.  Above eye level..</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Lagoc became a pro-bono human rights attorney, representing those who could not afford a legal voice. Perhaps he was, in his own way, a bridge over trouble waters?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And yes, he and his wife, Geocacher La, enjoyed the Simon and Garfunkel song of the same title (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVDg8fVC4EQ), even going so far as to buy a DVD of one of their concerts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope to live up to his example through my own work and actions. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">One key to a better brain is exercise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My late father-in-law, Atty. Rodolfo G. Lagoc was a brilliant man. Part of this I attribute to his being so wide read. There was nothing he couldn't debate me on. He'd run circles around my arguments and English wasn't even his primary language!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think about him a lot as I run Lake Merritt. He had just moved in near the Lake with his wife, Lola Jules when he was taken ill. While he was able to walk some of the Lake, he never made it all the way around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This geocache series will honor him and some of the achievements from his life. His life was full and rich but not without hardship (i.e., 6 months as a political prisoner under Marcos). To that end, the caches in this series will range from easy to hard. C'mon, we've all found enough 1/1 LPCs, haven't we? In the words of Emeril, let's kick it up a notch! We miss you, Lolo!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this cache, the idea is simple. Exercise is another way to improve brain function. Don't believe me? Then read it here - http://tinyurl.com/exercise-brain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having said that, you will exercise getting to this cache. As geocacher Spongehead points out, situational awareness is key as water does not mix well with electronics and geocachers. Says my favorite geocaching witch, water does not go well with a nice new pair of shoes either. Also, iPhone coordinates are not very tight. Use a GPS or your wand.</groundspeak:long_description>

Lagoc, I never knew him to fear anything. Even as he lay dying at Oakland's Summit Hospital (OX3B3FH), he did not fear dying. Indeed, he told me, in no uncertain terms, that he saw deceased relatives in the room and they were welcoming him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That I might be so brave. But what do you do when you fear something? My personal mantra is, &quot;Fight the fear&quot;. When my favorite young geocacher, Spongehead was unwilling to tackle the indoor climbing wall at the Boy Scout Center in San Leandro because of his fear of heights, I told him that my own way of dealing with my fear of heights was to tackle it head on. I did not let my fear of heights keep me from climbing trees, scaling walls, etc. In short, I told him to &quot;fight the fear&quot;. Together, he and I (me in wizard robes and full suit) climbed the indoor wall, up fifty feet to find the stuffed Garfield, dressed in a Cub Scout uniform, no less. And when Spongehead and I faced the prospect some years later of climbing a seventy-five foot muddy ladder with no safety gear and only sharp rocks below to &quot;cushion&quot; our fall, we looked at each other and said, &quot;Fight the fear&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those of you without fears, I tip my hat to you. For the rest of us, &quot;Fight the fear&quot;. Do not let anything hold you back. In case you feel discombobulated when you are done with this cache, go across the street to Inline Chiropractic and tell Dr. Irwin what a mean person I am. She will fix you up. Coordinates are a bit jumpy with the tree line but focus on the D/T ratings.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">My late father-in-law, Attorney Rodolfo G. Lagoc was amused at the polar opposites one can find in Oakland. For example, at the waypoint, you will see what remains of a public statue. This is not one of Oakland's shining moments when you see the graffiti on the base. You might even wonder where the statue went, why it hasn't been replaced, and who or what the statue was of. My initial research has not revealed the answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet in the same vein, as you approach GZ, you will see Oakland's well-maintained lawn bowling area. There is even a lawn bowling club you can join.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And that is Oakland. Some great spots to visit and then some head-scratcher places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache reflects the polar opposites of the title. The D/T is 1/5. There is a traditional log in the cache (reflecting a well-prepared geocacher) and Post-it notes (reflecting a cacher who needed to quickly improvise).</groundspeak:long_description>

We met in Singapore while on training for our respectives management positions at Citibank. On our first weekend together, she told me about a favorite MBA teacher, Father James Donlan who would say, &quot;God writes straight with crooked lines&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In thinking about the career of my father-in-law, I often wondered how different it would have been if he had not been locked up as a political prisoner under then Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. What heights could he have scaled to if not for this? But as he would often remind me, he was happy with how his life turned out and the change he was able to affect through his work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In strolling (wheezing?) around Lake Merritt, I have often been intrigued by the crooked tree branches near the Lake. Indeed, they are crooked but they support the tree just as a straight branch would do.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">My late father-in-law, Attorney Rodolfo G. Lagoc was a labor judge in the Philippines. In one case being tried before his bench, he was hounded by an attorney representing the defense. The attorney wanted my father-in-law to decide in favor of the defense and was willing to pay whatever was needed to do so. In fact, the attorney called repeatedly, each time offering more and more. While such behavior may seem odd to the casual observer of the US judicial system (Al Capone, not withstanding), it was common back then in the Philippines. While presented with a choice, my father-in-law did the right/ moral/ ethical thing/ made his choice and decided the case based on the merits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While I cannot (and have no desire to) create such ethical dilemas/ moral choices in the geocaching world, I can offer you a different kind of choice. Do you wish to approach GZ from the lower path or the upper path? Approaching from the lower path is harder but perhaps more stable. An approach from the upper path can easily result in you taking a header down to the lower path. Also, if your GPS is jumpy or if you use a mobile phone for your GPS device, you may find with an upper path approach that you get way too close to Children's Fairyland. Any of you who have cached with me know that I steer clear of kid's areas. Please do likewise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After finding the cache, please replace the cammo. Need some more? Shouldn't be too hard to find some. The trees make the signal choppy. Taking a page out of Berkeley Boomers' book, I averaged my Garmin eTrex readings to come up with what I did.</groundspeak:long_description>

Bring the kids along, it's a nice hike.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Rest in peace, Lolo. He was an attorney and a judge. He was an advocate for poor. He was a voice for downtrodden. 12/18/35 - 2/7/12, 2:04 AM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My father-in-law, Atty. Rodolfo G. Lagoc has done a lot of good work for the underdog as an activist judge in the Philippines. However, he has not done a lot of good work for himself. He's enjoyed the good life and now is paying the price. He was admitted to this fine facility on 12/3/11. It is not looking good for him. As I stayed in the emergency room with him, I thought of geocaching and looked around for a suitable cache. Voila!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why do I geocache? Exercise primarily. Secondarily, to relieve stress. It is amazing how a magnetic key holder on a stop sign can clear up a bad day at the office or a 2 AM night at the hospital.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take care of yourselves, fellow cachers. Take care of yourselves. Exercise. Watch your diet. Stay healthy. If not, the alternative is in clear view of the cache and trust me, that is not fun. I can speak to that from first-hand experience now. As I think about the patients in the hospital and this cache, I am reminded of the sad state of the dad in the official Dixie Chicks video for the song, Top of the World. &quot;Wanna grab a hold of a little song bird. Take her for a ride to the...&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As to the cache, while it is not sterile (obviously), it was not used for nefarious purposes. It can hold pathtags, small trinkets, and tiny TBs. It is available from 5 AM to 12 midnight. Kudos to Panda Ellie and N3urom4ncer for the FTF at 6:10 AM. Enjoy and cache on!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Weirdness on the Albany Bulb. Terrain is a fairly easy walk of about 1 km. This small cache is the fifth-generation cache in this place; the previous four were pillaged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: since 2011, there are a large number of homeless camps on the 'Bulb. If you're uncomfortable with that situation, bring a friend or two and stick to daylight hours and weekends. I've never had any trouble with any of the people out there (then again, I'm a 6'4&quot; 215 lb male); better safe than sorry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a nice bike ride or easy hike across the meandering landscape that is the Albany Bulb. This ex-industrial waste dump is now a park littered with bizarre and beautiful artwork.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have a camera, bring your telephoto lens for pictures of the avian life, and bring your regular lens for pictures of the crazy sculptures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you locate the cache, you'll probably want to inspect the array of constructions nearby on the north end of the peninsula. (Low tide recommended!) On the northwest and north edges of the 'Bulb, you'll find all kinds of good stuff!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a camo-taped small-sized cache, but with enough room for a few goodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(This cache used to be called Bullsi, due to a large painting of a target nearby. The cache was stolen, and the owner moved far away. I replaced it with a new cache called Stay on Target, so-named for the same nearby painting. The nearby painting had since been painted over with faces. Then a skatepark was built, and the slab was removed and the cache, which had been chained below it, was pillaged; so I put a new cache on a nearby overlook. And then, as if the story could possibly be over, the cache was pillaged again from the overlook. The beautiful and lovingly-crafted skatepark, too, has been demolished, probably by the State which recently acquired the land--that's just not right, I say, even if the skaters were in any way responsible for the original pillaging. After the economic bust, more people starting living on the 'Bulb, and someone set up camp right next to the cache, which was eventually stolen in early 2012. And that leads us to today's present location!)</groundspeak:long_description>

I thought I was going down the Halloween trail but I ended up going straight down a dirt road. Along the way I found a beautiful place for a new cache. It over looks the golf course and there are no caches in this area. a nice hike up but a hard hike down.</groundspeak:long_description>

Maybe others will add their own caches to this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a reliable cacher DNFed this listing I checked my position listing in google earth and it looked good So i went back with all of my GPSr to get a real position. &lt;br/&gt;The rino with current firmware was 5 feet to the east. My Iphone was 46 feet north east. The Garmin legend was like the Iphone 36 feet north east. The worst was the Garmin Etrex was 86 feet all over the place. I took 8 marks 20 feet apart in all directions and averaged them to the new location.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; ~ 6 squirrels, quartered&lt;br /&gt;
~ 6 oz your favorite dry rub&lt;br /&gt;
~ 3 tbsp salt&lt;br /&gt;
~ 2 tsp pepper&lt;br /&gt;
~ 9 oz your favorite BBQ sauce&lt;br /&gt;
~ 3 tsp garlic powder&lt;br /&gt;
~ 5 tsp onion powder&lt;br /&gt;
~ 2 large handfuls hickory chips&lt;br /&gt;
~ a dozen or so charcoal briquettes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In a large pot, boil the squirrel in water seasoned with the salt,
pepper, garlic powder and onion powder for 1 hour or until
tender.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the meantime, soak the hickory chips in water. Light the
charcoal and let them get white hot. Place them to one side of your
grill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remove the squirrel from the water and pat dry. Coat with your
favorite dry rub.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Add one handful of wood chips to the hot coals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Place squirrel on grill across from the hot coals. Cover and smoke
for 1 hour. Add a handful of wood chips every half hour.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Add last of the wood chips and baste squirrel with BBQ sauce.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Smoke for another half hour basting another 3 - 4 times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Serve with mashed potatoes, sweet corn and buttermilk
biscuits.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Quick park, maybe not a quick grab? First cache in what I hope to be a series.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache features a great view from GZ and no xenergyx endorsed &quot;Sonoma County Vista&quot; could be called number 1 without a glimpse of Mt. St Helena towering over all. The view features the rolling hills of West Sonoma County and of course the grand Sonoma Mountain itself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is plenty of room to park on the northbound side of the road, and if you planned to CITO but forgot a bag there is even a trash can!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You may choose to bring a camera during the green season for some extra special shots.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After you grab the cache, you can head south for about a quarter mile and on the right side of the road on the far side of the fence is some exposed lengths of old road. I have marked the exposed road as 2 additional waypoints. It's something you dont see very often.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache itself is just big enough to hold a log and my 2 cents.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please be careful as cache is delicate and replace exactly as found.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Watch for cars and barbed wire...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy the view, and the cache!&lt;br /&gt;

This cache is fairly easily accessible with only a 1/4 mile hike uphill on a paved road. It will only require you to step off the path a few feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do not worry when you are beginning your journey, the signs are merely warning you are responsible for your own injuries. This is a common walking path that connects to many different points in the surrounding neighborhoods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you visit on a clear day, walk slow and take in the view of Sonoma Mountain to the East and Mt St Helena in the distance to the North. The elevation is only around 300ft, but the paths here give the best view of Petaluma and the surrounding mountains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At GZ you a looking for a nano, camouflaged, which is only viewable from a certain angle. Be sure to bring a pen of course and please replace exactly as found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*** NOTE: After hearing from a few fellow cachers, I though I would add - cache is not located on the wrong side of the fence! ***</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">It's now been two years since Julie (Cheryl-MuggleN0More) and I (Zop)had to actually admit to all of our Geocaching friends that yes.. We are a couple :-) Funny how most of you knew it before we did!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since then we've racked up some 4000 fun and challanging hides and a whole bunch of not so fun or challanging hides. Today to celebrate these two awesome years, we decided to take a short Kayak ride in the Walker Creek and decided to leave a fun little surprise behind for the rest of you thrill seekers to tackle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you look at the cords with Google Earth, Yes, that's pretty darn accurate! So.. Plan accordingly! You will need a way to get there and we recommend high tide! You will then also need to either have a long grabbing tool or have the spirit of a simian (and the agility too!) to retreive this cache and to replace exactly as found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The difficult rating is because of the inherent danger associated with retreival and replacement, the Terrain rating is because you will need some sort of watercraft or be a fairly adept swimmer.&lt;br/&gt;Photos of your adventures are welcomed and encouraged!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We accessed the creek with our Kayaks about .40 miles up the creek from GZ at the Key's Creek Fishing lot. You probably can too.&lt;br/&gt;As always, be safe and have a blast!</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cache itself is a grey magnetic keyholder. Coordinates were averaged from several readings in multiple dimensions. Finding the cache is not hard it should be visible from GZ at the right angle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Getting to it is the trickier part, but definitely is doable with the right level of ninja skill. Stealth is also required, as people do walk and ride bikes down this path frequently.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several tools you can use, and while I don’t mind if you bring a friend as a booster, I encourage summoning the ninja within.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what will it be?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Are you strictly a team effort kind of ninja?&lt;br /&gt;
Will you be the more ingenuitive and resourceful ninja?&lt;br /&gt;
Or will you be the extreme, old school, no holds barred type?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your fate rests in your own hands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since the cache has no camo, I know it may be muggled, so consider this also a test of your ninja response time!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please make note of the position the cache is in, and try to replace exactly as found, so it will not be overly obvious.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy, have fun, and BE CAREFUL!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Had a fun time-- this was our first geocache. My husband climbed through the shrubbery for us to get to the box. He did comment that there was some animal scat on top of the box... I guess that adds to the camoflage? My son (almost 3) was excited to get a treasure (a purple carabiner clip thingee). Our youngest son (4 months) just enjoyed the ride. And no, we didn't get any ticks. : )</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;Hello, my name is Iola (a.k.a. YoYo) and I've
got an easy puzzle for you!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is not at the posted coordinates. You must study the
pictures of my furry friends to figure out the actual coordinates
for the cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During certain times of the day you'll have to
use your best stealth techniques as there will be many muggles. The
cache is a camo'd altoids tin with room for small trade items.. and
as my owners always say bring your own pen/cil.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now go get it and remember never bite the mailman! Good puppy
dog!&lt;/p&gt;

What a pleasant surprise!!! I woke up to a cat fight out side my window this morning and a neighbor's pooch singing the blues - What else am I going to do but shrug it off and head down stairs to get a cup of coffee and check my email?

Well, the kids are still in bed, a new puzzle pops up just a short ride away and I'm just wondering what all these pictures could mean!?!? Then it hits me!!  I'm off to the shower then on down the road!

The hide? Well... what can be said that won't give it away but WELL DONE!!!  The area was quite busy even at 8:00 AM this morning! People coming and going on foot, bike, car and truck! I even feigned using the establishment and even bought a paper!

Took nothing and left only my ink on the scroll - oops! And a U4D TB. I thought for sure Noyo Knots would have been here and gone but I was treated to a brand new scroll!

TFTH!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Enjoy the view of the Petaluma Valley, and look for the dominant features in the distance. Mt. Tamalpais, the skyscrapers of San Francisco and the Bay Bridge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now that you've got the scenic view wrapped up, it's time to get serious.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Container is log only.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I hope you have brought your cacher's kit with the works, as there is no telling what instruments you will need in order to sign the log. A simple pen will not suffice in this situation. It's a long drive up so be sure to bring everything you may need and then some to retrieve the cache on your first try.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please note placement when retrieving the cache and replace exactly as found to ensure the next cacher has the same experience.&lt;br /&gt;

to gain what you need.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Enter Agent Otto Von.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly trained communications specialist yet
bumbling oaf of a secret agent from a little known country, located
somewhere between Chaos and Order. His pursuers call him Agent
“0” Yes, that’s a Zero, Not an Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otto Von seems like such an unlikely character
to pull off such an important task but it appears that he has
managed to stay one step ahead of the local G-Men who have been hot
on his trail since capturing his trusty comrade, Flash Override,
also known as Agent “A”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before Agent “A” was
captured, he somehow managed to get a message to Agent
“0” who has been artfully dodging the authorities ever
since. Luckily for you however, the bumbling oaf “0”
seems to have dropped a note on which we believe to be some sort of
cryptic instructions on how to find the location of a secret
drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several minutes of bell torture, Agent
“A” gave up this tidbit of information: N38º 20.ABC
W122º 41.DEF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now need your skills to decipher this note
and locate the secret drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
A = SP0+1IGS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
B = YH1+1FDN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
C = VLA+1DEM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
D = NWP+1HSP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
E = NYS+1C0W&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
F = PS0+1B0X&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mission is to crack this code and find
the area where Agent “0” is heading for his drop and
leave him a little note letting him know that we are on to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and make it back safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hints may be posted soon&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Who says I cannot get ready for a special occasion in 5 minutes!? Heck when a 5/5 FTF is the finale I'll get ready in 3!All day long I was wondering who would get this cache first... By 3:45 I texted Zop to see if anyone had posted a find log yet. Once I learned there had not been the clock to get home from work could not have moved slower. I squirmed in my desk chair from 4 until I could leave. When I did I was so excited! Then I got behind drivers (EVERY ONE OF THEM!) who drove 40 mph. I usually take my commute at 60! So I chillaxed and spent my commute meditating and visualizing the cache. Once I had two feet inside our home Zop and I left to get this thing! We are not dilly dalliers. We drove up the GZ and there were two people with cute dogs loitering. They kept looking up at the sky and looking down at their GPSrs. OH! NO! Geocachers are already here! Zop and I decided to walk right past them as I stowed GPS and other TOTTS needed for this cache in my slacks pockets. Zop and I then walked to another place that we thought would help us get a better angle on the cache and we saw something we DID NOT EXPECT. We walked right back to the car post haste so I could get a change of clothes. I was not happy. I had waited long enough. (MIND you Zop had waited even longer for me to get home from work so we could get this one together so I have nothing to complain about. Thank you Zop.)We did our best to walk back to Stango Bango nonchalant but as we drove away one of the cachers at GZ gave us a knowing acknowledgement. The race was ON! Zop got me back home and I changed clothes faster than Clark Kent to change into Superman! I would say we were back where we wanted to be in less than 12 minutes. Then we went for it. When we did quite a crowd formed asking what we were doing and taunted and rooted us on. It was not an easy thing to do and their presence bolstered my conviction. We were not coming away with this without a find. NO WAY. NO HOW. Not with a crowd. Once we did finally find it I felt like we were on top of the world. The crowd was amazed and curious and quite honest concerned. WTF must have been at the forefront of their minds. Once we were done we had the pleasure of meeting the cacher with the knowing glance that was there when we arrived. Atomic Dog, it was a pleasure to meet you. What an EPIC cache. This is up there with THE BEST caches to date. Mr. Moo you have impressed me to no end. You have set a bar for geocaching and yourself. Thank you with all of my wacky geocaching filled heart. Thank you.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow!! I’ve got to hand it to you Mr. Moo!! You have definitely raised the bar for the Rohnert Park geocachers!!

Cheryl-MuggleN0More and I came by here shortly after the cache was published last night and pretty thoroughly searched some of the likely areas but then the cold and the late hour got the best of us.

We vowed to return again today once we both came home from work and that’s just what we did!

When we first arrived today, there was Atomic Dog and Aiko’s dad searching diligently in the same areas we searched last night. Being that we were still more or less on a recon mission to confirm my hunch, we shamefully avoided letting them in on our quest. Once we found the right spot though, we quickly realized that we were not quite as equipped as we wanted to be so we took off back home and as we passed again, there was Atomic Dog letting us know that we were seen!! It’s those cache page pics we frequently upload that gave us away for sure .
Anyway, we zipped on home, got what we needed and snuck back on in from a different angle and made our attempt. Well, as luck would have it, we were seen… Not only by a handful of Muggelettes, but Atomic Dog was still on the scene and came over after we were well under way. 
After struggling our way to GZ and keeping ourselves as safe as possible... I have so much more to say about that adventure but maybe later once this has been found a few times as to not give too much away. So.. There we were! There was the geocache! We did it! We found our way there! Only.. Since you placed the hide, a fat juicy Black Widow has made that spot her home! 
Yes! This one is definitely going to be difficult for some. Being a former Black Widow owner, (RIP Alice) they don’t really bother me much anymore so I volunteered to be the sacrificial lamb and reached out for the grab. 
After congratulating each other, we could hear from afar, the others who dared not follow, also speak a word of congrats. Or did they call us crazy? I dunno.. It’s kind of hard to tell at that distance 

So after signing the virgin log, we trudged back the way we came trying to avoid all the pitfalls along the way. Once back on safe ground it was very nice to meet Atomic Dog who was still there rooting for us. Sorry to see that we missed Aiko’s Dad yet again. Perhaps one day soon.
Fear not about the Mugglettes though, they made it pretty clear that they in NO WAY wanted to follow our footsteps 

Mr. Moo, thank you for the awesome FTF adventure!! This one seriously earned a favorite point for the both of us! Keep up the good work! If you had half as much fun placing this as we did finding it, you must have had a BLAST!</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt; 5/6/09 - Please do not park at the cemetary! The
owner of the road would like to keep the way clear at all times.
Instead, please park near the mailboxes near the included coords.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been looking around the area for a nice location for a
cache when I stumbled upon this little known plot of forgotten
history… After finding out about this place and confirming that
even though the large road sign on your left as you enter the dirt
road states private, public access is allowed as far as you need to
go. In fact, you will most likely notice the sign just a bit
further down the lane that advises you to go no further. The
location will be obvious once you get there and you will park on
the shoulder near the Spring Hill sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please do &lt;u&gt;NOT&lt;/u&gt; visit this site at night as lights will
certainly draw attention.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Once you have found this little plot, you will want to wander a bit
and read a little about many of those who passed before you. CITO
is welcomed and my research has taught me that volunteer clean-up
crews visit annually! For them, let’s help keep this place as nice
as can be. While I had considered making this one an evil puzzle, a
second thought convinced me to make this cache as easy as possible
as to not raise too much attention to those who come looking. The
hint will be a spoiler so avoid it is you want any challenge. As
always, BYOP, maybe a little swag and have fun! Watch your
step!&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK1PFR3 - PLEASE PARK NEAR HERE&lt;br /&gt;N 38° 23.768 W 122° 51.803&lt;br /&gt;PARKING - Please park near the mailboxes and walk in - only a few hundred feet.</groundspeak:long_description>

Its purpose was initially to be the container for that cache. Well, once at the top, it was noted that there no less than four other ammo cans in the crowd and they were all bigger! So..  Back down the mountain it goes to show up here on another little hill dwarfed by St. Helena off in the distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trail to get to this cache will not be an easy one to find if you go the same way I did. I came in from the North off Marsh Trail but ventured South at one of the switchbacks only to find a hidden trail that used to be a road by the looks of it. Anyway, follow this road on up to the trail that takes you to the top of a knoll near N38 25.150 W122 37.900 that overlooks Santa Rosa and the Bennett Valley. Take a look around, this is a great area to take some pictures. From there follow your GPS. The trail narrows and eventually you will find a gate and fence separating the parklands from private property. DO NOT CROSS THE FENCE. Take a break right here though. I sure needed one.&lt;br/&gt;Just around to the left, you will spot a narrow trail that will take you to the Bennett Rest Stop or some alien crop circle made of stone at 38 24.795 122 37.458. The trek here only took me about 1.5 hours from my parking spot on Sky Crest. Sit down and enjoy the serenity of the area. Once you're rested up go find this ammo can and sign in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To keep this one a 2 difficulty, you will receive no hints.</groundspeak:long_description>

So please be quiet when looking for the cache.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to DadFish for the heads up on this placement issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A First to Find Kupin is awaiting.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hidden in the trees of
the Youth Community Park of Santa Rosa Ca. is a little bike play
ground where the dirt is shaped for air. Where only the Girls
ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other places
to ride in this park and once a year there is a mud fest ride
through this area but even they don’t go for this
air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to “The
Girly Jumps” A place where Xgames
could be held or might be some day. I wonder. This area was shaped
by the city for the youth in this area but I can’t find a
single story about this playground of air. Where supergirl was perfected and I bet the first
360’ back flip was tried. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;       
Ok now for why you’re here. The
Cache. GZ is right above the cache use your geosence to find the most likely place for a large
Costco trail mix container. Do everything you can to keep this
camoed to the max just like the air I
want pictures of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;       
So get out there and get some air on “The Girly
Jumps!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special Girly jumps
Kupin for the FTF on this
one.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We found this trail, which we had never walked before, and sure enough found a spot that would work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a small lock n lock with room for small trade items and is hidden in a pretty common style for this area.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Tales from the Crypt - A Geocachers story...
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Many years ago I was visiting the Mt. Olivet Cemetery in my home
town of Terra Linda with two of my friends. Shortly after paying
respects to my father who had been laid to rest there some 15 years
earlier, three of us walked about admiring the crypts and tombs in
the moonlight. Oh.. Did I mention that it was about 2:00 AM?
Well... to make a long story short, my two friends just happened to
be aspiring singers! Well, I really did not know just how good the
were in song so they decided to show me. The began an incredible
harmonic &quot;Don't try suicide&quot; by Queen. Needless to say, I was blown
away! As I stood there with my jaw somewhere near my belt line we
heard a rather peculiar sound from the tree area below...
&lt;p&gt;Apparently a (mall) security guard from Northgate was not
exactly where he should have been at 2:00 AM and was startled awake
by the singing - And he he must not have been very comfortable with
the singing emanating and reverberating from the crypts above where
he was trying to take a nap and he took off in QUITE the hurry!!!
Well, true story and all, this really has very little to do with a
cache in a similar cemetery so far to the north but it had me
thinking. This is not an ALR cache as they are no longer permitted
but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not share a little Cemetery story with us in your logs. Be
it comical, serious, or even just a fond or fearful memory, we'd
all love to hear about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be looking for a Decon at ground level nowhere near a
grave in this nice quiet little corner of Mt. Olive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no posted hours but use your good sense to visit at a
time where you can enjoy all of the sights (and sounds) of this
peaceful place.&lt;/p&gt;
By the way, the main gates are always closed. You access the
cemetery another 200 feet to the SW of the main gate.
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and be safe!&lt;/p&gt;
Favorite log so far:
&lt;p&gt;June 25 by mytachem (3081 found) After arriving in kilt et al to
pipe at a graveside service for someone I didn't know, I noticed
the vault ready to be placed in the grave by several nearby workers
and also some on-lookers standing, waiting for the service. I began
to play my soul out : &quot;Going Home&quot;, &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot;,
&quot;Amazing Grace&quot;. I felt I had provided a wonderful send-off. I paid
my respects and slowly walked away. Then I heard a nearby on-looker
turn to another and say, &quot;Well, I've been putting in septic tanks
for 30 years, and I've never seen anything like this before!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Finally the grave diggers started filling in the grave thinking this would encourage the family to move onto the wake. Instead the great grandchildren (all 10+) ran forward and waved like the were waving a Mickey Mouse at Disneyland cooing &quot;Bye Bye Grandma!&quot; The grave digger's jaws dropped as they paused until the family gathered up the young ones. It was time to celebrate the Matriarch of a loving family with a BBQ, swimming and fun loving stories of her 90 year long life on familial hallowed grounds. I love you Mama. May you be dancing to Nat King Cole in Popeye's arms while Popeye sings full lunged and off-tune. Life after death MUST be good.</groundspeak:text>

The system was designed to divert water from the Sacramento River into the settling basin by virtue of a dam across the Sacramento River located in Red Bluff, California. And although the system operated in this manner for some years, environmental concerns and regulatory requirements have altered the operational practices of the dam. Where, at one time, the dam could be counted on to divert water as early as March, current regulations generally prevent the dam gates from being lowered until May 15th.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To overcome this limitation and provide water to irrigators, the Bureau of Reclamation installed three pumps in the latter half of the 1990's, each with a capacity of between 80 and 100 cfs (cubic feet per second), with provisions for the placement of a fourth pump. The installation of the fourth pump occurred in 2006. However, irrigation demand can reach between 800 and a 1000 cfs before May 15th, when the dam becomes operational.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To overcome this limitation, current practice is to dam up Stony Creek in Orland and back flow water through canal gates that were actually intended to let water out of the canal into Stony Creek. Between the pumps on the Sacramento River at Red Bluff, and the reverse flow diversion at Stony Creek, the demands of irrigators have been met, but generally without any reserve.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please bring your own writing pen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you seek this cache, bring a digital camera that can accept up to a 2-Gb SD memory card and take a picture of you and your party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DO NOT TAKE THE MEMORY CARD!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the SD card is in your camera, you can look at the pictures others have left behind. Please log your find, and if the memory card gets full, let us know and we'll change it out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located along the Wagner Butte trail nestled among a rock outcropping on the way up. The terrain is not difficult, and the cache is placed not far off from the trail. So you won't have to bush-wack to get to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The altitude where the cache is placed is around 6,240 feet, and is a nice place to stop for a bite to eat.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The cache is an official green geo-cache film canister with label. There is only one 2-Gb SD memory for a digital camera and a log book. The purpose of this cache is to bring a digital camera and take a picture of you and/or your party.

The canister is tucked away in the rocks where it won't be affected by weather. Please put it back in the same spot. If your picture fills the memory card, please log this so we can replace it with a new one.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

There a bunch of mailboxes, just turn up the road and follow the main road till your gps says stop! Congratulations daveydude and Freedon Queen on being FTF. I put in a few goodies.

Cruised through Jacksonville and snatched up a few new ones on the way.  Had a great time of sliding the car sideways, blowing through puddles and making rooster tails, screaming at enormous lizzards, running and shoving each other to find the caches first and much more!

size camo jar I got from the Caching the Coast event in Coos Bay.
Its a short uphill hike to GZ.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So driving up on these mountain roads I always see all these kids
riding their motorcycles and Atv's. What a different life they all
must lead then the one did when I was a kid. No crazy adrenaline
hobbies for me when I was young or for that matter even now that
I'm getting older. The spot I placed the cache is a spot just for
the activity I described. Its kind of my tribute to my misplaced
childhood! Congrats to Fatninjuh and HsSrvnt for FTF!&lt;br /&gt;

VERY SMALL pulloff area, but you may have to walk a little.  Originally I had this cache inside the city limits, but because of the train rule, I had to move this just a few hundred yards outside the city limits.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Noticed a large stretch along the 37 road with no caches so we
decided to hide one. I let my son Corey pick the spot. His choice
showed how much of a seasoned geocacher he is already at only 5
years old. It was even his birthday the day we hide it! This road
is usually closed during winter as there is to much snow, so plan
accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;

Shiver me timbers, I had been here long before I was hornswaggled by me old mates after me treasure. They had a hempen halter all stung up and waiting for me, but I wasn't ready to dance the hempen jig just yet. I put some led from my musket into their dungbies and made my escape. I'm just glad were to far inland for the picaroons to make me walk the plank!&lt;br/&gt;Its become to dangerous 'round here for me and my treasure so I had to hide it, but in all the chaos I forgot where I hid it. Thats where ye landlubbers come in. I've hidden clue to the where abouts of me treasure 'round the valley. Problem is I can't remember where they are either or even what they are. You'd think I would have used clues I could easily remember. So All hands Ahoy! get out there and find me treasure!</groundspeak:long_description>

But before you bolt out the door and fly like a bird from your nest to Old Stage road, you may want to remember who placed these caches!  Yup, you're right!  So, drop in a stick of gum and slow your roll for these dEVILed eggs. After looking for a while, you may feel as dumb as a rock; just say, &quot;Rats!&quot; and move on the next cache.  Be careful when sticking your hands in dark places; spiders and snakes have been known to bite! Lastly, you'll probably need some music, so we'd recommend &quot;Brick House&quot; by the Commodores.

Be sure to bring your caching tools with you and you'll probably want your GPS too!&lt;br/&gt;BTW, many of these will be 5's and few would probably be 6's in difficulty.

But before you bolt out the door and fly like a bird from your nest to Old Stage road, you may want to remember who placed these caches!  Yup, you're right!  So, drop in a stick of gum and slow your roll for these dEVILed eggs. After looking for a while, you may feel as dumb as a rock; just say, &quot;Rats!&quot; and move on the next cache.  Be careful when sticking your hands in dark places; spiders and snakes have been known to bite! Lastly, you'll probably need some music, so we'd recommend &quot;Brick House&quot; by the Commodores.

You must find the first 14 stages in order to reach the Log Book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache covers about 1.5 to 2 miles of distance in downtown urban Central Point.  There are several twists and turns, which we've spent the last year making.  There might be things you see, that aren't as real as they appear.  &lt;br/&gt;You are going to want to write EVERYTHING down.  You don't want to dismiss anything, otherwise, you may be going back!&lt;br/&gt;On many of the stages, you will not have to open the container.  You just need to write down everything you can see.  One more thing, there are some &quot;bad&quot; coordinates too that will take you to the wrong places, so watch out for those as well!  GOOD LUCK!&lt;br/&gt;This cache is out for the Great Amazing Caching event on July 16th, 2011.  Once the event is over, you will be able to go out there and find it.  Take your time, or this cache may swallow you whole!

But before you bolt out the door and fly like a bird from your nest to Old Stage road, you may want to remember who placed these caches! Yup, you're right! So, drop in a stick of gum and slow your roll for these dEVILed eggs. After looking for a while, you may feel as dumb as a rock; just say, &quot;Rats!&quot; and move on the next cache. Be careful when sticking your hands in dark places; spiders and snakes have been known to bite! Lastly, you'll probably need some music, so we'd recommend &quot;Brick House&quot; by the Commodores.

Just so everyone knows, there are cachers who are replacing the caches in more conspicous and easier positions.  This makes a true 5 rating cache more like a 1 or 2.  Please replace these caches exactly as you found them so everyone can have fun finding these!  Also, 2 of the special Diablo cache containers have gone missing, one of which could only have been a cacher.  Please respect these caches and know that you are looking for HARD caches in this series!</groundspeak:long_description>

Just so everyone knows, there are cachers who are replacing the caches in more conspicous and easier positions.  This makes a true 5 rating cache more like a 1 or 2.  Please replace these caches exactly as you found them so everyone can have fun finding these!  Also, 2 of the special Diablo cache containers have gone missing, one of which could only have been a cacher.  Please respect these caches and know that you are looking for HARD caches in this series!</groundspeak:long_description>

Just so everyone knows, there are cachers who are replacing the caches in more conspicous and easier positions.  This makes a true 5 rating cache more like a 1 or 2.  Please replace these caches exactly as you found them so everyone can have fun finding these!  Also, 2 of the special Diablo cache containers have gone missing, one of which could only have been a cacher.  Please respect these caches and know that you are looking for HARD caches in this series!</groundspeak:long_description>

She is one of our greatest &quot;placers&quot; here in the Rogue Valley.  This spot, she archived, however we returned to this one a total of 5 times before it was archived.  With that, I figured I'd give some of you the opportunity to return to this cache over and over again, as did I.  Freedom Queen, take a bow....this one's for YOU!!</groundspeak:long_description>

I noticed some weren't published yet, oh well, leave those for some other cachers. (though I did grab two that weren't even published yet, after seeing the other hides I kind of figured out where there must be a cache and I was right twice!  If that fair? lol) This was out first one and for some reason the hardest, that little sucker really blended in, I must have looked at it 4 times before I saw it!

I signed the last available spot on the log sheet.

I put this one out to help with a couple of challenges that are out there. Have fun and enjoy. - -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roosevelt Elk The Roosevelt Elk is the largest of all elk species. A mature bull can weigh up to 1,000 pounds where a mature cow can weigh up to 600 pounds. Roosevelt elk are found in Oregon and Washington but some inhabit northern California and British Columbia. The Roosevelt Elk is darker than the American elk and some say they are the toughest species to hunt because they often don't bugle as much as American elk. The terrain they live in can be extremely rugged and wet because many of them inhabit the rain forest located in Oregon. The greatest difference between Roosevelt elk and Rocky Mountain elk is in their habits and distribution. Roosevelt elk choose to live in the rain forests of the Pacific coast. They prefer the logged and burned over areas of the coastal mountains and the western slope of the Cascades. Upon finding an area which meets their needs they spend their entire lives there</groundspeak:long_description>

On our way to Hebb Park we spotted this area and I just had to leave a cache behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is parking available near the cache for a couple of cars. At the time of the hide there weren't many obstacles in the way to the hide but when the weather warms up there may be some growth. Little DinoGirl cammo'd this peanut butter jar.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A fairly simple multi-stage find with a bit of local history tossed into the mix. I've recently recalculated the math for the cache and hopefully this will make the find a little easier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is our first cache and was inspired by a confluence of events when we read a local newspaper article that mentioned the well known Willamette Meteorite, now residing in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. However, we found out that this 15 1/2 ton meteorite, the largest ever found in the United States, was discovered and began its not so humble journey to NYC very near where we used to walk our dog, Maia, almost daily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coordinates above will take you to a local historical marker that most people drive right by without notice. Take a look at this marker and read it carefully so you can answer the questions below to find the next coordinates and the cache at the site near where the Willamette Meteorite, known as &quot;Tomonowos&quot; or &quot;The Heavenly Visitor&quot; by the local Native Americans, was found in 1902. The local parks department is soon to place some displays regarding the Willamette Meteorite in the meadow near this cache. Go explore and learn about it!</groundspeak:long_description>

have read of Perle Mesta, the 1950’s Washington D.C. hostess with
the mostest. Another cache dedicated to Perle is GC NKZ9. Perle is
having another party and needs to make sure she has all the
ingredients to make it successful. Her liquor cabinet is well
stocked with all the cordials, flavorings and garnishes needed to
make any cocktail desired. Her staff’s main concern is that they
have all the right stock of alcoholic liquids. Perle has given the
butler a list of guests and their favorite drinks. From this list
he needs to purchase the correct liquor. Here is the note from
Perle. Huge Reilly Kares, Governor of California drinks only Colt
45 Malt Liquor. The Director of Housing, Fannie Mae is a real
boozer and will ask for Beal's Cocktail, Suissesse Cocktail, and a
Baltimore Bracer. And that divine Mr. Bello Uomo, the Italian
Ambassador, likes a Bellini. Of course the Mexican Ambassador,
Pedro Cuervo will ask for Mexicola. We must prepare Blarney Stone
Cocktail for the Speaker of the House, Mi-Mhacantact. CIA Director,
I.M. Espy drinks both the Moscow Mule and Ping Pong Cocktails.
Rumour has it that Movie Director, Red D. Action drinks a lot and
prefers Widow's Dream Cocktail and Mint Highballs. Leylys
Gutierrez, the wonderful ambassador from Peru, will prefer Pisco
Sour. The Australian Adjunct General, Sidney Arbor, will ask for
that awful Kangaroo Cocktail and Vice Admiral Bleu Waters will
naturally drink the Commodore Cocktail. Last but least, IRS
Director, B. Lud Sucker will want his Income Tax Cocktail. Go to
the determined coordinates. Travel 50 feet at a 25 degree magnetic
north bearing and find the cache. BE EXTREMELY STEALTHY AND BRING
YOUR OWN PEN.

Other nearby spots are marked No Parking. Please visit this cache during daylight hours.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Team Pals first Cache. It fits it's name because it is located where my neighborhood ends and the forest begins again. If you park at the appropriate cords and walk east you will find a small path through the berry bushes. Once through the berries you will be on your way. The cache is small but big enough to hold small trade items, TB's and coins. Have fun. </groundspeak:long_description>

Adults are distinguished from the common toad by a yellow line down the middle of the back. They have relatively long legs, and this gives them a distinctive gait, contrasting with the hopping movement of many other toad species.They can live up to 15 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This should be a fairly easy cache.&lt;br/&gt;It is a dreaded nano.&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the view from this lookout location.&lt;br/&gt;You can enter this part of the park from any of the three parks located around it Cook Park , Tualatin Community Park or Durham City Park.&lt;br/&gt;While here enjoy the other caches that are nearby. </groundspeak:long_description>

Please rehide this one well so the muggles don't find it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1853, Samuel Galbreath began a ferry service crossing the Tualatin River from&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a village he called &quot;Galbreath&quot;. The town's name was changed to &quot;Bridgeport&quot;&lt;br/&gt;when Galbreath built the first bridge across the Tualatin River in 1856.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located along one of the first &quot;improved&quot; roads, Boone's Ferry Road, Bridgeport thrived&lt;br/&gt;by attracting business from Portland throughout the Willamette Valley. The&lt;br/&gt;Community's accommodations were simple: a blacksmith shop, boarding house,&lt;br/&gt;general store, and saloon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1886, the Portland &amp; Willamette Railway Company purchased a right-of-way&lt;br/&gt;through John Sweek's land on the Tualatin River's west bank opposite Bridgeport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Profiting from the sale, Sweek took advantage of the railroad's location and&lt;br/&gt;platted a town around the depot - he called the new town Tualatin.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True"> Xiaosaurus ( Zhou-SAWR-us ) was a small plant eating dinosaur. It ran on 2 legs with its tail held stiffly out behind him. Its name means little reptile and its head would have come up to an adult human's knee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I decided to name a few caches after dinosaurs since my daughter little dinogirl loves them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located in a nice park with paved trails. There is a dirt path leading to the cache about 70 ft off the paved trail.There may be alot of signal bounce due to tree coverage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't try to enter the park from Cambridge Dr that entrance is now closed off. While here enjoy the other caches in the park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may also enter the park from Cook Park or Tualatin Community Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please rehide this cache with the provided cover or rehide better so the muggles don't see it.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>  
Look for an obvious hiding spot. Think tree center. </groundspeak:encoded_hints>

BYOP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking on your own, and please put the cache back as you found
it. This can have a tendency to be very muggle heavy, so stealth is
a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wizard inadvertently put me onto this clever and ingeniously
evil idea for a challenge, and I am now sharing with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to log this cache you must have posted 50 DNF logs that
are rated 1.5/1.5 or lower D/T rating OR 100 DNF logs of D/T rating
3.0/3.0 or lower, and bookmark your list with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) The &quot;GC&quot; code/cache name; and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) What date the DNF was logged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will verify and confirm with you via e-mail that you have met
the criteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF will have an unactivated coin at the following CGA monthly
event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

A large congrats and a huge thank you to Lady
Orca on FTF!&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;From the numerous times I have been caching with Nogs (who,
consequently, got me hooked on this crazy game) the biggest thing I
remember is his constant complaining about getting poked,
scratched, and generally put through the wringer on some of these
cache hides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
So...I thought I would up the ante for him and
place one in his honor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly easy find for the experienced cacher. BYOP. Log
only.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
Congrats to two finders keepers for
FTF!!&lt;br /&gt;

of deduction/logic on this hide. You know the rules of how far away
a cache has to be from an existing geocache. Using that logic you
can narrow this down to a 50-100 foot block of real estate to begin
your search. The rest is up to you... The type of container is in
the name. Enjoy!

So you drain your savings and find ways to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's what Jim Wizer did 80 years ago when he opened Wizer's Fine Foods in Portland, Oregon. That store closed in 1947 and a new location was opened in Lake Oswego, Oregon in 1948. Wizer's relocated to a new facility in 1960 where it is currently located and remains family owned and operated serving fourth generation customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our family shopped here for years and our son even held his first job here until they closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that they have closed their Lake Grove location we felt it was time to place a cache nearby. The original location is still in downtown Lake Oswego, however, the Lake Grove location is now empty and very lonely. This cache includes a twist for us. So put on your thinking cap, follow the GPS to GZ and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BYOP there isn't one in the cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please replace the cache just as you found it so the next cacher can enjoy this hide the same as you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went to check on this one and decided to leave the cache in a postion to make it easier to access until the cold weather is over. So for now no superhuman strength required. </groundspeak:long_description>

Since we are visiting from the area, we don't know the local cachers so apologize in advance if we are suffering delusions or signing log sheets while sleep walking.  Oh Thank Heaven, we found it and across from where the big event was held.

Your cache is greatly appreciated!  [:D]

The trail is well hidden itself if you ask me, then you got to find the cache which is also very well hidden. The clue helps a lot,make sure to read it.

Parking is available along SE Salquist RD. Some bushwhacking on the trail may be required. This spot will be very wet and muddy during the rainy seasons. I would recommend that you use the compass mode for better navigation because the canopy of the trees will affect your GPSr signal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a Loc-N-Loc type container located down a small trail that starts at the east end. It is hidden among the trees and near Kelly Creek. It is large enough to trade small TB's and coins.

Note: Please do not post hints... otherwise the difficulty should

use your Geosenses. Quick note to those concerned about me changing
the rating. &lt;i&gt;IF&lt;/i&gt; I end up doing so it will be an archive and
repost at a lower rating so you don't lose your stat (since the old
cache was harder), but all of the responses I've gotten so far seem

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Visiting from WI to see family in Beaverton, thoroughly enjoyed caching in the area. Many thanks to all the local cachers for their hides which kept me busy. Out on a rainy morning and after a DNF nearby, swung by here and managed to make the find. Even though the weather wasn't great, I enjoyed spending some time exploring the memorial. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located on the North side of SE Salquist Rd down by the Kelly Creek culvert that runs under the road. Stay to the right of the black cloth construction fence, the west side is private property. I would recommend that you use the compass mode for better navigation because the canopy of the trees will affect your GPSr signal. There are lots of vines and a creek side nearby so be careful. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was inspired to build this cache after finding one very similar up North on Camano Isl. Called Hydro-Oboe (GCQK1K). I didn’t want to copy it so I tried to build one just a little bit different, I hope you enjoy it. &lt;br/&gt;I have placed a bucket next to the cache but YOU MAY WANT TO BRING YOUR OWN BUCKET OR AT LEAST ONE GALLON OF WATER WITH YOU just in case my bucket has disappeared or the creek has dried up. Oh yes, and don’t forget to bring something to write with and please POST SOME PICTURES if you can. ***DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN THE CACHE CAP*** Just finger tight will work. It a real bear to remove when it gets screwed on too tight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, please let me know if there are problems with either the cache or its coordinates. The hint is a spoiler and explains what you need to do to retrieve the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is dedicated to the nearby Costume Avenue, where you can
rent costumes year-round... since Geocaches are all about good
disguises. There may be lots of muggles during the day, so finding
this cache might be easier at night.&lt;br /&gt;

To solve this mystery cache; you'll have to test your knowledge of the song, and hopefully learn something!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First thing's first, if you aren't familiar with it, here is an excellent performance of it by my favorite opera singer, Luciano Pavarotti: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdTBml4oOZ8.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're having trouble with the quiz, email me for help! Or, uh... *mumbles* check wikipedia... *mumbles*&lt;br/&gt;So how much do you know about Nessun Dorma? Let's put your knowledge to the test in this Nessun Dorma quiz!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 45 30.ABC W 122 38.DEF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A) Roughly, what is Nessun Dorma about?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2 — A princess must learn the name of an unappealing suitor. If she learns his name, she may kill him. However, if she does not, she must marry him. She decrees 'nessun dorma' or 'none shall sleep'! None of her subjects may sleep until his name is found. 7 — A princess wishes to marry a suitor, but her father will not allow it. She pleas 'nessun dorma' or 'have pity' to her father. 4 — A prince's father is killed by his uncle. At the climactic scene of the play, his uncle has been killed, but the prince is fatally wounded by a poison blade. Fortinbras, an enemy king, rushes in and the prince declares 'nessun dorma' or 'take my domain' to Fortinbras. The prince hands his kingdom over to his enemy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B) The song claims: il nome suo nessun saprà!... e noi dovrem, ahime, morir! Who must die?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9 — The princess. 0 — The subjects. 1 — Laertes. 4 — Senator Palpatine. 3 — Fortinbras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C) What language is Nessun Dorma written in?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9 — French. 0 — Latin. 4 — Italian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D) Where has Nessun Dorma made an appearance?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7 — In the soundtrack of Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith, at the climactic scene when Obi-Won confronts Darth Vader. 3 — Superbowl XXII at halftime. 5 — The 1990 FIFA world cup. 2 — Winston Churchill was listening to a live performance of the song when he received news of the Japanese surrender, thus ending World War II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E) In the opera Turandot, who sings Nessun Dorma?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 — Calaf. 9 — Lord Montague. 4 — Ophelia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F) Who composed Nessun Dorma?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5 — Sottaceto Faccia. 9 — Mozart. 2 — Giacomo Puccini'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun, and good luck!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Green Day was originally part of the punk scene at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases for the independent record label Lookout! Records earned it a grassroots fanbase. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime, The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States. Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac, Nimrod, and Warning did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status. Its rock opera American Idiot (2004) reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States. The band's eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few other bands have had such political inluence in the late 90's and 2000's than Green Day. With their carefully sewn lyrics and calls for action; they have brought anti-war sentiment back into mainstream music for the first time since the 60's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Urban legend has it that when an intern uploaded Green Day music onto President Bush's iPod, he listened to one song, and threw the iPod into the Potomac.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun, and good luck! </groundspeak:long_description>

So feel free to stamp your own personal logbook with the stamp in the cache, but please, do not take the stamp! Good luck, and have fun! Do you have a cat?

&lt;/p&gt;
A few words of advice on this cache series:
&lt;p&gt;1) Muggles, Muggles everywhere so your best stealth is
required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Rehide the container as good or better than you found
it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Did I mention MUGGLES?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) If a cache is unobtainable due to muggle infestation then
please come back for it on a future attempt. Hiding them is a joy
for me, replacing a container is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am taking this opportunity to introduce some of my own five
star evil into the Portland metro area. This one is in the spirit
of some other difficult micro caches in the area. I have enjoyed
making three or four trips back to hunt some of the really &quot;crazy&quot;/
&quot;Vicious&quot; and &quot;Shady&quot; micros... ACTUALLY I have not enjoyed making
the return trips back at all... I was lying about that...and I have
wished harm on all of these cache owners at times for these
monstrously hard to find caches... I guess some might enjoy the
headache they get from a lengthy search and the thought of a DNF
failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I despise impossible hides and yet I find myself in the middle
of the night making these ugly little nightmarish devices. This
sign only micro was slated to be a hard 3.5 star difficulty
however, while searching for a suitable location, I came across
this area and had a much more wicked idea of how to arrange this
one. I am not providing a description of the container nor will I
be giving a hint. I will tell you that the container is
approximately two inches wide and six inches tall at its widest
points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an added irritation, light tree cover may play with your
GPSr signal a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coords are taken from a 2100 average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to bring a pen to sign the log.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muggles may be present at times making this one impossible to
hunt...this only adds to the challenge. Due to the location and
nature of this hide, please rehide this one as well as or better
than you found it. This will insure that it will have staying power
and it will also make the next hunter &quot;earn their five stars&quot;. I
hope you enjoy this extremely frustrating and horribly devious
micro as much as I had altering it and placing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scream, curse, stamp your feet, throw a tantrum...if it makes
you feel better...but it will not help you find it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE DO NOT GIVE HINTS OR SPOILERS IN YOUR LOGS! I DO NOT WANT
TO DELETE ANYONE, HOWEVER, IF YOU DO, I WILL BE FORCED TO REMOVE
THE LOG TO PROTECT THE SPIRIT AND INTEGRITY OF THE CACHE. ALSO, I
WILL BE CHECKING THE LOG SHEET OFTEN SO PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR
NAME IS ON IT BEFORE POSTING A FIND! AGAIN, IF YOU DO NOT SIGN THE
LOG, I WILL BE FORCED TO REMOVE YOUR FIND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you hunt this one and do not find it, please post a DNF log
for every seperate visit. I would like to keep track of it
all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
A few words of advice on this cache series:
&lt;p&gt;1) Muggles, Muggles everywhere so your best stealth is
required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Re-hide the container as good or better than you found
it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Did I mention MUGGLES?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) If a cache is unobtainable due to muggle infestation then
please come back for it on a future attempt. Hiding them is a joy
for me, replacing a container is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the location and nature of this hide, please re-hide this
one as well as or better than you found it. This will ensure that
it will have staying power. Scream, curse, stamp your feet, throw a
tantrum...if it makes you feel better...but it will not help you
find it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLEASE DO NOT GIVE HINTS OR SPOILERS IN YOUR LOGS! I DO NOT WANT
TO DELETE ANYONE, HOWEVER, IF YOU DO, I WILL BE FORCED TO REMOVE
THE LOG TO PROTECT THE SPIRIT AND INTEGRITY OF THE CACHE. ALSO, I
WILL BE CHECKING THE LOG SHEET OFTEN SO PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR
NAME IS ON IT BEFORE POSTING A FIND! AGAIN, IF YOU DO NOT SIGN THE
LOG, I WILL BE FORCED TO REMOVE YOUR FIND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Come to find out, both this one and the other were hidden in 2009 so I'm guessing this is why I wasn't able to find them. I'm guessing this is long gone but if you know otherwise then please let me know.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Old Shipwreck conceals cache, surrounded by aliens. Use this cache
to exchange state quarters.

On November 25th, 1852 the iron ribbed schooner, Machigone
(pronounced Ma-CHIG-oh-nee) left Fort Vancouver laden with goods
from the Hudson's Bay Company. She never reached her destination.
While crossing the Columbia bar, a mighty gale blasted the ship.
The crew fought valiantly but the ship broke apart in the swells
and 9 of the crew perished including the captain, Horace Simpson of
Astoria. The gale blew for several days growing into a hugh storm
of typhoon proportions. Tremendous flooding washed the remains of
the ship many miles inland where it lay buried for over 100 years.
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1969, James Harrison, a building contractor working in N
Portland discovered an old piece of iron ribbing in the area where
he was digging a foundation. Further excavation revealed the
twisted remains of the Machigone. Harrison had an interest in
history and a flair for art so he supervised cleaning up the
remains of the old ship leaving most of it right where he found it.
It remains there today, a monument to the brave sea captains who
plied the dangerous waters of the Pacific bringing commerce to the
NW. Its rusty iron ribs and keel are a testimony to the skill of
American ship builders of that era. Ironically, the only survivor
of the shipwreck was the ship's doctor, William Kaiser
Albright.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Find the ship, then find the cache. Beware, aliens are abundant
during weekdays, scarce on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

When you find the cache......Please &lt;br/&gt;&quot;DO NOT&quot; Attempt to remove the cache container from its location. To open the cache,&quot;loosen it wing nut!&quot; and remove lid, make sure wing nut is snug and cover cache well so the water does not get in to the cache container Enjoy another view of the slough and the critters that live here.[:)]™Happy Caching!!!!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Joseph Albert Albertson was born in Yukon, Oklahoma Territory. He was one of four sons born to Rhoda and Earl Albertson. Before he was three, the family moved to Caldwell, Idaho, in 1909, where Joe grew up.&lt;br/&gt;After graduating from Caldwell High School in 1925, Joe studied business for two years at the College of Idaho in Caldwell. While in college in 1927, he began his career in the grocery industry as a clerk at a local Safeway store. In 1930 Joe married his college classmate Kathryn McCurry, of Boise, Idaho. They had one daughter,&lt;br/&gt;Joe quickly moved through the ranks with Safeway, until he was supervising more than a dozen stores. But he was not satisfied and wanted to start his own store -- one that he could build to his own specifications and manage his own way. &lt;br/&gt;With $5,000 of the money he and Kathryn had saved, and with $7,500 borrowed from his wife's aunt, Joe formed a partnership with L.S. Skaggs, a former Safeway Division Manager, and Tom Cuthbert, Mr. Skaggs' accountant. &lt;br/&gt;At the age of 32, Joe opened his store in 1939 in Boise, Idaho on three simple principles - quality, good value, and excellent service. &lt;br/&gt;Albertson is credited as being one of the pioneers of the complete one-stop, self-service supermarket concept, and boasted to be  &quot;Idaho's largest and finest food store.&quot;  The store was located at 17th and State Streets, a few blocks north of downtown Boise. &lt;br/&gt;Joe Albertson's grocery store was an enormous success, Joe opened his second and third Albertson's stores in Nampa and Caldwell, Idaho, in 1940. When Joe Albertson was considering putting a new store in a town, he would drive around the town and look for neighborhoods with lots of children's clothing hanging on clotheslines; he knew that those kinds of neighborhoods were where he wanted to build his stores.&lt;br/&gt;During the years of World War II, when food was being rationed, he filled the empty shelves with health and beauty products, general household goods and other non-food items.&lt;br/&gt; Joe Albertson's reputation for generosity and community involvement grew during those war years. His stores promoted war bonds and sponsored scrap drives that collected aluminum, steel, fats, and paper for recycling&lt;br/&gt;During the 1950s and 1960s, Albertson's expanded and became a familiar name to shoppers throughout the western United States.&lt;br/&gt;Albertsons, Inc. became a public company in 1959, and its growth continued, in 1964 Joe opened his 100th store, in Seattle.  &lt;br/&gt;Joe's generosity continued throughout the years. The College of Idaho received many generous donations from Joe and Kathryn. It was named Albertson College of Idaho for sixteen years from 1991 to 2007. Perhaps the most obvious gift to the citizens of Idaho is the 41-acre Kathryn Albertson Park with its winding walkways, wildflower's, trees and ponds.&lt;br/&gt;In 1966, Joe and Kathryn established the J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Foundation They focused their giving primarily on education, which was important to Joe and Kathryn because neither were able to finish college during the Great Depression Since then, has given more than $240 million to Idaho’s communities and education systems, the Foundation continues to give to charities, primarily in areas where Joe and Kathryn lived or worked in Idaho.&lt;br/&gt;Joe Alberston died in January 1993 at the age of 86.&lt;br/&gt;Joe did the common thing uncommonly well. He accumulated a great wealth of knowledge and formulas for success. He found the fulfillment that comes from setting monumental goals and achieving them. His life was filled with enjoyment of the rare but simple pleasures -- fishing a mountain stream, hunting with friends, and enjoying the company of his family. If Joe Albertson was still alive today he probably would of added geo-caching as one of his simple pleasures,  His wife Kathryn died on Apr 30, 2002,9 years later...And On January 23, 2006, Albertsons was sold to Supervalu, CVS/pharmacy for $17.4 billion in cash, stock and debt assumption, but still carries the Albertsons name.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is a private driveway at the end of the road with a large sign that states this message. &quot;Do NOT&quot; go beyond the sign the cache is not there. You can catch a beautiful sun set here on a clear evening and a bit of wild life may be about. Always expect the un-expected . Enjoy!![:)]This is our 13th cache placed on a lucky day, the 7th.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is a private driveway and some no trespassing sign's near by, please respect these sign's as the cache is not in or beyond these areas.  Please park @ N45’ 33.657 W122’ 24.737 this will keep your vehicle out of the way of any truck's that may use this road to access the Private Driveway that is down the road a bit. If you are here on a clear evening you can catch a beautiful sunset. Be careful as the concrete log has some metal roots. Enjoy!!![:)]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A NOTE TO ALL: Please do not place cache to close to the opening we want the cache to be out of site and out of mind from any maintenance muggles or workers that may pop up from time to time and (Please)do not place the cache to far in as this make's it hard for other cacher's to reach.</groundspeak:long_description>

Robin Leach say’s “Pack Your Bag’s”
Conveniently located near PDX and 205, this Travel Bug Inn is a
luxury inn for those tired travelers that need a break from those
cold, damp and stuffy accommodations of those regular type cache
containers, and with “ No Fear” of being muggled. The
Inn is equipped with 24hr nearby video security surveillance and a
security code will be used to enter the cache at all times…
Relax in the hot tub, or take a stroll on the beach, what ever your
traveler’s pleasures may be, they will find it here with lots
of spacious room for those larger TB’s. The wall to wall
carpeting will make those Travel Bug’s and Geo-Coin’s
stop here a memorable and pleasurable stay… ATTN: This cache
is located on private property with permission of the property
owner's, some of the neighbors are aware of its presents, you may
park across the way or right in front of the Inn, you won't be
there long enough to cause any problems, also this will give you a
little bit of cover from prying eye’s. Please be respectful,
there is no need to go into anyone’s yard at all... Don't
Forget To Sign The Inn's Guest Book Upon Arrival... Have A Nice
Day! Enjoy your stay! PLEASE NO SWAG !!!, Travel Bug's &amp; Geo
Coins ONLY!!! Note: The cache IS NOT THE MAIL BOX !!! Please mix up
the security code when re-locking, we would not want muggles to get
inside the Inn, as there are &quot;No Muggles Allowed&quot; Cache viewed

It is nice to find a big cache for a change!  Very nicely done.

I was 24 feet or so from the cache when I came up against a chain link fence with barbed wire along the top, figures! Well I walked the fence line to the waterway and managed to scoot around the end of the fence to access the other side without any real trouble, after that, all was fine and I found the cache in short order.

We drove up and I said, hey I bet its in the ^#$^#$)(*.  T&amp;T got out and grabbed it sure enough.  Lots of activity at the lake today.

There is a great view of the river and a small waterfall from a tributary that enters the river across the way. The cache is small, very small with just enough room to hold the log so b.y.o.p. It is at eye level and fit's well within its surrounding's. Please make sure that you put it back exactly how you found it so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands...Note: the cache is not by the river infact you can park within a few feet of it.</groundspeak:long_description>

Since I live in Scappoose (the Chinook word for gravelly plain), I thought it would be fun to name my caches in Chinook. This is my fourteenth hide, celebrating my 140th find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1805, Lewis and Clark visited this island and called it Wapato Island for its abundance of potato plants. At that time, there were approximately 2,000 Chinook Indians living on the island in 15 villages. Today there are just over 1,000 residents who have established several farms, a grocery store and a school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: this cache is also a letterbox. Please do not remove the stamp.  Thanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BEWARE: while hiding this letterbox I was stung by a nettle plant. I stomped on it with my boot, but it will likely grow back. Wear long pants, long sleeves, boots and gloves. My hand was tingling all day.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

When parking, there is plenty of street parking and to the south of the building. DO NOT BLOCK ENGINE BAY DOORS, not even for a second!!&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is in memory of Geoduker who was a fire fighter at the cache location until he passed on Jan. 2nd 2009. The cache gets it's name from CAASKE68 and TALR Duke who both contributed as did many others to make this cache a reality. With the support of the local fire fighters, friends and family we were able to bring an idea for this cache to a reality from its conception on Labor day. Thus the name of the cache. </groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is a duplex container, two M&amp;M's taped together. In
one side is a log. In the other side is a stack of quarters.
&lt;p&gt;Find the cache and sign the log then add one or more quarters to
the other container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the coin container is FULL then it is your turn to help the
homeless. Take all the quarters except for one and then do
something creative with the rest to help the homeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't think of anything to do, just look around and you
will see some transients near by hitch hiking or pan handling. You
could just hand them the stack and call it good. It would be better
if you found something more creative but that is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU DO NOT HAVE TO OPEN ANY DANGEROUS LOOKING CONTAINERS TO FIND
THE CACHE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache has been resurrected once again from Muggledome.
Please make sure you hide it completely out of site. There is a
black backup cache hidden there two. It has no quarters.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Had to move the cache a little.  It was discovered by someone who has been stealing the money on a regular basis.  They finally took the container and left the log.</groundspeak:text>

We replaced the cache with a new container and new log and primed it with two quarters.  Hope it sticks this time.  This is the THIRD plunder for this one.</groundspeak:text>

I have been waiting for construction in that area to subside a bit before replacing it and now I see that it has slowed down a little. So, I will get off my duff and replace it soon, this weekend.

Our cache is in a container that can not be removed from it's location and a lot of people are logging this letter box and not finding the real cache. Please make sure you are logging the real cache, our cache is marked Official GeoCache Site...Thanks: Shelrik[:)]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located Between Brush Prairie and Hockinson, although The original name for this area southeast of Battle Ground was Eureka, a Greek word meaning &quot;I have found it.&quot; The early settlers here were Finns and Swedish-speaking Finns from the Aaland Islands... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Swedish man Ambrosius Hakanson was the first postmaster in 1884. His name was anglicized to the present spelling, and the town Hockinson: was named for him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brush Prairie was named by Elmarine Bowman, for a brushy prairie and swamp near her father's homestead. The Bowmans were one of the first white families to settle in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you enter the area of the cache and the place to park, on your left you will see stones of many sizes, look closely and you will find one with the etchings of Brown upon it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pioneer of the area born in Finland and at the age of 15 he went to sea, at 25 his ship landed in America he decided to seek his fortune in this new land hoping to make a home for his first wife he left in Sweden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He worked on a steamboat on the Mississippi River until he could come to the Washington Territory at the age of 27 to join his brothers Andrew and Leonard who had already homesteaded here. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He secured a homestead of 40 acres on the hill directly east and above what is now Hockinson (which has often been known as Charlie Brown's hill)he then sent for his wife &amp; 2yr old son he had never seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cabin he built stood well into the 30's it was constructed of cedar which he hand cut and carried a quarter of a mile uphill. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually 10 acres of land needed to be cleared around the cabin to keep it safe from the tall trees in case of severe wind storms that has been well known in history to have hit these areas up to the recent one on 2008. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All was handwork, no blasting powder or stump pullers yet and the 14 miles to Vancouver over a dirt road took two days for the roundtrip when provisions were needed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The loads of wood he haled to town provided the necessary money for supplies, it took 4 to 6 months to clear an acre of land to grow grain and vegetables and he fished in the Columbia River during the summer months, when the boys were old enough to help he bought &amp; cleared another fifty acres of land at $5 to $15 per acre eventually owning about 190 acres valued at $10 dollars per acre, his sons, Carl, Alfred and Otto Brown were probably the Brown Boys referred to in the Vancouver newspaper -- the Eureka Etchings as sinking the dugout canoe in Battle Ground Lake, they would have been the right age for that kind of an adventure &amp; this could be the dugout boat in the museum now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Charles Brown used a horse to turn the wood lathe with which he fashioned many pieces of furniture for himself and neighbors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During these years many families turned to him for help during sorrow and the old cemeteries near Brush Prairie still have crumbling cement tombstones made and crudely engraved by him. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He also &quot;laid out&quot; the dead and made their coffins as there were no funeral parlors until the early 1900s. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a few scattered neighbors, he helped build the cabin that served as the first real schoolhouse in Hockinson, Carl Brown, the oldest son, was in Elim's first confirmed class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When his first family was grown and gone and his second wife deceased, his farm was a prosperous 4000 acre tree prune ranch Mr. Brown married Ann in 1910 and brought her and her small son Homer to life in a new home built to replace the house which burned in the 1902's Yacolt burn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Charles Brown died in 1923 at the age of 76 and is buried beside his third wife Ann in the Elim cemetery, Brush Prairie. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pioneer graves of his first wife and children are in the old Baptist Church cemetery south of Brush Prairie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you have paid your respects to this Finnish pioneer who no longer lives here, look over to your right for a set of twins one which has an abnormal Siamese growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope you enjoy this bit of history and the finding of this cache and please respect all the Finnish pioneers and all the others that don't live here, there is approx 400 residents on this plot.</groundspeak:long_description>

My lil family and I went on out there to try and find it and looked for a good half hour with no avail. Very dissappointed since we only went for two that haven't been found yet and could find either one....  
I wonder if you could email me any hints or if you've been back there since you placed it.
I really want a FTF and was hoping this would be the first. Oh well, had fun anyway other than the wifey getting eaten by the bugs :)</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Gardner Oaks Park. Navigation Pinball.

This cache is located in one of Battle Ground's many undeveloped
parks. Someday this land will be a beautiful place with lovely oak
trees. The park is a little hard to get to because no access has
been developed and it is surrounded by either fields, fences, or
houses. I asked the city officials if it was OK to use the park for
hiking, etc, and they said it is fine to do so. There is a No
Trespassing sign posted near the city water well, so stay away from
that area. Since the park is large, that is no problem. You can
park at the end of SW 12th Street and walk through a gate into the
park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For this cache you need to have a simple magnetic compass. Most any
kind will do, but the best ones have some kind of sighting device
on them to allow you to site a course and accurately read off the
degrees. I used an old Korean War vintage army surplus compass with
a flip-up site and glass eyepiece to sight the courses. My GPS has
a magnetic compass built into it but I find that it is easier to
use the army surplus compass. If you use a electronic compass, make
sure it is set to MAGNETIC, not TRUE.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is medium size and dark in color. To find the cache you
have to play &quot;Pinball Oaks&quot; and YOU are the ball.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Start at the coordinates shown above. Stand on the path next to the
fence post in front of the ditch and get out your compass. Follow
these directions to ricochet to the cache. The pacing is not really
necessary since each heading leads to a tree, but pacing provides a
nice cross check on your direction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Sight a course of 242 Degrees and walk 74 paces to a &quot;Small
Oak.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
2. Sight a course of 340 Degrees and walk 63 paces to the &quot;Twin
Oaks.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
3. Sight a course of 202 Degrees and walk 51 paces to a &quot;Lone
Oak.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
4. Sight a course of 276 Degrees and walk 68 paces to a &quot;Crooked
Oak.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
5. Sight a course of 42 Degrees and walk 26 paces to a &quot;Wounded
Oak.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
6. Sight a course of 270 Degrees and walk 52 paces to a &quot;Roped
Oak.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
7. Sight a course of 323 Degrees and walk 54 paces to a &quot;LARGE
Oak.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
8. Sight a course of 34 Degrees and walk 14 paces to a &quot;Straight
Oak.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
9. Sight a course of 124 Degrees and walk 15 paces to the
Cache&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is easier than it sounds. Please report the condition of the
cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The park is rather slushy during rainy season, but it is normally
dry in summer.
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a magnetic key locker. Please replace it
correctly USING the magnet. This cache has a serious muggle problem
so place it completely out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: TCGPEA - Final&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

Well, its not so easy anymore. You are looking for a capsule about
the size of a bison.
&lt;p&gt;This park is not very well known. I call it Dorky Park, because
it is sort of a dorky park. What do you think? It is big enough for
one family to have a picnic and almost large enough for you to play
frisbee with your Chihuahua. There is a scenic stream and a nice
footbridge. There is also a nice view of the backside of several
houses. Believe it or not, they used to have a tiny baseball
diamond here with permanent bases and a pitcher's mound. When I say
tiny I mean there was about 30 feet between 1st and 3rd.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a clean cache. No need to get wet or dirty. Beware of
spying eyes from every direction. It is within reach of the path
but hard to spot.&lt;br /&gt;

Since I live in Scappoose (the Chinook word for gravelly plain), I thought it would be fun to name my caches in Chinook. This is my fourth hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crown Zellerbach trail was once a logging road and before that, a logging railroad. Today it is a linear county park. It is a rails to trails project that is progressing very slowly in my opinion, but it is a very welcome project. The park runs along a lot of private property, so be respectful, and stay on the trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I saw a video on this site about creative caches, and I decided that I wanted to try one. This was a copy of one of the caches featured in the video. Many people enjoyed it, but the creative element proved difficult to maintain, so the creative clue has been replaced with a low-tech clue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage One of this cache is at the posted coordinates. It is a small food storage container.  Inside it, you will find two clues.  One clue will definitely lead you to Stage Two.  The other clue might lead you to Stage Two, and it might not.  Stage Two is about 18 paces (36 steps) from Stage One. It is a 12-cup food storage container (regular cache).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We saw some harmless little snakes while we were out on the trail the day we hid this cache (07/04/2011). We also saw lots of birds and butterflies and a tiny caterpillar or silk worm descending from a tree above.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is probably the best view point in SW Washington. On the map
it is called Lookout Mountain and it used to have a fire tower on
it. Go to this cache on a clear day and you can see Mt. St Helens,
Mt. Rainier, Mt. Adams, Mt. Hood, Mt Jefferson and The Sisters.
Rainier appears very bold next to Helens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cache is a 50 Caliber Ammo Box. An easy find.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is dedicated to my dog who is buried up here. She was
the best dog I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To get to the cache:&lt;br /&gt;
Turn right through the camping area at sunset falls and cross a
bridge, then turn left onto the forest road. Follow this road until
you get to N45.48.143 W122.06.833. This is the turn off to the
cache. Now...decide if you want to drive up to the cache or
walk...it is 1.04 miles uphill all the way. There is NO turn around
until you get to the top. The road is steep and rocky and bumpy. I
recommend taking a 4 wheel drive vehicle, but I once made it up
there in my Chevy Suburban with 2 wheel drive. Good ground
clearance is the key. The climb is from 3440 to 4206 elevation. Due
to the elevation, this cache may be blocked by snow at times.
During the winter you can take a northern route to this cache by
going straight at sunset falls and following the main road past
Cougar Rock, then follow the fork to the right. A map of the forest
is handy. The forest roads are pretty nice gravel. It looks like a
long way, but it is actually only 34 driving miles from the center

This is a beautiful, round, volcanic crater lake surrounded by tall
trees. In this 280 acre park there are 10 miles of hiking trails
and bike trails, 5 miles of horse trails. In addition, there are
picnic, play and camping areas. Park in the main parking lot at the
state park. There is no longer a fee.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also park on a side road at 45.47.962, 122.30.036, then
walk through the horse parking area, across the field and down the
trail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tree cover might mess with your GPS especially on a cloudy day.
Look for a very large fire damaged tree about 30 feet uphill from
the lowest trail but the cache is not at the tree.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a 50 Cal. ammo can with lot of room for goodies.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

If you are passionate about enviromental preservation, you may not want to attempt this cache. The wee-cackle and I probably destroyed 6 ferns and broke a dozen tree branches, not to mention the beautiful water slide we created for the rain water heading down from the cache location. So once I got up there, my GPS (iphone) was bouncing all over the place. I searched for 10 minutes with no luck, but found it just as I was about to head back down. TSLS.</groundspeak:text>

God has seen fit to increase the difficulty of this cache so I am changing the number.  It used to be fairly easy to spot after you scrambled up the fairly steep trail.... now it is a different story.  You can stand there and stare right at it and never see it.  If you gently poke around, you'll find it.</groundspeak:text>

The mammoth (whatever) that the cache is parked under is awesome to behold.

You can avoid the park fee by driving past the normal park entrance and turning down 259th street.  Look for a small parking area on the south side of the road just past the RR tracks that is intended for horse type people and camp service workers.  Park there and navigate the trails from the backside of the park...its easy.
Of course you miss the scenic walk around the lake, but you get to see other scenic things, like cool trees, rabbits, moss etc.  One direction on the trail is better than the other, but which way??

The cache was in poor shape.  The log book was damp and mouldy but usable.  All other paper items in the cache were pretty far gone, so we removed them all except for the standard caching form, which is also in bad shape.  If you go to this cache please take a new copy of the caching info form and a couple of medium zip lock bags.

We took a few trinkets and left an Octopig and Cross Country Moto bug.

This is a lovely setting in a forest park. You can camp there for a
$5.00 fee with running water, out houses, pull through sites and
tent sites. The camp ground is small. Day use parking is also $5.00
but the day use parking is rarely busy and you can probably park
long enough to find the cache with no problem. You can also park up
the road a short way and walk in for free....perfectly legal. There
is no attendant on duty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The water here is cold and clear. Bring a swim suit if you dare,
you can jump off the falls into a beautiful clear pool of icy
mouuntain water.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a nice cache to catch on the way to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?ID=83575&quot;&gt;Boot

Since I live in Scappoose (the Chinook word for gravelly plain), I thought it would be fun to name my caches in Chinook. I doubt very much if any river otter live here, but I like river otter, and creeks.  This is my 9th hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crown Zellerbach trail was once a logging road and before that, a logging railroad. Today it is a linear county park. It is a rails to trails project that is progressing very slowly in my opinion, but it is a very welcome project. The park runs along a lot of private property, so be respectful, and stay on the trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There must have been a bridge here at one time.  How did the trains and trucks get the logs across Alder Creek?  But the bridge either washed out or it was taken up, and it has not been replaced.  Hopefully a nice pedestrian bridge is on the list of improvements for this trail.  In the mean time, there are some conveniently fallen logs to help the hiker across the creek.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Bat Haven - Moulton Madness II

Rated 3 for being a poor reception area and for some rocky terrain,
this cache is located in beautiful Moulton Falls Park. It is the
second in my Moulton Madness trilogy of caches and is located very
close to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GCh31b&amp;amp;Submit6=Find&quot;&gt;
&quot;Ring of Wonder&quot;&lt;/a&gt; cache.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final approach to this cache is rocky and may be slippery if
it is wet so watch your step! No cliff climbing, tree climbing or
scuba diving is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPS coverage is poor in this area so don't expect exact coords.
Accuracy showed 39' using the best of 3 gpses on a clear day. Ahh!
That's close enough just follow your nose. Think like a bat and
you'll find it. The cache is a standard ammo can. If you find
yourself bumping your head as you walk around, you are probably in
&quot;Cougar Haven&quot; not &quot;Bat Haven.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The entry to this area is locked up during some of the winter
months, but it is a lovely area so even if it is locked up, you'll
have a nice trip. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a boat launch and a nice swimming area and some picnic
tables. The lake is a great place to fish, ski, sail or yak.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From reading the logs I see that the park has now imposed a $3.00
entry fee. Some people have evaded the fee by either walking in or
by pleading with the gate attendant stating that they just want to
look the place over...a short visit. I'm enhancing the clue to keep
visits short.</groundspeak:long_description>

No view today...to foggy.  We parked our camper in the turnout and camped for the night.  My wife was frightened by some creature rustling in the bushes when she opened the door of the camper shortly after dark.  It was funny to see her jump.  The creature departed in haste.  Next morning there was a slight view and you could dimly see the crater.  </groundspeak:text>

Anyway, REDNECKBUCK - I am not sure what you mean by &quot;Mustache on a pole&quot;.  if you found this particular cache, you would have found the cache container with the log and there would be no doubt.  Other then being a pretty small cache container (nano), I consider this one pretty easy, so I don't want to say any more then that.  Regards!  Red67</groundspeak:text>

At the cache site, you get to see some history and a beach.  The history is explained on the way to the cache.  The following grid is the closest parking spot: N 47° 06.137' W 122° 46.192'.  After you park at the tennis courts, find the paved path behind it.  Follow the path north, continue to follow the path when it turns to gravel.  When you hit the metal steps, you're nearly on top of the cache.  Hunt begins at the third flight.  Have fun, see the sites, follow the instructions listed inside the cache.

the largest planned community in Washington state near Bonney Lake
but it never actually happened. Roads, a school, and 2 parks were
built but that was all that was ever done in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always thought the area was off limits but my son's school
needed remodeling this year so he was shipped off to Eismann
Elementary (in Cascadia) for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While visiting the school I noticed a sign saying there were 2
parks open to the public. I confirmed with a security guard that
the park area are open to the public during daylight hours.&lt;/p&gt;
The rest of Cascadia is off limits but the parks are open. I sure
hope they open the rest of the area one day there are over 15 miles
of nature trails that were created for the planned community and
now they are just sitting abandon
&lt;p&gt;In order to find the cache start at the posted coords and you
will find a statue. At the base of this statue you will find a
plaque. The plaque has a date which you will need to find the final
coords. If it's a sunny day from this statue you will have a
beautiful view of Mt. Rainier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
MM = A&lt;br /&gt;
DD = B&lt;br /&gt;
YYYY = C&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Add (B+B+1)/1000 to the north coordinates&lt;br /&gt;
Add (A-6)/1000 to the west coordinates&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area is only open from dawn to dusk so please be respectful
and don't go after this one at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you get stuck and need a hint feel free to send me a message or
you can always call
me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the area as heard of Cascadia it was suppose to be
the largest planned community in Washington state near Bonney Lake
but it never actually happened. Roads, a school, and 2 parks were
built but that was all that was ever done in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always thought the area was off limits but my son's school
needed remodeling this year so he was shipped off to Eismann
Elementary (in Cascadia) for the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While visiting the school I noticed a sign saying there were 2
parks open to the public. I confirmed with a security guard that
the parks are open to the public during daylight hours.&lt;/p&gt;
The rest of Cascadia is off limits but the parks are open. I sure
hope they open the rest of the area one day there are over 15 miles
of nature trails that were created for the planned community and
now they are just sitting abandon
&lt;p&gt;Da Vinci Park is a kid friendly neighborhood park (without the
neighborhood). It's geared towards little kids which is great for
me. There are picnic tables and brand new play toys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park is only open from dawn to dusk so please be respectful
and don't go after this one at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you get stuck and need a hint feel free to send me a message or
you can always call
me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CONGRATULATIONS to road trip for another great
FTF&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is an easy, short walk, and has parking nearby.  Have fun.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salal is a pretty plant. I was wondering if was native, or an imported invasive plant (a.k.a. a weed). Here is what I found from Wikipedia about this amazing little plant:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaultheria shallon is a leathery-leaved shrub in the heather family (Ericaceae), native to western North America. In English it is known as salal, shallon, or in Britain simply Gaultheria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ecology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaultheria shallon is very tolerant of both open sun and shady conditions. In coastal areas it can form deep, nearly impenetrable thickets. It grows as far north as Baranof Island, Alaska.[1] Western poison oak is a common associate in the California Coast Ranges.[2]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edibility&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its dark blue &quot;berries&quot; (actually swollen sepals[1]) and young leaves are both edible and are efficient appetite suppressants, both with a unique flavor. Gaultheria shallon berries were a significant food resource for native people, who both ate them fresh and dried them into cakes. They were also used as a sweetener, and the Haida used them to thicken salmon eggs. The leaves of the plant were also sometimes used to flavor fish soup.[1]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More recently, Gaultheria shallon berries are used locally in jams, preserves and pies.[1][3] They are often combined with Oregon-grape because the tartness of the latter is partially masked by the mild sweetness of Gaultheria shallon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medicinal properties&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gaultheria shallon has been used for its medicinal properties by local natives for generations. The medicinal uses of this plant are not widely known or used. However, the leaves have an astringent effect, making it an effective anti-inflammatory and anti-cramping herb. By preparing the leaves in a tea or tincture one can take the herb safely to decrease internal inflammation such as bladder inflammation, stomach or duodenal ulcers, heartburn, indigestion, sinus inflammation, diarrhea, moderate fever, inflamed / irritated throat, and menstrual cramps. A poultice of the leaf can be used externally to ease discomfort from insect bites and stings.[4]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Economic use&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Pacific Northwest, the harvesting of Gaultheria shallon is the heart of a large industry which supplies cut evergreens worldwide for use in floral arrangements. It is used in native plant gardens. </groundspeak:long_description>

to have a cache too. And it needed to be full of boy stuff. So,
here's a cache filled with stuff that a boy would like. Initial
contents include a foam dart gun, some matchbox cars and, of
course, some dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located off the southern section of the Buckley
Trail. It's a nice place to come and have a picnic and listen to
the birds. Trail is paved to within 30 feet of the cache. GPS was
bouncy due to all the tree cover, but should be close.&lt;/p&gt;

have been muggled. There are lots of kids in this neighborhood so
please keep an eye out I would hate to see this one get muggled.
Hopefully, this one will be a little harder to get to and should
keep them at bay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While the cache is available 24/7 I would not advise doing it at
night. I would hate to see someone get hurt. Even during the day
please be careful in retrieving the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don't think kids will be able to make it to the actual cache. Be
caution as there is a stream nearby but there is plenty of room for
them to watch someone retrieve the cache container.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you can't reach the cache, need a hint, or get stuck and can't
get down feel free to send me a message or you can always &lt;a href=&quot;http://dl.dropbox.com/u/386320/Geocaching/Gadgets/Call.html&quot;&gt;call

Ran into fozroc who was only about a minute late I was just walking back to my car when he pulled up.  I also got to meet cougarfan75.  Nice to meet everyone love the FTF parties.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Amazing Spider-Man is one of my favor superheroes so I had to
give him a fun cache. I wouldn't do this cache at night as you will
have to cross a creek about 18&quot; deep and there isn't much more then
a deer trail to follow so have fun bush whacking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are many different trails in this area the one I marked below
is just the one I used. If you know of a better trail feel free to
use it, but you might miss out on the fun in getting wet crossing
the creek. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The coords might be a little jumpy, but I don't think it will cause
anyone problems once you are between the 2 large Cedar trees you
shouldn't even need your GPSr. As always comments on Terrain and
Difficulty are welcome, if you come up with better coords please
post them in your logs. I will keep an eye on the comments and make
adjustments as needed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you get stuck just send me a 
message or you can always call
me.&lt;br /&gt;

birthday. Since my boys love large caches I had to come up with a
spot big enough to fit their favorite type of cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a new nature trail in Bonney Lake. The city just opened
this area to the community on Arbor Day. Here is a pretty cool
slideshow of people cleaning up the area before the opening.
(Link)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature trail is only open from dawn to dusk.&lt;/p&gt;

birthday. Since my boys love large caches I had to come up with a
spot big enough to fit their favorite type of cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a new nature trail in Bonney Lake. The city just opened
this area to the community on Arbor Day. Here is a pretty cool
slideshow of people cleaning up the area before the opening.
(Link)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature trail is only open from dawn to dusk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a large clear lock 'n lock with a superman
on the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Happy Birthday Oliver&lt;/b&gt;

You are looking for a micro in the woods. No sense trying to deny
it. I'm really not sure about the difficulty I know for me it would
take me a while , enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The coords might be a little jumpy, I let it average for a good
long while. As always comments on Terrain and Difficulty are
welcome, if you come up with better coords please post them in your
logs. I will keep an eye on the comments and make adjustments as
needed.&lt;br /&gt;

The coords might be a little jumpy, but I don't think it will cause
anyone problems. As always comments on Terrain and Difficulty are
welcome, if you come up with better coords please post them in your
logs. I will keep an eye on the comments and make adjustments as
needed.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viking Park is the first site for an off-leash dog park in
Bonney Lake. The fenced park is in a wooded area with a trail,
waste station, picnic tables and a water station. The fenced areas
are accessed through a double-gated entry system designed to allow
dog owners the opportunity to remove or fasten dog leashes prior to
entering or exiting the facil! ity. The dog park is open free to
the public each day from dawn until dusk. Area dog owners are
encouraged to read the rules of conduct when visiting the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area is only open from dawn to dusk so please be respectful
and don't go after this one at night.&lt;/p&gt;

place to go especially on a hot summer day. However, Bonney Lake
has 8 parks and I wanted to bring people to some of the other
lesser known parks.
&lt;p&gt;Madrona Park is a 'pocket park' at the corner of 80th St and
182nd Ave. Amenities include a half-court basketball court, play
toys, a small picnic area with water fountain, and a view of Mt.
Rainier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park is only open from dawn to dusk so please be respectful
and don't go after this one at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a small clear Lock 'n Lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;YOU MUST PARK ON THE
STREET!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The neighbors seem quite nice but they don't want you parking in
their drive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Well I have some really bad news they are converging in a rural area of Mason County. Last time I was this worried was when Fish Bait was taking over the Summit Lake area. While out walking my dog with my wife we came upon a 35mm breeder of sorts. I don't know what to make of this but after 720+ caches I am positive this is part of the Micro Epidemic we are facing today. Remember friends don't let friends hide micros!!!!!!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is on the same logging road as Secret Creek There is no access to these caches other than the logging road!!</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: THANKS TO SOME HUNTERS, THERE IS A HUGE MESS HERE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would suggest waiting for a few weeks to let the coyotes
wander off with some of the bones and stuff sitting here. If you
dont mind it then go for it though by all means! LOL. If i can get
up there in the next few days or so i will get rid of some of the
mess.&lt;/p&gt; 

 Growing up we used to come down to play and fish under the bridge
nearby. If you want to go under the bridge be aware that it is very
steep and loose. I will not be held liable for anyone falling or
getting hurt. ( Consider yourselves warned! LOL) CONGRATS TO:

We started looking to the west a bit and made our way in the correct direction, when my geo senses started going crazy I was able to locate two dead give aways and had the cache in hand almost instantly.

Took &quot;caching for dummies&quot; and left a dog leash. You will definitely want to make sure this is placed very well back up in its hiding place and watch for muggles even in the passing boats.</groundspeak:text>

When we got there and they saw that people had been pulling at the orange barrier to get past to the cache they asked &quot;Why do grownups not know the rules? They made a huge mess of this fence! Thats not cool! Theyre going to ruin it for all of us.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thankfully it didnt take long to refocus their energy into putting a new cache together, and getting it hidden, not far from one of their earlier hides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Again, placed with the kiddos in mind, this cache is filled with small, fun trinkets and toys for the little ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please take care to rehide the container as well or better than you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;----------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grats to KokiNut and SirDescentSeas for one of their first FTFs!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Mary and Charles Curran purchased a 7.33 acre parcel of land in 1951 and transformed it into an apple orchard with 250 Gravenstein, Macintosh and Golden Delicious apple trees that quickly became a popular local landmark. The Curran's two horses, Brewster and Christopher, also enjoyed visits from local children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1993, the University Place Community Council successfully obtained Conservation Futures funds from Pierce County to preserve the orchard forever as a park. Today, Volunteers from CORE (Curran Orchard Resource Enthusiasts) continue their efforts in working with the City of University Place to develop the orchard into an &quot;urban, edible&quot; outdoor classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interested people can adopt a tree for one harvest season at a time for a small fee. The adopter is encouraged to prune, thin and harvest their tree. FREE Pruning classes and trained volunteers are available to provide guidance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Pavilion at the orchard is a favorite spot for weddings and small gatherings, especially during beautiful Spring days like the one we chose to hide this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring your own pen, and PLEASE make sure to cache completely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE : The apple orchard itself is a wonderful area for kids, with a small area for them to play and picnic tables. The cache itself is not the most kid friendly however. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>It's best to be positive, because people who are negative rarely seem as grounded as they think they are.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to KC Geo Clue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this cache series you will find extra large bison caches that will give you clues to find the final puzzle cache. If you have ever played the game Clue, you shouldn't have any problem with this cache series. Thanks to California Cacher &quot;Winkster&quot; for allowing me to steal heavily from his idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King County will serve as the &quot;board&quot; for this game. There will be a series of 6 caches representing each of the Clue suspects spread throughout King County as well as the final puzzle cache. You, are the star Medina Police Detective. You have been summoned to a large mansion on the Medina waterfront  to investigate the death of Mr. Boddy, a local multi-millionaire who suddenly and tragically passed away during a dinner party. Your job as the detective will be to &quot;investigate&quot; each of the &quot;suspects&quot; (caches) when you visit the cache and log the find. Inside each suspect cache you will find information that will help you narrow down who done it, with what weapon and in what room the evil act took place. Each cache will have a laminated card with SWR numbers as well as a separate three digit number. These SWR numbers correspond to the numbers on the Detective Note Pad that is attached to each cache. The &quot;S&quot; numbers are the suspects, numbers S1 - S6 which represent the all of the game characters. On the Detective Note Pad, Ms. Scarlet, for instance is S1. The &quot;W&quot; numbers will be for the weapons, W1 - W6. The knife is W1 on the Detective Note Pad. The &quot;R&quot; numbers are the rooms, R1 - R9. The Hall is R9 on the note pad.  During your &quot;investigation&quot; of the &quot;suspect&quot;, you will want to write down the SWR and three digit numbers you find in each cache on your detective note pad there by eliminating the suspects, weapons and rooms. Please note that you will need ALL THE NUMBERS on the laminated card to find the final puzzle cache! Also, PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE LAMINATED CARD THAT HAS THE SWR NUMBER PRINTED ON IT! The final puzzle cache will give you instructions as to what to do with the information you obtained from each suspect (cache). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mrs. White &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you make your way to Mrs. White, you see that she is dressed in a typical maids uniform. During the course of your interrogation of Mrs. White, you find Mrs. White to be quite upset about Mr. Boddy's untimely departure. Mrs. White tells you that she has worked for Mr. Boddy for 15 years now as live in maid. Mrs. White is quite tearful and sobbing about what happened to her employer and can not imagine who would do such a thing to Mr. Boddy. Further interrogation reveals that Mrs. White got a bit aggitated when the subject of pay came up. It seems that during her 15 year employment history with Mr. Boddy, she NEVER has received a raise for all of her hard work. You have a funny feeling that Mrs. White may be putting on act about the loss of Mr. Boddy and you think that she may be playing you. You wouldnt put it past Mrs. White to have a grudge against Mr. Boddy and with her easy access to  the plentiful steak knives in the kitchen you could vision Mrs. White making stabbing gestures towards Mr. Boddy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mrs. White &quot;hanging out&quot; at a location she feels a connection with. Its a place that she enjoys to walk at and the sound of running water can be heard nearby. You should have no challenges finding her. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy sleuthing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a drive up cache located on the county roadside right of way.  There is enough shoulder right at the cache site for pulling off a vehicle, or you can park down a nearby side street and walk back to it.  My GPSr signals never settled in this location, so the above coordinates are an average, but you only need to get within 200 feet to know where to hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am dedicating my first cache to my dad, Luther S. Winsor, a National Park ranger, and park planner, who taught me about the natural world as I grew up, inspiring a love of nature and a study of natural sciences in me.  He used his knowledge and experience to protect and preserve land and resources for the use and enjoyment of others, both for the nation in his work, and locally during his retirement years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have enjoyed driving by this particular botanical treasure for several years now. It is a magnificent example of this tree species, which is the third largest in North America. It is related to the Big Cone Spruce.  However, like the Big Cone Spruce, it is not a Spruce, it is a relative of the Hemlock, and belongs to the pine family. (However, its common name includes none of these designations) These trees can grow to be over 200 feet high and can be identified by their reddish barked, deeply grooved trunks, short, flat, soft needles, and small, soft cones which have bracts that look like the back ends of little mice crawling under the scales of the cone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The common name of this tree is on the cache log.  You are looking for a container similar to the size of a bison tube.</groundspeak:long_description>

Defiance, Vashon Island and the Gig Harbor Lighthouse.  When the mountain is out, (If you're a WA state resident, you know what I mean!)there is a great view of it as well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Originally placed by Blind Umpire in 2003, this cache has been an icon for Gig Harbor Caches ever since.  This muggle dense area calls for patience and stealth, and may require multiple visits due to lingering muggles.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The view is worth every trip, however.  The pilings from the old ferry dock are visible in the water not far from the viewpoint, and there are historical markers with interesting facts to learn.  I make regular visits there either walking or taking pictures of the different moods of NW sunrises and Mount Ranier.  Watch fishing boats, yachts, kayacks, etc. come and go from the harbor entrance.  Keep an eye out for herons, cormorants, terns, and the occasional harbor seal or bald eagle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also several benchmarks visible from this spot.  See if you can spot them!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just as in the original cache, the coordinates will put you in the middle of the little park by the largest round flower planter.  The cache is within 40 feet of the planter on the safe side of the railing, and not in any of the plantings.  The container is visible.  Although the hide is not quite as delightfully devious as the original, it should still present enough challenge to be a fun hunt and keep bringing cachers to this great spot.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A puzzler of a cache including a virtual waypoint and a final waypoint with container. Coordinates are for a tree, which will place you in a small waterfront park in Gig Harbor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The object is to have fun learning some interesting tree trivia, some local history and enjoy a great little harborfront park along the way.  There are several fun caches in the neighborhood of the first waypoint, and several more between that and the final. (See bookmark lists) Coordinates were averaged to 9 feet accuracy at both locations with a Garmin GPSmap 76CS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      Here's a botanical pop quiz featuring one of the most unique trees grown in the Pacific Northwest.  Native to the Southern hemisphere, this 600 million year old species is the dominant tree in the coniferous forests of Chile and Brazil.   The 60-150 ft. trees grow 40 years before seeds can be harvested and need one male tree for every 5-6 female trees for cones to be produced.  (hmm, how do you tell what sex a tree is?)  The cones take 2-3 years to mature. &lt;br/&gt;      Introduced to Great Britian in the late 1700's, these trees thrive in a cool, mild, moist climate like ours.  I was first intrigued by a huge specimen of this type of tree in The Butchart gardens in Victoria, B.C., and have loved them ever since.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The first waypoint is located at the tree in question.  After seeing the tree, see if you can answer the following questions.  (answers in final container on logboook cover)&lt;br/&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;  1. What is the common English name of this tree?&lt;br/&gt;  2. How did the tree get this name?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bonus question: Is this tree male or female? (answer not provided, e-mail me with your answer and the reason for it if you'd like to know what I think-since I don't know for sure myself!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      If you would like to research the answers and come prepared to confirm them, you can decrypt the hint for a clue to help with your research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, to find the coordinates for the final, stand on the sidewalk nearest the tree.  Take a compass bearing of 320 degrees and walk on that bearing until your GPS shows you are 100 feet from the tree.   Nearby will be the answers to the following questions. (You won't need compass bearings if you just explore a little, you can actually just walk along the sidewalk.) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. How many people do you see on or near the porch? This number is A.&lt;br/&gt;2.  How many children in the family who built the house?  This number is B.&lt;br/&gt;3. What was the cost per brick to build the house?  This number is C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now continue on the same bearing of 320 degrees (on the sidewalk) until you are 244 feet from the original coordinates.   Find the answers to the following questions at two locations nearby.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4.  How many fishermen took shelter in Gig Harbor and became the first white settlers there?  This answer is D.&lt;br/&gt;5.  How many times did Sam Jerisch sail around Cape Horn?  This answer is E.&lt;br/&gt;6.  Find the number of Sam and Anna's children.  This answer plus C is F.&lt;br/&gt;7.  How many 'cork' floats can you see where the fisherman is pulling in his net?  This answer is G.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Insert the answers as follows&quot;&lt;br/&gt;North 47* G.A C D      West 122*  E B. F A F&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North 47* __. _ _ _      West 122*  _ _._ _ _&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A correct answer will require a stiff uphill hike, or a short car ride.  There is easy nearby parking for the final, which is near a building and an intersection.  Check the second clue if you are still unsure that you are in the right spot.  Careful counting on the clues is essential!&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FNMXY1 - Botany 102 Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located in a beautiful, forested park and accesssible by way of a one mile walk, more or less, on marked, maintained trails. Depending on trailhead chosen, the trail is flat, muddy spots likely.  Cache is within a few feet of the trail, no climbing or bushwhacking needed. I have corrected coordinates to N47 21.117 W122 36.797 with 12'accuracy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     If a tree falls in the forest and a geocacher isn't there to hear it, does it make a sound?  It looks as though this one fell before there was any such thing as geocachers, but now there are, and sound or no sound, this is worth seeing, and worth a cache hide.&lt;br/&gt;     I discovered this spot while doing trail maintenance as a volunteer on Earth Day 2006. There are several places along the road to park, and trailheads from all of them.  N 47 20.840 W 122 37.262 will put you at trailhead 'E', which backtracks before joining the main trail, but is no longer than other options, and is the prettiest walk in &amp; out. Cache will show at about .36 mi. from parking, but the shortest route to it is .8 mi.&lt;br/&gt;     Main trail parallels the road.  Check trail post maps and head for 'Z'. After trailpoint 'Y' it shouldn't matter which trail you take, or which fork you choose at any junctions you encounter.  They will all take you where you need to go with very little difference in total distance traveled. For the final trail designation see the hint.&lt;br/&gt;     A note on signal.  Dense tree cover is the rule on this hunt.  Corrected Coordinates are more than adequate to put you close enough for your finding skills to take over on a fairly straightforward, easy hide.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Ninety percent of the apples grown commercially in the world
have six parents and two of those are the parents of the
others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wild varieties of apple have a wide range of flavors, but most
are unappetizing &quot;spitters&quot;. If you were to bite one of the apples
pictured above, you would know instantly that this is an apple
fully justifying its appellation. You may find most spitters
inedible, but they are actually some of the best cider apples.
Since colonial times, spitters have been used to make a strong
alcoholic beverage called applejack. George Washington was rather
fond of applejack and Johnny Appleseed knew a thing or two about it
as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teetotalers will find other trees nearby bearing Yellow
Transparent apples, which can be used to make an outstanding
applesauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This picture and descriptive text are exactly what they appear
to be and will not guide you to the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;47 23.XXX 122 24.XXX. A purist might say the answer should be
divided by 1000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could check your answers for this puzzle on
geocheck.org, if Garmin would let you.  12 correct guesses and 196 incorrect
guesses had been made prior to 2009-09-07 when the switch from
GeoChecker to GeoCheck was made.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Another cache on the Soos Creek Trail. This is near the entry point closest to our home.&lt;p&gt;

GPSr reception in this area is a little shaky. We had different units showing everything from 8 ft to 40 ft away at the same time.

Your feet should not have to leave the concrete. Please stay on the trail because you are surrounded by wetlands. Some stealth is required.

Parking may be the biggest headache in getting this cache. There isn't any legal parking close by. Please take a look at the parking co-ordinates supplied below.

Lion Stretching

The word stretch has many different meanings. Perhaps one of the definitions below will help you find this cache. It shouldn't be 7b and I hope you don't want to 10 me.

1. To lengthen, widen, or distend: stretched the sweater out of shape.

2. To cause to extend from one place to another or across a given space: stretched the banner between two poles.

3. To make taut; tighten: stretched the tarpaulin until it ripped.

4. To reach or put forth; extend: stretched out his hand.

5.   a. To extend (oneself or one's limbs, for example) to full length: stretched her calves before running.

      b. To extend (oneself) when lying down: she stretched herself out on the couch.

      c. To put to torture on the rack.

6. To wrench or strain (a muscle, for example).

7.   a. To extend or enlarge beyond the usual or proper limits: stretch the meaning of a word.

      b. To subject to undue strain: to stretch one's patience.

8.   a. To expand in order to fulfill a larger function: stretch a budget; stretch a paycheck.

      b. To increase the quantity of by admixture or dilution: stretch a meal by thinning the stew.

9. To prolong: stretch out an argument.

10. Informal: To fell by a blow: stretched his opponent in the first round.


Again, your feet should not have to leave the concrete. Please stay on the trail because you are surrounded by wetland.

Bring your own writing instrument, there isn't one in the cache.

Now walk 20 paces SSW, until you see a large Cement Slab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stand on the slab and again look SSW. There is a Slightly Steep Trail leading down towards the lake. When you get to the bottom of the trail, look for (3)Three Fir trees forming the Letter &quot;W&quot;. What you seek is behind the middle of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you have hopefully found it, please take your time to enjoy your surroundings and look for a picnic table, in case you brought a picnic lunch, or just have a rest before your return trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BTW, there are plenty of geocaches out in this area to keep you busy for a very long time, not to mention another Letterbox at Belfair State Park.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to KC Geo Clue! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this cache series you will find extra large bison caches that will give you clues to find the final puzzle cache. If you have ever played the game Clue, you shouldn't have any problem with this cache series. Thanks to California Cacher &quot;Winkster&quot; for allowing me to steal heavily from his idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King County will serve as the &quot;board&quot; for this game. There will be a series of 6 caches representing each of the Clue suspects spread throughout King County as well as the final puzzle cache. You, are the star Medina Police Detective. You have been summoned to a large mansion on the Medina waterfront  to investigate the death of Mr. Boddy, a local multi-millionaire who suddenly and tragically passed away during a dinner party. Your job as the detective will be to &quot;investigate&quot; each of the &quot;suspects&quot; (caches) when you visit the cache and log the find. Inside each suspect cache you will find information that will help you narrow down who done it, with what weapon and in what room the evil act took place. Each cache will have a laminated card with SWR numbers as well as a separate three digit number. These SWR numbers correspond to the numbers on the Detective Note Pad that is attached to each cache. The &quot;S&quot; numbers are the suspects, numbers S1 - S6 which represent the all of the game characters. On the Detective Note Pad, Ms. Scarlet, for instance is S1. The &quot;W&quot; numbers will be for the weapons, W1 - W6. The knife is W1 on the Detective Note Pad. The &quot;R&quot; numbers are the rooms, R1 - R9. The Hall is R9 on the note pad.  During your &quot;investigation&quot; of the &quot;suspect&quot;, you will want to write down the SWR and three digit numbers you find in each cache on your detective note pad there by eliminating the suspects, weapons and rooms. Please note that you will need ALL THE NUMBERS on the laminated card to find the final puzzle cache! Also, PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE LAMINATED CARD THAT HAS THE SWR NUMBER PRINTED ON IT! The final puzzle cache will give you instructions as to what to do with the information you obtained from each suspect (cache).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Green.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In true fashion, Mr. Green is dressed for the occasion looking dapper in his green suit. Mr. Green, has seen and heard some things while in the Mr. Boddy's mansion and is most willing to help you out during your investigation. Mr. Green says he's Mr. Boddy's long time banker and over the years has become good friends with Mr. Boddy. Mr. Green seems all to eager to help you with your investigation. He says he has &quot;nothing to hide&quot; but you wouldn't put it past Mr. Green raising the wrench over Mr. Boddy's head! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will find &quot;Mr. Green&quot; &quot;hanging out&quot; in a most appropriate location. NOTE: THIS IS NOT A NIGHT CACHE! Please do not attempt this cache after dark. I have permission from the property owners to have this cache at this location. The area is patrolled after dark by rent-a-cops. They are dispatched out of one of the near by buildings. They will hassle you if you are spotted at night at this location!  The cache is located just steps off of the nearby, well known trail (that seems to have a tie-in with this name of this cache and the river nearby). Please do not go into the vegetation to get this cache. The cache can be reached from the dirt trail next to the paved trail. Just unscrew the cap to obtain the log. Do not remove the cache from this location as it is secured and can not be removed by hand.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please follow these simple cache rules. If the area gets torn up by cachers or if I find out folks are visiting this at night, I will archive this cache and therefore the fun gets spoiled for everyone.  I have a very descriptive hint below if you cant find this one. If you are still lost, email me and I will help you, even physically show you where the cache is if need be. This is not meant to be a hard cache to get and I do not want folks tearing up the vegetation trying to get this one. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for following my rules on this cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE LAMINATED PAPER WITH THE CODES ON IT!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy sleuthing!&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Her hubby died in the war many 30 years ago and she never remarried. Peacock claims that she is Mr. Boddy's distant Aunt who was summoned to Mr. Boddy's mansion for the dinner party. She became &quot;distant&quot; due to a family squabble with Mr. Boddy's mother who is Mrs. Peacocks sister with the squabble being over inheritance issue. Mrs. Peacock, dressed in her bright blue dress and jewel studded rings, claims that she has no family issues with Mr. Boddy, but her eye for shiny gold jewely and her nervous shifty eyes leads you to believe otherwise and its not too far fetched to envision Mrs. Peacock swinging that heavy candlestick!  You will find Mrs. Peacock hanging out in a concealed spot where a lot of liquid move beneath her. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Sleuthing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache was originally a letterbox, but it has now been re-assigned for use on this website. At a later date, I will obtain the actual coordinates of the cache site, when I have a chance to visit it and pickup the letterbox stamp.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coordinates given for this cache is for the intersection of WA/SR-16 off-ramp and WA/SR-160/Sedgwick Rd., where you will be making a left turn and going westbound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLEASE FOLLOW THESE STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Begin your journey by taking the SE Sedgwick Road exit from SR-16 and proceed Westward towards Lowe's Hardware and Albertson's Grocery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Follow SE Sedgwick Road, crossing SW Sidney Road, until you come to an intersection with a very large cement block wall on the North side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Turn Southward onto Glenwood Road SW and continue for about two miles or so. Eventually, you will come to the intersection of Glenwood Road SW and SW Lake Helena Road. You are almost there with a couple more turns to go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Turn Westward onto Lake Helena Road SW and continue, until you come to Wick's Lake Road SW.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. Turn onto Wick's Lake Road SW and continue Northward, until you come to the end of the road. Here you will find a Green Double Gate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. Once your vehicle is parked safely, you may begin your short hike down to Wick's Lake. The distance to the lake is about 0.14 miles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7. Locate the Four Large Cement Blocks. Stop here for a rest and enjoy the view. Take time for a picnic, if you like or bring some fishing gear. Boats are allowed, provided you hand carried them from the parking area to the edge of the lake. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8. From the large blocks, continue Northward for about 0.12 miles, passing several side trails leading to the lake. You will come upon a major intersection of a logging road coming from the West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9. At that intersection, there is a somewhat overgrown trail leading down towards the lake. Follow this trail, until you are standing at the lake. Now look Southward about twenty to thirty feet or so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;10. What you seek is on the South side of a Tall Broken Tree Stump and well concealed at ground level. After you have signed and stamped the logbooks, please make sure this cache is well concealed and out of view of non-players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: The container is a Lock &amp; Lock with some collectible Cat-Eye Marbles.  </groundspeak:long_description>

Exit the WA/SR-16 at WA/SR-160/Sedgwick Rd. and go East and up the hill to Bethel Rd SE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Turn South/Right and continue over the top of the freeway, past the church on your Right/West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Continue South to the next &quot;T&quot; intersection with SE Mullenix Rd. on your Left/East.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Continue South to the next &quot;X&quot; intersection with SE Burley-Olalla Rd. crossing Left/East to Right/West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. Continue South to the next &quot;T&quot; intersection with SE Pine Rd. on your Right/West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. Turn Right/West and continue for a short distance to Park Dr. SE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7. Turn Left/South and continue past SE Fenton Rd. and slow down quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8. The entrance to the park is on your Right/West. Park in front of the gated entrance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9. The gate may be closed to cars, but there is a small one for people to pass through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT TO DO:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After your drive to this park, you may want to rest a bit. In that case, enter the park and have a seat on the log bench to your Left. While resting comfortably, take in the view and look around a little, in particular, where you are sitting and the baseball field to the West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If and when you are ready, look at the Dedication Plaque attached to the back of the bench upon which you are sitting. Read it's inscription and get ready to do some simple math. Please answer the following questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question #1. Larry lived how many years? The letters &quot;AB&quot; equals this number!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question #2. Germaine lived how many years? The letters &quot;CD&quot; equals this number!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you think you have the correct answers, get off your hind-quarters and start walking &quot;AB&quot; paces West towards and into the baseball field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you reach the correct location, look around the perimeter of the field, locate and go to the Cement Block (water pumping) building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you see those two huge Cedars off to your Right? Well, stand between them and start walking down the trail for another &quot;CD&quot; paces West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before you finish counting, you will find a post on your Left/South side with &quot;2844 1/2&quot; at it's base. Turn Left/South at the &quot;T&quot; and continue counting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When finished and you are in the correct location, look for the Conjoined Maple on your Right/West side. Go behind it and you will discover your prize.  </groundspeak:long_description>

Please watch your step.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the parking lot, walk east, across the field to the Chirico Trail sign. On the corner of the wooden fence on the right, you'll see a reflective tack.  There are a few more through the pedestrian gate.  Follow these to the cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tree with the final is marked by an orange tack approximately twelve feet above ground-level.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are looking for a lock-n-lock container.  You *will not* need to step off the trail to retrieve the container. Please rehide it well.

&lt;b&gt;I Can Read With My Eyes Shut!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;~~~ By: Dr. Seuss ~~~&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I can read in red, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I can read in blue.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I can read in pickle color too.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I can read in bed, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;And in purple, &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;And in brown.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I can read in a circle and upside down!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I can read with my left eye.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;And I can read with my right.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I can read Mississippi with my eyes shut tight!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;There are so many things you can learn about.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;But...you'll miss the best things,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;If you keep your eyes shut.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The more you read, the more things you will know.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The more you learn, the more places you'll go.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;If you read with your eyes shut you're likely to find&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;That the place where you're going is not far behind&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;So...that's why I tell you to keep your eyes wide.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Keep them wide open...at least on one side.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Poem Modified By: Fledermaus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;I'm counting on you to solve my mystery,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;And if you do, my geocache you will see.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;So, just climb the stairway and go inside,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to KC Geo Clue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this cache series you will find extra large bison caches that will give you clues to find the final puzzle cache. If you have ever played the game Clue, you shouldn't have any problem with this cache series. Thanks to California Cacher &quot;Winkster&quot; for allowing me to steal heavily from his idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King County will serve as the &quot;board&quot; for this game. There will be a series of 6 caches representing each of the Clue suspects spread throughout King County as well as the final puzzle cache. You, are the star Medina Police Detective. You have been summoned to a large mansion on the Medina waterfront  to investigate the death of Mr. Boddy, a local multi-millionaire who suddenly and tragically passed away during a dinner party. Your job as the detective will be to &quot;investigate&quot; each of the &quot;suspects&quot; (caches) when you visit the cache and log the find. Inside each suspect cache you will find information that will help you narrow down who done it, with what weapon and in what room the evil act took place. Each cache will have a laminated card with SWR numbers as well as a separate three digit number. These SWR numbers correspond to the numbers on the Detective Note Pad that is attached to each cache. The &quot;S&quot; numbers are the suspects, numbers S1 - S6 which represent the all of the game characters. On the Detective Note Pad, Ms. Scarlet, for instance is S1. The &quot;W&quot; numbers will be for the weapons, W1 - W6. The knife is W1 on the Detective Note Pad. The &quot;R&quot; numbers are the rooms, R1 - R9. The Hall is R9 on the note pad.  During your &quot;investigation&quot; of the &quot;suspect&quot;, you will want to write down the SWR and three digit numbers you find in each cache on your detective note pad there by eliminating the suspects, weapons and rooms. Please note that you will need ALL THE NUMBERS on the laminated card to find the final puzzle cache! Also, PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE LAMINATED CARD THAT HAS THE SWR NUMBER PRINTED ON IT! The final puzzle cache will give you instructions as to what to do with the information you obtained from each suspect (cache). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ms Scarlet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You find Ms. Scarlet &quot;lounging around&quot; in the lounge. During your interrogation of Ms. Scarlet,  you learn that Ms. Scarlet is a business associate of Mr. Boddy's and met while on a business trip in Saigon. As you talk with her you notice that she talks in general terms and does not go into a lot of detail regarding her relationship with Mr. Boddy. She claims she will help anyway she can to find Mr. Boddy's killer, but can you really trust a woman who uses a cigarette holder? You could easily see Ms. Scarlet craftily putting the rope around Mr. Boddy's neck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ms. Scarlet is &quot;lounging&quot; in a nice comfy &quot;fuzzy&quot; spot next to a trail appropriately named. Ms. Scarlet would never dream of being laying on the ground and she does have a fear of heights. To reach Ms. Scarlet, park at the established trailhead and take a nice walk .41 miles to Ms. Scarlet's hiding spot. The terrain rating is for the length of the walk, which portions of it are up hill, but not a very steep climb.  There is no need to go more than a couple of steps off the well established trail. Trail blazing IS NOT needed to find Ms. Scarlet and is NOT recommended in this park. When this cache was placed, the sat coverage was limited due to tree cover. Thus I have put a picture hint on the page if you cant find it based upon all of the hints already posted above. Please obey the park rules and do not attempt this cache at night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy sleuthing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking at Red Town Trailhead:  47 32.126  122 07.728&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

Though we will never know with certainty, there probably is some truth to the Kaldi legend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is said that he discovered coffee after noticing that his goats, upon eating berries from a certain tree, became so spirited that they did not want to sleep at night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the fifteenth century, in the Sufi monasteries of Yemen. It was here in Arabia that coffee beans were first roasted and brewed, in a similar way to how it is now prepared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THIS LETTERBOX / CACHE:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a Mystery Letterbox containing a Logbook and Stamp.

Relics of the old site can still be seen including a stairway that really leads to no where. Here you will find an extra large bison tube hidden in a most obvious spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While in the area, there are other caches not far and several trails that you can take that will take you much deeper into this awesome park.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pioneer Park is a 113 acre forest purchased by the City of Mercer Island in 1964. Ownership of the park was transferred to the Mercer Island Open Space Conservancy
Trust in 1992. It contains 6.6 miles of trails. The park has been kept in a natural state so that Island residents &lt;i&gt;'can easily get out in the woods'&lt;/i&gt; through the course of their daily lives. Roads divide the park into three distinct quadrants.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Northwest Quadrant is on the west side of Island Crest Way, but it also may be found by its location across from the QFC Village. Parking is available on 84th Avenue SE at the north end of the park. The forest is primarily deciduous, with conifers interspersed. This quadrant contains a perimeter trail that is accessible for strollers and wheelchairs.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is a small Bison placed inside a slightly larger camouflaged container, hidden in plain view. Please take care to replace cache as found.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do allow time to explore the Pioneer Park Trails and enjoy the sights, sounds, and fresh air!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Logging
Etiquette:&lt;/b&gt; Geocache hiders sometimes go through a great deal of
planning to place their caches. As a result, they'd like to hear
your feedback on whether you liked or disliked any aspect of the
hide, or if you feel that some cache maintenance is required.
Single word, acronym, or emoticon logs may be easier when you have
a lot of caches to log, but it doesn't tell the hider or other
finders anything about your adventure (or lack thereof) in finding
the cache. Please keep this in mind when entering your log. Thank
you, and Happy Caching!&lt;/p&gt;      </groundspeak:long_description>

You can find it, if you dare, for it is nestled in the Western region of Kitsap County. However and due to the encroachment of the Human civilization, the Elves retreated back into their forest and the Giants stood nearby to guard the Land of Elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Begin your journey by traveling to the Land of Pendergast Park, atop a hill and North of Loxie. After traversing several roads, you will come upon the House of the King's Men. Be careful not to arouse their suspicions, for they too seek the Treasure of the Giants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon your arrival at a blackened clearing, you will see many Giants watching over there domain. However, pay no attention to most of them, for they will do you no harm. The Giants you seek, six of them in all, are watching over their own lessor domain to the South and thinking of their Four lofty Goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of these Six Giants, sporting an LbNA Tattoo, oversees the Land of Canine and points the way to their treasure. But beware, for it is said that this treasure is protected by Old Stumpy the Elder, a fiendish Elf by nature, who hides in the Lands of Elves far to the North.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approach this Giant carefully and stand next to him. If he is bothered by your presence, walk 125 paces on a bearing of 280 Degrees, keeping the Land of Canines to the Southwest. When you have arrived at the Giant's Castle to the Northeast, you may stop and rest your tired bones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once rested, continue for another 130 paces on a bearing of 290 Degrees towards Castle Green. From here you should see the Seven-Eyed Giant in the distance, sporting an LbNA Tattoo, and faces East to guard his Field of Dreams. Carefully approach him, turn to the West and you will see a small trail leading into the Land of Elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon entering the forest and down a narrow path, you will see the Tree of Many Arms. It has been said that for each of you she captures, she is rewarded a Ribbon. From here, continue Left for about 15 paces, until you encounter the Ancient Traveler and guards the trail behind him. Choose the Right path and continue deeper into the Land of Elves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you encounter the (broken) Gateway to Old Stumpy's home, step over it and continue for about 20 paces. If this is your lucky day, you may discover the Giant's Treasure hidden within the Elf's rotting old house on your Left. Keep this in mind, if he catches you, you may become a tasty treat for him and his clan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Hunting and may your journey be a safe one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GLOSSARY OF TERMS:&lt;br/&gt;=======================================&lt;br/&gt;TERM = ROT-13 ENCRYPTION&lt;br/&gt;=======================================&lt;br/&gt;Land of Pendergast = Craqretnfg Cnex			&lt;br/&gt;Land of Giants = Yvtug Cbfgf bire Cnexvat Ybg&lt;br/&gt;Giant's Castle = Ynetr Terra &amp; Juvgr ohvyqvat&lt;br/&gt;Six Giants = Yvtug Cbfgf bire Fbppre Svryq&lt;br/&gt;Land of Canine = Bss-Yrnfu Qbt Cnex&lt;br/&gt;Seven-Eyed Giant = Yvtug Cbfg jvgu Frira Yvtugf&lt;br/&gt;Castle Green = Ynetr Terra ohvyqvat&lt;br/&gt;Field of Dreams = Onfronyy Svryqf&lt;br/&gt;Land of Elves = Jrfgrea Sberfg&lt;br/&gt;Tree of Many Arms = Zhygv-Gehax Gerr&lt;br/&gt;Ancient Traveler = IJ fvmr ebpx&lt;br/&gt;=======================================  </groundspeak:long_description>

Water&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Walking on water
generally refers to doing something that seems nearly impossible.
The phrase is often used outside a religious context, although it
has historically also referred to miraculous deeds. The phrase may
apply to the physical act of walking on water, either in fact or as
an illusion or miracle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The phrase is widely used in the English language to refer to the
performance of tasks in a manner out of the ordinary, e.g. as the
title of books that aim to show individuals how to break through
their personal limitations, and achieve dramatic success,
etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the well-known miracle which appears in the New
testament, in which Jesus walks on water (as in the Gospel of John
6:16–21) there are specific cases of reports of miraculous
acts of walking on water in several religions, such as Buddhist
texts, some Hindu stories, the Huang-Po story, the stories of
Orion, Horus, Macbeth, and the Aeneid and some native American
myths.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fortunately, logging a find here will not require any &quot;Adonis DNA&quot;
or &quot;Tiger Blood&quot;, nor will you need to perform any miracles, but
you will have to &quot;Walk on Water&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Beware of muggles (especially mini-muggles), as this is apparently
a very popular area. Please take care to leave the cache secure and
well camouflaged for the next cacher!

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Logging
Etiquette:&lt;/b&gt; Geocache hiders sometimes go through a great deal of
planning to place their caches. As a result, they'd like to hear
your feedback on whether you liked or disliked any aspect of the
hide, or if you feel that some cache maintenance is required.
Single word, acronym, or emoticon logs may be easier when you have
a lot of caches to log, but it doesn't tell the hider or other
finders anything about your adventure (or lack thereof) in finding
the cache. Please keep this in mind when entering your log. Thank
you, and Happy Caching!&lt;/p&gt;

you reach ground zero.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CAUTION: High muggle area adding to the general excitement of&lt;br /&gt;
finding the cache!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You're looking for a small, fragile ammo can, so please put
this&lt;br /&gt;
cache back EXACTLY as you found it to help keep it protected
from&lt;br /&gt;
the elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Congratulations kc0n on FTF!!!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

I don't know why, but I started out searching on the wrong side of the trail, which was fruitless, of course... I have a GPSr AND I know which way is North without it, yet I still managed to get myself turned around for a few minutes here. 

Eventually, I realized my error, and had the cache located quickly. Of course, that's when everybody decided to start showing up... Muggle after muggle after muggle... 

I had to use the 'talking on the phone' act and even snapped some nice photos while waiting them out, eventually finding the right moment to retrieve, ink and replace the log!

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who knew there were bison on Mercer Island?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, members of the genus Bison are large, even-toed ungulates within the subfamily Bovinae. Two extant and four extinct species are recognized. The surviving species are the American bison, also known as the American buffalo (although it is only distantly related to the true buffalo), Bison bison, found in North America, and the European bison, or wisent (Bison bonasus), found in Europe and the Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North American species is composed of two subspecies, the plains bison, Bison bison bison, and the wood bison, Bison bison athabascae. While all bison species are usually grouped into their own genus, they are sometimes included in the closely related genus Bos, together with cattle, gaur, kouprey and yaks, with which bison have a limited ability to interbreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just recently, a very rare species of bison was seen roaming through the Mercerdale Hillside Park. Word spread quickly, and now everyone is hoping for a chance to study this uniquely magnificent bison before they become extinct!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recently reported sighting was at the coordinates posted above. If you stay on the primary and secondary trails, have a keen eye, and exercise a little patience, you may be lucky enough to witness this rare bison in it's unnatural habitat! Be advised, due to heavy tree cover, you may find this bison roaming as much as 30 feet or more away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;I knew you would be
back for more, so I made this test special. I designed this cache
with you in mind.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Actually, that's not
entirely true, because I don't have a mind. But if I did, I would
have.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;As it turns out, not
having a mind is a good thing. For me.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;You know what they
say: A mind is a terrible thing to waste.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;I think you know what
I'm talking about.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Are you even
listening to me?&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;I don't think you
could find this cache if it were tethered to your GPS
device.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;I'm not going to lie
to you, the odds are a million to one. And that's with some very
generous rounding.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;You know what makes
me laugh? The thought of you finding this cache.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Ha ha ha ha ha, good
one.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Well, that concludes
the motivational speech portion of this test.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Time to find the
cache.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Are you still
standing there?&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Did we find
something? I say 'we' because you couldn't possibly have found it
without my help.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Congratulations. That
was genuinely mildly impressive.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;To help the
Enrichment Center continue to ensure the correct operation of this
test chamber for all future test subjects, we ask you to help us
help you help them by not destroying the cache
apparatus.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;At the Enrichment Center, we promise never to value your safety
above your unique ideas and creativity. However, we do require that
you do not share vital test results with other test subjects.
Violators are subject to permanent [test record] deletion.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Logging Etiquette:&lt;/b&gt; Geocache hiders sometimes go through a
great deal of planning to place their caches. As a result, they'd
like to hear your feedback on whether you liked or disliked any
aspect of the hide, or if you feel that some cache maintenance is
required. Single word, acronym, or emoticon logs may be easier when
you have a lot of caches to log, but it doesn't tell the hider or
other finders anything about your adventure (or lack thereof) in
finding the cache. Please keep this in mind when entering your log.
Thank you, and Happy Caching!&lt;/p&gt;

Eagles Landing
&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The Bald Eagle is the national bird of the United States of America. The founding
fathers of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the Roman Republic, in which eagle imagery was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the Continental Congress adopted the still-current design for the Great Seal of the United States
including a Bald Eagle grasping 13 arrows in one talon and an olive branch with 13 leaves in the other.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Breeding eagles are found throughout Washington State near large bodies of water.
Most nesting habitat is located in the San Juan Islands and on the Olympic Peninsula coastline. Two-thirds of all nests occur on private land. The number of nesting pairs was stable at about 100 from the mid-1970s through the early 1980s. In 1998, about 600 nesting pairs were counted in Washington State. That number increased to 835 pairs as of September 15, 2008.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Originally, I had a different theme for this cache, but decided to use something
different after seeing a nearby sculpture. The cache is camouflaged to blend in with it's surroundings. This is my first attempt with this type of cache, modeled after similar caches I have found in the past.

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Logging Etiquette:&lt;/b&gt; Geocache hiders sometimes go through a
great deal of planning to place their caches. As a result, they'd
like to hear your feedback on whether you liked or disliked any
aspect of the hide, or if you feel that some cache maintenance is
required. Single word, acronym, or emoticon logs may be easier when
you have a lot of caches to log, but it doesn't tell the hider or
other finders anything about your adventure (or lack thereof) in
finding the cache. Please keep this in mind when entering your log.
Thank you, and Happy Caching!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;FREE PARKING&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;
I wonder
if there are any among us who do not have many fond memories of
long days &amp; late nights playing Monopoly? One of my favorite
childhood board games (remember those?), we had our own special
rules to play by, and I suspect you did too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The
Official Monopoly Rules state: &quot;A player landing on this place does
not receive any money, property or reward of any kind. This is just
a 'free' resting-place.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We
always collected the money players paid in taxes and fines into a
separate stack, and when a player landed on Free Parking, they were
awarded any funds 'Free Parking' had accumulated, potentially
changing the course of the game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A quick
park and grab cache (BYOP), stealth may be required to successfully
log your visit while enjoying some Free Parking, Mercer Island
style.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Posted Park Hours are from 6:00am to 10:00pm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The farmers prayed to the Virgin Mary for her help, and the Ladybugs came to devour the pests and saved their crops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Henceforth, these little insects were called The Beetles of Our Lady, which over time was eventually shortened to Lady Beetles. It is said that the Ladybug's red wings represent the Virgin's cloak, while the black spots are symbolic of her joys and sorrows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AND NOW THE HUNT BEGINS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coordinates for this cache will only get you to the parking lot. From there you will have to follow the instructions as listed in the cache description below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somewhere on the Eastside of Bremerton, WA. is Blueberry Park, where you may have a garden and grow your own vegetables. And on a warm school day, you might hear the joyful sounds of children at play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, when you come to find this Letterbox, please take your time to enjoy this park and the gardens nearby. You might even consider taking a picnic lunch with you on a warm and sunny day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have parked your vehicle, proceed to the archway at the entrance to the park. Just beyond, you will find a covered picnic area and a children's play area to the West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you are ready, walk along the gravel trail, past the play area on your right. Along the way you will see a wooden bridge on the right, and then a bench for you to rest. A little farther there is a signpost informing you of the benefits of having a wetlands area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the distance and Eastward, you will see three tall sentinels. From the signpost, take a bearing of 75 Degrees Magnetic and go to the EGALR ELAMP and look inside.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck &amp; Happy Hunting !!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Letterbox is shared with Letterboxing.org, Terracaching.com and GPS Games.org websites.</groundspeak:long_description>

Geocaches or Letterboxes may be placed on Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission managed property only by written permission from the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission.&lt;br/&gt;2. The following items shall not be placed in the Geocache or Letterbox: Food items; illegal substances; medications; personal hygiene products, pornographic materials; inappropriate, offensive, or hazardous materials or weapons of any type. Logbooks are required for each cache and are to be provided by the owner of the cache.&lt;br/&gt;3. It is the visitor's responsibility to orient themselves with policies and rules pertaining to Washington State Parks areas.&lt;br/&gt;4. Report any incident, problem, or violation to State Parks staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THIS LETTERBOX:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First of all, the Park Ranger(Steve) and Park Manager(Steve) of this park are fully aware of Geocaching and Letterboxing. Prior to the installation of this Letterbox, there were two Geocaches belonging to me. With the addition of this Letterbox, that completes the maximum allowable number of &quot;caches&quot; within this park. If you wish to place your own Letterbox within this park, you must first gain permission from either the Park Ranger or Park Manager, preferably the latter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BEGIN YOUR HUNT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Begin your hunt by locating Illahee State Park on the Eastside of Bremerton. WA. It is located at the Eastern end of Sylvan Way, past Trenton Ave. From the park entrance, continue past the Park Ranger's Office and park at the next parking area on your Right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Find the lonely bush(es) that have taken control of a Large Old Stump that can hardly be seen.&lt;br/&gt;2. From there, go approximately 35 Paces to a very Lonely Fir Tree  to the East.&lt;br/&gt;3. Continue for approximately 45 Paces to the First Shelter built in 1937, now re-designed as a Covered Picnic area.&lt;br/&gt;4. Nearby the shelter, you will see a Large Maple Tree Stump and a Large Cedar Tree about 10 Feet away.&lt;br/&gt;5. Proceed Between the Tree and Stump and continue for about 42 Paces, until you arrive at a Bench. Take a break here, if you need one.&lt;br/&gt;6. Just beyond the Bench, you will see Three Signs, displaying information about the local flora and fauna.&lt;br/&gt;7. Look to your Right and you will see a Split-Rail Fence. Follow this fence for a short distance of approximately 24 Paces.&lt;br/&gt;8. Soon, you should see an Old Rotted Stump approximately 2 to 3 paces off the trail to your Right.&lt;br/&gt;9. Between that stump and a Bent Tree, you will find their Lazy Cousin wearing a Green Coat. What you seek is a Camouflaged Cylinder (with a Handmade Bat Stamp) at the Cousin's Feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck &amp; Happy Hunting !!!</groundspeak:long_description>

always stop here for a cup of coffee. In order to solve the puzzle
you will need 2 dates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All Dates are in MM/DD/YYYY format.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Date the tunnel first open to public bus traffic = AB/CD/CBBA&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Date the tunnel first open to public light rail traffic =
AE/CF/GAAB&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The final coordinates are N 47° (F-D)D.BGA W 122° CB.(E-C)EE&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bring your own pen/pencil. Getting good satellite reception is
difficult here, but google maps puts the final coords pretty close.
As always watch out for muggles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I almost posted another hint but decided not to for now, if you get
stuck just send me a 
message or you can always call
me.&lt;br /&gt;

when masterchef and kelientje visited seattle, they commented on how seattle seemed to be lacking in larger urban containers. when i mentioned how difficult it was to hide larger containers in the city, the ensuing discussion provided new insight from our european friends. my girlfriend then spotted the perfect hiding spot, which enabled me to present my first multi! you should be able to do this on foot within a lunch hour! terrain is 1.5 stars due to seattle's urban hill by the market.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
waypoint 1: start&lt;br /&gt;
you are standing at the very first location of this worldwide chain which opened here in 1971 and has gone on to forever associate seattle with coffee. this is actually the second location of the original, which was at 2000 Western Avenue from 1971 to 1976. they expanded to nyc in 1994. if you wander inside you will find a brass marker with some interesting information. to progress to waypoint2, you will need to stand just outside the door and count the number of visible green painted wooden boards framed in the ceiling above the entry way, this even number will be A. standing on the curb and facing the entry, count how many bolts are under the awning immediately and directly above the store windows and entry, this odd number will be B.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
waypoint2: N 47° 36.(580+A) W 122° 20.(507+B)&lt;br /&gt;
as the plaque states, this comical artwork was funded by gifts to care for the market. it's a great place to have a seat and admire the hustle and bustle during market hours. you will notice there are two rows of holes on each seat. to progress to waypoint3, you will need to count both rows of holes on each seat. red seat holes (even) = C and green seat holes (odd) = D.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
waypoint3: N 47° 36.(547+C) W 122° 20.(494+D)&lt;br /&gt;
this is a more recent seattle business which opened in 2003 and quickly took the niche market by storm, winning awards with quality handmade products using the highest quality ingredients. if you wander inside you can sample some of the best crackers you might taste. in 2011 they expanded to new york city, bringing handmade quality to both sides of the country. standing at the wp3 coordinates you will be able to observe the hand crafted process through the window. note the name of the company that made the machine they are using. ignoring the INC. portion, the number of letters in the first word will be E and the second word will be F, both are even numbers. now we are ready for the final!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
waypoint4 -final: N 47° 36.(589+A+B+C) W 122°20.(542+D+E+F)&lt;br /&gt;
PLEASE WATCH OUT FOR MUGGLES. this is a very high traffic area and there are lots of eyes in the windows but you should be able to see the cache without touching anything. you will know when you find it. for a good laugh, look up and see what's on the wall. when you obtain the cache, you might want to move to a safer location to sign the log away from muggles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
first and second to find prize is a gift card to one of the places in this cache. :) if you are FTF please only take one and leave the other for the STF. thanks and happy hunting!&lt;br /&gt;

This was definitely nice as this was the first vacation that the two of us have taken without the kids in ten years! Of course, this happens to be our ten year wedding anniversary so it all works out!

We came into Portland to visit a couple of friends from college and then we are all getting on a cruise for Alaska!! What a great way to spend an anniversary, going to new places and spending a lot of time with good friends!

Well today the cruise came to an end. And while it was sad, I think we needed to get back to reality. So after leaving the trip, we found ourselves in Seattle with all kinds of time to kill. See, we had an appointment at Groundspeak Headquarters at 2:00 and we were not about to leave BEFORE that appointment! Plus we wanted to check out more of the Pike Street Market. So we started hiking around on foot. And of course, we stumbled across some Geocaches along the way!

Found the cache after a quick search and in perfect working order. Took nothing, left nothing. Signed log. Thanks for the cache. </groundspeak:text>

this spot really deserves a cache, and is an ideal relaxation point for tourists. you can see the space needle and take in the smell of puget sound with the wind in your face. on a clear day, you will be able to see the snow-capped olympic mountains on the horizon across the water while ferries and sailboats meander across your view.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Masterchef and Kelientje pointed out this hide location when they were visiting seattle. we were surprised there isn't a cache here already so of course i had to place one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
this location has super high muggle traffic because it is right by a popular exercise (running, biking, dog walking) trail, so please be extra cautious of compromising the hide.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
*note 4/22/2012:&lt;br /&gt;
the original container filled with quality swag and custom logbook has been muggled. replaced with a more stealthy container that should help discourage muggles. please do your best to keep this hide safe and not compromise the location!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
the cache is not noticeable in plain view, the best method would be to meander around while searching for it without touching anything. when you spot the container, make sure the coast is clear, quickly make the grab, then move away to a safe area to sign the log. please return to the EXACT location for maximum concealment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
if the weather is nice and the seattle art museum's olympic sculpture park is open nearby, i highly recommend checking out the multi which covers this area:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC1A2TN&quot;&gt;Olympic Sculpture Park Walk : GC1A2TN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
i hope you enjoy this area as much as i do, and happy hunting!&lt;br /&gt;

I discovered my error early last week, and made a trip out to complete this cache today.

Thanks for the neat puzzle!</groundspeak:text>

there is a cache hidden in a part of seattle's recent history. this 33-foot tall totem pole was erected on february 26, 2012 in honor of John T. Williams as a symbol to promote peace and honor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John T. Williams, a 50 year old first nations totem carver, was shot and killed by a police officer on august 30, 2010.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
at roughly 3,500 pounds, the pole includes carvings of a perched eagle and a mother raven and the figure of a woodcarver.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
williams' friends and family worked on the pole for nearly a year, with space set aside for them at both seattle center and waterfront park on alaskan way so that passers-by could watch and even participate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rick Williams, the brother of the late John T. Williams, explains: “I, like my brother, am a First Nations carver in the heritage and tradition of my people and my family who have been carving in Seattle since at least 1926. We give the John T. Williams totem pole to the City of Seattle in the hope that it will be a symbol of peace and honor for many generations.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
this container has a feature to make it easier to retrieve, please note the orientation and replace exactly as found to insure easy retrieval for the next finder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
added 4/15/2012;&lt;br /&gt;
note this cache has an unintentional red herring 'in the hole' which is not the cache. the cache is accessible but you'll have to find it first. :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
bring your own pen! i hope you enjoy this totem pole as much as i do, and happy hunting!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

A red herring is a clue or piece of information which is intended to be misleading, or distracting from the actual issue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
some of my favorite caches feature clever red herrings located in likely cache hiding spots. in the spirit of this technique, there are plenty of red herrings featured in this cache to taunt and humor your search.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
the container is in an interesting location that should offer muggle-free searching most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
be sure to check out the view from the top where you can admire an unobstructed view of the space needle to the south as well as the wonderful queen anne neighborhood hill to the north.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
*in addition to the cache, there are six red herrings planted nearby, as well as numerous 'natural' red herrings, let us know how many you've found!&lt;br /&gt;

a giant old tree that used to grow on this corner fell over during a windstorm, cracking this telephone pole and denting the sign next to it. you can still see the stump of the old tree about ten feet south of the cracked pole. google street view shows the original tree and the pole!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
the large building to the south-east is a retirement community so there are lots of eyes staring out of those windows -beware of muggles!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
coordinates have been verified via google earth. if anyone has more accurate coordinates, please let me know!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
this is my attempt at using the largest possible container for the available location.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
the cache is located on public property and the container is unique, quite possibly the first of its kind in the seattle area! FTF prize is a signed dollar bill.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to KC Geo Clue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this cache series you will find extra large bison caches that will give you clues to find the final puzzle cache. If you have ever played the game Clue, you shouldn't have any problem with this cache series. Thanks to California Cacher &quot;Winkster&quot; for allowing me to steal heavily from his idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King County will serve as the &quot;board&quot; for this game. There will be a series of 6 caches representing each of the Clue suspects spread throughout King County as well as the final puzzle cache. You, are the star Medina Police Detective. You have been summoned to a large mansion on the Medina waterfront  to investigate the death of Mr. Boddy, a local multi-millionaire who suddenly and tragically passed away during a dinner party. Your job as the detective will be to &quot;investigate&quot; each of the &quot;suspects&quot; (caches) when you visit the cache and log the find. Inside each suspect cache you will find information that will help you narrow down who done it, with what weapon and in what room the evil act took place. Each cache will have a laminated card with SWR numbers as well as a separate three digit number. These SWR numbers correspond to the numbers on the Detective Note Pad that is attached to each cache. The &quot;S&quot; numbers are the suspects, numbers S1 - S6 which represent the all of the game characters. On the Detective Note Pad, Ms. Scarlet, for instance is S1. The &quot;W&quot; numbers will be for the weapons, W1 - W6. The knife is W1 on the Detective Note Pad. The &quot;R&quot; numbers are the rooms, R1 - R9. The Hall is R9 on the note pad.  During your &quot;investigation&quot; of the &quot;suspect&quot;, you will want to write down the SWR and three digit numbers you find in each cache on your detective note pad there by eliminating the suspects, weapons and rooms. Please note that you will need ALL THE NUMBERS on the laminated card to find the final puzzle cache! Also, PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE LAMINATED CARD THAT HAS THE SWR NUMBER PRINTED ON IT! The final puzzle cache will give you instructions as to what to do with the information you obtained from each suspect (cache). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Plum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Plum is nicely dress in a dark purple dinner jacket that looks well worn. Prof. Plum claims he is a tenured professor of business economics at the nearby university. The professor claims that he came to know Mr. Boddy during some philanthropic dealings with the university and has had him as a guest speaker during his classes. Prof. Plum is an avid &quot;kayaker&quot; frequents the GZ with Mr. Boddy who is also a &quot;rower&quot;. The professor claims he cant imagine why anybody would want to kill Mr. Boddy and is very eager to assist you in any way he can. If the professor can handle a paddle, you can easily see him handling a lead pipe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will find the good professor &quot;hanging out&quot; in a most appropriate place for a man of higher education. I have provided parking coordinates for this one as well as a hint. I have set the terrain rating higher than the rest in this series but thats for the 30 feet. The rest of the route from the parking to GZ is a 1.5. The sat reception in the GZ was challenging given the tree cover. Hence, I have posted a spoiler photo along with the hints I have already posted in the story above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy sleuthing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Since then I have found spiders, ants, and other insects, various types of garbage, small toys while looking for caches.  What have you found?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This only fits in the hiding spot in one way, please return it to it stays hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratz to Lfppdf8&amp;MyBetterHalf (both of them) for the First To Find!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">If you are looking for a quick and easy find, this cache isn't for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DRIVING INSTRUCTIONS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From SR-3 North or South - Exit at Kitsap Mall Blvd., then go South on Kitsap Mall Blvd. to Silverdale Way NW. Turn Left/North and continue to NW Schold Lane and turn Left/W. following it to Schold Road NW. Turn Left/South for about 1/4 mile to the Schold Farm Park entrance sign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABOUT THE CACHE:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this cache is to teach you how to use several functions found in your GPSr, such as Waypoint Projection, the Metric System and the Degrees - Minutes - Seconds format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since you will be going to several places within Schold Farm Park, you have a choice of either walking the trails or riding your bicycle, if you have one, to each of the waypoints below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you bring and ride your bicycle, please be respectful of those who frequent this park for their morning and afternoon walks, sometimes with their dogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since you may be here for awhile looking for other caches in this park, bring the kids, the dog and a picnic lunch while you enjoy the wide open fields and trails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache container is a Camouflage painted Ammunition Can. It has been secured to a Multi-Trunked tree with a Steel Cable and a Keyed Lock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WHAT'S IN IT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this time, there are no restrictions to the cache contents. However, I do suggest that you don't clutter up this cache with Personal Trademark Items, such as Stickers and Buttons et cetera, as cache trade items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the difficulty of this cache, placing a Travel Bug or GeoCoin into this cache may not be a good idea, since this cache isn't found as often as most other caches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PARKING COORDINATES:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WP-#1: N 47° 40' 17.0&quot; @ W 122° 40' 56.3&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have parked your vehicle, Please Read the Signboard at the entrance to the park, then warm up your GPSr and go to Waypoint #2 and get ready for the hunt!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WP-#2: N 47° 40' 17.1&quot; @ W 122° 41' 08.1&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT: Bearing: 014° / T @ Distance: 0.19 Km. The BEARING for the Final Cache is written in Black Marker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HINT: Sit down and take the load off the ground!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WP-#3: N 47° 40' 17.1&quot; @ W 122° 41' 08.1&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT: Bearing: 215° / T @ Distance: 0.13 Km. The DISTANCE for the Final Cache is written in Black Marker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HINT: You need a different point of view!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WP-#4: N 47° 40' 17.1&quot; @ W 122° 41' 08.1&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starting at this location, you may now Project the Bearing &amp; Distance information you found at WP-#2 and WP-#3. Now place your answers into the Final Cache Coordinates shown below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WP-#5: THE FINAL COORDINATES&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 47° ____' ____&quot; @ W 122° ____' ____&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shortest distance between two points is not always a straight line!&lt;br/&gt;If you are on the boardwalk and find a bat symbol, you're in the wrong place!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPECIAL NOTES:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now that you have all the information you need, be careful of the pathway you choose to find the cache. It's completely off trail and you may encounter Marshy Ground, Tall Grass and Stickers along the way. The boardwalks are there for a reason, because some of the land becomes flooded in the rainy season. So, Please watch your footing, whichever way you go, and wear sturdy hiking shoes or boots and long pants!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you see a Bat Symbol, You're in the Wrong Place!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GOOD LUCK &amp; HAPPY HUNTING !!!&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The bridge replaces a car ferry service dating from the 1920s. The Agate Pass Bridge operated as a toll bridge until October 1, 1951.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Agate Pass Bridge cost $1,351,363 to build. Construction costs were paid out of the motor vehicle fund, and were repaid by a bond issue passed by the 1951 State Legislature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tolls generated by traffic across the bridge repaid the bond. The toll was 35 cents per car plus driver and five cents per passenger. The Toll Bridge Authority managed the bridge during the one year it took to repay the bond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;State Highway Director William A. Bugge opened the bridge by fitting a giant wooden key into a large lock suspended over the bridge roadway. Next on the Highway Department’s agenda was “straightening, widening, and relocating 4.7 miles of highway from near Poulsbo to the north end of the bridge and 4 miles from the south end of the bridge to near Winslow. The [existing] narrow winding roads … are dotted with signs: '20 M.P.H.'” (The Seattle Times).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Agate Pass Bridge provided (and continues to provide) a direct route between Seattle, via the Seattle-Bainbridge Island ferry, and the Kitsap and Olympic peninsulas. The bridge spans Agate Pass 75 feet above the water and has a channel clearance of 300 feet between piers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN2X9ED - GC2X9ED Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

It was pretty awesome to find a &quot;real&quot; cache--non-micro container--that was clean and dry.  The terrain is very easy unless the bridge is slippery, which it almost always is.</groundspeak:text>

Before I picked up the cache, I watched a Great Blue Heron perched on a post on the other end of the bridge.   I found the cache completely out in the open and replaced it where I thought it should go, according to the cache page description.  I've been to this area before for other caches, and I can tell you that the bridge deck is VERY slippery when icy or frosty (about 5% of the time) or wet (the other 95% of the time).  Parents who let their kids run on ahead (a bad idea in caching anyway) be warned!  I took the TB to move along and left a pathtag.  Nice job on your first cache--thank you!</groundspeak:text>

This cache is tiny and camouflaged and in the center nook of a perfectly manicured large tree near the center of the park.

Don't know if someone found the cache or if you hid it so well because the tree is heavily used, but it definitely was a disappointment.</groundspeak:text>

got snagged by groundskeepers Do not PAF for hide info cause I
moved the container see new coords

&lt;b&gt;Silver Lake in Everett is the place to be.
I decided to place a cache here since this is a great place to cool
down. &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Puget Sound temps lately have set
records and today was still pretty hot. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Located away from high traffic areas so
extreme stealth will not be required. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have fun and happy
hunting.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take me out to the
ballgame&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summer time you will find games played almost all
the time.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best time to seek cache is early weekday mornings.
I used to&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;play coed softball here and would like to again.
Kasch park&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;is awesome. Soccer fields here too. Happy hunting
and dont&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;get snagged by the berry
bushes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking available in main softball area just
NorthWest of QUAD.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Easiest way to get to cache now is from quad
entrance, walk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;around outfield fences clockwise until your GPSr
needle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;takes a left turn. Boots or hightops will make
your journey safer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Berry bushes are in full growth summertime, so
come with&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;armor or snipping tools.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The groundskeeper looked at us funny as we sidestepped all along the fence, but he must see people doing this often because there had been a lot of other people at the cache recenlty before us.  :)  Had a nice walk on a beautiful August day and the kids played in the park after.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&quot;It's been (over 60) years since U.S. Route 2 was built through the
old cemetery....&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Snohomish Pioneer Cemetery - A controversial piece of land.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I came across the information on this while doing some local
genealogy research. The grassy piece of land uphill, just NW of the
cache used to be the southern two-thirds of the Snohomish
Pioneer/Indian Cemetery. The other third is under the old highway 2
cut (2nd street) and the fenced off property north across 2nd
street. Lots of drama unfolded when claims were made that the
Senior Center &amp; parking lot were built over the top of graves
that had not been moved to other cemeteries. The city was forced to
check for remains and the results came back positive that there
were people still buried here. Since the remains were found, the
Senior Center and parking lot were removed. All that is left now is
a nice grassy lot.
&lt;p&gt;It's sad to see that there are no longer monuments to identify
those still buried here. It's almost a certainty that there are
graves still remaining in the unexplored north portion of the
cemetery across Second Street within the old Pioneer Village site
(look for the old cabin), under Cypress Avenue and the road leading
into Pilchuck Park, along the south rock wall at the entrance to
Pilchuck Park, and the far east part of the bluff overlooking
Pilchuck River. The old maps indicate graves were located in these
areas. Kinda gives you goosebumps, eh?!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the north side of 2nd street, in what used to be the Pioneer
Village replica site, sit some of the tombstones that were hauled
over when the highway was cut through. These tombstones are not
sitting atop their graves as one would assume. They were arranged
in a &quot;fake&quot; cemetery for the replica village.&lt;/p&gt;

Decertification Attempt-&lt;/a&gt;This is an absolutely fascinating Adobe
document with maps and pictures of the site. I'll warn you though,
it is large.&lt;br /&gt;
The Rootsweb website also has a lot of information on the protest
&amp; removal of the senior center that was built atop this
cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a bison in about the only place one can be
hidden at GZ. You may need a tool to get it. Please be stealthy and
make sure the cache is well hidden before you leave. Please let me
know if there are any problems with the cache or the
coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

OK, maybe not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many interesting facts about Lake Stevens, but one little piece of information I found particularly chilling.  As the story goes, a woman died when she drove through a railing into the lake.  People have claimed to see her floating above the water, staring at them as they drive by.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I can't imagine how I would feel upon seeing this apparition, but it would make me hesitate to drive in that area again.  Oooooo, creepy!  I've hunted for more details on this, but can't seem to find out anything more.  I'm not even sure which road around the lake that this occurred, or if this is just urban legend. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look for a small waterproof match container.  I've upped the difficulty on this - seems its very hard for people to spot - the hide is not particularly clever.  Remember to bring your own writing instrument and Happy Haunting (oops, I meant &quot;Hunting&quot;). </groundspeak:long_description>

receiving - more so than email. 

&lt;p&gt;I bet AOL is proud of the fact that the phrase &quot;You've got Mail&quot;
is so recognizable. I was so impressed by all the internet had to
offer when I first signed on sooo long ago, but the long distance
charges just killed me (Island County didn't have any local access
numbers way back then).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used to put a lump in your throat when you heard those three
little words - wow, I've got email!! Now, with all the spam out
there, it can be a chore to weed through it all. And if you have a
friend or relative who just discovered the internet, your inbox can
be flooded with every joke, picture, tip, and chain letter known to
man.&lt;/p&gt;
The find should be fairly easy, but parking nearby will probably
not be. GPS reception wasn't the best when I hid this.  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the site of Hartford - a stop on the Everett &amp; Monte
Cristo Railway - later renamed the Hartford Eastern Railway.


&lt;p&gt;On March 23, 1936, workers began the removal of rails on the
abandoned Hartford Eastern Railway line between Hartford and Monte
Cristo to make way for the new forest service automobile road. You
can still see remnants of the old railbed along Highway 92 in some
areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decades earlier, the Everett &amp; Monte Cristo Railway Company
purchased the partially constructed Snohomish, Skykomish, and
Spokane Railway (called the &quot;3 S&quot;) line between Snohomish and
Lowell. They then constructed their own grade from Hartford
Junction (this cache site) near Lake Stevens to Monte Cristo via
Granite Falls, Robe Canyon, and the mines at Silverton. After
weather and flood delays, the line finally reached its destination
in September 1893. Between Snohomish and Hartford, the company
leased trackage rights from the Seattle, Lake Shore &amp; Eastern
Railway. This is the present day Centennial Trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to tell just where the old depot was located. The site
is not obvious and a few hours research have not turned up
anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is now a small round tin with room for little items &amp;
the log. *It is not weatherproof. Please make sure it is placed
back inside ziploc before re-hiding.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Whale tracks?! (TIDE MUST BE BELOW 8 FEET)&lt;br/&gt;At low tide this stretch of beach offers broad, easy walking for a mile south and 2 miles north from the Mabana boat ramp.&lt;br/&gt;This is not a park, but you can park by the fire hall at N 48 5.593' W 122 24.563' if the lot's mostly empty (It usually is.), and view the eagle nest high across the street while you're there. Walk down the road through the community of Mabana to their private boat ramp and off the end onto the beach.&lt;br/&gt;The beach is usually empty and a great place to find wild critters and the tracks they leave. Great blue herons are almost guaranteed, eagles are likely, and you might be lucky enough to encounter an otter or deer or seal.&lt;br/&gt;From mid-March to mid-April gray whales cruise this beach at high tide, thrashing the shrimp up out of the sand. They leave tracks that last into summer.  More details in the cache.&lt;br/&gt;The land above the beach is all private. Do not camp, build fires, or try to climb the bluff. You don't have to leave the beach to get the cache.&lt;br/&gt;The beach is very broad (and great jogging!) at low tide, but the water comes right up to the woods at the highest tides. The Seattle tide tables are a near-perfect match for here, and a program like JTides, free from http://arachnoid.com/JTides/index.html, gives greater detail than tables.</groundspeak:long_description>

not park on the south side of the river! If it's hot out, bring
your swimsuit! 



Cache container is once again an ammo can. Some cliffs in the area
of the cache -- please be extra cautious! Lots of muggles in
summer. 
&lt;p&gt;Park Features: * River Swimming Area * Portable Restrooms *
Picnic Tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary feature of this small park is a pedestrian
suspension bridge across the South Fork of the Stillaguamish River.
A path leads to the river shore where visitors can swim and relax
during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
Park History: The Jordan Bridge was first constructed in the early
1900's. The swinging bridge was historically used as the northern
access to the Jordan Bridge community. The bridge was built to
provide access for children attending school at Jordan, and to
provide a shorter route to Arlington on the south side of the
river. The bridge was condemned in November of 1972 due to its
dilapidated condition. It was rebuilt in the &quot;swinging bridge&quot;
style in the 70's and closed again in 90's for repair. It was then
rebuilt as a semi-solid structure by Snohomish County parks.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKPRPH - a good place to put your car&lt;br /&gt;N 48° 08.885 W 122° 02.281&lt;br /&gt;More parking available further west (north?). </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">(Dec 26, 2011) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello Opencachers,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I need your help.  My rich, adventurous, and eccentric uncle has disappeared again and has stayed missing longer than usual.  I've been trying to track him down for several weeks now, but following his travels has led me into getting stuck in an old research station near the North Pole.  I have plenty of fuel and provisions, and the Russians have promised to rescue me in the spring, but I'm afraid that without your help, the trail I've been following to find my uncle will become colder than the air outside my hut.  Fortunately, my associate has found a log-book of his caches in a cabin my uncle built on an island off the coast of northern BC; I will share the first cache here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache appears to be in a park in Langley, BC.  My uncle's notes describe the contents as some money from countries that he visited: two coins from adjacent countries, and a paper bill.  The first to find can keep the paper bill, it's supposed to come from a former communist country  with some interesting communist slogans on it (&quot;Freedom! Factories! Land!&quot; &quot;Proletarians of all countries, unite!&quot; &quot;Proletariat, organ of the international, socialist-revolutionary party&quot;).  The two coins can be traded for other, interesting coins.  I ask only that you let me know where the paper bill and the coins came from, and what coins you are leaving in trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It appears the listed coordinates lead to the general area of the cache, where you can get a clue for more specific coordinates:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;{Rosamond Sarles lived to a ripe old age&lt;br/&gt;Before she died, on her birthday&lt;br/&gt;Subtract 81 from her age to get Y&lt;br/&gt;And 64 from her age to get X&lt;br/&gt;Find a small jar at 49 02' 7.Y and 122 39' 27.X&lt;br/&gt;(NOTE: these coordinates are in the DD MM' SS.ss format)}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, and please let me know as soon as you figure out where the bill and the coins in the cache come from, it will give me important clues in the search for my uncle.     </groundspeak:long_description>

Nice easy find on these bike trails, lots of places to hide caches in this park.

I really don't believe that none of those prolific FTF seekers in Abbotsford have not gone looking for this very creative and well done hide, We looked high and low trying not to leave any trace as to where we had actually looked and finally Solonm come up with the goods.

Very well hidden cache.

Thanks for the adventure and the FTF

There is room for small trade items. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache is not at the posted co-ordinates.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;CRAP:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We hear this word normally used as a form of slang, it is most often used to describe the droppings of anything from tiny birds to animals as large as Elephants. Sometimes in that same description there are other superlatives used to enhance the point we are trying to make.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the description really has nothing to do with CRAP at all, such as $()%$$* CRAP, and !@@)@*$) CRAP. We cannot use the real words here because of  censorship, however you get the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you walk, bike or run along the Rotary Trail and parts of our local dike system, you will encounter all kinds of CRAP, the little Rabbit droppings in the bush are unobtrusive, the odd Coyote scat is also part of nature and often tells us what they had for lunch, stuff from above is of no concern unless it lands on us, we also have the Doggy Do Do, left behind because the owner won't pick up after their pet. Then there is the large piles of Horse Crap, now this should not be confused with Bull Crap, which is most abundant during fishing season. However none of this Crap should be left on the trails for other users to dodge and pets to eat and roll in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's keep our wonderful trails crap free...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache has been placed an appropriate distance from any other cache listing.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">So it turns out that despite hiding a cache near UBC (http://www.opencaching.com/#!geocache/OXZTMTD), my mysterious uncle did not attend that university.  Maybe he just liked to play hackie-sack in the nude on Wreck beach, who knows.  However, a newly deciphered cache should provide a clue as to which post-secondary institution he did attend, have a read:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STAGE 1&lt;br/&gt;Find a foot bridge at the posted coordinates and count the number of boards that make the deck of the bridge to get X (bring galoshes if recent days have seen heavy rain)&lt;br/&gt;A = (X+1)/10&lt;br/&gt;B = (X+1)/5&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STAGE 2&lt;br/&gt;There once was a boy named SKL&lt;br/&gt;Who liked to spray graffiti, but not very well.&lt;br/&gt;All he could do was spray his name&lt;br/&gt;On beautiful old cedars, how thoroughly lame.&lt;br/&gt;Find a cedar grove, his favourite playground,&lt;br/&gt;And count the mighty cedars tagged with his name all around.&lt;br/&gt;The entrance to the grove is at:&lt;br/&gt;N 49 05' X.AA&quot; &lt;br/&gt;W 122 X' 16.BA&quot;&lt;br/&gt;(DD MM' SS.ss&quot; format)&lt;br/&gt;And &quot;C&quot; is your count of cedars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STAGE 3&lt;br/&gt;Find another foot bridge at:&lt;br/&gt;N 49 05' X.CC&lt;br/&gt;W 122 X' 28.30'&lt;br/&gt;(DD MM' SS.ss&quot; format)&lt;br/&gt;Stand in the middle of the bridge and look directly downstream, &lt;br/&gt;South by south-west, 205 degrees.&lt;br/&gt;A small jar waits for you in front of the retaining wall,&lt;br/&gt;In the hollow of that tree, under some leaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache apparently contains three items, one of them being a clue to my uncle's university.  Please tell me what that clue is once you find it.  The other two items are small electronic devices; first to find can keep one of them, the other one can be traded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck!  </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;That's what you'll be thinking. 
  You'll be looking at this waypoint on a map and thinking why. Why would anyone 
  put a cache there? But you know what? You'll jump in your cachemobile and drive 
  out there anyway just to find out. And when you get there, you'll be happy to 
  discover that I didn't just drag you out to some industrial wasteland for a 
  'drive-up' nestled in between a couple warehouses so you can get your numbers 
  up. No, sir. Because nestled between the warehouses and factories is a full 
  fledged bird sanctuary complete with duck pond and lookout tower. The trick 
  is, how do you get there? But since this cache is more about why than how, you'll 
  just have to figure that out for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you reach the given 
  coordinates, you will find an information sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A = How many billion 
    liters of water are treated each year?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;B = How many thousand 
    tonnes of biosolids are processed each year?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;XXX = A - 290&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;YY = B + 36&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located at 
  N49 10.XXX, W122 57.0YY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a 500ml camo-painted 
  Lock &amp; Lock. Because the cache is relatively small, please only bring small 
  trade items and please do not try to overfill the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first person to find 
  this cache will find a shiny, new, unregistered TravelBug that is theirs to 
  keep - no trade necessary.

The posted coordinates of this cache are the FINAL coords so you can go right to it. You won't find a sign with any info on it because it's not at these coords. If you want to read about the sewage treatment plant etc walk 175m further west and you&quot;ll come to an observation tower and the signs are there. This is a great birdwatching place, and well worth the visit. Please do not disturb the nesting swallows in the nesting boxes along the fence, during May and June.</groundspeak:text>

Traffic was tied up on the bridge and I was right at the Annacis exit, so I decided to do this one, my last cache on this island. Finding the path in is quite a challenge, but putting up with the smell was even harder. Glad this one has a smiley now. A place I never knew existed and will never return to.

Took a bit to locate the final, as my math apparently sucks and my brain was refusing to listen to my geo-sense. Got there in the end. Thanks!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is one of a series of caches dedicated to the history and heritage of North Burnaby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

There is a picturesque little beach on the south shores of Burrard Inlet. One hundred years ago, this small stretch of sand was popular with the townsfolk living in the eastern section of Barnet. Today, it has become all but forgotten. Few people realize that this area harbours a secretive and sinister past. Read all about it at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

http://bobbea.com/treasure/secrets.html
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Additional hints are avalable on the website.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Although this cache is located on public property designated for the Barnet Marine Park expansion, it is listed as a &quot;kayaker's cache&quot; as the easiest way to the cache is from the water. The puzzle for landlubbers is to find the one (and only one) land route to the hidden beach. The parklands in this area are not yet developed and the existing trails can be difficult at the best of times. For those cachers not interested in a hit and miss walking tour, directions can also be found on the website.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy your visit.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Widgeon Slough&lt;/b&gt; is the
      largest freshwater marsh in southwestern BC and is a
      birdwatchers' paradise. Beavers, otters, Ospreys, Great Blue
      Herons and Bald Eagles are common sights. Many species of
      wetland birds including Sandhill Cranes, Trumpeter and
      Whistler Swans, coots, bitterns, rails and several species of
      ducks can be found here at various times of the year. 
&lt;p&gt;The slough
consists of a network of meandering back channels interspersed with
small sandy beaches suitable for sunning or picnicking. The slough
is a premier paddling destination and large groups of inexperienced
paddlers come here to paddle and explore the quiet, interesting
waters. Be sure to bring along your camera and
binoculars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widgeon Slough is
     easily accessible by canoe or kayak from the public dock at
     Grant Narrows Regional Park. Canoe rentals are available from
     May to September at Ayla Canoes located next to the public
     dock. Entrance to Widgeon Slough is opposite the dock across
     the Pitt River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is
not located at the listed coordinates. When you reach the
coordinates you will see a sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; =

 &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; = A + number letters in the second word on the

&lt;p&gt;Rather than
buy myself an extravagant birthday present as I am prone to do
every year, this year I decided to leverage my other birthday
tradition of taking the day off from work by treating myself to an
overnight kayaking trip up Pitt Lake to find a couple of the new
caches that have been recently placed. While packing for the trip
one of my travelling companions suggested (insisted would be more
accurate) that I plant a couple of my own caches as well. This
cache is the first of two I placed on the east shore of Pitt Lake
on my birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache
container is a sandwich-sized Lock &amp; Lock and, while it does
contain a couple of small trade items, trading is not required or
expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is
only accessible by boat and is just a couple meters off the rocky
beach. The easiest access is along the shore from the gravel beach
next to the Lipstick Beach cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are 3 islands in the south end of Pitt
      Lake. The largest, in the middle of the lake, is Goose
      Island. A couple kilometers to the northeast and just across
      the channel from Williams Landing, is Little Goose Island. A
      few hundred meters further north is a tiny island that, in
      the absence of any names on the maps and charts, we've dubbed
      &quot;Egg Island&quot;. The cache is on the southeast tip of Egg Island
      next to a pebble beach perfect for landing in a kayak, canoe
      or small motorboat. The terrain is rated as 5 because of the
      need for a boat otherwise it would be a Terrain
      2.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the
boat launch at Grant Narrows, it is about a 14.5 km journey along
the east side of Pitt Lake to Egg Island. Along the way you will
pass several easily accessible caches including Pitt Stop, Just This Side Of The Other Side, Other Side Of The Raven, Between A Rock And A Soft Place, Lipstick Beach and Gorak's Birthday Cache. Just a couple
   kilometers further north at the Osprey Creek North campsite are
   Victory At Osprey Creek, Under The Yum Yum Tree and Get Yer Rocks Off. If you are paddling, I
   would suggest making a weekend of it and camping at either Raven
   Creek, or one of the two campgrounds on either side of Osprey
   Creek.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
cache is a small, camo-painted 350 ml. Lock &amp; Lock container
hidden at the base of a large rotting stump. The cache is really
only big enough for a log book and pencils so trading is not really
required. If you feel you must leave something in the cache, please
make sure it is very small.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Starting from Deep Cove, this is a fairly ambitious paddle to the top of Indian Arm. The journey will take you approximately 20 kilometers in each direction and you'll see some of the most spectacular scenery that is easily accessible on the coast of British Columbia. Be prepared to see curious seals, jellyfish, crabs, assorted fish, and other marine life from the comfort of your kayak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The cache is located on the south side of Granite Falls near the very impressive public campground. There is no charge to use this campsite and spaces are available on a first-come basis. If all the groomed campsites are full, there is plenty of room in the common area to pitch a tent for the night. There is also another campground a few kilometers away at Bergs Landing which is on the west side of the arm near the south end of Croker Island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

It is possible to paddle to this cache and back in a single day but it will make for a very long and tiring trip. At an average pace, it will take approximately four to five hours of paddling to reach Granite Falls from Deep Cove. The journey is best suited for an overnight stay. If you don't have your own kayak, they are available for rent at Deep Cove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

On your way to Granite Falls be certain to stop and take a look at the incredibly beautiful Silver Falls located at N49 24.457 W122 53.102 -- you'll have to keep an eye out for the falls because it's easy to miss when travelling northward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Please note that there is no dock at the south area of Granite Falls and there is no bridge from the north day area to the south campground area. If you are visiting the cache with a power boat, you may not be able to access the south side of the falls if you are unable to run your boat up on the rocky beach. It is possible to cross over the outflow of the falls at low tide but you'll probably get your feet wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The cache is a 2.3 liter Lock &amp; Lock container and is under some old logs right near the base of a rock wall. A piece of wood is covering the cache but a small corner of the cache is visible. Please put the cache back the way that you found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The cache started out with the following contents: Space Jam DVD, Genesis 'Foxtrot' CD, Doll making kit, Hair barrettes, Hot Wheels 'Tony Hawk Skate Series' car, Lady Bug Kaliedescope, Laminated geocaching information sheet, Log book, pen, pencils and a pencil sharpener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Please sign the logbook, trade fairly, and log what you've traded on the website -- we'd like to keep the quality of trade items high for this cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Make a Contribution: Cache in and Trash Out!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

You can also contribute to the beauty of this wilderness area by promoting and supporting good caching in and trashing out practices. Throw a couple of plastic bags in your kayak for carrying out bits of litter. A grocery size plastic bag won't take up much space and will stay organized if you stuff it into an empty film container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Have fun and enjoy your trip to the top of Indian Arm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Please tread lightly when looking for a cache. It takes a long time for a plant to grow back.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located next 
  to Granite Falls at the north end of Indian Arm. Granite Falls is the site of 
  a Marine Park and is a great paddling destination and campsite. The coordinates 
  will bring you to a large yellow sign. The cache is located 5 meters at 20° 
  magnetic from the sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a 500ml camo-painted 
  Lock &amp; Lock. Because the cache container is relatively small, please bring 
  only small trade items and please do not try to overfill the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is rated 5 for 
  terrain because of the need for a boat to reach Granite Falls. Otherwise, the 
  terrain rating would be 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      Park which is about a 17 km journey by boat from Grant
      Narrows and is not accessible by vehicle. Along the way you
      will pass several easily accessible caches including Pitt Stop, Just This Side Of The Other Side, Other Side Of The Raven, Between A Rock And A Soft Place, Lipstick Beach, Gorak's Birthday Cache and Goose Egg. Once you've arrived at the Osprey
   Creek North campsite, there are two other caches, Victory At Osprey Creek and Get Yer Rocks Off, in the vicinity. If you
   are paddling, I would suggest making a weekend of it and camping
   either here or at Osprey Creek South or Raven
   Creek.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache is a small, camo-painted 350 ml. Lock
     &amp; Lock container hidden at the base of a large tree which,
     if you are camping here, is a great tree for hanging your food
     out of reach of the bears and mice. The cache is really only
     big enough for a log book and pencils so trading is not really
     required. If you feel you must leave something in the cache,
     please make sure it is very small. Please be very discreet
     when looking for this cache when other campers are about. This
     is a fairly busy area of the campground.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
terrain is rated as 5 because of the need for a boat otherwise it
would be a Terrain 2.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache promotes active living and environmentally friendly
geocaching. While here take a lunch and enjoy the veiw at the cache
site Picnic table enjoy the trails of this beautiful park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden in a BC Park. BC Parks supports&lt;br /&gt;
 geocaching!
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcgeocaching.com/pdf/BC_Parks_Geocaching_Policy.pdf&quot;&gt;
Here&lt;/a&gt; is a link to the BC Parks geocaching policies,&lt;br /&gt;
 please familiarize yourself with them. Through cooperation
with&lt;br /&gt;
 BC Parks, we can keep geocaching a fun and supported activity
in&lt;br /&gt;
 BC's Provincial Parks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these caches, you'll find some ProjectBlueSky geocoins
for&lt;br /&gt;
 the first finders. Please only take one... if you have one
from&lt;br /&gt;
 another cache, please leave them for other people. There are

 some other pins and swag from BC Parks, BCGA and Project Blue
Sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Park Info&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten Mile Lake is a very popular recreational
destination for local residents and visitors. It offers a large
picnic area, three sandy beaches, a boat launch, and great fishing
not to mention attractive, treed campsites, showers and flush
toilets. A 2-km nature trail to a large beaver pond, through forest
and along an abandoned rail road is very rewarding to hike. In the
winter the park's trails are transformed into approximately 10 km
of cross country ski trails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Location&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/regional_maps/quesnel.html&quot;&gt;
Location Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 12 km north of Quesnel on Highway
#97.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Nature &amp; Culture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History&lt;/strong&gt; - Ten Mile Lake Park was established
in 1962 as a recreational destination for residents of Quesnel, as
well as travellers on the Cariboo Highway. The name of the park
comes from the milepost on the Pacific Great Eastern Railway that
stood here in the early 1900s. There is still evidence of the
abandoned rail grade in the park; the tracks had to be relocated
because of difficulties in crossing the Cottonwood River north of
the park.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Heritage&lt;/strong&gt; - The city of Quesnel was
established as a supply centre during the Cariboo Gold Rush of the
1860's. It was originally much smaller than nearby Barkerville,
which is now preserved as a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barkerville.ca&quot;&gt;Historic Town&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conservation&lt;/strong&gt; - Ten Mile Lake Provincial Park
is situated within the Fraser Basin, an irregular shaped depression
of gently rolling hills and shallow lakes covering much of North
Central BC The park lies in a transition area between the wetter
Quesnel Highlands to the east, and the dry Chilcotin Plateau to the
west, leading to a wide diversity of plant species. You can find
white spruce, Douglas-fir, trembling aspen and lodgepole pine,
while the forest floor is home to shrubs like red osier dogwood and
saskatoon. Flowers, trees and shrubs are part of the park's natural
heritage, please don't damage or remove them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wildlife&lt;/strong&gt; - Walk the Beaver Pond trail and view
a beaver lodge and series of beaver dams. Ducks Unlimited has
placed waterfowl nesting boxes and platforms around the beaver
pond&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Park Size&lt;/strong&gt;: 260 hectares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BC Parks is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. The
first BC Park was Strathcona Park on Vancouver Island which was
officially created on March 1, 1911.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the parks system in British Columbia is one of our
greatest resources. Currently 14.26% (13.5 million hectares) of
British Columbia's land base is protected. There are more than 340
campgrounds, 6000 km of hiking trails, 118 boat launches and 263
day-use areas in B.C.'s provincial park system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BC Parks and the BC Geocaching Association are partnered along
with the Year of Science to invite you to explore BC Parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of 100 caches placed in parks throughout BC. Each
cache will have a unique trackable geocoin available for the first
3 finders. There are also BC Parks trade items, BC Geocaching
Association buttons, and Year of Science pins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a maximum of one coin per Geocaching account. Please
trade fairly for all items in the cache. If you have a coin from
another cache, please leave it for another cacher - you would want
them to do the same for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Fort George Canyon Provincial Park&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small 178 hectare park consists of two parcels on either
side of the Fraser River south of the city of Prince George. Public
recreation opportunities and trail access is available on the west
side of the river. Up until 1914 the Fraser River was the highway
in and out of this part of British Columbia and Fort George Canyon
was one of the obstacles that sternwheelers had to navigate. Rapid
and dangerous, this canyon abounds in whirlpools and massive,
jagged rocks close to the surface. The park is day-use only.
Natural Features: Historic Canyon on the Fraser River, the park
protects the historic winch site used by paddle-wheeled boats in
the early 1900’s and related portage, a native fishing site
and popular hiking trail.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;There are activities going on in BC Parks all year to celebrate
this wonderful anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2011 is also the Year of Science in BC.&lt;br /&gt;
There are events and a collection of interesting stories about
people who chose Science.&lt;/p&gt;
Here is the list of all the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/bookmarks/view.aspx?guid=ed6ac827-f22b-401a-8f87-e65ef1560a9e&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache promotes active living and environmentally friendly
geocaching. While here please take the time to enjoy the trails of
this beautiful park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden in a BC Park. BC Parks supports&lt;br /&gt;
 geocaching!
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcgeocaching.com/pdf/BC_Parks_Geocaching_Policy.pdf&quot;&gt;
Here&lt;/a&gt; is a link to the BC Parks geocaching policies,&lt;br /&gt;
 please familiarize yourself with them. Through cooperation
with&lt;br /&gt;
 BC Parks, we can keep geocaching a fun and supported activity
in&lt;br /&gt;
 BC's Provincial Parks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these caches, you'll find some ProjectBlueSky geocoins
for&lt;br /&gt;
 the first finders. Please only take one... if you have one
from&lt;br /&gt;
 another cache, please leave them for other people. There are
also&lt;br /&gt;
 some other pins and swag from BC Parks, BCGA and Project Blue
Sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Park Info&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small 178 hectare park consists
of two parcels on either side of the Fraser River south of the city
of Prince George. Public recreation opportunities and trail access
is available on the west side of the river. Up until 1914 the
Fraser River was the highway in and out of this part of British
Columbia and Fort George Canyon was one of the obstacles that
sternwheelers had to navigate. Rapid and dangerous, this canyon
abounds in whirlpools and massive, jagged rocks close to the
surface. The park is day-use only. Natural Features: Historic
Canyon on the Fraser River, the park protects the historic winch
site used by paddle-wheeled boats in the early 1900’s and related
portage, a native fishing site and popular hiking trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History&lt;/strong&gt; - The Fraser
River is designated as a Canadian Heritage River and Provincial
Heritage River. As the largest river in British Columbia, and the
most productive salmon fishery in the world, the Fraser River has
played a major role in supporting human life along its length.
Locally, Fort George Canyon was an important fishing site for First
Nations peoples. The river was an important route for early
explorers. In more recent years, the river was used as a route for
transportation of people and resources. Fort George Canyon was one
of the few obstacles along the river in north central British
Columbia. In the early 1900s sternwheelers would have to be winched
through this treacherous section of river while passengers would
have to portage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Heritage&lt;/strong&gt; -
This area is a native fishing site. The canyon was a major
impediment to sternwheelers, and this natural feature had a
significant effect on the development of the region, particularly
during railway construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Conservation&lt;/strong&gt;
-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area is a special
feature in the Nechako Lowland Ecosection.&lt;br /&gt;
 Dramatic canyon feature with pinnacles of volcanic rock and
several islands.&lt;br /&gt;
Riparian vegetation; the east side of the river was previously used
for grazing.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;strong&gt;Wildlife&lt;/strong&gt; - The park is
a salmon migration corridor. The park supports white sturgeon
populations and a large variety of other fish
species.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Park
Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 178 hectares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay
Safe:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring your own drinking water as
potable water is not available in the park. Drinking out of any
streams or lakes is not recommended unless the water has been
filtered or treated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backcountry areas are not suitable
for dogs or other pets due to wildlife issues and the potential for
problems with bears.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;While Here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the other caches down the trail&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Route 66 Prince George - North&lt;/h2&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Route 66 (North). Enjoy a journey down the Cranbrook
Hill Greenway Trail system. The greenway trail starts at the Blue
Cedars Campground and winds its way past UNBC, Forests For The
World and ending at the Otway Ski hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranbrook Hill Greenway is a protected greenway trail corridor
located in the forested hills and the open meadows high above the
community of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Established
in 1997 - 1998, the protected corridor was built in three phases
and now covers over 300 hectares of green space with over 25
kilometres of trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multi use trail is maintained by a community group and is a
popular trail system used by joggers, bikers, walkers, xc skiers,
snowshoers and horseback riders. No motorized vehicles are
permitted on the route. The trail is somewhat of a commuter trail
as it connects the Otway Ski Centre to UNBC to Blue Spruce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many parts of the gravel, pine needle cushioned path are
wheelchair accessible and baby stroller friendly. Although most of
the route is earthy, the trail does have some gravel path sections,
wooden bridges and boardwalk protecting the ground, bogs and the
sensitive vegetation. Be aware this is a working forest so some
sections may not always be accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cranbrook Hill Greenway is best explored in three sections.
The shortest section explores a birch tree forest for 0.8
kilometres which connects UNBC to the Forest For The World. The
UNBC to Blue Spruce section is 5.8 kilometres and navigates through
Douglas Fir and Birch trees, leading to a viewpoint. The UNBC to
Otway trail section is 18 kilometres and the most difficult part of
the greenway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Cranbrook Hill Greenway provides many opportunities
to view several ecosystems and is worth the few hours it takes to
explore some of the route. Plan your route for any of the
highlights along the trail including the many forests, a natural
climbing wall, the scenic viewpoints, the Labrador Tea Pond and the
Forests For The World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route 66 (north) starts with the first cache near the gate at
Blue Cedars campground and ends at the Westcrest Drive. Along the
route, you will find 66 caches placed for the trail as well as
other caches already established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy the caching trail.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h2&gt;Route 66 Prince George - North&lt;/h2&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Route 66 (North). Enjoy a journey down the Cranbrook
Hill Greenway Trail system. The greenway trail starts at the Blue
Cedars Campground and winds its way past UNBC, Forests For The
World and ending at the Otway Ski hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranbrook Hill Greenway is a protected greenway trail corridor
located in the forested hills and the open meadows high above the
community of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Established
in 1997 - 1998, the protected corridor was built in three phases
and now covers over 300 hectares of green space with over 25
kilometres of trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multi use trail is maintained by a community group and is a
popular trail system used by joggers, bikers, walkers, xc skiers,
snowshoers and horseback riders. No motorized vehicles are
permitted on the route. The trail is somewhat of a commuter trail
as it connects the Otway Ski Centre to UNBC to Blue Spruce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many parts of the gravel, pine needle cushioned path are
wheelchair accessible and baby stroller friendly. Although most of
the route is earthy, the trail does have some gravel path sections,
wooden bridges and boardwalk protecting the ground, bogs and the
sensitive vegetation. Be aware this is a working forest so some
sections may not always be accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cranbrook Hill Greenway is best explored in three sections.
The shortest section explores a birch tree forest for 0.8
kilometres which connects UNBC to the Forest For The World. The
UNBC to Blue Spruce section is 5.8 kilometres and navigates through
Douglas Fir and Birch trees, leading to a viewpoint. The UNBC to
Otway trail section is 18 kilometres and the most difficult part of
the greenway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Cranbrook Hill Greenway provides many opportunities
to view several ecosystems and is worth the few hours it takes to
explore some of the route. Plan your route for any of the
highlights along the trail including the many forests, a natural
climbing wall, the scenic viewpoints, the Labrador Tea Pond and the
Forests For The World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route 66 (north) starts with the first cache near the gate at
Blue Cedars campground and ends at the Westcrest Drive. Along the

&lt;h2&gt;Route 66 Prince George - North&lt;/h2&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Route 66 (North). Enjoy a journey down the Cranbrook
Hill Greenway Trail system. The greenway trail starts at the Blue
Cedars Campground and winds its way past UNBC, Forests For The
World and ending at the Otway Ski hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranbrook Hill Greenway is a protected greenway trail corridor
located in the forested hills and the open meadows high above the
community of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Established
in 1997 - 1998, the protected corridor was built in three phases
and now covers over 300 hectares of green space with over 25
kilometres of trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multi use trail is maintained by a community group and is a
popular trail system used by joggers, bikers, walkers, xc skiers,
snowshoers and horseback riders. No motorized vehicles are
permitted on the route. The trail is somewhat of a commuter trail
as it connects the Otway Ski Centre to UNBC to Blue Spruce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many parts of the gravel, pine needle cushioned path are
wheelchair accessible and baby stroller friendly. Although most of
the route is earthy, the trail does have some gravel path sections,
wooden bridges and boardwalk protecting the ground, bogs and the
sensitive vegetation. Be aware this is a working forest so some
sections may not always be accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cranbrook Hill Greenway is best explored in three sections.
The shortest section explores a birch tree forest for 0.8
kilometres which connects UNBC to the Forest For The World. The
UNBC to Blue Spruce section is 5.8 kilometres and navigates through
Douglas Fir and Birch trees, leading to a viewpoint. The UNBC to
Otway trail section is 18 kilometres and the most difficult part of
the greenway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Cranbrook Hill Greenway provides many opportunities
to view several ecosystems and is worth the few hours it takes to
explore some of the route. Plan your route for any of the
highlights along the trail including the many forests, a natural
climbing wall, the scenic viewpoints, the Labrador Tea Pond and the
Forests For The World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route 66 (north) starts with the first cache near the gate at
Blue Cedars campground and ends at the Westcrest Drive. Along the
route, you will find 66 caches placed for the trail as well as
other caches already established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy the caching trail.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

is based on the Show Gilligans Island from the 1960's.&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to find the Castaways and their ship before you will
be able to find the final cache..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each cache you
will learn a little about the character as well as find a Number
put them all together to find the final &quot;Gilligans
Island&quot;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The S.S. &lt;em&gt;Minnow&lt;/em&gt; used in the opening of the second and
third season color episodes, previously named the
&lt;em&gt;Bluejacket&lt;/em&gt;, now resides at Schooner Cove Marina on the
east side of Vancouver Island, in Nanoose Bay, British Columbia.
Having put the boat through a major restoration, the new owner
plans to use it for charters and sight seeing tours.It is equipped
with an old life preserver with &quot;S.S. &lt;em&gt;Minnow&lt;/em&gt;&quot; on it, as
well as other show items&lt;/p&gt;

Cedars Campground and winds its way past UNBC, Forests For The
World and ending at the Otway Ski hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranbrook Hill Greenway is a protected greenway trail corridor
located in the forested hills and the open meadows high above the
community of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Established
in 1997 - 1998, the protected corridor was built in three phases
and now covers over 300 hectares of green space with over 25
kilometres of trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multi use trail is maintained by a community group and is a
popular trail system used by joggers, bikers, walkers, xc skiers,
snowshoers and horseback riders. No motorized vehicles are
permitted on the route. The trail is somewhat of a commuter trail
as it connects the Otway Ski Centre to UNBC to Blue Spruce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many parts of the gravel, pine needle cushioned path are
wheelchair accessible and baby stroller friendly. Although most of
the route is earthy, the trail does have some gravel path sections,
wooden bridges and boardwalk protecting the ground, bogs and the
sensitive vegetation. Be aware this is a working forest so some
sections may not always be accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cranbrook Hill Greenway is best explored in three sections.
The shortest section explores a birch tree forest for 0.8
kilometres which connects UNBC to the Forest For The World. The
UNBC to Blue Spruce section is 5.8 kilometres and navigates through
Douglas Fir and Birch trees, leading to a viewpoint. The UNBC to
Otway trail section is 18 kilometres and the most difficult part of
the greenway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Cranbrook Hill Greenway provides many opportunities
to view several ecosystems and is worth the few hours it takes to
explore some of the route. Plan your route for any of the
highlights along the trail including the many forests, a natural
climbing wall, the scenic viewpoints, the Labrador Tea Pond and the
Forests For The World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route 66 (north) starts with the first cache near the gate at
Blue Cedars campground and ends at the Westcrest Drive. Along the
route, you will find 66 caches placed for the trail as well as
other caches already established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy the caching trail.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

World and ending at the Otway Ski hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranbrook Hill Greenway is a protected greenway trail corridor
located in the forested hills and the open meadows high above the
community of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Established
in 1997 - 1998, the protected corridor was built in three phases
and now covers over 300 hectares of green space with over 25
kilometres of trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multi use trail is maintained by a community group and is a
popular trail system used by joggers, bikers, walkers, xc skiers,
snowshoers and horseback riders. No motorized vehicles are
permitted on the route. The trail is somewhat of a commuter trail
as it connects the Otway Ski Centre to UNBC to Blue Spruce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many parts of the gravel, pine needle cushioned path are
wheelchair accessible and baby stroller friendly. Although most of
the route is earthy, the trail does have some gravel path sections,
wooden bridges and boardwalk protecting the ground, bogs and the
sensitive vegetation. Be aware this is a working forest so some
sections may not always be accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cranbrook Hill Greenway is best explored in three sections.
The shortest section explores a birch tree forest for 0.8
kilometres which connects UNBC to the Forest For The World. The
UNBC to Blue Spruce section is 5.8 kilometres and navigates through
Douglas Fir and Birch trees, leading to a viewpoint. The UNBC to
Otway trail section is 18 kilometres and the most difficult part of
the greenway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Cranbrook Hill Greenway provides many opportunities
to view several ecosystems and is worth the few hours it takes to
explore some of the route. Plan your route for any of the
highlights along the trail including the many forests, a natural
climbing wall, the scenic viewpoints, the Labrador Tea Pond and the
Forests For The World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route 66 (north) starts with the first cache near the gate at
Blue Cedars campground and ends at the Westcrest Drive. Along the
route, you will find 66 caches placed for the trail as well as
other caches already established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy the caching trail.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PBA's Monkey Puzzle Cache&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This is a cache I've been wanting to make for a very long
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you attended the last geocaching event you know how
this simple puzzle works. unlike Ohmmmmmm! this cache has the key
with it unfortunately it is locked inside you have to figure out
how to retrieve it. please be gentle with the container you don't
need brute force just a little patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide to do this cache, please plan on staying a
while. NO FORCE IS NECESSARY TO SOLVE THE PUZZLE, NOR ARE ANY
TOOLS. Please be careful when handling the container and remember
to return the key to its hiding place before reclosing and replace
the container exactly as found. NOTE: YOU MAY NOT CLAIM A FIND
UNLESS YOU OPEN THE CONTAINER AND SIGN THE LOG. FTF prize is a PBA
Geocoin to be adopted to the FTF. Thanks &amp; Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

and now covers over 300 hectares of green space with over 25
kilometres of trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multi use trail is maintained by a community group and is a
popular trail system used by joggers, bikers, walkers, xc skiers,
snowshoers and horseback riders. No motorized vehicles are
permitted on the route. The trail is somewhat of a commuter trail
as it connects the Otway Ski Centre to UNBC to Blue Spruce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many parts of the gravel, pine needle cushioned path are
wheelchair accessible and baby stroller friendly. Although most of
the route is earthy, the trail does have some gravel path sections,
wooden bridges and boardwalk protecting the ground, bogs and the
sensitive vegetation. Be aware this is a working forest so some
sections may not always be accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cranbrook Hill Greenway is best explored in three sections.
The shortest section explores a birch tree forest for 0.8
kilometres which connects UNBC to the Forest For The World. The
UNBC to Blue Spruce section is 5.8 kilometres and navigates through
Douglas Fir and Birch trees, leading to a viewpoint. The UNBC to
Otway trail section is 18 kilometres and the most difficult part of
the greenway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Cranbrook Hill Greenway provides many opportunities
to view several ecosystems and is worth the few hours it takes to
explore some of the route. Plan your route for any of the
highlights along the trail including the many forests, a natural
climbing wall, the scenic viewpoints, the Labrador Tea Pond and the
Forests For The World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route 66 (north) starts with the first cache near the gate at
Blue Cedars campground and ends at the Westcrest Drive. Along the
route, you will find 66 caches placed for the trail as well as
other caches already established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy the caching trail.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;strong&gt;The
Prince George Cache
Confessional&lt;/strong&gt;


 

&lt;p&gt;He (or She) who is without &quot;Travel Bug sin&quot; probably hasn't been
cachin' for very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've all done it at some time or other. Forgotten about a TB,
been unable to find time to place it, or the worst of all TB
sins.... You've LOST ONE!!! Take that weight off of your shoulders
and confess your sins my child!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it was skipping out of work for a FTF then coming back
to find out no one noticed you were gone or stealing the batteries
out of the kids toys...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have committed a Geocaching sin, this is the place for
you! Come down to the Prince George Cache Confessional and get
those caching sins off your chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is based on others in Saskatchewan, Vancouver and,
yes, one I found in Williams lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ammo can's original contents were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A logbook.&lt;br /&gt;
 2 pencils&lt;br /&gt;
 A Pencil Sharpener&lt;br /&gt;
 Johnny Lightning Car&lt;br /&gt;
 and two Geocaoins that will start their journey in this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is my Caching sin? Well, you will just have to find the
cache to find out!&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Otway trail section is 18 kilometres and the most difficult part of
the greenway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Cranbrook Hill Greenway provides many opportunities
to view several ecosystems and is worth the few hours it takes to
explore some of the route. Plan your route for any of the
highlights along the trail including the many forests, a natural
climbing wall, the scenic viewpoints, the Labrador Tea Pond and the
Forests For The World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route 66 (north) starts with the first cache near the gate at
Blue Cedars campground and ends at the Westcrest Drive. Along the
route, you will find 66 caches placed for the trail as well as
other caches already established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy the caching trail.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h2&gt;Route 66 Prince George - North&lt;/h2&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Route 66 (North). Enjoy a journey down the Cranbrook
Hill Greenway Trail system. The greenway trail starts at the Blue
Cedars Campground and winds its way past UNBC, Forests For The
World and ending at the Otway Ski hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranbrook Hill Greenway is a protected greenway trail corridor
located in the forested hills and the open meadows high above the
community of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Established
in 1997 - 1998, the protected corridor was built in three phases
and now covers over 300 hectares of green space with over 25
kilometres of trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multi use trail is maintained by a community group and is a
popular trail system used by joggers, bikers, walkers, xc skiers,
snowshoers and horseback riders. No motorized vehicles are
permitted on the route. The trail is somewhat of a commuter trail
as it connects the Otway Ski Centre to UNBC to Blue Spruce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many parts of the gravel, pine needle cushioned path are
wheelchair accessible and baby stroller friendly. Although most of
the route is earthy, the trail does have some gravel path sections,
wooden bridges and boardwalk protecting the ground, bogs and the
sensitive vegetation. Be aware this is a working forest so some
sections may not always be accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cranbrook Hill Greenway is best explored in three sections.
The shortest section explores a birch tree forest for 0.8
kilometres which connects UNBC to the Forest For The World. The
UNBC to Blue Spruce section is 5.8 kilometres and navigates through
Douglas Fir and Birch trees, leading to a viewpoint. The UNBC to
Otway trail section is 18 kilometres and the most difficult part of
the greenway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Route 66 Prince George - North&lt;/h2&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Route 66 (North). Enjoy a journey down the Cranbrook
Hill Greenway Trail system. The greenway trail starts at the Blue
Cedars Campground and winds its way past UNBC, Forests For The
World and ending at the Otway Ski hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranbrook Hill Greenway is a protected greenway trail corridor
located in the forested hills and the open meadows high above the
community of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Established
in 1997 - 1998, the protected corridor was built in three phases
and now covers over 300 hectares of green space with over 25
kilometres of trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multi use trail is maintained by a community group and is a
popular trail system used by joggers, bikers, walkers, xc skiers,
snowshoers and horseback riders. No motorized vehicles are
permitted on the route. The trail is somewhat of a commuter trail
as it connects the Otway Ski Centre to UNBC to Blue Spruce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many parts of the gravel, pine needle cushioned path are
wheelchair accessible and baby stroller friendly. Although most of
the route is earthy, the trail does have some gravel path sections,
wooden bridges and boardwalk protecting the ground, bogs and the
sensitive vegetation. Be aware this is a working forest so some
sections may not always be accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cranbrook Hill Greenway is best explored in three sections.
The shortest section explores a birch tree forest for 0.8
kilometres which connects UNBC to the Forest For The World. The
UNBC to Blue Spruce section is 5.8 kilometres and navigates through
Douglas Fir and Birch trees, leading to a viewpoint. The UNBC to
Otway trail section is 18 kilometres and the most difficult part of
the greenway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Cranbrook Hill Greenway provides many opportunities
to view several ecosystems and is worth the few hours it takes to
explore some of the route. Plan your route for any of the
highlights along the trail including the many forests, a natural
climbing wall, the scenic viewpoints, the Labrador Tea Pond and the
Forests For The World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route 66 (north) starts with the first cache near the gate at
Blue Cedars campground and ends at the Westcrest Drive. Along the
route, you will find 66 caches placed for the trail as well as
other caches already established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy the caching trail.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Island
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 







&lt;em&gt;&quot;Just sit right back
and you'll hear a tale, A tale of a fateful trip&lt;br /&gt;
That started from this tropic port Aboard this tiny
ship.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This caches series is based on the Show Gilligans Island from
the 1960's.&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to find the Castaways and their ship before you will
be able to find the final cache..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each cache you will learn a little about the character as
well as find a Number put them all together to find the final
&quot;Gilligans Island&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thurston Howell III, is so wealthy that he took tens of
thousands of dollars in cash and several changes of clothing with
him for what was intended to be only a three-hour boat tour in
Hawaii, one of the sillier premises of the show. Howell is a
stereotypical member of the Northeastern Yankee elite—a
resident of Newport, Rhode Island and a graduate of Harvard
University. His wife, Lovey, is conscious of social strata, yet
seems to be a good-hearted woman with a deep sense of noblesse
oblige allowing her to interact with the other passengers and crew,
though they are all her social inferiors. One of the implied
humorous points of the show is that Thurston continually fails to
realize that all of the Howells' money is essentially useless to
them on the island. On the other hand, the other castaways
apparently tolerate the fact that he refuses to do any work. One of
the most unusual aspects of his character is that, even though he
is married, he sleeps with a teddy bear that he calls &quot;Teddy&quot;. The
Howells, as was common practice on American sitcoms of the
mid-1960s, also slept in twin beds.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;strong&gt;Stormcloud's Nightmare&lt;/strong&gt;


 

&lt;p&gt;When I started Caching the most evil Cache I encountered was &quot;a
Place of Rest&quot; by Stormcloud, it took a while to figure it out and
find the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that Stormcloud was known the most evil cacher in Prince
George of course, he had no competition. Well this year he will
lose his title there is now competition I Plumbrokeacres will take
over and become Evil Cacher Supreme Bwahahaha, BWAHAHAHAHAH,
&lt;strong&gt;BWAHAHAHAHAH.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache was thought up by me last year and it took me 9
months of R&amp;D to come up with this cache. it is a small cache
hidden in L.C. Gunn Park while here also check out the other 3
caches hidden in this jewel of a park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original contents of this cache are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A log&lt;br /&gt;
 A pencil&lt;br /&gt;
 A Pencil Sharpener&lt;br /&gt;
 An Unactivated Shut-Out Geocoin for the FTF&lt;br /&gt;
 A PGcachers Pin&lt;br /&gt;
 and a few other goodies&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Island
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 









&lt;h1&gt;The Proffessor - Ron Hinkley&lt;/h1&gt;





&lt;em&gt;&quot;Just sit right back and
you'll hear a tale, A tale of a fateful trip&lt;br /&gt;
That started from this tropic port Aboard this tiny
ship.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This caches series
is based on the Show Gilligans Island from the 1960's.&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to find the Castaways and their ship before you will
be able to find the final cache..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each cache you
will learn a little about the character as well as find a Number
put them all together to find the final &quot;Gilligans
Island&quot;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The Professor's backstory identifies him as a high school
science teacher who was born in Cleveland, Ohio. His principal
expertise was as a botanist, whose purpose in joining the ill-fated
voyage that stranded the castaways was to write a book to be titled
&lt;em&gt;Fun With Ferns&lt;/em&gt;. His main function on the show was to
devise many ways for the castaways to live more comfortably on the
island. Many of his inventions (including a method for recharging
the batteries in the ubiquitous radio) utilized coconuts and
bamboo, both of which were in plentiful supply. Aside from his
proficiency in science, he was also adept and well-versed in law,
literature, social sciences, and the arts. Besides a list of
degrees from various schools he provides in one episode, little was
ever learned about his past and nothing was ever learned about his
family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Professor was portrayed as the most neutral and level-headed
character. He usually displayed more patience with Gilligan than
the other castaways, and was often called upon to settle disputes.
As a result, he often served as the leader of the castaways whom
the others respected because of his great store of knowledge,
although the castaways rarely mentioned this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A running joke about the Professor was his ability to build
anything from coconuts and bamboo, yet he was somehow unable to
create a raft or other means to leave the island.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h2&gt;Route 66 Prince George - North&lt;/h2&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Route 66 (North). Enjoy a journey down the Cranbrook
Hill Greenway Trail system. The greenway trail starts at the Blue
Cedars Campground and winds its way past UNBC, Forests For The
World and ending at the Otway Ski hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranbrook Hill Greenway is a protected greenway trail corridor
located in the forested hills and the open meadows high above the
community of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Established
in 1997 - 1998, the protected corridor was built in three phases
and now covers over 300 hectares of green space with over 25
kilometres of trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multi use trail is maintained by a community group and is a
popular trail system used by joggers, bikers, walkers, xc skiers,
snowshoers and horseback riders. No motorized vehicles are
permitted on the route. The trail is somewhat of a commuter trail
as it connects the Otway Ski Centre to UNBC to Blue Spruce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many parts of the gravel, pine needle cushioned path are
wheelchair accessible and baby stroller friendly. Although most of
the route is earthy, the trail does have some gravel path sections,
wooden bridges and boardwalk protecting the ground, bogs and the
sensitive vegetation. Be aware this is a working forest so some
sections may not always be accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cranbrook Hill Greenway is best explored in three sections.
The shortest section explores a birch tree forest for 0.8
kilometres which connects UNBC to the Forest For The World. The
UNBC to Blue Spruce section is 5.8 kilometres and navigates through
Douglas Fir and Birch trees, leading to a viewpoint. The UNBC to
Otway trail section is 18 kilometres and the most difficult part of
the greenway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Cranbrook Hill Greenway provides many opportunities
to view several ecosystems and is worth the few hours it takes to
explore some of the route. Plan your route for any of the
highlights along the trail including the many forests, a natural
climbing wall, the scenic viewpoints, the Labrador Tea Pond and the
Forests For The World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route 66 (north) starts with the first cache near the gate at
Blue Cedars campground and ends at the Westcrest Drive. Along the
route, you will find 66 caches placed for the trail as well as
other caches already established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy the caching trail.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It's approximately 4.5L 'jar' with some decent cammo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter the cache zone from the corner of Azure and Elkhorn.  Follow the trail in toward the hillside.  You will reach a small fork in the path.  Depending on your geosense, it's up to you which route you take.  The trails are both reasonably easy with fallen trees and stumblable rubble.  If you take the right path, the cache will be on the left side under some fallen twiggage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had intended on hiding this in a different spot but stopped dead in my tracks at a murder of crows about 10 deep.  They all flew to nearby trees and berated me for bothering them.  To be honest, it scared me a little, hahaa!  As I turned around and headed to where the cache ended up, the 3 squirrels surrounding me began fussing as well.  Perhaps this is a 'Human Free Zone'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(I wasn't getting a very strong satellite signal and the waypoint averaging, once at 100% had moved 57 feet.  Enjoy the hunt because it might be a good one.)&lt;br/&gt;Take some time to wander the trails in here.  There is a stream just past the cache and beyond you will see that someone has tied the branches together over the paths to make some pretty archways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original cache contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF Pylon&lt;br/&gt;Soap&lt;br/&gt;Lock &amp; key&lt;br/&gt;Fishing lure&lt;br/&gt;Shell&lt;br/&gt;Golf Ball&lt;br/&gt;Headphones&lt;br/&gt;Vancouver Aquarium Coin (not trackable)&lt;br/&gt;Geocoin&lt;br/&gt;Logbook and pencils</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PGCAR2010: Secret Chambers and Hidden
Treasures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since I was
a student at the College of New Caledonia many years ago, I have
always know about this organization and have, at times, attended
their secret meetings. What happens behind closed doors is not for
the public to speculate, but this is one of the most active
'organizations' around this town.&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is meant to show you, the caching world, that this
secret society is at work in your community!&lt;br /&gt;
PS. Don't park in the Bus Stop!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;An Evening of
    Reflection&lt;/b&gt;








 
Not at the posted Coordinates read
the listing to find the cache,&lt;br /&gt;
Caching means different things to different People &quot;An Evening of
Reflection&quot; is here for you to &quot;Reflect&quot; on what caching means to
you. 
&lt;p&gt;This is a night time cache only and will have you starting at N
53.55.962 W 122.49.144 traveling south. you will drive to N
53.54.967 w122.49.147 and turn Right by the time you have reached N
53.54.905 w122.49.869 you should have been able to determine the
starting location for the Final leg of you evening of
Reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have arrived at the Coordinates you have found looking
for a series of  Fire tacks that will lead you down the path
to the Cache site. The trail is a maintained trail &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: It
can be Slippery on the Trail so use appropriate care.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
except the last 100ft or so you will know you have arrived when you
can see 3 fire tacks close together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy your hunt as much as I did plotting this
hide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: FireTacks
are tiny reflectors that are about 10 times brighter than any other
type of trail marker. They reflect directly back at the light
source. Therefore, they are best illuminated by a light source held
as close to eye level as possible&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Original Contents:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Cache container is a

&lt;h2&gt;Route 66 Prince George - North&lt;/h2&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Route 66 (North). Enjoy a journey down the Cranbrook
Hill Greenway Trail system. The greenway trail starts at the Blue
Cedars Campground and winds its way past UNBC, Forests For The
World and ending at the Otway Ski hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranbrook Hill Greenway is a protected greenway trail corridor
located in the forested hills and the open meadows high above the
community of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Established
in 1997 - 1998, the protected corridor was built in three phases
and now covers over 300 hectares of green space with over 25
kilometres of trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multi use trail is maintained by a community group and is a
popular trail system used by joggers, bikers, walkers, xc skiers,
snowshoers and horseback riders. No motorized vehicles are
permitted on the route. The trail is somewhat of a commuter trail
as it connects the Otway Ski Centre to UNBC to Blue Spruce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many parts of the gravel, pine needle cushioned path are
wheelchair accessible and baby stroller friendly. Although most of
the route is earthy, the trail does have some gravel path sections,
wooden bridges and boardwalk protecting the ground, bogs and the
sensitive vegetation. Be aware this is a working forest so some
sections may not always be accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cranbrook Hill Greenway is best explored in three sections.
The shortest section explores a birch tree forest for 0.8
kilometres which connects UNBC to the Forest For The World. The
UNBC to Blue Spruce section is 5.8 kilometres and navigates through
Douglas Fir and Birch trees, leading to a viewpoint. The UNBC to
Otway trail section is 18 kilometres and the most difficult part of
the greenway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Cranbrook Hill Greenway provides many opportunities
to view several ecosystems and is worth the few hours it takes to
explore some of the route. Plan your route for any of the
highlights along the trail including the many forests, a natural
climbing wall, the scenic viewpoints, the Labrador Tea Pond and the
Forests For The World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route 66 (north) starts with the first cache near the gate at
Blue Cedars campground and ends at the Westcrest Drive. Along the
route, you will find 66 caches placed for the trail as well as
other caches already established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy the caching trail.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PGCAR2010: Cottonwood Park&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Dec 2007 an ice jam on the Nechako river caused the
river to rise&lt;br /&gt;
and flood the banks from cottonwood park and all along river road.
the water&lt;br /&gt;
found a way around the jam and that took it right through
Cottonwood park&lt;br /&gt;
ripping out the majority of the Bridges in the park making the
majority of&lt;br /&gt;
the park unacceptable, 3 years later and some of the foot bridges
are being&lt;br /&gt;
replaced. I have enjoyed this park since moving here and am very
happy to&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 









&lt;h1&gt;Gil Egan&lt;/h1&gt;





&lt;em&gt;&quot;Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale, A tale of a fateful trip&lt;br /&gt;
That started from this tropic port Aboard this tiny ship.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This caches series is based on the Show Gilligans Island from the 1960's.&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to find the Castaways and their ship before you will be able to find the final cache..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each cache you will learn a little about the character as well as find a Number put them all together to find the final &quot;Gilligans Island&quot;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Gilligan's past and family were not mentioned during the series, except for his older brother, from whom he swiped his ever-present red shirt, a sister whose best friend was broken up by her boyfriend, and an uncle who was apparently illiterate. He once mentioned he was born in Pennsylvania, but no city was specified. He would sometimes mention his childhood friends, Skinny Mulligan and Fatso Flannigan, possibly implying that he came from a predominately Irish-American neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite his bumbling nature, Gilligan has an innate innocence of character that causes the others to forgive his mistakes. He occasionally saves the others when an escape plan goes awry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilligan also makes several discoveries, but they often have disastrous results, and Gilligan is usually faced with big decisions. Examples include who to give the last orange on the island, or who to give hot water from a hole in the ground (which the Professor later discovered to be an active volcano). On one occasion, Gilligan found seeds which gave people the ability to read minds, but when the seeds proved to have disastrous results, he gathered up all the seeds on the island and burned them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite frequently ruining plans to get off the island, his fellow castaways (the Skipper included) ultimately harbor affection for him. When Gilligan was bitten by a potentially fatal insect and showed all the symptoms following the bite, everyone tried to find a cure, only to get bitten themselves (although the insect was later found to be harmless).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite an awkward exterior, Gilligan has shown some intelligence. He tenaciously guards his position, particularly when someone tries to use him. Gilligan has also proven his willingness to &quot;step up to the plate&quot; should leadership call – although, if Gilligan doesn't break the plate, it usually fractures. In the end, a double measure of fortune corrects his missteps. Gilligan, like Barney Fife, Gomer Pyle and other comic figures of the era, are termed unlikely or &quot;backdoor&quot; heroes, whose good intentions always win out over sheer stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h2&gt;Route 66 Prince George - North&lt;/h2&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Route 66 (North). Enjoy a journey down the Cranbrook
Hill Greenway Trail system. The greenway trail starts at the Blue
Cedars Campground and winds its way past UNBC, Forests For The
World and ending at the Otway Ski hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranbrook Hill Greenway is a protected greenway trail corridor
located in the forested hills and the open meadows high above the
community of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Established
in 1997 - 1998, the protected corridor was built in three phases
and now covers over 300 hectares of green space with over 25
kilometres of trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multi use trail is maintained by a community group and is a
popular trail system used by joggers, bikers, walkers, xc skiers,
snowshoers and horseback riders. No motorized vehicles are
permitted on the route. The trail is somewhat of a commuter trail
as it connects the Otway Ski Centre to UNBC to Blue Spruce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many parts of the gravel, pine needle cushioned path are
wheelchair accessible and baby stroller friendly. Although most of
the route is earthy, the trail does have some gravel path sections,
wooden bridges and boardwalk protecting the ground, bogs and the
sensitive vegetation. Be aware this is a working forest so some
sections may not always be accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cranbrook Hill Greenway is best explored in three sections.
The shortest section explores a birch tree forest for 0.8
kilometres which connects UNBC to the Forest For The World. The
UNBC to Blue Spruce section is 5.8 kilometres and navigates through
Douglas Fir and Birch trees, leading to a viewpoint. The UNBC to
Otway trail section is 18 kilometres and the most difficult part of
the greenway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Cranbrook Hill Greenway provides many opportunities
to view several ecosystems and is worth the few hours it takes to
explore some of the route. Plan your route for any of the
highlights along the trail including the many forests, a natural
climbing wall, the scenic viewpoints, the Labrador Tea Pond and the
Forests For The World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route 66 (north) starts with the first cache near the gate at
Blue Cedars campground and ends at the Westcrest Drive. Along the
route, you will find 66 caches placed for the trail as well as
other caches already established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy the caching trail.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

For a three hour tour, a three hour tour...........&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is not at the listed coordinates, in order to locate this cache you will need to find the castaways and get the clues to the final.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Ginger Grant&lt;/h1&gt;





&lt;em&gt;&quot;Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale, A tale of a fateful trip&lt;br /&gt;
That started from this tropic port Aboard this tiny ship.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This caches series is based on the Show Gilligans Island from the 1960's.&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to find the Castaways and their ship before you will be able to find the final cache..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each cache you will learn a little about the character as well as find a Number put them all together to find the final &quot;Gilligans Island&quot;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Ginger appeared in several episodes to be the desire of The Skipper but as this was 1960s series television, the &quot;relationship&quot; was never allowed to develop beyond a mild flirtation. The Skipper chose Ginger as his preferred contestant in the &quot;Miss Castaway Pageant&quot; held on the island (Season 2 Episode 2 &quot;Beauty Is as Beauty Does&quot;). (In addition, and quite tellingly, when Skipper loses his memory in the first season Episode 30 &quot;Forget Me Not&quot;, he is much more attracted to &quot;Well, hi, beautiful&quot; Ginger than &quot;Howdy Ma'am&quot; Mary Ann; although this is probably more Skipper's unconscious id talking than the Skipper himself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ginger sided with Thurston Howell, III, on many occasions, acting as a witness during a trial over treasure, serving as a sort of spy to divulge information from Gilligan by scratching his back and allowing herself to be bribed by Howell, such as during the &quot;election&quot; of who was to be President of the island. It should also be noted that her secret agent code name and her measurements were both 36-25-36.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;em&gt;&quot;Just sit right back and
you'll hear a tale, A tale of a fateful trip&lt;br /&gt;
That started from this tropic port Aboard this tiny
ship.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This caches series
is based on the Show Gilligans Island from the 1960's.&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to find the Castaways and their ship before you will
be able to find the final cache..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each cache you
will learn a little about the character as well as find a Number
put them all together to find the final &quot;Gilligans
Island&quot;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;She was traveling alone on the &quot;three-hour tour&quot; that was lost
at sea, and was in her late teens to early twenties—an age
which she pinpoints in the Season 2, Episode 30 &quot;V for Vitamins&quot;
when she says, &quot;Women and children first, so I get two votes.&quot; In
many episodes she appeared to be the love interest for the
Professor but this was never allowed to go beyond a mild
flirtation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the rest of the cast, not much was ever learned about
her life prior to being marooned on the island, but she mentioned
having dated a boy named Horace Higgenbotham from Horners Corners,
Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the series' (second) pilot &quot;Two on a Raft&quot; (Season 1, Episode
1), the Honolulu-based AM radio news reader only states that &quot;the
attractive brunette&quot; is &quot;employed at the Winfield General Store.&quot;
Mary Ann confesses to Mr. Howell in Season 1, Episode 6 &quot;President
Gilligan&quot; that she's only a clerk.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;Skipper - Captain Jonas Grumby&lt;/h1&gt;





&lt;em&gt;&quot;Just sit right back and
you'll hear a tale, A tale of a fateful trip&lt;br /&gt;
That started from this tropic port Aboard this tiny
ship.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This caches series
is based on the Show Gilligans Island from the 1960's.&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to find the Castaways and their ship before you will
be able to find the final cache..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each cache you
will learn a little about the character as well as find a Number
put them all together to find the final &quot;Gilligans
Island&quot;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;the Skipper (his actual name was rarely used after the show's
pilot episode) was the owner and captain of the S.S.
&lt;em&gt;Minnow&lt;/em&gt; on its &quot;three hour tour&quot; in Hawaii when he, first
mate Gilligan, and their tourist passengers were caught in a
violent storm and stranded on a deserted island. He acts often in
his legal role as the group's leader, albeit with a decidedly
collegial and democratic bent; the only individual whom he
routinely orders about is Gilligan. In times of crisis, the Skipper
tends to defer to the more level-headed and educated passenger,
Professor Roy Hinkley. He is sort of a strongman succumbed to lack
of exercise, despite doing most of the physical work on the island
or making Gilligan do it. He is also the most superstitious
castaway, sometimes putting him in conflict with the Professor's
rationalistic ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Skipper is lovable but is irritated continually by the
clumsiness and ineptitude of his &quot;little buddy&quot; Gilligan, despite
that they are good friends. A running gag is that whenever Gilligan
messes up a rescue, the skipper conks Gilligan on the head with his
hat; a variation of this gag is that whenever Gilligan is in a tree
as a lookout and falls down, he usually lands on the Skipper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This a a nice walk with some different veiws of the Nechako River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Nechako River&lt;/strong&gt; ( /nəˈtʃækoʊ&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IPA_for_English&quot;&gt;/&lt;/a&gt;) arises on the Nechako Plateau east of the Kitimat Ranges of the Coast Mountains of British Clumbia and flows north toward Fort Fraser, then east to Prince George where it enters the Fraser River. &quot;Nechako&quot; is an anglicization of [netʃa koh], its name in the indigenous Carrier language which means &quot;big river&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its main tributaries are the Stuart River, which enters about 45 km (28 mi) east of Vanderhoof; the Endako; the Chilako, which enters about 15 km (9 mi) west of Prince George; and the Nautley River, a short stream from Fraser Lake. Among the other tributaries is the Cheslatta River, which drains Cheslatta Lake and enters the Nechako at the foot of the Nechako Canyon via Cheslatta Falls and begins at the Kenny Dam and forms the Nechako Reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fishermen will find a variety of fish including whitefish, chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, sturgeon, rainbow trout, bull trout and pink salmon here.&lt;/p&gt;

Island
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 







&lt;em&gt;&quot;Just sit right back
and you'll hear a tale, A tale of a fateful trip&lt;br /&gt;
That started from this tropic port Aboard this tiny
ship.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This caches series is based on the Show Gilligans Island from
the 1960's.&lt;br /&gt;
You have found Mrs. Howell, You will need to find the other
Castaways and their ship before you will be able to find the final
cache..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each cache you will learn a little about the character as
well as find a Number put them all together to find the final
&quot;Gilligans Island&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eunice &quot;Lovey&quot; Howell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While her husband always called her &quot;Lovey,&quot; the other castaways
always called her Mrs. Howell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one episode in which the Howells were having marital
problems, she mentioned her maiden name was Wentworth, and in
another episode a radio broadcast mentions that her given name is
Eunice. Hardly anything was ever learned about her life before
being marooned with her fellow castaways, but she mentioned in one
episode that she spoke fluent French and Italian, hinting at a
classical education. Thurston Howell also indicates that Lovey, or
at least her family, had money of their own; Mr. Howell describes
her family as being loaded. She also claimed in one episode to
being a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution
(DAR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she was spoiled and preoccupied with social status,
Mrs. Howell was also kind and genuinely cared about the well-being
of her fellow castaways. She frequently served as something of a
mother figure to the two younger female castaways, Ginger Grant and
Mary Ann Summers, offering advice (though she sometimes also
displays jealousy toward the two younger women).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several times she acted as a motherly figure to Gilligan, such
as psychoanalyzing him, adopting him, and praising him for his
accomplishments when no one else did. She often plotted with her
husband several times to steal/access/manipulate things from the
other survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was once quoted by Thurston Howell himself that their
brilliance together was only succeeded by their greed. They had
also proven to have once had several houses and several staffs of
servants, including an upstairs maid, a downstairs maid and a
butler who served him breakfast in bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;B11: Dystrukshun's Nemesis&lt;/h1&gt;





&lt;p&gt;As i have followed Dysrtukshun and Fallinginthewoods exploits
while Geocaching, I have noticed a lot of encounters with our most
industrious of insects the much maligned ant. I dedicate this cache
to Dystrukshun and Fallinginthewoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Couple of Ant Facts:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ants perform many ecological roles that are beneficial to
humans, including the suppression of pest populations and aeration
of the soil. The use of Ants perform many ecological roles that are
beneficial to humans, including the suppression of pest populations
and aeration of the soil. The use of weaver ants in citrus
cultivation in southern China is considered one of the oldest known
applications of biological control. On the other hand, ants can
become nuisances when they invade buildings, or cause economic
losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some parts of the world (mainly Africa and South America),
large ants, especially army ants, are used as surgical sutures. The
wound is pressed together and ants are applied along it. The ant
seizes the edges of the wound in its mandibles and locks in place.
The body is then cut off and the head and mandibles remain in place
to close the wound&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to get to this cache, the shortest (also the
hardest) way is park across the road by &quot;Peachycats surprise and
climb up the dirtbike trails (it is the preferred way down)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easier access is park by the yellow gate up the hill
(waypoint attached) cross the highway and go up the trail slight
incline easy hike in but you will be doing some bushwhacking)&lt;/p&gt;

 N: ABCD&lt;br /&gt;
 W: EFGH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put these numbers into the following
co-ordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N: 53 5 ABCD&lt;br /&gt;
 W: 122 4 EFGH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will lead you to the actual
cache site not too far away. There is a trail used by many
different types of users that leads towards the final cache. The
trail can be muddy. Watch out for other users of the
trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Micro in the
    Woods&lt;/b&gt;








 
This Cache was set up by
Plumbrokeacres. 
&lt;p&gt;Every time I speak with cachers I continually hear people talk
about micros. they are very passionate about how they feel about
micro's. mention Woods and micros in the same sentence and man oh
man they can talk for hours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought if people were so passionate about Micro's in the
woods I just HAD to do one! so here is my take on the micro in the
woods. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the parks system in British Columbia is one of our
greatest resources. Currently 14.26% (13.5 million hectares) of
British Columbia's land base is protected. There are more than 340
campgrounds, 6000 km of hiking trails, 118 boat launches and 263
day-use areas in B.C.'s provincial park system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BC Parks and the BC Geocaching Association are partnered along
with the Year of Science to invite you to explore BC Parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of 100 caches placed in parks throughout BC. Each
cache will have a unique trackable geocoin available for the first
3 finders. There are also BC Parks trade items, BC Geocaching
Association buttons, and Year of Science pins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a maximum of one coin per Geocaching account. Please
trade fairly for all items in the cache. If you have a coin from
another cache, please leave it for another cacher - you would want
them to do the same for you.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/giscome/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
Giscome Portage Trail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giscome Portage Trail is a designated Heritage Trail that is
located 40 km north of Prince George and 6 km off Highway 97 North
on Mitchell Road. The Giscome Portage is a route approximately 8.5
km in length, crossing the Continental Divide, which separates the
Pacific and Arctic watersheds and provides a link for north and
south water-bound travelers. Historically the route was known and
used by the Indians of the area, and was investigated by the North
West Company during the fur period. However, it did not come into
prominence as a transport route until the discovery of gold in the
Omineca and Peace River areas in the 1860’s created a demand
for quick and efficient access to the goldfields. It remained as
the main northern access route until 1920 when it became obsolete
with the construction of a road from Prince George to Summit
Lake.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;There are activities going on in BC Parks all year to celebrate
this wonderful anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2011 is also the Year of Science in BC.&lt;br /&gt;
There are events and a collection of interesting stories about
people who chose Science.&lt;/p&gt;
Here is the list of all the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/bookmarks/view.aspx?guid=ed6ac827-f22b-401a-8f87-e65ef1560a9e&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BC Parks is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. The
first BC Park was Strathcona Park on Vancouver Island which was
officially created on March 1, 1911.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the parks system in British Columbia is one of our

Crooked River Provincial Park&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crooked River lies within the Fraser Basin, an irregularly
shaped basin of gently rolling hills and shallow lakes covering
much of the North Central B.C. Three beautiful lakes are contained
within this 970 hectare park. The centre of activity of this park,
an hour's drive north of Prince George, is beach-fringed Bear Lake.
The fine, sandy beaches are some of the best in the region and are
favourites of swimmers and sunbathers. Fishing, hiking, camping and
nature study are also popular activities with outdoor enthusiasts.
Visitors like to hike to nearby Square Lake or along the
willow-lined Crooked River, the original route of early explorers.
A natural feature in the park is Livingston Springs (is a cold
water springs that run year round).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Park Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 970 hectares&lt;/p&gt;
