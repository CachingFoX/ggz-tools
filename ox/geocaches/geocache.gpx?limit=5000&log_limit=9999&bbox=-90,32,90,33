 The perfect picnic site spot!

While having a picnic on Christmas day, we realised this is the perfect spot to share with other cachers (and we couldn't resist..)!

This demarcated picnic spot is renowned for its bird life, and not only bird watchers will enjoy it, but any wildlife fanatic!!  

Facilities available: clean toilets, picnic tables, braai facilities and lots of shade.  Also, at certain times there are lots of muggles around....

But be careful: the spot is situated inside a Game Reserve.  Always be careful - there are numerous wildlife in the area, and encounters are always possible.

Please upload any wildlife &amp; bird photos of the area &amp; picnic spot - to show other cachers the beauty of this wonderful Game Reserve.

As a special treat to the First to Find: There is a blue shark keyring inside the cache with your name on (not as a tradeable)!!

Take your time, and enjoy a spectacular Reserve.</groundspeak:long_description>

is dedicated to my daughter Zoé (one of the two most beautiful
girls in the world) to celebrate her 8th birthday: May the sun
always shine upon you, and may the angels always guide you... We
travelled 750km to celebrate her birthday at her favourite place on
earth! &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



 
&lt;br/&gt;





&lt;p&gt; In 1822 the Royal Navy sent the ships Leven, Barracouta,
and Cockburn to survey the coastline. The captain of the Barracouta
was Lieutenant A.Vidal, after whom Cape Vidal was named, and Leven
Point was named after the sloop HMS Leven. The various points along
the coast: Jesser, Liefeldts, Gobey &amp; amp, and Hully were named
after officers on the ships who died of Malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cape Vidal is a beautiful stretch of beach, where one can swim,
fish, sail or snorkel. It is part of the Eastern Shores Nature
Reserve of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. In the year 1999 the
coastal area between Maphelana in the south and Kosi Bay near the
border to Mozambique in the north, including the wetlands around
Lake St. Lucia, were declared a World Cultural Heritage Site by the
UNESCO. Since then the reserve is called the iSimangaliso Wetland
Park (previously St. Lucia Wetland Park) and comprises 328000
hectares. It protects a stunning variety of unique habitats:
lagoons, reet and papyrus swampland, mangroves and swamp forests,
different types of thornveld and savannah, subtropical coastal
forest, dunes and sandy beaches as well as coral reefs off the
shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park’s centrepiece is Lake St Lucia. Although several rivers
feed into the lake, it is not a freshwater lake, but a 60 kilometre
long, shallow lagoon with varying degrees of salinity. It runs
parallel to the coast and has its mouth south of St. Lucia, which
might close up in times of drought. Because of the vast and
permanent supply of water, a large number of game animals,
especially antelope, hippopotami, crocodile and elephant are
attracted to the area. The Eastern Shores Nature Reserve features
the highest dunes in the world (150m high). The St Lucia Lake is
home of over 2000 crocodiles and 700 hippos, many antelope and a
very rich bird life. More than 350 species of birds, including
pelicans, flamingos, fisheagles and herons have been recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

find. (at least to experienced geocachers).
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I was just visiting the island from the USA to view properties and of
cause a spot of cache hunting in between looking at houses. Anyway,
spotted this interesting location on the way to Polis and it just
so happens that I had a cache to hand! So, what better than to
leave behind a cache that hopefully will not need maintenance until
my wife and I setup home and retire here on this beautiful island.


&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Update.... Well, I did finally make the move and now live permanently in Cyprus. Watch out for a lot more caches to appear on this beautiful island.

This idyllic location is quite worth a visit - it looks brand-new almost. Staff of the fire dep. was just irrigating some trees when we've been there.
