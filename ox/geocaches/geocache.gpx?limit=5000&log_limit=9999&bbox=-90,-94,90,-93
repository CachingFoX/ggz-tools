Theres an old church house there also that has been redone somewhat, take a look inside after you have found the cache, its neat!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a small jar(peanut butter size) with a white lid, it contains a log and a few small items. This is easily accessed during all seasons, just beware of ticks and snakes during the warm ones!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there is any maintence needed please let us know!

ATU-Ozark is aware of all of the caches along this trail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a one-half mile walking trail built around the Arkansas
Tech University – Ozark Campus. The trail is called the
“SGL- The Carbon Company Trail”. This trail was
completed in October 2011. It is the first project funded by the

&lt;br /&gt;
The trail also features a 9-hole disc golf course. Discs may be
checked out at the library inside the Alvin F. Vest Student
Union.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The trail and disc golf course (as well as disc checkout) are
available to the public. The caches, trail and disc golf course are
available everyday. However, discs can only be checked out during
library hours when campus is open. M-F 8 a.m. – 5 p.m.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you would like to check out disc golf discs before you
begin&lt;br /&gt;
your walk, I suggest you start at this cache first. This cache
will&lt;br /&gt;
take you to the parking lot outside the Student Union
building.&lt;br /&gt;
Inside is a food vendor, bookstore, library, computer lab and
study&lt;br /&gt;
area. The cache owner is located inside the library where the
big&lt;br /&gt;
picture window is. Please feel free to come in and say&lt;br /&gt;
“Hi!”. If you would like to play the disc golf
course&lt;br /&gt;
you are able to check out disc golf discs inside the library.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This one will probably require the most stealth of any of the&lt;br /&gt;
caches. It is located in the main parking lot for campus and
is&lt;br /&gt;
outside one of the busiest buildings on campus and can see a lot
of&lt;br /&gt;
traffic. I have made this a quick P&amp;G. Shouldn’t
take&lt;br /&gt;
long to retrieve this one. Please place back the way you found
it,&lt;br /&gt;
so that it is not easily found by the many muggles who walk
through&lt;br /&gt;
here. BYOP.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The trail starts just at the entrance to the parking lot where
this&lt;br /&gt;
cache is located.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a small camo plastic container located at the Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turpentine Creek is a refuge for lions, tigers and bears (I know- Oh My!). The park is opened daily from 9:00-6:00, 5:00 during Daylight Savings Time. There is a fee for entering the refuge, but the cache can be accessed without entering the refuge. &lt;br/&gt;Take some time to enjoy the area. The deer and llamas are exceptionally friendly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;www.turpentinecreek.org&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***Park in the gift shop parking area. The cache is only a short walk from here. Please do not drive around the building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**I had to move the cache and the accuracy was not as good, not bad about 18ft, but I thought I would give a few extra hints since I hate looking for caches when the accuracy is way off.&lt;br/&gt;From the parking area, there is a small track with a short (3-4 ft.) drop off on one side.  If you pass the area your GPS points you too by about 30 feet there is an area where you can get down the drop off easily and double back to the cache on the lower part of the track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new area does have some plants so use bug spray and watch for ticks!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is placed with the permission of the Turpentine Creek staff. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original contents were lion and tiger themed items.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a neat place.  I got to go tour it on my birthday and I recently brought them a deer someone hit in the park.  If you are here make sure you go on the tour.  Its a little pricey but you will enjoy.

I took a TB dogtag (loose) and left a periscope toy i got at sonic.  I got some good close up photos of the Llamas too.

TFTC!

The original part of town is the &quot;upper portion&quot; near the intersection of MO-90 and MO-37.  It was originally called Keetsville, and was one of only three towns in Barry County during the Civil War.  The other two towns were Cassville and McDowell -- all 3 on the Old Wire Road / Trail of Tears.&lt;br/&gt;After this portion of the town was platted, the name was officially changed to Washburn, although the upper portion was known as O'Day for a while (I haven't been able to find out how long), before it was finally just all called Washburn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring your own pencil.  Also make sure that the container is put back in the same way you found it -- so that it doesn't get blown or washed away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Permission from Brian Henry, the store owner, was obtained before placing the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

(I do it for the fun, not the frustration.) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please do not block the main driveway.  Please park in the &quot;secondary&quot; driveway, which is actually closer to the cache and is blocked by a closed gate, just a few yards NNE of the main driveway, but not in the neighbor's driveway!  Unless you're driving a school bus , your vehicle should easily be able to park in the secondary driveway before the closed gate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you find the waterproof tube, just unscrew the bottom portion of it, while holding the top that is wired to the fence post.  You'll find a couple of trinkets and the usual log book in a zip lock.  Have fun!</groundspeak:long_description>

So much has been done here in the last few years, yet this town remains a dot on the map and a speed limit nuisance for those traveling north and south on Hwy 37.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you take the short detour however, you will find that this little town is making nice changes and have made great strides in beautifying their town.  You may enjoy a walk around the multi-falls waterfall or to sit and have lunch in the gazebo - it is your choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a little more than a park and grab, but the terrain is inviting for everyone and the cache is in reach for all.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please to not tear anything apart.  Just look and grab, sign and return.  Ensure that it is hidden well when you put it back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anytime you can, help out by offering a CITO... the town kindly offers a few trash cans nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*** Congrats to Topgun5403 &amp; Co-Pilot Marty for another FTF ***</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a BYOP, Bring Your Own Pen(cil) cache.&lt;br /&gt;
Muggles will generally be few or all around depending on the time of year; use stealth.&lt;br /&gt;
Part of the North America Geocaching Society - N.A.G.S. Cache Collection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache completes the fourth corner of caches at Monett South Park.  This location provides great access to the &quot;sledding&quot; hills of the park, however you must sled at your own risk!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This approach to the park offers game day fields for local sporting events, access to the walking trail, as well a a great place to hit golf balls or fly a kite.  I the winter, this area is near the end of the drive thru parade of lights... a growing Christmas Season tradition in Monett.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We hope you enjoy this one, knowing how troublesome it may be! *** Congrats to brophyfam for FTF ***

Justin left Lafayette, Indiana to start a new life in Spanish Fort, Texas. Initially a boot repairman, H.J. soon began his own boot company working out of his home. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a railroad was built in Nocona, Texas in 1889, H.J. moved his family and business there to capitalize on the bigger market opportunity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1908, John and Earl came to work for their father, and the company was renamed H.J. Justin and Sons. In 1910, Justin boots were sold in 26 states, Canada, Mexico, and Cuba for $11 a pair. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;John, Earl and Avis took over the business after their father's death in 1918. In 1925, the brothers moved the company headquarters to Fort Worth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1948, John Justin, Jr. purchased controlling interest in the company. It wasn't long before H.J. Justin &amp; Sons was growing again. In 1968, the company made a deal with Acme Brick, another Fort Worth company with pioneering roots, to form Justin Industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nocona Boot Company became part of Justin Industries when John Jr. purchased the controlling shares from his aunt, Enid Justin, in 1981. Three years later, Chippewa Shoe Company was added to the Justin family of brands. And in 1990, Justin Industries purchased competitor Tony Lama Boots after years of intense rivalry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In August of 2000, Justin Boots was purchased by Berkshire Hathaway, managed by Warren Buffett. With strong financial backing, a lasting tradition of quality, and a talented management team, Justin Boots today is stronger than ever. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This location is one of many in the SW United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a simple camo just-above-micro container that holds a log and enough room for a few micro coins or TBs.  There is no reason to dismantle anything or remove anything.  This may be hard for handicap/wheelchairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This should be a great park and grab for those traveling through via Hwy 60 and will allow for RVs and larger vehicles as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you stop by the nearby business, thank them for allowing another cache in the Monett Area...  They would love to know more about Goecaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache has been place with the owner's permission - Doug Smith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*** Congrats to Crache dummies for a quick FTF ***</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a new cache in the downtown part of Monett to help guide passerbys off Hwy 60 into our often overlooked downtown.  There are many shops and things to see and do while here and since you are at this free parking location, why not park and take a stroll!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first weekend in June, Monett hosts Strawberry Festival and downtown is filled with vendors, musicians, and people enjoying the sun and festive atmosphere.  We have two outstanding coffee shops with their own unique style and genre.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Within the next 10 years, this whole area will be transformed as Monett updates downtown into the 21st century, adds a new fully functional campus for Drury University and many other exciting attractions.  Look around and see what is to come! *** Congrats to chuck80196 and Shoney1 for another joint FTF ***</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Placed in celebration of Veterans Day 2011 and the Palindrome 11-11-11.  Simple Ammo Box hidden under the tall growth trees.  Please respect the surroundings and watch out for the prying eyes of muggles nearby!  A variety of military trinkets and other goodies to start this one off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(a N.A.G.S. Cache - North America Geocaching Society, Search us on Facebook) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of units that can be read the same way in either direction, with general allowances for adjustments to punctuation and word dividers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Composing literature in palindromes is an example of constrained writing. The word &quot;palindrome&quot; was coined from Greek roots palin (p????; &quot;again&quot;) and dromos (d?óµ??; &quot;way, direction&quot;) by English writer Ben Jonson in the 17th century. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most familiar palindromes, in English at least, are character-by-character: The written characters read the same backwards as forwards. Some examples of common palindromic words: civic, radar, level, rotor, kayak, reviver, racecar, redder, madam, toot, boob, pop and noon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you think of any more?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park next to the giants. Please respect the private property. Use caution to avoid muggles stares.  If you take something, leave something in the best tradition of Geocaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;** Thank you to all the Veterans who serve, have served, or will serve the USA - Thank you for our freedom! **&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;** Congrats Bumbling Idiots on FTF **</groundspeak:long_description>

The establishment was founded March 6, 2011 in a living room.  It has now grown to become a active member of the Monett community and hosts many outreach and community projects to assist those in need as well bring regular encouragement to those in attendance.

Coords may be a little spotty at GZ due to the blocked sky view on one side.  Just use your GeoSenses when you near the mark!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a simple camo just-above-micro container that holds a log and enough room for a few micro coins or TBs.

Cache Collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area is tucked quietly way on the Northwest side of Monett and can easily be missed unless you are specifically looking for it or you like to drive on random streets and happen upon it.  As always with these types of caches, please respect the residents.  There is some great history hidden around these parts if you take the time to look!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's begin...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your final Coordianates will consist of finding the clues to solve the missing numbers...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N36 55.ABC&lt;br/&gt;W093 55.XYZ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Locate ground zero for the beginning coordinates... Here you will discover Z.  Z = the number of bolts holding this object in place&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Look around you and locate a &quot;dead&quot; tree.  On this tree, there is a name - the number of letters in the last name is C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. You must now search for a above ground home where two residence reside.  The owners of this dwelling go by the last name of Cook.  You need to discover how many letters are in the Mr's name without those in Cook.  (His first name and middle initial).  Add these up and you will have discovered letter X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. After visiting the Cooks, you will need to search for the &quot;i&quot;s.  These are not your eyes nor are they capital i's... there are lower case &quot;i&quot;s.  If you can find the row of white poles, you will be heading in the right direction.  Count the &quot;i&quot;s and add 1 for good measure and you will have discovered B.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. It is time to walk the line, or road if you prefer.   Find the Northwest most corner of this area and you will find a strangely misplaced resident.  This hero had the honor of serving his country and the state of Missouri in the Missouri Cavalry.  Discover the regiment of Mr Wm. J. Curtis then subtract 2 and you will have letter Y.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. It is time to return to the beginning.  Discover the tall home with a large vase on it.  At the base of the vase, not the home's foundation, you must count the diamonds that circle it.  Remember where you started or you will simple go around in circles forever.  After you are sure you have the right number, you need to do a flashback to junior high or break out your trusty calculator...  Divide the number of diamonds by 2 and then subtract 9 to discover letter A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you followed the clues and found your way to the right places... and for that matter did your math right, you now have A,B,C,X,Y, &amp; Z.  Plug these little guys into your trusty GPS and it is time to make the find!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is room in this cache for some swag and trackables, but out of respect for the residence, please do not fill it with geojunk that could blow away during your find!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the cache, Enjoy the history!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN3NKV8 - Final Location&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

This was a lot of fun to do! Minus seeing stickers I was pretty glad we were able to get out and do this. This was a little bit of a climb but not to much effort put into it even in the summer months. Was able to make the grab pretty quick. This was a nice break from the eating and fireworks.

Without getting religious, I will summarize by providing the key points for you...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you arrive at GZ, take a look around you.  You will notice there are many here who have two dates and a dash.  The first date represents the moment in time when they where born and the second number represents the moment in time when they died.  The dash, however, was their life that was lived.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will notice that some here had many years between their two numbers, others had only a few weeks.  Still others have only the first number and the dash...  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually, we each will have the numbers leading and ending our life.  How you live your life is represented by the dash!  Will you be a great leader?  Are you one who helps others?  Are you perhaps, one who only seeks personal gain?  You can't take anything with you, but you can leave a lot behind!  Remember, your Dash represents Your life...  Live it well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I ask again... What will you do with your dash?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is just off the main road with a few micro caches nearby to make it worth your time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Open only from dawn to dusk!

You are welcome to stop by their places and observe their impressive tenures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be careful on the NW corner however, since the resident at this end appear to have had mishaps with the passersby on occasion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple park and grab - parking is obvious.  As always, please respect the surroundings and practice CITO whenever possible to help the residents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a simple camo just-above-micro container that holds a log and enough room for a few micro coins or TBs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*** Congrats to buckeyekids, bosco7, topgun5403 &amp; Co-Pilot Marty  for a shared FTF ***</groundspeak:long_description>

You decide!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;It has produced 5 million gallons of water per day for hundreds of years.  Thousands of Indians have camped here.  Some artifacts found are said to be 6000 years old.  In early 1800 several families settled here. In 1831, Jacob Miller was the first to be buried in Spring River Cemetery.  In 1840, the first Sunday school west of the Mississippi was 400 feet Southeast of here.  In late 1800, a large number of Swedish families came to this valley.  Over 2500 people have gathered here in one day for baptisms.  This park is dedicated to the memory of the Indians, Swedes, and others who have passed this way.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add your self to the memory!

Search NAGS on Facebook!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On May 9, 1870 a Congregational minister and former Union officer, Stephen G. Elliott and his wife, Anna, acknowledged before J.W. Rinker, a notary public, the plat of a new town to be called Aurora on 40 acres of the farm he had bought from John C. McNatt after the close of the Civil War. He did so as part of an agreement with Andrew Pierce, Jr. president of the Frisco railroad, by which half the lots in the new town was the price for a depot to be located within it when the railroad came through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1880 there were two general stores, a drug store, two grocers, four blacksmiths, tow wagon makers, a physician and four preachers with four churches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day in November 1885 was probably the single most important day in Aurora's first hundred years. On that day, workman digging a well ran into rock, set a charge of powder and blew up great chunks of pure galena ore. A company was formed to mine it; it seemed as if shallow lead was to be found almost anywhere around Aurora. Other discoveries followed one upon another. Then came businessmen doing business out of tents or back of a wagon until something better could be built.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1886 Aurora was incorporated with Carr McNatt the first Mayor. When the first city hall was built is not certain, but it was probably just a few years after incorporation, perhaps in 1891.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coming of the railroad in 1872, the discovery of pure galena ore, lead and zinc in 1885 and the newspaper in 1899 marked the late 1800's in Aurora history. The newspaper, The Aurora Advertiser has survived to this day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first large industry, Majestic Milling, came to Aurora in August 1905. The MFA Milling Company expanded the operation into one of the largest feed mills in the world. The giant grain elevators stand today as a tribute to the historical significance of the mills operation and a welcome to visitors entering Aurora from the north along the Ozark Mountain Parkway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patriotism has swelled the hearts of Aurorans through the decades. Company M, 2nd Missouri Infantry of Aurora was called into action for World War I on August 5, 1917. While waiting to be shipped overseas, the Aurora infantrymen befriended a stray hound dog that eventually traveled overseas with them. The dog returned to Aurora with the group and the &quot;Houn Dawg &quot; became the official town mascot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, Aurora is known as &quot;The Summit City of the Ozarks&quot;. Located on a high plateau (1,434 ft. above sea level) in the state's southwest corner from which one can gradually descend into the Ozark Mountains. As one of the oldest mountain ranges in the United States, the Ozark Mountains retains its wilderness character, rugged, diverse and always delightful. This beauty surrounds Aurora.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**Congrats Bride of ScottyLove for a geosense (no GPS) FTF**</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
We took a back road home and say this hill from a distance.  We decided to go check it out. &lt;br /&gt;
There is a nice view from up here if the weather is right.  It is kinda cool looking straight up too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Obviously, there is no reason to do more than park and find here.  Observe the signs nearby for your safety as well as not to break the law.  There is a nice parking spot just off the road which will be obvious.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a bunch of items to start this cache off including various maps and some swag.  This could be a great location for trackables as well.  Please do not fill the cache up with geojunk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy the view and cache!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a small camouflaged and well hidden cache located at Lindenlure river access in Linden MO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The community of Linden started as early as 1833 and had an operating mill from about 1840 through 1922.  The site of the mill is now known as Lindenlure.  Lindenlure is a public river access with canoeing and an easily accessible waterfall formed from a man-made dam. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache area is a very short distance from the road, however there will likely be some dense foliage in the summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area tends to be very busy on warm summer days with lots of gravel beaches on the river to enjoy.  &lt;br/&gt;There will likely be muggles about during these times making it difficult to access the cache without attracting attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;** 8/9/2008 I checked the cache and it looks like the flooding or muggles go to this one so I replaced the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a lot of growth around the cache in the summer so be wary of ticks and Poison Ivy, I gave a good hint so you won't have to wander in it searching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;** The river access is closed at 10:00 p.m.  This is STRICTLY ENFORCED due to past trouble in the area.</groundspeak:long_description>

Thought about taking my car off roading a little bit, but decided to park. walked our way to the grounzero, surprised it was still there do to all the flooding, but the container had taken on some water. the log book was soaked, and water came gushing out of the contanier. We were able to sign the log but dont know how long it will last. Train took a pic to prove it. on our way back we saw a guy that was weeding whacking and knew why he was replacing his wire on his weed whacker when we first started our hunt. we had some good laughs, and on our way back to down the road we saw a baby fox, took a quick picture before traffic came by and the fox decided to run. tftc</groundspeak:text>

This is a Trackable Hotel.  TB's, trackables, and even Geocoins need a place to pull over for a short rest from their missions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the SUGGESTED GUIDELINES for your visit to the SW Missouri Hotel... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Trade even or up (trackables only), don't forget to Sign Guest List.&lt;br/&gt;2.  If you do not have a trackable for trade, please sign the log and record your find.  Instead of taking a trackable, simply &quot;discover&quot; any trackable found!  This helps keep the Hotel Guest occupancy level up.  Low occupancy is bad for business!&lt;br/&gt;3.  If you have a trackable that needs a place to rest, you are welcome to drop it here anytime. Consider the first stay on us.&lt;br/&gt;4.  Do not leave &quot;geo-junk&quot; in the Hotel... Seriously, who likes a messy hotel??  We are striving for a 5-star rating!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are only suggestions since there cannot be &quot;rules&quot; related to trackable items.  But, in the spirit of the Hotel concept, please consider these suggested guidelines with your find!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Help keep the guest list full.  Taking without trading defeats the purpose of the Trackable Hotel.  Again, welcome to the SW Missouri Trackable Hotel and have a nice stay!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**Congrats topgun5403 &amp; Co-Pilot Marty for another FTF**</groundspeak:long_description>

Football themed trade items.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kickoff/parking coordinates are: N 37 09.255 W 093 18.514 You
can get here going South on Ferguson from Battlefield. Please park
here, there are closer areas to park but they are in neighborhoods
and apartment parking and require the crossing of surprisingly busy
streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distance to the cache will be about .20 from the parking
coordinates over mostly flat terrain, however there will be some
bushwacking required the last 20 feet or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After very heavy rains the walk could be muddy and the cache
could be unaccessible at these times. The cache is on high ground
and should not flood. Please do not attempt at night since the
parking is still near housing and would probably raise unwanted
attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original cache contents were a premade cache given to me on
my birthday by GeoJenC. I have a travel bug I have been waiting to
send out I named Tailgater, so Jenny made a cache filled with
Football items so I would have an appropriate place to start it's
travels.&lt;/p&gt;
I KNOW THERE ARE CLOSER PLACES TO PARK, I WAS ASKED NOT TO HAVE
PEOPLE PARK THERE WHEN GETTING PERMISSION FOR PLACING THE
CACHE.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;*** Just a heads-up, pay attention to the attributes: THORNS,
TICKS, POISON IVY AND POSSIBLY BEES in the cache area. Watch out
for the very big Groundhog holes!! Not much I can do about these
but give an additional warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

placement&lt;/u&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I am heading home after spending the last 10 days at Mom and Rog's. Thought I would spend some of my day caching to &quot;shorten&quot; the trip, stretching a 12 hour drive into 24!

I parked a block away and froggered my way across Walnut Lawn. Found some thorns and then the cache. Dropped of a TB that I have been hauling around for a few days. Didn't find any others in the cache. 

TFTC,

about 50 feet from parking on relatively flat terrain. &lt;br /&gt;
 This should be a quick grab and is kid friendly.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The building where this cache is located has lots of local
information and they are very helpful, particularly for out of town
guests.&lt;br /&gt;
 The hours are approximately 9:00-5:00, they vary slightly on
weekends and holidays.&lt;br /&gt;
 * Please try to do this cache around the business hours and not
late at night, it is located very near a bank and you don’t want
them to “come for you”. Also you can’t get any of the information
if they are not open. &lt;br /&gt;

 Approach the cache from the West to avoid damaging any of the
shrubbery.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This series is a tribute to the bands that I love, and this one gives tribute to the band call Neva Dinova. Neva Dinova is of course another indie band from Omaha, Nebraska that is on the Saddle Creek label. The band, Neva Dinova, came from the lead singer Jake Bellows grandmother. Although the band didn’t originally release their albums with Saddle Creek, all their albums have been re-issued.  The band is made up of lead vocals and guitarist Jake Bellows who is joined by Heath Koontz (keyboards/bass), Mike Kratky (vocals/guitar), Time Haes (guitar), and Roger Lewis (drums). The band was originally with Crank! Records and released their self title album “Neva Dinova” (2002) and “The Hate Yourself Change” (2005). In 2004, Neva Dinova and Bright Eyes did a split album, “One Jug of Wine, Two Vessels” that was released on Crank! But Connor Oberst of Bright Eyes convinced Neva Dinova to joined Saddle Creek, which they did and on April 8, 2008 they released their 3 album “you May Already Be Dreaming” Since then Saddle Creek has re-issued “One Jug of Wine, Two Vessels” with extra tracks, and re-issued their previous albums. The lead singer (Jake Bellows) has done work with Connor Oberst, with the latest being on the album Cassadaga. The drummer Roger Lewis also has been working with another Saddle Creek band called The Good Life.  The band has released 3 EP’s and 3 LP’s since their short &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a very common park and grab, but the container is not a micro, you will know what I mean when you arrive on ground zero. The traffic is very heavy in this area, so be aware of muggles, and parking will be virtually right by the cache. The road that you will pull onto is a dead end road, but you don’t have to drive to the end, so it is no RoF more like a col-de-sac. FTF winner will get their FTF medal but also awaiting them some music by Neva Dinova that they recorded for a Daytrotter Session. Daytrotter is an online promotion website for indie bands that allow you to download their music that they performed in their studio for free. ***FTF Honors goes to SterlingConnie***</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My Ipod is naming my caches again! It came up with this very fitting song by Mumford &amp; Sons which not only do they sing this song off their album Sign No More. Mumford &amp; Sons you might have heard they were nominated for a grammy this year.&lt;br /&gt;This cache is off the South Dry Sac River Trail where it meets the Truman Park Trail. Bring your own pen, there is room for trackables, and some trade items. This area can be busy during certain times of the day. So watch out for muggles along the trail. Make sure you hide the cache the way you found it or better than you found it due to the amount of traffic that can be in this area.&lt;br /&gt;If you choose to park at the school to get on the trail please be respectful of the time that you come. Do not park in the school parking lot 30 minutes before and after school is in session. You can reach the cache by a good stroll, hike, or bike ride to the cache itself at the head of the trail itself.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Out placing a cache and the crazy iPhone all of a sudden changed
songs to When Trees Get Wheeled Away by Bright Eyes off their album
Noise Floor. I decide to keep the name of the cache because when
you find the cache, it might make sense....or it might not.&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located on the David Murruy Tail, it is just 15 feet
off the trail. Please bring your own pen for the adventure, the
cache is in its nature surroundings. Watch out for thorns! The
trail is open from sunrise to sunset. During certain periods of the
day the trail is pretty busy, so use stealth, and watch out for
muggles. I had averaged the cords because the readings i got were
very different each time, but the closest i got was about 20 feet.
Please bring your own pen to write with.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK2T6ME - GC2T6ME Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 16.864 W 093° 18.066</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This series is a tribute to the bands that I love, and this one gives tribute to the band called Bright Eyes. The front man, Conor Oberest has been the face of the band since the beginning of his young career at the age of 14. Conor Oberest started an independent label with his brother called Saddle-Creek located in Ohama, Nebraska. Bright Eyes has 11 albums (including a Christmas album), 6 EPs,  numerous split records, and has been on 3 benefit albums. Conor Oberest has developed his solo career and done a collabrative album with other major indiependent artist. Bright Eyes has never had one sound to hang their hat one, but Conor Oberest is a great storyteller through out his career. Bright Eyes in their albums sounds range from folk, alternative, rock, indie, electronica, and country. They are a must to check out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geocache itself is located on a dead end road that has about four houses around it, located about 10 feet off the road, this is an easy park and grab. Make sure you place it back how you found it. If this takes you more than 10 minutes then it is probably not there. You might want to kick up the stealth during the day. I hope you enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located downtown Ash Grove, Missouri, on Main Street, so it is very
easy to get to.

&lt;p&gt;This cache will
     have a multi purpose in a way. One to have a cache close to my
     home coordinates, second to add more fun to the area, and
     third even have the chance to get a few waymarks while you are
     in town if you are into that part. Do a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.waymarking.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;waymark&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; search on that
     site for postal code &lt;b&gt;65604&lt;/b&gt; and it will come up with a
     bunch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nothing to historic or special about the cache itself but the area
is full of history, and there are a few more traditional caches in
the area that you can grab while you are here. Main street has a
few things to offer also, there is a restaurant, bar, historical
museum, library, antique shop, candle shop, music shop, art shop,
and a few others…..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is hidden outside, so you won’t have to worry about time
limits, it will be available 24/7. If you have been caching a long
time it will become obvious where the cache is, if not, you might
have to have help with the hint. There should be room in there for
A LOT OF GOODIES. Main Street can be very busy at times, so watch
for muggles. There is plenty of sitting room and even a little
table to rummage thru the goodies. Most of the stores/shops in the
area know I am hiding one here so they won’t call the local police
on ya.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is also a couple WiFi Hotspot here in this area. I am working
on of my own and should be up and running correctly by the time
this cache hits the net. So if you are like me and like to have
your PSP or Laptop with you, it really helps when searching or
logging that find fast, or even to hunt for the next closest if you
haven't already programmed your GPS.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Original contents are in two butter dish's and will be, Autograph
Baseball Card from Don Demeter 1963 Detroit Tigers, Trackable
Dollar, GeoCoin, Calculator, 4 or 5 key rings, ALOT of Beanie
Babies, and who knows what all else, filled to the rim. So FTF will
have a chance for a nice prize.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 ** The owner of
     the building and proprietor of the store granted permission
     for this hide. Be sure to step in and say hi to my mom while
     you are there if it's open, hours should be Tue-Sat 10am to
     4pm, (Nedra) She is the one that thought it would be neat to
     have one here. She likes to meet and talk to people.&lt;/p&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Will start off with a little History Lesson about this
cache and the area where you will take your journey today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Greetings from Fr. Moses:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Theotokos &quot;Unexpected Joy&quot; Orthodox Church!&lt;br /&gt;
We are a mission of the Orthodox Church in America, located in Ash
Grove, a small town about 20 miles from Springfield, in southwest
Missouri.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our membership is multi-ethnic, and we follow the Old (Julian)
Calendar, and all services are in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;u&gt;This will be a quick Park N Grab here in Ash
Grove.  Nothing major about the hide, and I am sure you have
seen this type of container before.  Not a total micro/nano :)
just your normal size film canister.  It's NOT on the sign, so
no need to get splinters ;) heheheh  Enjoy the country side
and add another smiley to your list.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello all, Another history lesson to go along with this cache
and the area you will be in today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One note before
we begin, if you do go all the way up the path, PLEASE KEEP THE
GATE CLOSED, there are cows in the field and they don't need to be
out on the road roaming around.  The cache is not through the
gate, but you are welcome to take the  hike up to the
cemetery.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

slaves, rural black families and several souls whose names are lost
to time has gained national recognition. Ash Grove's Berry Cemetery
has been named to the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 130-year-old cemetery was deeded as a burial
place for &quot;Slaves, paupers and Indians&quot; who were not allowed
interment at the Ash Grove Cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it's all that's left of a once-thriving black
community in northwest Greene County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They were husbands and wives and children, a
community of people that had hope in the generations to come,&quot; said
Moses Berry, great-grandson of the cemetery's founder, William H.
Berry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They built their own homes. They built their own
schools. They worked and prayed for their community and left behind
a loving legacy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses Berry, an Orthodox priest who spent most of
his life away from the Ozarks, now lives adjacent to the cemetery
on his great-grandfather's farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berry said his family had always maintained the
cemetery, but it had fallen into neglect before he inherited the
nearby farm eight years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We rescued that cemetery from the woods,&quot; said
Berry. &quot;Tombstones had been knocked down by grazing cattle. We had
to fill dirt in some of the graves that had sunken.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of many volunteers, much of the
one-acre burial ground has been cleared of brush, fenced in and
nursed back to a respectable state. But Berry worries about what
will happen after he can no longer care for the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sought the National Register designation as a
way to encourage future generations, and especially
African-Americans, to remember the cemetery's significance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Berry Cemetery nomination was accepted on the
National Register on Nov. 13. Berry received notification of the
designation in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berry said he hopes the National Registry
designation will help preserve not only the memory of a vanished
black community, but the segregated world in which it
functioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It will be a place where future generations can
look back and recognize what their ancestors accomplished. It says,
'My life is connected to more than just the present.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;OK, this should be another quick Park N Grab,
Cache is not on or past the gate, again, if you do go up to the
cemetery, PLEASE keep the gate closed. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;ALSO, If you drop the container, it's a goner
:)  No big deal really, just let me know and I will replace
it, so   BE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD HOLD ON IT, BOTH TAKING
OUT AND PUTTING IN.   THANKS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

alive but moved from the area. Thanks Mike for the great site.

&lt;p&gt;Ok, the original &quot;AH CHOO! CHOO CACHE&quot;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC266FY&quot;&gt;(GC266FY)&lt;/a&gt; was one of my favorites
and I hated to see it go, but I know how things change.  So,
here is a quick rundown of the original.  Nothing has changed
about the location and dangers of this area if you have small
kids.   Watch them close if they get out of the
vehicle.  It is a very nice place and you will have fun
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the old cache page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATTENTION!!&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is in no way under the bridge down in the valley.. DO
NOT GO DOWN THERE..  You do not need to cross any barrier or
fence.  If you have kids they may need to stay in the car on
this one just because the guardrail of the bridge has gaps in
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now
to the fun part.. :)&lt;br /&gt;
This is an spot that myself and BegHef32 found while caching
through the Ash Grove area.  While we were there, I asked him
about hiding a cache at this location since out of my 500 caches
finds, this is the most amazing place that I have ever
seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be a very quick park and grab which is on
fairly level ground.  After nabbing the smiley, take time to
ennjoy the view and maybe even take some photos.  I hope
youenjoy this one.. bring your own pen as the container will be too
small to hold one.. parking is available on the north side of the
bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you want an awesome view of where you will be going,
click the link below.. Note:  It will open up a new page in
your browser.  It is safe and virus free.  But with all
things in life, if you don't want to take a chance that's cool
too.  I have been using this site for quite some time and
never had a problem with it.....&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Have you
ever just gotten in the car and followed that road through the
country? It's a great way to leave the stresses and pressures of
everyday life behind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We took a liesurely route back from a recent road-trip destination
doing exactly that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This little rest stop nestled at a quiet cross-roads made perfect
sense to place a cache at. You are looking for a medium sized,
camo'd pill bottle. A FTF token is attached.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the time of this placement, we did not see ticks, thorns,
snakes, or poison ivy - but this is Missouri, and as we all know,
stuff changes seasonally&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There is much history
in the border areas between Missouri and Kansas. If you take the
time to look around you, you'll frequently find plaques and markers
providing insight into the significance of the areas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We recently came across a detailed historical marker and decided to
place a cache in the immediate area to highlight the events that
occurred there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You'll be seeking a magnetic keycase in a fairly well-trafficked
area, so some stealth would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the time of this placement, we did not see ticks, thorns,
snakes, or poison ivy - but this is Missouri, and as we all know,
stuff changes seasonally&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BEWARE: This cache is dangerous and should only be
attempted by those properly trained in rock climbing or rappelling.
Always perform unfamiliar maneuvers in a safe environment before
attempting them in the field. Never rappel or climb alone. Always
use properly maintained gear and know how to use it. Not following
these warnings could result in serious injury or even death. All
participants visit the cliff at their own risk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Area and The History&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Located two hours south of Kansas City and about 30 minutes west
of Osceola, MO is the town of Monegaw Springs, MO. While there
isn't much left of the original town the area has a rich history
worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache has been placed at a location known as Younger's
Lookout, which is a vista at the top of a cliff on the shore of the
former Osage River, now Truman Lake/Reservoir. Younger's Lookout is
named after the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James-Younger_Gang&quot;&gt;Younger Gang&lt;/a&gt;, a notorious group of outlaws including
Jesse James that used these cliffs as a hide-out from which they
could see the surrounding land for miles. The nearby town of
Monegaw Springs was the site of a famous deadly shootout between
the Younger Gang and the sherrif in 1874.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the river from Younger's Lookout you will see the remains
of the historic &lt;a href=&quot;http://bridgehunter.com/mo/st-clair/monegaw/&quot;&gt;Monegaw Springs Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, and at the bottom of the
climbing route you will see a few collapsed caves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Getting to The Cache&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is hung on a climbing bolt half way down the cliff at
Younger's Lookout, making the cache accessible only by rock
climbing the route or by anchoring a rope from the top and
rappelling. For rigging a rope at the top of the cliff there are
numerous trees to use as an anchor, but make sure to use a backup
anchor or two behind your main anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rappelling&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those attempting to rappel down to this cache should bring at
least 100 feet of rope. There is no landing to rappel to, instead
one must stop their rappel half way down and do all work while only
hanging from the rope. This means that one should know how and have
the proper equipment to lock off their rappel device in order to
retrieve, sign, and replace the cache as found while hanging hands
free on the rope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Again, you will have nothing to stand on or otherwise
stabilize yourself to retrieve, sign, or replace the cache other
than your rope.&lt;/em&gt; As a reminder, with all vertical sports all
unfamiliar techniques should be practiced in a safe environment
before being executed on a rope in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rock Climbing&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I am no climber, and I have no knowledge as to the
difficulty of this route or the condition of its bolts. With my
limited knowledge of rock climbing I would have to guess this is an
intermediate route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rock climbers could either lead climb using the bolted route or
setup an anchor and top rope climb to the cache. I have been told
that this route is listed in some climbing books, but I am not
certain wich books those are. Any better information that could be
provided by any climbers that visit this route would be
appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Required Gear&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rappelling or rock climbing gear. This should always include
but is not limited to a climbing harness, rope, helmet, locking
carabiners, lockable rappel device, and gloves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweezers to extract the log from the cache container.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An adjustable wrench to open/close the mallion the cache
container is attached by.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your own writing utensil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food, water, tp, full tank of gas (see &quot;Services&quot; below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Signing The Cache&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No piggybacking here folks. Don't sign anybody else's name for
them, you did the work to get there, shouldn't they have to as
well? Nobody should sign the log or claim the cache on
geocaching.com unless they have actually climbed to, rappelled to,
or otherwise actually visited the precise location where the cache
is attached to the cliff, retrieved the cache, and signed the log
themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Services&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no gas stations, restrooms, convenience stores,
drinking water, or cell phone signal anywhere near this cache.
Bring everything you need for a self-supported day, including a
full tank of gas. The nearest services are about 30 minutes away in
Osceola, MO. After a hard day of caching I recommend Sugarfoot BBQ
in Osceola, MO for refreshments and caloric content (Just off
MO-13, head West on MO-82 from MO-13 in Osceola)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BEWARE: This cache is dangerous and should only be
attempted by those properly trained in rock climbing or rappelling.
Always perform unfamiliar maneuvers in a safe environment before
attempting them in the field. Never rappel or climb alone. Always
use properly maintained gear and know how to use it. Not following
these warnings could result in serious injury or even death. All
participants visit the cliff at their own risk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also known as GC2XYK6&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Hazel Hill Lake is a little-known conservation area a few miles north of Warrensburg, MO. You are looking for a nontraditional camo'd container. There's no room for a writing instrument, so you will need to BYOP. The cache can be reached from a wheelchair for those who can bend at the waist. It’s accessible from the paved parking area as well and should be available year-round except in heavy snow.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a nice quiet place to go fishing or bird-watching. The fishing dock is wheelchair accessible and is close to the parking area. A special thank you to Steve Cooper of the Missouri Department of Conservation who granted permission and issued the permit to place a cache here. Geocaching is still new to the local DOC so please be a respectful steward of the sport. The park hours are 4:00 am to 10:00 pm.  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTICE: Please be respectful of the posted park hours. If you enter the park after hours you are trespassing. If you are stopped you can be ticketed or arrested and will put the future of geocaching in the parks in jeopardy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. </groundspeak:long_description>

It's well hidden even if the container is in plain sight.  Hopefully it will hold up well but not sure if it's water tight as the previous finder mentioned.  Might be worth replacing as convenient but should hold up in the short term.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Came to Sedalia today to wipe most of its caches off my map.  The maneuver was dubbed Operation: Nuke Sedalia.  I’m not going to say who dubbed it that, but it was so dubbed.  The temperatures were serious as the heat index hit 110.  We were not going to be deterred, though.  There were multiple distractions and attempts to derail the effort, but by dusk, the operation was declared a success.  In the end, nearly 70 caches in and around Sedalia fell to my pen.  

One last BikeDH cache to close out the day.

I should mention that the catalyst for the trip originated with BikeDH’s Breakfast at the Café event, GC2XAA4.  BikeDH is a great host and did a great job overcoming the issues that hit this event the week of the event.  

I am working on keeping my logs shorter and not so long winded.  Sometimes typing out the stories of my cache finds takes longer than finding the cache itself.  In fact, that happens more and more these days.  Of course, I write, rewrite, revise, review, and finalize.  Probably more care for the log than necessary.  I hope I was able to keep this log appropriately short and sweet.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Scout is Friendly&lt;/b&gt; - A Scout is a friend to all. He is a brother to other Scouts. He seeks to understand others. He respects those with ideas and customs other than his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scouting has been a part of Odessa Missouri for over 75 years. Troop 286 was founded in 1935, and moved this location sometime in the 1950s, where it still meets today. This cache not only acknowledges the history of Troop 286, but the history of Scouting in Odessa Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is parking on the property, but if it's been raining you may want to park across the street at the Park entrance and walk onto the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Big Muddy District&lt;/b&gt; serves the counties of Ray, Lafayette and Carroll (located northeast of Kansas City, in the state of Missouri) and includes the communities: Bosworth, Camden, Carrollton, Concordia, Corder, Hardin, Henrietta, Higginsville, Lexington, Mayview, Napoleon, Norborn, Odessa, Orrick, Rayville, Richmond, Waverly, and Wellington, Missouri.

Permission was granted by Slater City Hall City Administrator and property owner of land the sign and driveway is located on. Please pull in the driveway behind sign and don't block the drive. Ground is fairly level until the last few feet. Please place back as found. Should be muggle free, but as always use some stealth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Slater, MO aka &quot;The Boyhood Home&quot; of Steve McQueen.&lt;br/&gt;In 1933 McQueen and his grandparents moved in with his grandmother's brother Claude on his farm near Slater. McQueen lived with his uncle until age 8, when his mother took him back with her to Indiana. A couple years later when his mother was unable to control his behavior, McQueen was sent back to his Uncle Claude's until he was 14. This is when McQueen left his Uncle's home without saying goodbye and joining the circus. &lt;br/&gt;As we all know, McQueen went on to be one of the biggest movie stars of the 60's and 70's.&lt;br/&gt;Every year in the spring, The City of Slater hosts Steve McQueen Days with festivities celebrating Steve's life and his rural Missouri roots.&lt;br/&gt;This sign is a great place to take picture's. If you do take some pics and feel like putting them in your log along with your city and state, please do so, as the City Hall folks like to see where people are visiting from.&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a lock and lock container that contains swag and a log book and writing utensil.&lt;br/&gt;There is a 2011 KC Picnic Pathtag for the FTF prize&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*** Congratulations to BikeDH on being FTF ***</groundspeak:long_description>

Then it requires some minor bushwhacking to Ground Zero. As area around any lake goes, there can be encounters with thorns, ticks, snakes, ninja squirrels, etc.&lt;br/&gt;Use your geosenses.&lt;br/&gt;Permission to place this cache has been granted by The fishing club board and Slater City Hall. Yes we know that the entrance sign says members only but they have given cachers permission to seek this cache...&lt;br/&gt;No Night Caching Please. &lt;br/&gt;Happy Hunting!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK3DK8K - GC3DK8K Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 13.306 W 093° 02.849&lt;br/&gt;This is the closest parking to the cache (less than 1/4 mile walk to the cache)</groundspeak:long_description>

across the northern edge of Missouri and is sparsely populated with
caches few and far between. I thought I would try and add to a part
that seemed especially barren.&lt;br /&gt;

You will seeking a painted micro-canister large enough for a log
and geocoins, or very small TBs.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;There is enough space
for up to 2 cars to pull off on the shoulder
safely.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

This puzzle series was great.  I know a lot of work went into these, and a ton of work went into solving them.  I was riding with a great crew as we took these down in the field.  A great memorable morning at MOGA.

Had solved all the puzzles with iowa2asia and da_ewoks prior to our trip to MOGA. Ran the trail with GuitarMan24, coupleofbucks and iowa2asia on Friday night before MOGA. The skies were grey but the rain stayed away. We made most of the finds pretty easily, only had trouble with some cedar trees but we persevered and found them. Excellent trail and a great way to start off our MOGA. Thanks for all the work that went into creating the puzzles and hiding the caches, awesome job!

We signed as a team with the team name BBC (Big Bang Cachers). Ended up grabbing 42 FTF and had the whole pennisula to ourselves. After all of that we went to the BYO Bash and after that we made a plan to go out and grab all of these MOGA puzzles. I did most of the puzzling solving got some help on some others. But we were able to make the grab on the MOGA art.</groundspeak:text>

Had solved all the puzzles with iowa2asia and da_ewoks prior to our trip to MOGA. Ran the trail with GuitarMan24, coupleofbucks and iowa2asia on Friday night before MOGA. The skies were grey but the rain stayed away. We made most of the finds pretty easily, only had trouble with some cedar trees but we persevered and found them. Excellent trail and a great way to start off our MOGA. Thanks for all the work that went into creating the puzzles and hiding the caches, awesome job!

Had solved all the puzzles with iowa2asia and da_ewoks prior to our trip to MOGA. Ran the trail with GuitarMan24, coupleofbucks and iowa2asia on Friday night before MOGA. The skies were grey but the rain stayed away. We made most of the finds pretty easily, only had trouble with some cedar trees but we persevered and found them. Excellent trail and a great way to start off our MOGA. Thanks for all the work that went into creating the puzzles and hiding the caches, awesome job!

I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

This puzzle series was great.  I know a lot of work went into these, and a ton of work went into solving them.  I was riding with a great crew as we took these down in the field.  A great memorable morning at MOGA.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Graceland was Elvis’s home in Memphis, TN. This was a very special place to him and his family. He purchased Graceland in March 1957 for approximately $103,000 with the proceeds of his first hit record, Heartbreak Hotel, when it hit number one on the charts. The gates of Graceland that features the musical notes were installed later that year. The month the musical notes were added equals A.&lt;br /&gt;

Following are opening lines of one of Elvis's gold hit singles that he recorded in Feb 1969. This was a very popular record that only made it as high as #16 on top billboard single charts in 1970. &quot;(C equals the # of)lonely days and a dozen towns ago, I reached out one night and you were gone.

Elvis passed away in 1977.The US Postal Service honored his life and featured the (cost of the postal stamp minus 24 equals E) cents postal stamp in 1993.&lt;br /&gt;

Had solved all the puzzles with iowa2asia and da_ewoks prior to our trip to MOGA. Ran the trail with GuitarMan24, coupleofbucks and iowa2asia on Friday night before MOGA. The skies were grey but the rain stayed away. We made most of the finds pretty easily, only had trouble with some cedar trees but we persevered and found them. Excellent trail and a great way to start off our MOGA. Thanks for all the work that went into creating the puzzles and hiding the caches, awesome job!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

This puzzle series was great.  I know a lot of work went into these, and a ton of work went into solving them.  I was riding with a great crew as we took these down in the field.  A great memorable morning at MOGA.

We made our way to MOGA with Trekkie79, louinliberty, debrajean and kickrobo.  We signed most of our logs as KCHB.  This was one of many on our super day that we found.  Thanks so much for being a part of our first MOGA.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

This puzzle series was great.  I know a lot of work went into these, and a ton of work went into solving them.  I was riding with a great crew as we took these down in the field.  A great memorable morning at MOGA.

Had solved all the puzzles with iowa2asia and da_ewoks prior to our trip to MOGA. Ran the trail with GuitarMan24, coupleofbucks and iowa2asia on Friday night before MOGA. The skies were grey but the rain stayed away. We made most of the finds pretty easily, only had trouble with some cedar trees but we persevered and found them. Excellent trail and a great way to start off our MOGA. Thanks for all the work that went into creating the puzzles and hiding the caches, awesome job!

We made our way to MOGA with Trekkie79, louinliberty, debrajean and kickrobo.  We signed most of our logs as KCHB.  This was one of many on our super day that we found.  Thanks so much for being a part of our first MOGA.

I qualify by way of the 2nd row going across!  Will gladly verify more if needed.  Neat little Bingo game!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

This puzzle series was great.  I know a lot of work went into these, and a ton of work went into solving them.  I was riding with a great crew as we took these down in the field.  A great memorable morning at MOGA.

Had solved all the puzzles with iowa2asia and da_ewoks prior to our trip to MOGA. Ran the trail with GuitarMan24, coupleofbucks and iowa2asia on Friday night before MOGA. The skies were grey but the rain stayed away. We made most of the finds pretty easily, only had trouble with some cedar trees but we persevered and found them. Excellent trail and a great way to start off our MOGA. Thanks for all the work that went into creating the puzzles and hiding the caches, awesome job!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

This puzzle series was great.  I know a lot of work went into these, and a ton of work went into solving them.  I was riding with a great crew as we took these down in the field.  A great memorable morning at MOGA.

We made our way to MOGA with Trekkie79, louinliberty, debrajean and kickrobo.  We signed most of our logs as KCHB.  This was one of many on our super day that we found.  Thanks so much for being a part of our first MOGA.</groundspeak:text>

Had solved all the puzzles with iowa2asia and da_ewoks prior to our trip to MOGA. Ran the trail with GuitarMan24, coupleofbucks and iowa2asia on Friday night before MOGA. The skies were grey but the rain stayed away. We made most of the finds pretty easily, only had trouble with some cedar trees but we persevered and found them. Excellent trail and a great way to start off our MOGA. Thanks for all the work that went into creating the puzzles and hiding the caches, awesome job!

Had solved all the puzzles with iowa2asia and da_ewoks prior to our trip to MOGA. Ran the trail with GuitarMan24, coupleofbucks and iowa2asia on Friday night before MOGA. The skies were grey but the rain stayed away. We made most of the finds pretty easily, only had trouble with some cedar trees but we persevered and found them. Excellent trail and a great way to start off our MOGA. Thanks for all the work that went into creating the puzzles and hiding the caches, awesome job!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

This puzzle series was great.  I know a lot of work went into these, and a ton of work went into solving them.  I was riding with a great crew as we took these down in the field.  A great memorable morning at MOGA.

I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

This puzzle series was great.  I know a lot of work went into these, and a ton of work went into solving them.  I was riding with a great crew as we took these down in the field.  A great memorable morning at MOGA.

Had solved all the puzzles with iowa2asia and da_ewoks prior to our trip to MOGA. Ran the trail with GuitarMan24, coupleofbucks and iowa2asia on Friday night before MOGA. The skies were grey but the rain stayed away. We made most of the finds pretty easily, only had trouble with some cedar trees but we persevered and found them. Excellent trail and a great way to start off our MOGA. Thanks for all the work that went into creating the puzzles and hiding the caches, awesome job!

Funny story on this one, we were south of here when I got a text from my wife at home... &quot;Bart&quot; had found GuitarMan24's cell phone which he left at another cache. I gave him a call and he was at Polibus Square, so he described a location near the cache that he would hide the phone for us to get. Glad to get a cache and find the lost phone at once. Thanks a million Bart!!!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

This puzzle series was great.  I know a lot of work went into these, and a ton of work went into solving them.  I was riding with a great crew as we took these down in the field.  A great memorable morning at MOGA.

Had solved all the puzzles with iowa2asia and da_ewoks prior to our trip to MOGA. Ran the trail with GuitarMan24, coupleofbucks and iowa2asia on Friday night before MOGA. The skies were grey but the rain stayed away. We made most of the finds pretty easily, only had trouble with some cedar trees but we persevered and found them. Excellent trail and a great way to start off our MOGA. Thanks for all the work that went into creating the puzzles and hiding the caches, awesome job!

But we were able to make the grab on the MOGA art.</groundspeak:text>

You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

This puzzle series was great.  I know a lot of work went into these, and a ton of work went into solving them.  I was riding with a great crew as we took these down in the field.  A great memorable morning at MOGA.

Had solved all the puzzles with iowa2asia and da_ewoks prior to our trip to MOGA. Ran the trail with GuitarMan24, coupleofbucks and iowa2asia on Friday night before MOGA. The skies were grey but the rain stayed away. We made most of the finds pretty easily, only had trouble with some cedar trees but we persevered and found them. Excellent trail and a great way to start off our MOGA. Thanks for all the work that went into creating the puzzles and hiding the caches, awesome job!

We made our way to MOGA with Trekkie79, louinliberty, debrajean and kickrobo.  We signed most of our logs as KCHB.  This was one of many on our super day that we found.  Thanks so much for being a part of our first MOGA.

We decided rather late in the day that we would try to get as many icons as we could. GuitarMan24, iowa2asia, coupleofbucks and I had the MOGA Mega, a CITO, Earth Cache and of course traditional and had just done the &quot;Orienteering&quot; puzzle nearby. This one was advertised as easy and stage one was a quick find for me. Punched in the stage 2 coordinates and was a little skeptical that I had done it right when I saw the distance and what was in that direction. Thankfully others had left an indicator making stage two an instant find! Off to get a letterbox hybrid!

Letterboxers hide small, weatherproof boxes in publicly-accessible places (like parks) and post clues to finding the box online on one of several Web sites. However, clues to finding some of the most highly-sought boxes are passed around by word of mouth. There are about 20,000 letterboxes hidden in North America alone. Individual letterboxes usually contain a log book, an often hand-carved rubber stamp and may contain an ink pad. Finders make an imprint of the letterbox's stamp on their personal log book, and leave an imprint of their personal stamp on the letterbox's logbook .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Letterboxing is said to have started in England in 1854 when a Dartmoor National Park guide, James Perrott of Chagford, left a bottle by Cranmere Pool with his calling card in it an an invitation to those who found the bottle to add theirs. Eventually, visitors began leaving a self-addressed post card or note in the jar, hoping for them to be returned by mail by the next visitor (thus the origin of the term “letterboxing;” “letterbox” is a British term for a mailbox). This practice ended in time, however, and the current custom of using rubber stamps and visitor’s log books came into use. It caught on in the US in 1998 after an article in Smithsonian magazine.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Orienteering is a family of sports that requires navigational skills using a map and compass to navigate from point to point in diverse and usually unfamiliar terrain, and normally moving at speed. Participants are given a topographical map, usually a specially prepared orienteering map, which they use to find control points. Originally a training exercise in land navigation for military officers, orienteering has developed many variations. Among these, the oldest and the most popular is foot orienteering. For the purposes of this article, foot orienteering serves as a point of departure for discussion of all other variations, but basically any sport that involves racing against a clock and requires navigation using a map is a type of orienteering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have to go to the starting point and go 150 feet at 117 degrees and you will find a decon.</groundspeak:long_description>

We decided rather late in the day that we would try to get as many icons as we could. We had the MOGA Mega, a CITO, Earth Cache and of course traditional when we arrived here. Was hoping this one wouldn't be too puzzling... we followed the GPSr to ground zero and I stood with my iPhone and the compass pointed us right to the cache. An instant find was made, GuitarMan24 skipped some rocks off the lake, and coupleofbucks and iowa2asia teamed up to get the log signed. Off to get a multi cache and a letterbox hybrid!

GuitarMan24, iowa2asia, coupleofbucks and I had the MOGA Mega, a CITO, Earth Cache and of course traditional and had just done the &quot;Orienteering&quot; puzzle and &quot;Boating on The Lake&quot; multi-cache nearby. Glad to see all these letterbox hybrids nearby so that we could add that icon as well. Very nice set of letterbox caches! We added the flash mob MOGA event later in the evening to give us a total of 8 cache type icons for the day. Not bad considering we only had two at 4:00 and three at 6:00. Had a great time at MOGA, thanks to all who made it possible!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Letterboxing is an intriguing “treasure hunt” style outdoor activity. Letterboxers hide small, weatherproof boxes in publicly-accessible places (like parks) and post clues to finding the box online on one of several Web sites. However, clues to finding some of the most highly-sought boxes are passed around by word of mouth. There are about 20,000 letterboxes hidden in North America alone. Individual letterboxes usually contain a log book, an often hand-carved rubber stamp and may contain an ink pad. Finders make an imprint of the letterbox's stamp on their personal log book, and leave an imprint of their personal stamp on the letterbox's logbook .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Letterboxing is said to have started in England in 1854 when a Dartmoor National Park guide, James Perrott of Chagford, left a bottle by Cranmere Pool with his calling card in it an an invitation to those who found the bottle to add theirs. Eventually, visitors began leaving a self-addressed post card or note in the jar, hoping for them to be returned by mail by the next visitor (thus the origin of the term “letterboxing;” “letterbox” is a British term for a mailbox). This practice ended in time, however, and the current custom of using rubber stamps and visitor’s log books came into use. It caught on in the US in 1998 after an article in Smithsonian magazine.</groundspeak:long_description>

We decided rather late in the day that we would try to get as many icons as we could. GuitarMan24, iowa2asia, coupleofbucks and I had the MOGA Mega, a CITO, Earth Cache and of course traditional and had just done the &quot;Orienteering&quot; puzzle and &quot;Boating on The Lake&quot; multi-cache nearby. Glad to see all these letterbox hybrids nearby so that we could add that icon as well. Very nice set of letterbox caches! We added the flash mob MOGA event later in the evening to give us a total of 8 cache type icons for the day. Not bad considering we only had two at 4:00 and three at 6:00. Had a great time at MOGA, thanks to all who made it possible!

We made our way to MOGA with Trekkie79, louinliberty, debrajean and kickrobo.  We signed most of our logs as KCHB.  This was one of many on our super day that we found.  Thanks so much for being a part of our first MOGA.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

It was great to bounce into the cache owner at MOGA and thank them for all of their great caches out here.  I’ve done quite a few before on a previous trip, but even with this effort, I’m still going to have quite a few to mop up.  I’ll likely never get them all!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

It was great to bounce into the cache owner at MOGA and thank them for all of their great caches out here.  I’ve done quite a few before on a previous trip, but even with this effort, I’m still going to have quite a few to mop up.  I’ll likely never get them all!</groundspeak:text>

The results of these alerts have left me thinking that I might need to come up early to MOGA to get some back road caching done.  Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

It may be made of rubber or rubber-like material such as vinyl plastic (which is more often used). The yellow rubber duck has achieved an iconic status in Western pop culture and is often symbolically linked to bathing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the ubiquitous yellow rubber duck with which most people are familiar, there have been numerous variations on the basic theme, including holiday-themed duckies, animal-shaped duckies, religious duckies, dragon duckies, &quot;Devil Duckies&quot; which sport demon-like horns, bride and groom ducks, &quot;dead&quot; ducks, royalty ducks, pirate ducks, Walt Disney themed ducks, historical figure-themed ducks, pink breast cancer awareness ducks, rubber ducks with water activated LED lights, and character ducks representing professions, politicians or licensed individual celebrities. There are also ducks that glow in the dark, change colour, or have a wind-up engine that enables them to &quot;swim&quot;. In 2001, The Sun, a British tabloid newspaper reported that Queen Elizabeth II has a rubber duck in her bathroom that wears an inflatable crown.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’ve been monitoring the area for newly published caches for quite some time.  The results of these alerts have left me thinking that I might need to come up early to MOGA to get some back road caching done.  Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’ve been monitoring the area for newly published caches for quite some time.  The results of these alerts have left me thinking that I might need to come up early to MOGA to get some back road caching done.  Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

It may be made of rubber or rubber-like material such as vinyl plastic (which is more often used). The yellow rubber duck has achieved an iconic status in Western pop culture and is often symbolically linked to bathing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the ubiquitous yellow rubber duck with which most people are familiar, there have been numerous variations on the basic theme, including holiday-themed duckies, animal-shaped duckies, religious duckies, dragon duckies, &quot;Devil Duckies&quot; which sport demon-like horns, bride and groom ducks, &quot;dead&quot; ducks, royalty ducks, pirate ducks, Walt Disney themed ducks, historical figure-themed ducks, pink breast cancer awareness ducks, rubber ducks with water activated LED lights, and character ducks representing professions, politicians or licensed individual celebrities. There are also ducks that glow in the dark, change colour, or have a wind-up engine that enables them to &quot;swim&quot;. In 2001, The Sun, a British tabloid newspaper reported that Queen Elizabeth II has a rubber duck in her bathroom that wears an inflatable crown.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A rubber duck is a toy shaped like a stylised Yellow-billed Duck , and is generally yellow with a flat base. It may be made of rubber or rubber-like material such as vinyl plastic (which is more often used). The yellow rubber duck has achieved an iconic status in Western pop culture and is often symbolically linked to bathing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the ubiquitous yellow rubber duck with which most people are familiar, there have been numerous variations on the basic theme, including holiday-themed duckies, animal-shaped duckies, religious duckies, dragon duckies, &quot;Devil Duckies&quot; which sport demon-like horns, bride and groom ducks, &quot;dead&quot; ducks, royalty ducks, pirate ducks, Walt Disney themed ducks, historical figure-themed ducks, pink breast cancer awareness ducks, rubber ducks with water activated LED lights, and character ducks representing professions, politicians or licensed individual celebrities. There are also ducks that glow in the dark, change colour, or have a wind-up engine that enables them to &quot;swim&quot;. In 2001, The Sun, a British tabloid newspaper reported that Queen Elizabeth II has a rubber duck in her bathroom that wears an inflatable crown.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’ve been monitoring the area for newly published caches for quite some time.  The results of these alerts have left me thinking that I might need to come up early to MOGA to get some back road caching done.  Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

The yellow rubber duck has achieved an iconic status in Western pop culture and is often symbolically linked to bathing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the ubiquitous yellow rubber duck with which most people are familiar, there have been numerous variations on the basic theme, including holiday-themed duckies, animal-shaped duckies, religious duckies, dragon duckies, &quot;Devil Duckies&quot; which sport demon-like horns, bride and groom ducks, &quot;dead&quot; ducks, royalty ducks, pirate ducks, Walt Disney themed ducks, historical figure-themed ducks, pink breast cancer awareness ducks, rubber ducks with water activated LED lights, and character ducks representing professions, politicians or licensed individual celebrities. There are also ducks that glow in the dark, change colour, or have a wind-up engine that enables them to &quot;swim&quot;. In 2001, The Sun, a British tabloid newspaper reported that Queen Elizabeth II has a rubber duck in her bathroom that wears an inflatable crown.</groundspeak:long_description>

The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.

I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

It was great to bounce into the cache owner at MOGA and thank them for all of their great caches out here.  I’ve done quite a few before on a previous trip, but even with this effort, I’m still going to have quite a few to mop up.  I’ll likely never get them all!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

It was great to bounce into the cache owner at MOGA and thank them for all of their great caches out here.  I’ve done quite a few before on a previous trip, but even with this effort, I’m still going to have quite a few to mop up.  I’ll likely never get them all!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A rubber duck is a toy shaped like a stylised Yellow-billed Duck , and is generally yellow with a flat base. It may be made of rubber or rubber-like material such as vinyl plastic (which is more often used). The yellow rubber duck has achieved an iconic status in Western pop culture and is often symbolically linked to bathing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the ubiquitous yellow rubber duck with which most people are familiar, there have been numerous variations on the basic theme, including holiday-themed duckies, animal-shaped duckies, religious duckies, dragon duckies, &quot;Devil Duckies&quot; which sport demon-like horns, bride and groom ducks, &quot;dead&quot; ducks, royalty ducks, pirate ducks, Walt Disney themed ducks, historical figure-themed ducks, pink breast cancer awareness ducks, rubber ducks with water activated LED lights, and character ducks representing professions, politicians or licensed individual celebrities. There are also ducks that glow in the dark, change colour, or have a wind-up engine that enables them to &quot;swim&quot;. In 2001, The Sun, a British tabloid newspaper reported that Queen Elizabeth II has a rubber duck in her bathroom that wears an inflatable crown.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The 1970s, pronounced &quot;the Nineteen Seventies&quot;, was the decade that started on January 1, 1970, and ended on December 31, 1979.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Western world, social progressive values that began in the 1960s, such as increasing political awareness and political and economic liberty of women, continued to grow. The hippie culture, which started in the latter half of the 1960s, waned by the early 1970s and faded towards the middle part of the decade, which involved opposition to the Vietnam War, opposition to nuclear weapons, the advocacy of world peace, and hostility to the authority of government and big business. The environmentalist movement began to increase dramatically in this period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Industrialized countries, except Japan, experienced an economic recession due to an oil crisis caused by oil embargoes by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. The crisis saw the first instance of stagflation which began a political and economic trend of the replacement of Keynesian economic theory with neoliberal economic theory, in with the first neoliberal governments being created in Chile, where a military coup led by Augusto Pinochet took place in 1973, and in the United Kingdom with the 1979 elections resulting in the victory of its Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher in 1979.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novelist Tom Wolfe coined the term Me decade in his article &quot;The &quot;Me&quot; Decade and the Third Great Awakening&quot;, published by New York magazine in August 1976 referring to the 1970s. The term describes a general new attitude of Americans towards atomized individualism and away from communitarianism in clear contrast with the 1960s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wolfe attributes disappearance of the &quot;proletariat&quot; with the appearance of the &quot;lower middle class&quot;, citing the economic boom of Post-War America as affording the average American a sort of self determination and individuation that ran alongside economic prosperity. Wolfe describes this abandoning of communal, left, and New Deal politics as &quot;taking the money and running.&quot; He traces the preoccupation with one's self back to the aristocrat. The nature of the &quot;chivalric tradition&quot; and the philosophy behind &quot;the finishing school&quot; are inherently dedicated to the building and forming of personal character and conduct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The attitude of the counter-culture of the 1960s and The New Left promoted a recovery of the self in the wave, of what was deemed, a flawed, corrupt, and almost fascistic, America. This philosophy left the 1970s with the promise that the use LSD or acid unveiled the true and the real self. Wolfe describes the revelatory experience of hallucinogens as attenuating the ecstatic religious experience, transforming the religious climate in American. Chronicling the First and Second Great Awakenings, Wolfe comes to describe the &quot;Me decade as the &quot;Third Great Awakening.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Asia, affairs regarding the People's Republic of China changed significantly following the recognition of the PRC by the United Nations, the death of Mao Zedong and the beginning of market liberalization by Mao's successors. Despite facing an oil crisis due to the OPEC embargo, the economy of Japan witnessed a large boom in this period. The United States withdrew its military forces from their previous involvement in the Vietnam War which had grown enormously unpopular. In 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan which led to an ongoing war for ten years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1970s saw an initial increase in violence in the Middle East as Egypt and Syria declared war on Israel, but in the late 1970s, the situation in the Middle East was fundamentally altered when Egypt signed the Egyptian–Israeli Peace Treaty. Anwar El Sadat, President of Egypt, was instrumental in the event and consequently became extremely unpopular in the Arab World and the wider Muslim world. He was assassinated in 1981. Political tensions in Iran exploded with the Iranian Revolution which overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty and established an Islamic republic of Iran.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The economies of much of the developing world continued to make steady progress in the early 1970s, because of the Green Revolution. They might have thrived and become stable in the way that Europe recovered after World War II through the Marshall Plan; however, their economic growth was slowed by the oil crisis but boomed immediately after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1977 Elvis died and this began decades of Elvis sightings. New York City had its famous blackout, Star Wars premiered, as well as Saturday Night Fever, and President Jimmy Carter officially pardoned all those who avoided the draft during the Vietnam War.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The 1970s, pronounced &quot;the Nineteen Seventies&quot;, was the decade that started on January 1, 1970, and ended on December 31, 1979.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Western world, social progressive values that began in the 1960s, such as increasing political awareness and political and economic liberty of women, continued to grow. The hippie culture, which started in the latter half of the 1960s, waned by the early 1970s and faded towards the middle part of the decade, which involved opposition to the Vietnam War, opposition to nuclear weapons, the advocacy of world peace, and hostility to the authority of government and big business. The environmentalist movement began to increase dramatically in this period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Industrialized countries, except Japan, experienced an economic recession due to an oil crisis caused by oil embargoes by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. The crisis saw the first instance of stagflation which began a political and economic trend of the replacement of Keynesian economic theory with neoliberal economic theory, in with the first neoliberal governments being created in Chile, where a military coup led by Augusto Pinochet took place in 1973, and in the United Kingdom with the 1979 elections resulting in the victory of its Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher in 1979.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novelist Tom Wolfe coined the term Me decade in his article &quot;The &quot;Me&quot; Decade and the Third Great Awakening&quot;, published by New York magazine in August 1976 referring to the 1970s. The term describes a general new attitude of Americans towards atomized individualism and away from communitarianism in clear contrast with the 1960s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wolfe attributes disappearance of the &quot;proletariat&quot; with the appearance of the &quot;lower middle class&quot;, citing the economic boom of Post-War America as affording the average American a sort of self determination and individuation that ran alongside economic prosperity. Wolfe describes this abandoning of communal, left, and New Deal politics as &quot;taking the money and running.&quot; He traces the preoccupation with one's self back to the aristocrat. The nature of the &quot;chivalric tradition&quot; and the philosophy behind &quot;the finishing school&quot; are inherently dedicated to the building and forming of personal character and conduct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The attitude of the counter-culture of the 1960s and The New Left promoted a recovery of the self in the wave, of what was deemed, a flawed, corrupt, and almost fascistic, America. This philosophy left the 1970s with the promise that the use LSD or acid unveiled the true and the real self. Wolfe describes the revelatory experience of hallucinogens as attenuating the ecstatic religious experience, transforming the religious climate in American. Chronicling the First and Second Great Awakenings, Wolfe comes to describe the &quot;Me decade as the &quot;Third Great Awakening.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Asia, affairs regarding the People's Republic of China changed significantly following the recognition of the PRC by the United Nations, the death of Mao Zedong and the beginning of market liberalization by Mao's successors. Despite facing an oil crisis due to the OPEC embargo, the economy of Japan witnessed a large boom in this period. The United States withdrew its military forces from their previous involvement in the Vietnam War which had grown enormously unpopular. In 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan which led to an ongoing war for ten years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1970s saw an initial increase in violence in the Middle East as Egypt and Syria declared war on Israel, but in the late 1970s, the situation in the Middle East was fundamentally altered when Egypt signed the Egyptian–Israeli Peace Treaty. Anwar El Sadat, President of Egypt, was instrumental in the event and consequently became extremely unpopular in the Arab World and the wider Muslim world. He was assassinated in 1981. Political tensions in Iran exploded with the Iranian Revolution which overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty and established an Islamic republic of Iran.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The economies of much of the developing world continued to make steady progress in the early 1970s, because of the Green Revolution. They might have thrived and become stable in the way that Europe recovered after World War II through the Marshall Plan; however, their economic growth was slowed by the oil crisis but boomed immediately after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1976 I escaped from high school. I graduated and was free from the indoctrination of public school BS. Four military academies; US Air Force, US Naval, US Military, and the US Coast Guard, admitted the first women. The artificial gene was introduced, Apple Computer was launched, CB radio’s popularity peaks, and Jimmy Carter became president.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The 1970s, pronounced &quot;the Nineteen Seventies&quot;, was the decade that started on January 1, 1970, and ended on December 31, 1979.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the Western world, social progressive values that began in the 1960s, such as increasing political awareness and political and economic liberty of women, continued to grow. The hippie culture, which started in the latter half of the 1960s, waned by the early 1970s and faded towards the middle part of the decade, which involved opposition to the Vietnam War, opposition to nuclear weapons, the advocacy of world peace, and hostility to the authority of government and big business. The environmentalist movement began to increase dramatically in this period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Industrialized countries, except Japan, experienced an economic recession due to an oil crisis caused by oil embargoes by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. The crisis saw the first instance of stagflation which began a political and economic trend of the replacement of Keynesian economic theory with neoliberal economic theory, in with the first neoliberal governments being created in Chile, where a military coup led by Augusto Pinochet took place in 1973, and in the United Kingdom with the 1979 elections resulting in the victory of its Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher in 1979.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novelist Tom Wolfe coined the term Me decade in his article &quot;The &quot;Me&quot; Decade and the Third Great Awakening&quot;, published by New York magazine in August 1976 referring to the 1970s. The term describes a general new attitude of Americans towards atomized individualism and away from communitarianism in clear contrast with the 1960s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wolfe attributes disappearance of the &quot;proletariat&quot; with the appearance of the &quot;lower middle class&quot;, citing the economic boom of Post-War America as affording the average American a sort of self determination and individuation that ran alongside economic prosperity. Wolfe describes this abandoning of communal, left, and New Deal politics as &quot;taking the money and running.&quot; He traces the preoccupation with one's self back to the aristocrat. The nature of the &quot;chivalric tradition&quot; and the philosophy behind &quot;the finishing school&quot; are inherently dedicated to the building and forming of personal character and conduct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The attitude of the counter-culture of the 1960s and The New Left promoted a recovery of the self in the wave, of what was deemed, a flawed, corrupt, and almost fascistic, America. This philosophy left the 1970s with the promise that the use LSD or acid unveiled the true and the real self. Wolfe describes the revelatory experience of hallucinogens as attenuating the ecstatic religious experience, transforming the religious climate in American. Chronicling the First and Second Great Awakenings, Wolfe comes to describe the &quot;Me decade as the &quot;Third Great Awakening.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Asia, affairs regarding the People's Republic of China changed significantly following the recognition of the PRC by the United Nations, the death of Mao Zedong and the beginning of market liberalization by Mao's successors. Despite facing an oil crisis due to the OPEC embargo, the economy of Japan witnessed a large boom in this period. The United States withdrew its military forces from their previous involvement in the Vietnam War which had grown enormously unpopular. In 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan which led to an ongoing war for ten years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1970s saw an initial increase in violence in the Middle East as Egypt and Syria declared war on Israel, but in the late 1970s, the situation in the Middle East was fundamentally altered when Egypt signed the Egyptian–Israeli Peace Treaty. Anwar El Sadat, President of Egypt, was instrumental in the event and consequently became extremely unpopular in the Arab World and the wider Muslim world. He was assassinated in 1981. Political tensions in Iran exploded with the Iranian Revolution which overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty and established an Islamic republic of Iran.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The economies of much of the developing world continued to make steady progress in the early 1970s, because of the Green Revolution. They might have thrived and become stable in the way that Europe recovered after World War II through the Marshall Plan; however, their economic growth was slowed by the oil crisis but boomed immediately after.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1972 marked the first release of electronic games. America welcomed PONG! Meanwhile, George Wallace was shot while campaigning, the last mission to the moon happened, Federal Express was founded, and the book, Joy of Sex, was released. Believe it or not e-mail was invented; Mark Spitz won seven gold medals while the Watergate scandal began. Speaking of Watergate, the first FBI female agent was hired and women’s rights continued to grow.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Some towns all I could find were post office information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RED CEDAR MILLS. A post office from 1853 to 1856 in the central part of Liberty Township.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HAMAKER'S. A post office in the southern part of section 2, Liberty Township, as appears on maps of 1868 and 1869.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EVERIST. A coal mining village in section 17, Liberty Township. Post office, 1905-14.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like many other states in America’s Heartland, Iowa is exceptionally rich in ghost towns.  What caused so many towns to die?  In general, the number one ghost town creator is failure of the town’s economy.  That failure can be caused by many factors, but the three major triggers were: agriculture, mining and railroads. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AGRICULTURE – As transportation methods improved in the mid-1900s, it was easy to hop in the family car or truck and drive to a larger town where shopping choices were better.  This led to a gradual slowdown in business in the local communities.  When major discount department stores expanded nationwide beginning in the 1960s, the mom &amp; pop stores couldn’t compete, and began to fold.  Also many farm families would sell out at retirement, and the farms would be taken over by major agricultural conglomerates, which because of mechanized farming, had no need for the little towns, which would then fade into oblivion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MINING – Coal mining throughout Iowa contributed hundreds of small coal mining camps and larger company towns.  As mining declined in the post-WW II years, these mining camps either had to transform their economies or perish.  Most took the later route and disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAILROADS – There were three categories of ghosts created by the railroads.  &lt;br/&gt;Temporary construction camps that would move as tracks progressed across the countryside.  They often had large transient populations of workers and others who tried to provide diversions to liberate money from the workers.  &lt;br/&gt;•Railroad stations.  When trains switched from coal to diesel fuel the need for water stops and coal refilling stations declined.  Also, as agricultural communities began fading in the mid 20th Century, the need for many railroad shipping centers in rural also faded.  The need for stations also declined as other transportation methods carried people. &lt;br/&gt;•Relocation of towns occurred when railroads would come through the area, but miss an established town by a mile or more.  Often the townsfolk would pack up the town and relocate it to the railroad, leaving the old site abandoned</groundspeak:long_description>

When major discount department stores expanded nationwide beginning in the 1960s, the mom &amp; pop stores couldn’t compete, and began to fold.  Also many farm families would sell out at retirement, and the farms would be taken over by major agricultural conglomerates, which because of mechanized farming, had no need for the little towns, which would then fade into oblivion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MINING – Coal mining throughout Iowa contributed hundreds of small coal mining camps and larger company towns.  As mining declined in the post-WW II years, these mining camps either had to transform their economies or perish.  Most took the later route and disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAILROADS – There were three categories of ghosts created by the railroads.  &lt;br/&gt;•Temporary construction camps that would move as tracks progressed across the countryside.  They often had large transient populations of workers and others who tried to provide diversions to liberate money from the workers.  &lt;br/&gt;•Railroad stations.  When trains switched from coal to diesel fuel the need for water stops and coal refilling stations declined.  Also, as agricultural communities began fading in the mid 20th Century, the need for many railroad shipping centers in rural also faded.  The need for stations also declined as other transportation methods carried people. &lt;br/&gt;•Relocation of towns occurred when railroads would come through the area, but miss an established town by a mile or more.  Often the townsfolk would pack up the town and relocate it to the railroad, leaving the old site abandoned</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Well, I left Kentucky back in '49 An' went to Detroit workin' on a 'sembly line The first year they had me puttin' wheels on cadillacs Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry 'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black. One day I devised myself a plan That should be the envy of most any man I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand. CHORUS I'd get it one piece at a time And it wouldn't cost me a dime You'll know it's me when I come through your town I'm gonna ride around in style I'm gonna drive everybody wild 'Cause I'll have the only one there is a round. So the very next day when I punched in With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends I left that day with a lunch box full of gears Now, I never considered myself a thief GM wouldn't miss just one little piece Especially if I strung it out over several years. The first day I got me a fuel pump And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk Then I got me a transmission and all of the chrome The little things I could get in my big lunchbox Like nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home. Now, up to now my plan went all right 'Til we tried to put it all together one night And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong. The transmission was a '53 And the motor turned out to be a (-4 = D,E) And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone. So we drilled it out so that it would fit And with a little bit of help with an A-daptor kit We had that engine runnin' just like a song Now the headlight' was another sight We had two on the left and one on the right But when we pulled out the switch all ( A) of 'em come on. The back end looked kinda funny too But we put it together and when we got thru Well, that's when we noticed that we only had (x2=f) tail-fin About that time my wife walked out And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts But she opened the door and said &quot;Honey, take me for a spin.&quot; So we drove up town just to get the tags And I headed her right on down main drag I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around But up there at the court house they didn't laugh 'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff And when they got through the title weighed (C,B) pounds. CHORUS I got it one piece at a time And it didn't cost me a dime You'll know it's me when I come through your town I'm gonna ride around in style I'm gonna drive everybody wild 'Cause I'll have the only one there is around. (Spoken) Ugh! Yow, RED RYDER This is the COTTON MOUTH In the PSYCHO-BILLY CADILLAC Come on Huh, This is the COTTON MOUTH And negatory on the cost of this mow-chine there RED RYDER You might say I went right up to the factory And picked it up, it's cheaper that way Ugh!, what model is it? Well, It's a '49, '50, '51, '52, '53, '54, '55, '56 '57, '58' 59' automobile It's a '60, '61, '62, '63, '64, '65, '66, '67 '68, '69, '70 automobile.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">EVERIST A coal mining camp two miles north of Marysville, in the southeastern corner of the county. A post office was established May 20, 1905 and discontinued October 15, 1918.  The camp was never platted, but in 194 had 300 people and the Everist Mercantile Company (general store), the post office, a 5-teacher school and a telephone exchange. &lt;br/&gt;Latitude: 41.2097234 / 41° 12' 35&quot; N &lt;br/&gt;Longitude: -92.9613122 / 92° 57' 41&quot; W&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like many other states in America’s Heartland, Iowa is exceptionally rich in ghost towns.  What caused so many towns to die?  In general, the number one ghost town creator is failure of the town’s economy.  That failure can be caused by many factors, but the three major triggers were: agriculture, mining and railroads. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AGRICULTURE – As transportation methods improved in the mid-1900s, it was easy to hop in the family car or truck and drive to a larger town where shopping choices were better.  This led to a gradual slowdown in business in the local communities.  When major discount department stores expanded nationwide beginning in the 1960s, the mom &amp; pop stores couldn’t compete, and began to fold.  Also many farm families would sell out at retirement, and the farms would be taken over by major agricultural conglomerates, which because of mechanized farming, had no need for the little towns, which would then fade into oblivion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MINING – Coal mining throughout Iowa contributed hundreds of small coal mining camps and larger company towns.  As mining declined in the post-WW II years, these mining camps either had to transform their economies or perish.  Most took the later route and disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAILROADS – There were three categories of ghosts created by the railroads.  &lt;br/&gt;•	Temporary construction camps that would move as tracks progressed across the countryside.  They often had large transient populations of workers and others who tried to provide diversions to liberate money from the workers.  &lt;br/&gt;•	Railroad stations.  When trains switched from coal to diesel fuel the need for water stops and coal refilling stations declined.  Also, as agricultural communities began fading in the mid 20th Century, the need for many railroad shipping centers in rural also faded.  The need for stations also declined as other transportation methods carried people. &lt;br/&gt;•	Relocation of towns occurred when railroads would come through the area, but miss an established town by a mile or more.  Often the townsfolk would pack up the town and relocate it to the railroad, leaving the old site abandoned</groundspeak:long_description>

The town was platted November 17, 1881, and consisted of 228 lots along three main east-west trending streets.  It is were 200 people, express office with telegraph, a general store and a school. &lt;br/&gt;Latitude: 41° 27' 00&quot; N &lt;br/&gt;Longitude: 93° 09' 26&quot; W&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like many other states in America’s Heartland, Iowa is exceptionally rich in ghost towns.  What caused so many towns to die?  In general, the number one ghost town creator is failure of the town’s economy.  That failure can be caused by many factors, but the three major triggers were: agriculture, mining and railroads. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AGRICULTURE – As transportation methods improved in the mid-1900s, it was easy to hop in the family car or truck and drive to a larger town where shopping choices were better.  This led to a gradual slowdown in business in the local communities.  When major discount department stores expanded nationwide beginning in the 1960s, the mom &amp; pop stores couldn’t compete, and began to fold.  Also many farm families would sell out at retirement, and the farms would be taken over by major agricultural conglomerates, which because of mechanized farming, had no need for the little towns, which would then fade into oblivion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MINING – Coal mining throughout Iowa contributed hundreds of small coal mining camps and larger company towns.  As mining declined in the post-WW II years, these mining camps either had to transform their economies or perish.  Most took the later route and disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAILROADS – There were three categories of ghosts created by the railroads.  &lt;br/&gt;•Temporary construction camps that would move as tracks progressed across the countryside.  They often had large transient populations of workers and others who tried to provide diversions to liberate money from the workers.  &lt;br/&gt;•Railroad stations.  When trains switched from coal to diesel fuel the need for water stops and coal refilling stations declined.  Also, as agricultural communities began fading in the mid 20th Century, the need for many railroad shipping centers in rural also faded.  The need for stations also declined as other transportation methods carried people. &lt;br/&gt;•Relocation of towns occurred when railroads would come through the area, but miss an established town by a mile or more.  Often the townsfolk would pack up the town and relocate it to the railroad, leaving the old site abandoned</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">POPLAR GROVE. Listed as a post office in Marion County from 1856 to 1857, but not located on the maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like many other states in America’s Heartland, Iowa is exceptionally rich in ghost towns.  What caused so many towns to die?  In general, the number one ghost town creator is failure of the town’s economy.  That failure can be caused by many factors, but the three major triggers were: agriculture, mining and railroads. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AGRICULTURE – As transportation methods improved in the mid-1900s, it was easy to hop in the family car or truck and drive to a larger town where shopping choices were better.  This led to a gradual slowdown in business in the local communities.  When major discount department stores expanded nationwide beginning in the 1960s, the mom &amp; pop stores couldn’t compete, and began to fold.  Also many farm families would sell out at retirement, and the farms would be taken over by major agricultural conglomerates, which because of mechanized farming, had no need for the little towns, which would then fade into oblivion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MINING – Coal mining throughout Iowa contributed hundreds of small coal mining camps and larger company towns.  As mining declined in the post-WW II years, these mining camps either had to transform their economies or perish.  Most took the later route and disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAILROADS – There were three categories of ghosts created by the railroads.  &lt;br/&gt;•	Temporary construction camps that would move as tracks progressed across the countryside.  They often had large transient populations of workers and others who tried to provide diversions to liberate money from the workers.  &lt;br/&gt;•	Railroad stations.  When trains switched from coal to diesel fuel the need for water stops and coal refilling stations declined.  Also, as agricultural communities began fading in the mid 20th Century, the need for many railroad shipping centers in rural also faded.  The need for stations also declined as other transportation methods carried people. &lt;br/&gt;•	Relocation of towns occurred when railroads would come through the area, but miss an established town by a mile or more.  Often the townsfolk would pack up the town and relocate it to the railroad, leaving the old site abandoned</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Soft Shell Turtles are one of the more unique species that you’re going to find and they’re a great addition to your pond. They get their name from their soft shell structure, which lacks spiny scutes common in most other species. Their shell actually has a leathery feel to it and is light and somewhat flexible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This aquatic species is very active underwater. Like most aquatic species it’s only capable of swallowing its food when it’s submerged. They love to eat small fish and insects, but they also enjoy turtle pellets as well. Their elongated, snorkel-like nostrils make them one of the most unique-looking and interesting aquatic turtles you’ll ever see. They thrive in warmer climates and will give you years of joy observing! If you have any questions about caring for your Soft Shell turtle, please contact our turtle care experts!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Snapping Turtle is the largest species of turtle native to the United States. Their sinister look and reputation have made them perhaps the most well-known turtle species throughout the world. They’re native to regions as far north as Canada and as far south as Ecuador. Snapping Turtles are a very interesting species that will thrive and rule over any pond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Snapping Turtles defend themselves with their powerful jaws, rather than retreating to their shells like most species. Primarily carnivorous, the Snapping Turtle will eat just about anything. They’ll spend their days wallowing in the muddy bottom of your pond just waiting to snap up their next meal. These turtles get big and will give you years of enjoyment observing them and watching how they behave in their natural habitat.</groundspeak:long_description>

Laid out as a town in 1858 in the northeast quarter of the north section 23, Lake Prairie Township, on the south side of South Skunk River, four miles north of Pella. Never built up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LUCAS GROVE. A hamlet in the northwestern part of section 21, Union Township, about three miles north of the present railroad station of Donley. Post office, 1874-82.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like many other states in America’s Heartland, Iowa is exceptionally rich in ghost towns.  What caused so many towns to die?  In general, the number one ghost town creator is failure of the town’s economy.  That failure can be caused by many factors, but the three major triggers were: agriculture, mining and railroads. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AGRICULTURE – As transportation methods improved in the mid-1900s, it was easy to hop in the family car or truck and drive to a larger town where shopping choices were better.  This led to a gradual slowdown in business in the local communities.  When major discount department stores expanded nationwide beginning in the 1960s, the mom &amp; pop stores couldn’t compete, and began to fold.  Also many farm families would sell out at retirement, and the farms would be taken over by major agricultural conglomerates, which because of mechanized farming, had no need for the little towns, which would then fade into oblivion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MINING – Coal mining throughout Iowa contributed hundreds of small coal mining camps and larger company towns.  As mining declined in the post-WW II years, these mining camps either had to transform their economies or perish.  Most took the later route and disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAILROADS – There were three categories of ghosts created by the railroads.  &lt;br/&gt;•	Temporary construction camps that would move as tracks progressed across the countryside.  They often had large transient populations of workers and others who tried to provide diversions to liberate money from the workers.  &lt;br/&gt;•	Railroad stations.  When trains switched from coal to diesel fuel the need for water stops and coal refilling stations declined.  Also, as agricultural communities began fading in the mid 20th Century, the need for many railroad shipping centers in rural also faded.  The need for stations also declined as other transportation methods carried people. &lt;br/&gt;•	Relocation of towns occurred when railroads would come through the area, but miss an established town by a mile or more.  Often the townsfolk would pack up the town and relocate it to the railroad, leaving the old site abandoned</groundspeak:long_description>

When ordering the assorted pack you will receive one each of the Starfire Red, Electric Green and Sunburst Orange! GloFish are not dyed and their color, which is inherited from their parents, does not fade! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original generations of GloFish were genetically enhanced as embryos to help detect environmental pollutants and advance scientific research. Now every generation of GloFish is born with its amazing color! The brilliant hues are produced by a fluorescent protein gene which occurs naturally in some marine organisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keeping GloFish is as easy as keeping Danios. For best care, keep this peaceful fish by themselves in small aquariums or in small schools with equally non-aggressive fish. Since they are omnivores, feed GloFish a varied diet of flake and frozen foods.</groundspeak:long_description>

The •name first given the present village of Dallas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like many other states in America’s Heartland, Iowa is exceptionally rich in ghost towns.  What caused so many towns to die?  In general, the number one ghost town creator is failure of the town’s economy.  That failure can be caused by many factors, but the three major triggers were: agriculture, mining and railroads. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AGRICULTURE – As transportation methods improved in the mid-1900s, it was easy to hop in the family car or truck and drive to a larger town where shopping choices were better.  This led to a gradual slowdown in business in the local communities.  When major discount department stores expanded nationwide beginning in the 1960s, the mom &amp; pop stores couldn’t compete, and began to fold.  Also many farm families would sell out at retirement, and the farms would be taken over by major agricultural conglomerates, which because of mechanized farming, had no need for the little towns, which would then fade into oblivion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MINING – Coal mining throughout Iowa contributed hundreds of small coal mining camps and larger company towns.  As mining declined in the post-WW II years, these mining camps either had to transform their economies or perish.  Most took the later route and disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAILROADS – There were three categories of ghosts created by the railroads.  &lt;br/&gt;•	Temporary construction camps that would move as tracks progressed across the countryside.  They often had large transient populations of workers and others who tried to provide diversions to liberate money from the workers.  &lt;br/&gt;•	Railroad stations.  When trains switched from coal to diesel fuel the need for water stops and coal refilling stations declined.  Also, as agricultural communities began fading in the mid 20th Century, the need for many railroad shipping centers in rural also faded.  The need for stations also declined as other transportation methods carried people. &lt;br/&gt;•	Relocation of towns occurred when railroads would come through the area, but miss an established town by a mile or more.  Often the townsfolk would pack up the town and relocate it to the railroad, leaving the old site abandoned</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Central American Wood Turtles are native to southern Mexico and Central America. They are omnivorous and love turtle pellets but it’s also important that they get vegetation to supplement their diets which will change as they age. In their natural habitat they spend most of their time on land, in rainforests, near sources of fresh waters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Central American Wood Turtles are nice beginner turtles because they are fairly easy to care for. They are shy, but friendly turtles and will require a large tank if you plan to keep them indoors. Their markings are beautiful, unique and vivid. They love the warmth and will spend a lot of their time basking in the hot sun so you can enjoy their beauty!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Electric Blue African Cichlid creates a gorgeous, colorful focal point in the freshwater aquarium. It has the typical sleek, bullet-shaped body common to the Cichlidae family. The active Electric Blue African Cichlid seems equally content guarding its territory or perusing the perimeter of your aquarium. &lt;br/&gt;Sciaenochromis fryeri does well with other Lake Malawi cichlids when provided with a spacious aquarium of 70 gallons or more with ample rockwork. Although extraneous for the Electric Blue African Cichlid, aquatic plants may be beneficial for other aquarium inhabitants. Keep in mind that Electric Blue African Cichlids larger than three inches will often uproot live plants. The Electric Blue African Cichlid can and probably will be aggressive toward smaller fish. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Considered a specialized mouth brooder, eggs of the Electric Blue African Cichlid are fertilized and carried by the female. Within 12 to 18 days, fry are released, measuring 1/4 inch. Once released, the Electric Blue African Cichlid fry do not return to their mother again. Most members of the mouth brooding variety of African Cichlids are easily bred in the home aquarium when given the proper aquarium setup and excellent water conditions. A small group of five to seven females and one male will provide the best opportunities for breeding the Electric Blue African Cichlid. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Electric Blue Cichlid needs meaty foods such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, and small fish.</groundspeak:long_description>

This semi-aquatic species has webbed feet, making them excellent swimmers who need nice deep water for swimming. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their pale orange heads are marked with faint black spots and typically have a grey-brown carapace with a serrated rear edge. Giant Asian Pond Turtles are omnivorous that really enjoy munching on water plants, fruits, small invertebrates and our turtle pellets. In their natural habitats, Giant Asian Pond turtles thrive in rivers, streams, lakes and swamps. It’s important that the habitat you create mimic their natural habitats as much as possible.</groundspeak:long_description>

As mining declined in the post-WW II years, these mining camps either had to transform their economies or perish.

They often had large transient populations of workers and others who tried to provide diversions to liberate money from the workers.  &lt;br/&gt;•	Railroad stations.  When trains switched from coal to diesel fuel the need for water stops and coal refilling stations declined.  Also, as agricultural communities began fading in the mid 20th Century, the need for many railroad shipping centers in rural also faded.  The need for stations also declined as other transportation methods carried people. &lt;br/&gt;•	Relocation of towns occurred when railroads would come through the area, but miss an established town by a mile or more.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Crown Tail Betta has a striking, elaborate tail that differentiates it from other Bettas. The Crown Tail has a teardrop shape to its tail while the Twin Tail is split, almost giving the suggestion of having two tails. The Crown Tail Betta is a type of &quot;Siamese&quot; Fighting Fish. These fish have been bred over the years to enhance the fins and remarkable variety of colors of the males, as well as making them increasingly combative. Therefore, only one male should be kept in a tank; however, smaller, shorter-finned females may be housed together with caution. In addition, a male and a female should only be housed together temporarily for breeding purposes. Females can be as colorful as the males, although, they rarely have the long finnage that is seen with the males.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ideal environment for the Betta is a well-filtered aquarium that holds a steady temperature of between 75° and 86°F. Though the Betta is often sold in small bowls in department stores, for best care, Betta splendens should be kept singly in aquariums of at least 1 gallon. It also prefers a variety of hiding places amongst the foliage of freshwater plants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Betta can be bred in the home aquarium. For breeding purposes, males and females can be temporarily housed together. Once laid by the female, the eggs are placed inside a bubblenest and tended by the male Betta. Fry appear in about 24 hours and must be fed very small food initially, such as crushed or powdered flakes and newly hatched brine shrimp. Fry will also take finely chopped hard-boiled egg yolk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Provide the Betta with a carnivore diet consisting of a quality flake food, frozen or freeze dried bloodworms and brine shrimp.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The American Flagfish is an undemanding Killifish that is highly sought after for its algae-managing services. If that is not reason enough to acquire this hardy and interesting New World Killifish, the unique marking and color pattern is sure to win you over. It is not difficult to see why this Killifish is named after the American flag. Alternating horizontal stripes of red and creamy green stretch across the body and iridescent scales sparkle like stars on the blue anterior of the American Flagfish. This wonderful piscine Star-Spangled Banner is sure to capture the imagination of hobbyists and onlookers alike. &lt;br/&gt;The American Flagfish fish originates from still and slow-moving marshes, swamps, lakes, and ponds from Florida south to the Yucatan Peninsula. Provided with proper water quality, the American Flagfish can adapt to a variety of water conditions. The American Flagfish is a great addition to community aquariums, planted aquariums, cool-water aquariums, or even small outdoor ponds. The ideal aquarium environment for the American Flagfish should include driftwood, roots, and rocks for ample hiding places. Dense planting along the sides and rear of the aquarium and finish with a cover of floating plants. Be sure to leave an open swimming area in the center of the aquarium. To help bring out the best coloration in the American Flagfish, consider using dark substrate. The female American Flagfish is larger, more full bodied, and tends to be more yellow in coloration than the male. The dorsal fin of the male American Flagfish will tend to be more ornate and the body is more olive-green in coloration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American Flagfish will accept most live foods such as brine shrimp, white worms, tubifex, and some commercially prepared flake and frozen foods. If sufficient algae is not present in the aquarium, supplement the diet of the American Flagfish with prepared algae flake food or algae tablets.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Green Cobra Guppy is also called the Millions Fish and sometimes, simply the Guppy. It is one of the color variations of Poecilia reticulata guppy. The hardiness of the Green Cobra Guppy, as well as the fact that it matures quickly makes it an excellent fish for beginning hobbyists. The Green Cobra male has a vibrant green body with a snakeskin pattern. The tail fin is patterned with yellow and black. &lt;br/&gt;The Green Cobra Guppy requires a tank with at least 20 gallons of water, and is very tolerant of changing tank conditions. Plants should be hardy varieties such as Java Fern and Java Moss that can handle the increased hardness in the tank. Other peaceful fish would make good tank mates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The females in this pair are of an assorted variety; however, you can differentiate the males and females easily. The males are smaller in size, have brighter coloration, along with a bigger tail fin, and pointed anal fin. The females are larger in size with a duller coloration, have a rounded anal fin, as well as a pregnancy patch on the lower portion of the body. Ideally, the environment should have a covering of floating ferns and a breeding box to protect the fry. Adults may eat the fry if left to fend for themselves without the breeding box. The fry should be fed brine shrimp, micro food and pulverized flakes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Green Cobra Guppy is an omnivore and requires both algae-based foods as well as meaty foods. An algae-based flake food, along with freeze-dried bloodworms, tubifex, and brine shrimp will provide guppies with the proper nutrition.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Blue Paradise, also known as the Paradise Fish, is a brightly colored member of the Labyrinth Fish group. The body has alternating turquoise blue and orange stripes that extend into the fins and tail. There is a spot on the gills, and a pattern of dark scaling on the head reaching over the back and fading as it goes down the back. The fins and tail have a feather-like appearance, like that of a Betta. The Blue Paradise is a good jumper, so a tight fitting lid is a must. &lt;br/&gt;The Blue Paradise requires a larger aquarium, at least 30 gallons, with lots of hiding places for the female. It will not eat plants, but because of its active courtship and mock battles between tank mates, only very hardy vegetation is advised. The Blue Paradise is a territorial fish that will defend its area from its tank mates. For this reason, it should only be kept with other large, semi-aggressive fish. It will also eat smaller tank mates. Adult males should be kept one per aquarium, as they fight as fiercely as Bettas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The male Blue Paradise has much longer fins than the female and is more brightly colored. To induce spawning, reduce the water level and increase the temperature. The male will build a bubblenest beneath a large leaf where the eggs will be stored. Breeding is relatively easy, and spawning can result in up to 500 fry. When the fry are hatched they should be fed infusoria, and when older, brine shrimp. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blue Paradise is an omnivore and requires both algae-based foods as well as meaty foods. An algae-based flake food, along with freeze-dried bloodworms, tubifex, and brine shrimp will provide these fish with the proper nutrition.</groundspeak:long_description>

They are omnivorous .             Because they enjoy basking so much, its important that you purchase a nice UVB light source, and we offer a variety of those as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Golden Thread Turtles are native to swamps, ponds, lakes and rivers and can tolerate a wide temperature range. A submersible heater is recommended, but they can withstand cooler temperatures when kept in an outdoor pond. They should be kept indoors in climates with cold winters.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Tiger Pleco comes from the Amazon Basin of South America. It gets its name from the striped pattern it has on its body. Constant temperature and pH levels will help maintain this peaceful Plecostomus' health. Tiger Plecos make good additions to any community aquarium. &lt;br/&gt;Planted aquariums with high aeration and water movement make for a healthy environment. Rocks and driftwood help to accent a natural habitat and provide hiding spaces to reduce stress for the Tiger Pleco. A 30 gallon aquarium or larger is recommended for this species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Breeding in an aquarium setting has not been successful yet, however, different methods are being used in the industry. The Tiger Plecostomus is an egg-layer, that tends to use plants and rocks as an anchor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feeding the Tiger Pleco is not difficult due to the fact that it is not a picky eater. Feeding off the bottom of the aquarium, it gets most of its nutrition from left over food and algae. If there is no algae or left over food present, supplement with high quality flake food, sinking carnivore pellets, freeze-dried bloodworms, and tubifex.</groundspeak:long_description>

Avocado is often mistaken for a vegetable because we eat it like a salad vegetable, but it is actually a fruit. Avocados are at their best when they are ripe and very easy to prepare. They can simply be cut in half with the stone removed and eaten with a little salad dressing or chopped into a salad. Avocados are a good source of essential fats (the good ones) – one of the few fruits or vegetables that contain fat.&lt;br/&gt;(Looks alot like a lime sorry)</groundspeak:long_description>

Available in various colors and shapes, these interesting gourds may have the shape of a bell, finger, orange, apple, ladle, spoon or an egg. The most unusual ornamental gourd is the &quot;finger gourd&quot; also called, &quot;crown of the thorns&quot;, &quot;gourd of the Ten Commandments&quot; and &quot;holy gourd&quot;. The upper surface of this gourd bears five pairs of protuberances, or prongs, and may be white or cream-colored at maturity. Other colors include green-and-white striped, orange, and bicolor, which is green and green-striped with bands or areas of yellow. Star gourds are consistent in having ten prominent ridges around their edge and resemble their namesake. A delightful collection of shapes, sizes, and colors, their surface may be warted, horned or smooth. Ornamental gourds are not edible as they have very little flesh and are grown mainly for show. The flesh they do contain is rather tasteless and may even be bitter.</groundspeak:long_description>

There was a thick coating of ice on everything and the windchill made hunts short which brought my find/DNF average just above 50%. The fresh layer of snow upped the difficulty and terrain just a tad.

Parked nearby and was worried that the guy plowing in the tracked bobcat might muggle me but the cache was nicely placed out of view. Thank You! for using a small container which made the hunt nice and easy.

The cache was crammed full with stuff and I removed a thing or two to make room (A pink golf ball?).

Very nice hanger too!

Cache is in good shape. Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

It was the end of a long day and Ankeny was keeping me plenty busy but I knew I had to visit this one before the day was done.

Sun was getting low, snow was flying and the wind had picked up. Stayed in the car for a few extra minutes to charge up with heat and read the prior logs.

Mmmm.. Not much there.

Steeled myself and strolled over and after checking a few spots the cache was in hand. Took just a few minutes.

Woo hoo!

Took it back to the car to thaw the cleverly crafted container and after getting it open I marveled at the fine craftsmanship.

Very nicely done!

Logged, put it back together and back out into the cold to replace. Hopefully I didn't replace it too well.

I am going to miss my repeat visits to this place.

Thanks for the cache!

(PS After getting caught up with my logging I discovered this was find #4200.  :)  Very worthy of a milestone.)</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located in the area known as Hook's Point, a once thriving settlement in the mid 1800's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This settlement originated when Isaac Hook and his brother, James, came to the area in 1851.  There were only two other settlements in the area at that time, Homer and Fort Dodge.  Isaac built and opened a tavern and a hotel.  In 1958, the first murder in the county occurred in his tavern.  In 1869, there were 100 people there and a Post Office, two stores, a Blacksmith shop, a Sawmill, a Grist mill, and a physician.&lt;br/&gt;Hopes of a railroad running from Montana, better known as Boone, up the Des Moines River on the east side and through Hook's Point and Homer, would keep this settlement growing.  Unfortunately, the railroad ran from Jewel Junction to Dayton and caused the death of Hook's Point.&lt;br/&gt;All that remains today is the cemetery.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is a beautiful and well kept cemetery.  My kids and grandkids come here and walk around looking at stones and some do rubbings.  My dad and grandparents are laid to rest here, as well as cousins and an uncle. Also at the NW end of the cemetery there is the grave of the first person murdered in Hamilton County; Charles Gatchell.</groundspeak:long_description>

In the winter, ice houses abound, and in the summer pelicans can be seen all around.

A few years ago, when the governor of Minnesota made a visit to Albert Lea, there was even an idea pitched for a new Vikings' stadium to be located here. Imagine...

The plan is for it to eventually run all the way to Austin and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take some time to walk the trails and enjoy the scenery and wild life. Thanks to the efforts of the Shell Rock River Watershed board and many others, including the tax payers of Albert Lea, the lake and shoreline have become much more beautiful over the last few years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no need to disturb the plants or flowers around the sign while looking for this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;LAGOON PARK – THE JEWEL OF
JORDAN!&lt;/b&gt;

Lagoon Park is the largest of Jordan’s city parks and is
located in the heart of town. It contains several recreational
features and opportunities for everyone to enjoy the great
outdoors!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The biggest and most obvious of these features is the Mill Pond.
The Mill Pond covers 17 acres and is 18 feet at its deepest. The
lake was completely restored in 2008. It was dredged, rebuilt,
improved, refilled and restocked with various spices of fish. Since
the restoration project, it is not uncommon to see people swimming,
fishing, canoeing, and sunning on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Adjacent to the Mill Pond, Sand Creek flows towards another unique
feature of the park - Sand Creek Falls. While I have never tried
it, I hear of kayakers who run Sand Creek, and fishermen are often
seen wetting a line in the plunge pool.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like any good municipal park, there is a playground, several picnic
pavilions, numerous picnic tables, a gazebo, horseshoe stations,
two sand volleyball courts, large open areas, a bathroom, and a
warming house (for winter ice skaters).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the north end of the park is a patriotic display. There is a
flagpole ensemble, the historic cannon display (refurbished in
2011), and a bench dedicated to our home-town local hero, Spc.
Joshua R. Anderson who was killed in action in Iraq January of
2008.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With so much recreational opportunities available, it only made
sense that GeoCaching should be part of the plethora of
choices.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Currently, there is one cache located at the south end of the park,
(&lt;i&gt;be sure to add that one to your list too&lt;/i&gt;). Lagoon Park has
been home to several previous caches located at various places
throughout the park (&lt;i&gt;including one of my own&lt;/i&gt;) that have
since been archived. I felt it was time for Jordan to have a
&quot;walking tour&quot; multi cache, and after tossing a couple of different
ideas around, I settled on this walking tour of Lagoon Park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I hope you enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ABOUT THIS CACHE.&lt;/b&gt;

There are four stages to this Cache. Stages one and two may be a
little more challenging.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;
STAGE ONE IS &lt;u&gt;NOT&lt;/u&gt; LOCATED IN THE ROCKS!!! IT CAN BE RETRIEVED
FROM THE PAVED PATH!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The encrypted hint should help without giving it away
completely.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you complete the whole series, you will have walked close to a
mile and have seen most of what Lagoon Park has to offer! &lt;b&gt;Be
sure to watch out for muggles! Lots of 'em all around!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This multi cache should prove to be family friendly. The container
is suitable for a log book and small tradables, trinkets or travel
bugs. FTF prize was a presidential $1 coin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Make an “event” out of it. Plan a picnic, some
swimming, fishing, playing, skating, and of course…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The following story is for entertainment purposes only.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Any resemblance to persons, places, or situations either living or
dead, real or fictitious may be purely coincidental.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

Once upon a time there was a police dispatcher who received a radio
transmission from a member of his local fire department.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It would seem that the member of the fire department observed what
they felt was a &quot;suspicious person&quot; hiding an object that gave off
a &quot;worrisome silhouette&quot; in a &quot;precarious position&quot;. (&lt;i&gt;Apparently
this object may or may not have looked a little bit like a green
colored stick of TNT&lt;/i&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given the totality of the facts surrounding this situation, the
member of the fire department called for some assistance from the
the local police department to assist him ascertaining the true
nature of this potentially nefarious act.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The police dispatcher who answered the call for service (&lt;i&gt;being a
GeoCacher himself&lt;/i&gt;) recognized this collection of facts as a
potentional GeoCacher, possibly hiding a new GeoCache. Yet, our
dispatcher had an obligation to dispatch the local police
department to assist the local fire department (&lt;i&gt;in the interest
of public safety&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After dispatching the police to assist the fire department, the
police dispatcher sent a message to the responding officers sharing
his suspicions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the police arrived, the police and fire department worked
together to locate the object, the &quot;suspicious person&quot; was located,
and the dispatcher's suspicions were confirmed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, the dispatcher (&lt;i&gt;having never found a FTF before&lt;/i&gt;)
thought that he may have stumbled accross the PERFECT situation for
his first FTF! In fact, if this &quot;suspicious person&quot; had actually
just placed the cache, the dispatcher could make the find prior to
it even being published!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What a wonderful FTF story this would make for the logs!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But, the bad news was the dispatcher did not have his GPSr with him
that day. He asked himself &quot;How hard could it be&quot;? He had a
detailed description of the &quot;precarious position&quot; - there was snow
on the ground - foot prints easily visible - and, he had not had
his lunch break yet!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, the dispatcher did what any &quot;desperate for a FTF&quot; GeoCacher
would do. He punched out for his lunch break and headed off for his
very first FTF!! (&lt;i&gt;Obeying all traffic laws while on the
way&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When he arrived, the police department and fire department had
already cleared the scene. Realizing this park looked much bigger
in &quot;real life&quot; (&lt;i&gt;as opposed to his CAD map&lt;/i&gt;), he started off
looking for the new cache. After finding what he was certain MUST
have been the original sight, searching and searching the
surrounding area, and not finding the new cache, the dispatcher
headed back to his car, head bowed in defeat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So much for that FTF.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He returned to the dispatch center, and sent a message out to his
police officers about his crushing defeat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A few minutes later, one of the responding police officers arrived
at police headquarters, and stepped into the dispatch center. He
plopped the cache on this dispatchers desk, and said &quot;Here it
is&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To an untrained eye, the dispatcher had to admit that the cache did
indeed have a &quot;cartoonish&quot; TNT look to it. But, more embarrassing
to the dispatcher - the cache was &lt;b&gt;NOT NEW&lt;/b&gt;. It had been in
play for several months. It would seem in his excitement to make a
first FTF - he did not even consider the fact that the &quot;suspicious
person&quot; could have been someone &quot;finding&quot; the cache as opposed to
someone &quot;hiding&quot; it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The officer advised the dispatcher that he had left a message
(&lt;i&gt;via geocaching.com&lt;/i&gt;) to the owner of the cache that it had
been &quot;recovered&quot; by the police department, and that if he was
interested in retrieving the cache - to call and make arrangements
to pick it up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The dispatcher offered his services to the police officer. He told
the officer that he would get in touch with the cache owner and
make arrangements to return the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The owner did indeed contact the police department through the
dispatcher. The owner adivsed the dispatcher that he would archive
the cache site and that the dispatcher could do whatever he wanted
with the cache. The dispatcher told the owner that he would keep
the cache, and promised that he would do some &quot;&lt;b&gt;GEOCACHE
RECYCLING&lt;/b&gt;&quot; by putting it back out into play somewhere
else.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The dispatcher did just that, and the GeoCache lived happily ever
after.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hmmm... Ya know, this story reminds me of a different cache I have
stumbled accross in my GeoCaching adventures... Check the most
recent logs on the archived &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC20MHJ&quot;&gt;GC20MHJ - H Wadsworth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Coincidence?? Maybe...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Or is it something as simple as the nature of the business adjacent
to this cache? I guess you have to be the judge!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please try to use the parking coordinates provided (&lt;i&gt;on
Corporate Drive - also known as Timber Line Court&lt;/i&gt;). Cache is
located on a trail between a residential neighborhood and an
industrial park, and the trail comes pretty close in proximity to a
couple of houses in the neighborhood. A lot of extra activity on
the residential side may stir up some &quot;muggle&quot; attention.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would HATE to have the police called on this cache!&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Interesting story there. Frankly, I think that (most of the time) people and authorities have been pretty open and accepting of geocachers overall. Once in awhile you get a frustrating encounter, but with a little friendly chat usually it becomes positive. And surprisingly, perhaps because it brings tourists, governments have been very accepting of the game too. All good news for me. I don't think I'll ever quit playing until I die, and then I'll probably just haunt cache sites for eternity.

I was glad when I found this one fairly quickly. Trying to move around all the fallen trees was a bit annoying. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

On foot, followed by a horde of them, I decided to make my last stand on this hill.  The walls were too steep for their clumsy, jerky movements.  But I knew it was only a matter of time before their bodies piled up and they could reach me.  Then, a miracle happened...the sun came up and they became dazed and confused in the light, eventually going to sleep.  And so I lived another day...</groundspeak:long_description>

Lots of cottonwood seeds, and spider and worm silk on the trees make the woods a bit messy out here, but it was still a beautiful hike.

I took a large sample and averaged coordinates for this hide:

This cache is just what I needed to turn my stinky (caused by work) day around.  Enjoy the walk through the woods.  The frozen stream was very cool today... should of had a camera.  

Picked up Constable Bob.  Took a superball, which my toddler son enjoyed greatly when I returned home.  Left a Bugs Life watch.   </groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was NOT a walk in the park, unless I approached it from the wrong end. Nice stroll along the creek. But it was a long way up an awful steep hill with very slippery grass. I wonder if the owner lives in one of the houses at the top of the hill and placed it by going through his/her backyard to just below the slope. 

However, it was a very clever hide. Best if one looks to the north and it is definitely winter friendly. But according to my GPS, it was about 26 feet off the listed coordinates. 

Fun one! TFTC!!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br /&gt;
It was a warm, dark September evening in 1958. August Kahl and his
fifteen year old son, Loren were loading tomatoes into their farm
truck so they could get an early start to market in South St. Paul
the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The sound of a jet bomber high overhead was nothing new to the
Kahls. They had heard the sound before. There were the new jet
airliners landing at Wold-Chamberlain, fifteen miles away, and
there were the Air Force bombers on training missions that could be
heard every so often. But tonight the sound seemed unusual, Loren
Kahl followed the path of the sound as it circled around him, it
was getting louder and louder. All at once there was a heavy
&quot;booom&quot; from an area on the other side of the barn. For an instant,
the farm light blinked out, then the Kahls were enveloped in a
fireball that swirled around both sides of the barn. They began to
run towards the farmhouse a hundred yards away...but the fireball
seemed to surround them. The ground was on fire and a noisy wind
was blasting at their unprotected skin. Loren could feel the skin
on his face tighten from the heat, August Kahl tripped on something
and fell headlong into the roaring ground fire, regained his
footing and found his way to the house.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Inside the house, six other members of August's family were
struggling to understand what had happened. The house was an
inferno. Part of the stairway had been carried away and Grandpa
Kahl needed help to get to the bottom. They managed their way out
of the house and staggered some distance away from the heat to look
back and catch their breath, most of them in shock and aghast at
the scene.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Only scant minutes before the cause of the massive explosion and
fire had been an Air Force B-52D Stratofortress maneuvering at
36,400 feet overhead. On a Cold War training mission to simulate a
nuclear strike on the Twin Cities, the plane had been home to six
flight crewmembers and two instructors. The plane from the 69th
Bomb Squadron 42nd Bomb Wing of SAC, had departed Loring Air Force
Base, Limestone, Maine earlier in the day. It had made ECM runs at
Bath, Maine, Albany, New York, Williamsport, PA, Youngstown, Ohio,
and Bellefonte, Ohio. The flight had continued to Richmond,
Indiana, where a GPI Nav-bomb run was started, and which was to
terminate at Minneapolis. There it would be scored for accuracy
from the Air Force Radar Bombing site at Wold-Chamberlain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Four times the big plane crossed the target with &quot;bombs away&quot; for
the fourth run at 2016CST, Minneapolis. As it rolled off the last
run something went wrong. An elevator trim &quot;excursion&quot; began to
send tremors through the ship. Whatever happened will never be
known, for at this point the tail broke off the airplane, and it
began a high speed plunge straight for the ground. There was no
remark from the crew, and no cockpit voice recorder or black box to
record the last moments. From 36,400 feet, the ship dove towards
earth, and in no more than 108 seconds had crossed through 8.000
feet Moments later, control tower personnel at Wold-Chamberlain
witnessed an explosion in the direction of Inver Grove Heights. The
plane's main structure had impacted on the August Kahl farm a few
miles south of South St. Paul Airport.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though the crew had remained silent, they had never the less taken
action. Four crewmembers had ejection seats and fired themselves
out into the night almost immediately. The other four crew,
including the two instructors, had no ejection seats.. It was for
them to find an open hatch and leap to safety. Perhaps the
centrifugal force kept them pinned to their crew positions, for
they were unable to exit and rode the plane to the ground, being
consumed in the explosion and fire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of the four that ejected and were subjected to a 600 mile per hour
jetstream from outside the ship, flailing arms and legs and contact
with the aircraft structure produced fatal injuries to three. They
were found long after searchers and investigators had arrived,
still strapped in their useless seats, their parachutes ripped to
shreds by air blasts. The co-pilot was the singular survivor. He
had landed in a tree on a farm adjoining the Kahl property.
Neighbors helped him walk to a waiting ambulance some time after
the crash.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ariel photos taken the morning after the crash showed that the
plane had come in at a flat angle, clipping off the top of a
billboard alongside state highway 52., just fifty yards from the
impact spot. Five craters marked the positions the fuselage and
each pod of two engines. One of the engines had bulleted through
the Kahl farmhouse, smashing off the lower staircase. Pieces large
and small littered the entire farm and spread across neighboring
farms. The tail of the aircraft was found three miles to the
west.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though the event was traumatic and carried ad front page news in
local newspapers for the next two days, apart from convincing local
citizens that the plane was not carrying nuclear weapons, the
accident was soon hushed up. Recoverable pieces of the aircraft
were taken to the big Air Force Reserve hanger at Wold-Chamberlain
where they were laid out for the Air Force Accident Investigation
team. No further news was given to the public.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a result of the investigation, numerous changes were adopted in
both the ejection procedure, and in the design of the ejection
seats themselves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the Kahl Family, with August and Loren badly burned, and the
other family members burned and traumatized, they were able to
recover enough compensation to pay for their hospitalization and to
build a new farmhouse on a different spot of ground than where the
former house had stood. In the fall of 1995 when the Kahl farm was
purchased by the city of Inver Grove Heights, these buildings were
burned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The accident happened on September 16, 1958.
Thirty-eight years later, on September 14, 1996, a stone memorial
was dedicated on the spot where the bomber had crashed. Under the
sponsorship of the Minnesota Aviation Hall of Fame, all of the
major aviation museums in the Twin City area lent their support,
both financially and physically to provide, at long last, a marker
to honor these Cold War Veterans who gave their lives for their
country. Today the stone with a fine etched tablet reminds all
passersby of the sacrifice of these men. The location of the
memorial is at the intersection of Broderick Blvd. And Brooks Blvd.
Near the Inver Hills Community College, alongside Highway 52 in
Inver Grove Heights.&lt;br /&gt;

Considering the object the cache was likely hidden in (though the nearest edge was 26 feet from GZ, according to my GPSr, and since the sun was almost set, I had absolutely no confidence that I'd make the find. I was happily wrong, however - the cache was in the third or fourth spot I checked. I love when that happens! Nice hide, but the coords should be adjusted a bit for stage 2. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

I kept looking and he never said a word, so he probably knew what I was up to. A bit later I got to the right area and made the grab. The officer was gone by then. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located in a medium-sized City of Inver Grove Heights park, that is
complete with a plastic play area for kids, basketball and tennis
courts, and some wooded trails. Not too far from Highway 3, Highway
52 (which, by the way, Garmin Mapsource has labelled backwards),
and Interstate 494. There is also a historic church nearby, as well
as a lake teeming with wildlife. The park closes nightly at
10:00pm.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since almost everyone associates the same thing with the
place-name of Salem, we decided to make this kind of a mystery
cache--all of our initial trade items are wrapped, with simple
clues telling what the contents are--rest assured, everything is
harmless. Feel free to trade whatever you like, wrapped or
unwrapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/7/03--I just updated the coordinates, by changing the .023 to
.013 in the Latitude--my GPS has been right on whenever I've
checked this cache, so I thought it was everyone else, since the
coords posted in the logs vary quite a bit, but since I copied the
coordinates from my GPS to the cache page by hand, I might've
mistyped them. Sorry about that, and I hope you all enjoyed the
extra challenge. (I just updated the software in my GPS and lost
all the waypoints I had stored, so I don't know if my coordinates
matched).&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mngca.org&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: Park officials do read the cache logs, so please be
sure to stay on the trail to get as close to the cache as possible,
etc. Also note anything positive you do in the area i.e. cached and
trashed, and note how you enjoyed the park. Thank You.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It was my last cache for today and I was pretty proud of myself for beginning just as the rain had stopped and then finishing right when it was starting up again... then I realized that the TravelBug I had grabbed was missing and I hiked back to the cache - in the rain - to find it. Spent a while looking, searched my pack twice, didn't find it, went back toward the car searching the trail and found it on the ground near the exit of the trail. Thanks, Murphy. TFTC!

The fort has been partially restored including barracks, store, and hospital. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activites at the fort now include military drills, daily cannon firing, blacksmithing, hearth-cooking, period crafts , and games. There is an admission fee to get inside the actual fort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862, approximately 1,600 Dakota women, children, and elderly men were held at an internment camp next to the fort. Many died from outbreaks of disease. In 1863 the remaining people in the camp were placed on steamboats and sent to the Crow Creek reservation in South Dakota.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a sign at the coordinates which has more information about the internment camp. The code phrase can be found on the sign. The photographer who took the photo is __________.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Valley Park is the largest City of Mendota Heights Park, at 94.4
acres. It has a natural area, paved and dirt trails, a softball
field, soccer fields, tennis courts, a basketball hoop, play
equipment, and a picnic shelter. I had driven past on the freeway
on my way to work, and finally decided to come down and check it
out, and found some cache locations, one of which I'm going to use.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not too far from the paved trail through the park. Remember, the
most direct way isn't usually the easiest--there are plenty of game
trails in the area. The parking lot with all the amenities is
located at N 44°53.476, W 093°07.647. Cache is in a camoflage
painted ammo can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mngca.org&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: Park officials do read the cache logs, so please be
sure to stay on the trail to get as close to the cache as possible,
etc. Also note anything positive you do in the area i.e. cached and
trashed, and note how you enjoyed the park. Thank You.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've checked the coordinates a few times based on the
logs--sometimes my GPS brings me right to the cache, and 5 minutes
later, it shows me at 50 feet away, and other times, it'll show me
at 50 feet away when I get there, and 5 minutes later, it'll be
right on. All I can figure is that there is quite a bit of signal
bounce in the area due to the high-tension wires overhead, the
freeway nearby, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKEE7F - Valley Park parking area&lt;br /&gt;N 44° 53.576 W 093° 07.647</groundspeak:long_description>

I was in shorts out here, and its amazing how a little bad experience with some vegetation can make a person very wary about entering any kind of overgrown area without extreme caution. The spider webs in the face have become a summer geocaching ritual for me too. Got a couple of nice ones going for this cache. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False"> this cache was fun to find,
Me and the people going with me biked down the trail and then parked our bikes kind of where the stream takes a turn to the left then we hiked a couple more feet but my phone said to go up in the woods , so we did and after that it took a half an hour or so but we eventually found it !!!! This cache is nicely hid and camoflauged well. We put some trinkets in it and took some other trinkets and I logged in the log book when we found it and to look up Madyn28 on youtube. We loved finding this geocache, it was AWESOME!!!! :-)  but the Cache was a little dirty inside and had some small daddy longlegs in it, so it was fun to find and awesome when we did find it but I think it needs to be cleaned out and updated by the owner, BUT overall it is a cool cache and family friendly for kids 5 and over ( unless the kid under 5 is really adventourous and does not complain very much )!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:-) :-) :-) :-)</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow has been described as the first truly American poet. His works took distinctly American themes and made them accessible to a worldwide audience. After reviewing Henry Rowe Schoolcraft's publication on the traditions of the Ojibwe Indians of Minnesota and seeing an early photograph of Minnehaha Falls, Longfellow penned 5,314 chanting lines of epic poetry and titled it Hiawatha.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Hiawatha became America's most widely read poem of the 19th Century, spreading the fame of Minnehaha Falls and the uppermost regions of the Mississippi. Today, a statue of Hiawatha carrying his bride Minnehaha graces Minnehaha Park, and the Minneapolis Park System operates an information center in a scale replica of Longfellow's home. Unfortunately, the poem also spread wide misconceptions about Ojibwa Traditions, the real history of Minnesota, and the true identity of the famous chief.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Who was Hiawatha? The historic figure lived centuries earlier and half a continent away among the Iroquois Nation in New England. In the early 15th Century, about a hundred years before Columbus undertook his voyage, chaos and warfare reigned among the tribes. Hiawatha began as a solitary warrior, living in isolation until called by the supernatural being Deganawida to promote peace among the tribes of the Iroquois. Hiawatha became the founder of the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and his internal peacekeeping measures helped the Five Nations grow and prosper.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;So how did Longfellow transport Hiawatha across the country? In some Iroquois dialects, Hiawatha closely resembles the name of the deity Tahiawagi. Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, an extensive Ojibwa scholar, made an erroneous connection between Tahiawagi and Manabozo, a deity of similar feats and renowned among the Ojibwas in Minnesota. When Longfellow followed the false trail Schoolcraft laid in his book on Indian legends, the fictional Hiawatha was the result.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This very beautiful statue of Hiawatha carrying Minnehaha is on a small island in Minnehaha Creek, just a short distance above Minnehaha Falls. Hiawatha was an Objibwe warrior and Minnehaha was his true love. Minnehaha in the Dakota language means &quot;laughing waters.&quot;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Hiawatha and Minnehaha were - characters in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem, The Song of Hiawatha. The poem is based the myths and legends of Indian tribes in the north country, around lakes Michigan and Superior.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;It took Longfellow about 18 months to write The Song of Hiawatha in 1854-1855. This masterpiece was the most widely read poem in America in the 19th century. Today it remains one of the best known and most loved poems in all of American literature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Here is a familiar excerpt:&lt;br/&gt;&quot;By the shores of Gitche Gumee, &lt;br/&gt;By the shining Big-Sea-Water, &lt;br/&gt;Stood the wigwam of Nokomis, &lt;br/&gt;Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis. &lt;br/&gt;Dark behind it rose the forest, &lt;br/&gt;Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees, &lt;br/&gt;Rose the firs with cones upon them; &lt;br/&gt;Bright before it beat the water, &lt;br/&gt;Beat the clear and sunny water, &lt;br/&gt;Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water. &quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find the code phrase to log this virtual cache, locate the plaque describing the Hiawatha and Minnehaha statue. The plaque is very close to the posted coordinates. According to the plaque, the funds to erect the statue were contibuted principally by the _________ _________ of Minesota. The words in the blanks above are the code phrase. </groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;We found this location while looking for a RickRich cache
nearby. When we first checked it out we knew immediately that this
was an excellent place for our first cache. It highlights a natural
wooded area in the heart of a major metro area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hiawatha Oaks is a long narrow strip of woods that is
bordered by Hiawatha Ave on the east side and an apartment building
parking lot on the west. Please be respectful of the residents on
each side of the woods, and enter the woods on the Cambridge Street
- north of the cache location. It's about 300 feet from the sign to
the cache location. Parking is tricky here, the closest legal
parking is the restaurants along Cambridge Avenue, about .2 miles
away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a regular cache suitable for the largest of travel bugs,
and toys for the kids. The cache is easily retrievable with
materials on the cache site. The cache is winter friendly too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for visiting our cache and enjoy the Hiawatha Oaks!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I felt a bit awkward trudging to this cache since it was so close to the gentleman's house nearby, and I decided to risk the illegal (but nowhere near dangerous) parking on the street right nearby. I met the gentleman in question, however, and after his initial surprise at finding someone &quot;hiding&quot; behind a tree near his property, I explained I was geocaching, and he said, &quot;Oh, okay, I know about that.&quot; He said he had no problems with it and he'd talked to the owner.

&lt;p&gt;Don't wait, summer will be a different story!  This cache is on the island.  During winter, it's a 'walk in the park'.  During Summer, it's a a short boat ride.  &lt;/p&gt;

This ceramic niche is part of a public art project called the GeoNiche project.  In the cache itself there is a logbook and maps to hidden artworks in Swede Hollow park as well as glass (tumbled) found in the park).  Swede Hollow was the flodding shanty village that housed various immigrant groups over the years who made there homw there: Swedes, Italians and Mexicans.  I have hidden several artworks in the park (located a few blocks from Swede Hollow Cafe where you will find this cache.  I am unable to list them on this site due to proximity.

of the University of Minnesota, seek this small cache in its
shadow. Keen eyes will spot this cache in it's secret lair. This
cache has room for small TB's and geocoins.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 19th, 2009 Update: As today I have changed the cache
name to &lt;b&gt;Platonic Figure&lt;/b&gt;. This is the inscription on the
dedication plaque. I did this for two reasons: first, to match the
plaque. Second, I have realized I was unwittingly gender biased
when I placed the cache. WylburWing and I visited Minnesota Woman
this summer. If they can rename a 10,000 year old archaeological
dig, we can rename an androgynous modern sculpture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the name, there might be a few problems with
finding this cache though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Platonic Man is located on a Muggle Highway: there are students
walking here day and night.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPS Reception: welcome to the U of M Canyon. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have found tough caches before, so get out there and search
your brains out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is wheelchair accessible, but retrieval of the cache
is not wheelchair accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also listed a hint now, it's not a spoiler, but it's
more fun without it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platonic Man is also a waymark -

Today I decided to walk down there and get as many of the caches on campus that I could, and this was one of them. Fortunately, I went later in the day, so once I spotted the nicely hidden cache I was able to wait for a break in the passing students to grab and then another to sign and replace.

Unfortunately that year he wasn't able to go to the Rose Bowl and since then they have never gone back. When they do I promise to take him to the game. He worked as a equipment manager for the University of Minnesota Athletics for a long time and took care of a number of athletes. For some he was the old man getting on their case about getting to class and to others the father they never had. For all of those athletes he has taken care of he has always gone by the name of Matty. There is not a bigger fan or person who has put more blood, sweat and time than my father into Gopher Football and because of that he has been admired by many in college football and his profession. Dad thanks again for all of the wonderful memories that we were able to build and that you built for others during your time at the U of Minnesota.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For any former or current athletes out there that want an update or get in touch with my father feel free to contact me through my geocaching account.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To make this interesting and a little about Gopher Football History answer the following questions below and match it to the letter in the coordinate location.

Caching!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a cache a week to get us through the dark
months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tiny triangle park is just across the street from the
hustle and bustle of students and the University of Minnesota.
There are muggles nearby, but you should be able to snag this cache
without too much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a small cache with room for TB's and geocoins. Also very
Winter friendly for the year-round cacher crowd!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the fence of the park is a railroad line and a powerline
tower, but don't waste your time with these - caches are not
allowed here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a homeless camp on the south side of the fence. The
cache is not on this side of the fence. The cache can and should be
located from the north side of the fence.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Caching the U and Dinkytown after attending Breakfast Buddies in Minneapolis this morning. Thanksgiving weekend and very few students around. Seems like even the homeless encampment was emtpy today. Had the place to myself. Nice job on this one. STL and replaced as found. I love urban caching.

attractive and sometimes very aromatic, little park in the heart of
Minneapolis. Take note of the ratings on this cache. They are
fairly accurate so you should be able to do this one during your
work lunch hour and not come back in too bad of shape.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You will be looking for a peanut butter jar containing a log book,
pencil and a bunch of brand new trinkets.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do NOT attempt to find this cache unless you promise to place the
cache as good or better than you found it. There are many shady
characters walking this area so we don't want to lose the cache. I
do not know first hand, but I am guessing you might NOT want to do
this at night. You never know what's going on down in the
bluffs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For easier access, take the stairs closest to St. Anthony Main, the
one right past Excel Energy.</groundspeak:long_description>

Spent the afternoon volunteering at the State Fair today, half the day with the MN Geocachers Association at the DNR building and the evening supporting Tarryl Clark at the DFL. Grabbed one cache going to fair and now a couple more on the way home.

Found this one without much trouble, even in the dark, STL and replaced. One bit of confusion for me, when I went to find the next nearest cache my GPS gave me a second Open and Affirming chace, 40' away. Don't know what that was about. I hate not knowing.

This cache was hidden by the scouts of Boy Scout Troop 9071, Woodbury, MN..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the original geocache container going missing and the changing vegetation around the original location making concealment impossible, I moved this cache on August 17, 2012 to the nearby coordinates listed above.&lt;br/&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

The cache at stage #1, however, had a Spy vs. Spy label on the outside, and it finally slipped off in my hands. I stuck it into the container so maybe it can be repaired at some point.

Larpenteur from Elmhurst Cemetery at N44°59.525',
W093°07.231'--follow a paved path past the off-leash dog area
through the Ramsey County Open Space to the City of Roseville park.
If you bring your four-legged companion along, remember they can be
off-leash in the off-leash area, but otherwise, local leash laws
apply.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cache container is an ammo can painted to resemble a grave stone.
I'm starting to accumulate quite a few MIA travel bugs, and I
decided to release the copy tags into circulation, and be creative
in doing so. Thus the Pet Semetary cache--a place where one can put
their dead travel bugs, and watch them come back to life in a
slightly altered form. Before placing your copy bug into the cache,
be sure to virtually reclaim the bug using the number on the copy
tag, and place it in the cache using the drop-down menu when you
post a log. And please only take one bug per visit so there are
still bugs in the cache for the next finder. I'm also placing quite
a few normal trade items, to thin out my growing collection. Also
remember to cache in and trash out.

This cache was hidden by Hockeyman14. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I inspected this cache on August 22, 2012 after FAB5's post and found it to be dry and intact including the log book with the MPR code word. I added the Opencaching.com verification code on a separate sheet of paper. Please see new hint below.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an old geocache named &quot;White Squirrel&quot; closeby and maybe the FAB5 found that geocache instead? </groundspeak:long_description>

It was created in 1917 and designed to be one of the most attractive and complete neighborhood parks in the nation. Enjoy the many fields and courts or take a walk along its many paths. The commitment of the neighborhood has resulted in a popular and friendly park. &lt;br/&gt;Log only, so you must bring your own pencil. Muggles are likely so you will have to use stealth.</groundspeak:long_description>

Extending along Bass Lake Road from Brooklyn Boulevard to Highway 100, this project will consist of many design aspects including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    * Regional Trail Connection.  A missing segment of the regional trail system will be constructed, providing a central connection to existing regional trails.&lt;br/&gt;    * Pedestrian Safety.  Design elements will encourage safe pedestrian routes and street crossings.&lt;br/&gt;    * Water Quality. Biofiltration systems will enable treatment of roadway runoff that may be contaminated with chloride from de-icing efforts before it discharges into Shingle Creek.&lt;br/&gt;    * Streetscaping. Multi-function aesthetic features will promote safety and beauty, including landscaping, pedestrian plaza and benches, lighting and colored concrete.  The look will be coordinated with Xerxes Avenue streetscaping to provide a consistent feel to the area.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache in Twin Lake North Park. A non-developed park in Brooklyn
Center. The only signs of a park is the ones that say &quot;no motorized
vehicles&quot;. Parking is best along Major Ave. FTF prize was a
non-activated 2007 MnGCA geocoin.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache was muggled and had to be replaced. I hid a different
container than the original ammo can and hid it a little
differently and hoping this one will last. The originally hide was
placed during my year as Vice-President of the MnGCA and I am
currently the President of the Organization. I started caching in
Feburary 2007 and it has become quite the hobby. I enjoy the many
different aspects of geocaching. I am frequently at WeekNIGHT
Caching as well as many different events. I was also able to
complete the Minnesota State Parks Geocaching History Challenge
this year and I was also talked into doing the Kitchen Cove and
Lair caches this summer.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is my first hide and a tribute to my favorite type of
cache-the ammo can. When I hit my 100th find I made sure it was an
ammo can. This cache is located along the trail along Shingle Creek
in Brooklyn Center that can be taken to a number of parks in the
area. Please be careful of muggles as this is a highly used trail
by both walkers and bike riders. There is also a lot of traffic at
times on nearby road. Please re-hide as found and bring your own
pen or pencil to sign log. FTF coin for FTF goes to Team
Dogs!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ununtrium&lt;/i&gt; is the temporary name of a synthetic element with the temporary symbol Uut and atomic number &lt;b&gt;113&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you find yourself without the ability to sythesize &lt;i&gt;Ununtrium&lt;/i&gt; from the decay of a bunch of &lt;i&gt;Ununpentium&lt;/i&gt; you happen to have lying around? Do you lack the bismuth-209 to cold-fuse with zinc-70? Do you lack the apparatus to detect simple alpha decay? Fret no longer; you can still find some Ununtrium (though please don't keep it)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Go to the posted coordinates.&lt;/b&gt; There you will find a sign in front of the playground equipment. On the east-facing side of the sign are two numbers separated by a hyphen, we'll call them &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;, so the sign reads like this: &quot;...blah blah blah &lt;b&gt;A-B&lt;/b&gt; blah blah blah...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will call &quot;&lt;b&gt;U&lt;/b&gt;&quot; the atomic number of Ununtrium.(It's on this page!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final coordinates for this cache are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;N 45° 04.((U - 1) * A / 2)   B&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;W 93° 26.((U   B) * 2)   A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


Park hours are 6:00 AM to 11:00 PM
(6 and 11 are not the numbers you need from the sign)

&lt;p&gt;However...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you bribe the chipmunks in the area with peanuts, they might just tell you where the cache is at...it's worth a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you have to find the peanuts first...because by the looks of it they may be hidden quite well too :)&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Co-FTF with Sharknose Bunnies! I've been distracted lately and have a backlog of new, but still unsolved, puzzles. This one happened to come out when I was free of distractions.

My first idea panned out (love it when that happens) and I had all but one digit. Since the checker allows 10 wrong guesses before a lockout, it was a simple matter of geochecker-bingo before I got the all-clear. But BigChiefS4 and Msteffel were well ahead of me. Sharknose, ever the hound, said we should go NOW. NOW, NOW NOW. Yeah, okay, geez.

Last night, a fuse blew out in my car and killed my taillights and instrumentation lights. I got pulled over and had a 10-second conversation with one of Saint Paul's finest and managed to get home without any further stops. Figuring it was just one of those things, I put a new fuse in this afternoon. Everything worked, and I forgot about it. Everything still worked when I tore out of the garage on my way to Maple Grove. Everything still worked as I merged onto 94. Then the gauges went black again. The car that was preparing to pass me reconsidered, backed off a little, and then exploded in white, blue, and red flashing lights. Dang.

This interaction with one of Minnesota Highway Patrol's finest took a little longer, but the package of fuses on my seat was enough for a short &quot;get that fixed&quot; discussion. Fortunately, the GPS with the Yeti voice didn't decide to ask in Yeti-ese why I'd stopped. I don't remember the last time I got a ticket or even a stern talking-to, but I have had too many sub-five-minute police interactions to count. Maybe I just have a face that inspires pity?

Anyway, I made it to the rally point to find SNB had beat me there (he always does), and he was holding the container and grinning by the time I got down the trail. YES! FTF! I signed us in, and gave only a few CCs of blood to the State Bird, popped in a 15-amp fuse to replace the 10-amp one that keeps blowing, and headed home.

The dash lights were dark again just after I got on 94. Guess what I'm doing tomorrow afternoon after work?</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Do you have a trusty Phone-A-Friend on speed dial? Do you find yourself calling them more often than you care to admit? Yes! We have all been there at one time or another. There is nothing like having to hang your head in shame while your &quot;friend&quot; begins endlessly ribbing you over the phone because you admitted defeat and had to call for their help. Well...It could be worse!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I was searching in a park for a bugger of a hide and was not having any luck at all. It was a puzzle cache that was a pretty easy solve. It was marked as a &quot;not specified&quot; container which was no help to me and to make matters worse there were beacons everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it a micro in the trees?&lt;br /&gt;
Or a nano on the bench?&lt;br /&gt;
Is it up?...or down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked in circles, squares and even tetrahedrons as I bumbled about doing my drunken bee dance. My GPSr was bouncing every which way. Finally after an hour I decide to resort to my PAFs, theodellfamily and AE_geohound. After talking to them, I found it right away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the magic of technology, I have created a way for you to call them yourself to help you on this cache so you don't need to be embarrassed. Use the buttons below to call them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://webpages.charter.net/tonykeyser/PAF1.mp3&quot;&gt;PAF #1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://webpages.charter.net/tonykeyser/PAF2.mp3&quot;&gt;PAF #2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize if they are not available or if they changed their number...they are busy people after all. If you still happen to resort to your own PAF to solve, please mention their geo-name in your log to thank them for their help and awesomeness! Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

I knew what to do when I got the notification email for this puzzle, but I was lazy and figured it would make for a nice lunchtime find at work. Then I completely forgot about it, and finally remembered and solved it today.

The find was pretty easy, as I could see Something Out Of Place as I approached from where I parked. That will get harder as time goes by!

Thanks for another fun puzzle Cachin8tor!</groundspeak:text>

Episode 396 (Alameda Chats 11/12/12)&lt;br /&gt;
Click on the PodCacher link above and fast forward to time code 34:00.&lt;br /&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;WARNING: This themed multi-cache is not for the faint of heart. It may require some technical knowledge, TOTTS, and may require multiple trips to solve! Depending on the season, some areas may be wet. Later evening hours are encouraged as it makes solving some of the stages easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need every weapon and tool in your arsenal to solve it! TECHNOLOGY WILL BE YOUR BEST FRIEND AND WORST ENEMY! Good Luck!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please observe park hours when hunting for this cache. They are 7AM-10pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cacher's everywhere must band together to defeat the rise of the machines! Geocaches and GPSr's have become so numerous and the database so extensive that the Computer Automated Cyborg Human Elimination Network (CACHENET) has become self-aware! Artificial intelligence has taken over and the human race has been targeted for termination!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to defeat the machines you must find and disable all of CACHENET's equipment in The Hills Park in Rogers, MN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;STAGE 1 - DOWNLOAD MEMORY CORE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The coordinates above will take you to an unprotected memory core of the CACHENET network. A resistance drone observed TheCachin8tor making a memory dump at this location before he was eliminated. You must access the information contained there to determine the IP addresses of the CACHENET main computer. The IP addresses will need to be decrypted to numerical format which will then indicate the location of next stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;STAGE 2: KILL POWER GRID&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Find the hard-line to the computer core and sever the power connection. This will disable most of the security blocks to the processor vault. You will find encrypted coordinates to Stage 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;STAGE 3 - INFILTRATE &amp; DESTROY SURVEILLANCE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Quickly dismantle and disable the video surveillance system. Gather the next target coordinates before the machines notice that you have infiltrated the base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;STAGE 4 - OBTAIN ENCRYPTED KEY CARD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One of our inside operatives, Sgt. Katherine Halsey was able to stash an encrypted access card before she was taken by the machines. Her location is still unknown. Find the key card and obtain the information on it to locate and bypass the vault security system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;STAGE 5 - BYPASS SECURITY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Gain access to the processor vault by entering the correct information you found on the key card at Stage 4 to bypass the security system. There is a 10-second timer before the alarm will sound! Time and stealth is of the essence!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;STAGE 6 - PROCESSOR EXTRACTION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Remove the processor from the processor receptacle. Decrypt the error code displayed on the processor. These are the coordinates for Stage 7. Now get out of there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;STAGE 7 - KILL SATELLITE UPLINK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
CACHENET will attempt a satellite uplink to activate it's fail-safe defenses. Locate the uplink antenna and gather the transmitted data to locate Stage 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;STAGE 8 - DISARM LASER-GUIDED WARHEAD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It appears that CACHENET was able to activate it's fail-safe to protect itself against termination. They have nuclear warheads targeting a secret stronghold containing a remote shutdown system. This particular warhead is targeting the final stage. Determine and follow the warhead's programmed flight path. THIS STAGE SHOULD BE DONE AT NIGHT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;STAGE 9 - ABORT!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have been observant and found all the stages then you will have found the secret bunker entrance and have the necessary clearance data to access THE BUTTON. Push the BIG red button to shut down the CACHENET network once and for all. If your access is denied, then you will need to go back and figure out what you missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hints will assist you in locating\solving AT the stage listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, please replace cache containers just as you found them and please log any issues you encounter in a maintenance log or an email to the CO so I can service the cache if necessary. Please also take care to maintain the integrity of this cache. A lot of time and effort went into creating this adventure. Thanks for playing :)&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Stage 1: ROT-AC Encryption. Careful! 0 (zero) and &quot;O&quot; are not interchangable. Inspect the inner container thoroughly!
Stage 2: Short circuit! &amp; ASCII
Stage 3: Good vantage point. Static or stereogram?
Stage 4: The key card uses full-spectrum encryption.
Stage 5: 10 second timer. Try to remain calm and stealthly!
Stage 6: The processor is extremely sensitive to temperature. Try cooling it with some Oxygen Dihydride.
Stage 7: Quality Reception. Hope you brushed up on your electrical engineering skills
Stage 8: Activate the targeting scanner, then follow the path.
Stage 9: Access Denied? How closely did you examine all the stages? The cache title may help...</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This Cache has been placed by permission and has been an inactive cemetery for over 100 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Foster Cemetery sits in the middle of the City of Ramsey's industrial district. Many individuals pass by this spot every day and don't even know that this piece of history is right under their nose. This cemetery was the first burial grounds in this area and is an important part of Anoka County History.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alfred Foster who later deeded it to Ramsey Township originally owned the cemetery. It was established prior to 1860, platted in 1861, but the first known burials were those of Richard and Jane Porter who were buried there in 1852-1854 respectively. Burials were evidently made when it was open prairie as no roads lead to this area. One soldier, Charles Pitman. Company C of Minnesota Mounted Rangers is known to be buried there. The last burial in Ramsey Cemetery was that of John C. Bowers who was buried there in 1879 and who was later moved to Oakwood Cemetery in Anoka. The cemetery was abandoned in l905.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cornelius Pitman was one of the original settlers of Ramsey. He served as one of the first supervisors of Ramsey in 1885, when Ramsey Township was organized. Records show that as early as March of 1864 Mr. Pitman was interested in improving the area, a receipt shows he received $20.00 for furnishing the lumber and for building a bridge on section line 20. He had been a member of a New England colony that made the first settlement in Ramsey Township in 1850.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first burials at this site were in 1852 and 1854 for Richard and Jane Porter. It is said this ground was broken for the graves of settlers passing through these northern woods. Some members of the clan apparently, were stricken with fever, died and as was the practice of the time, buried along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Richard and Jane Porter came to Ramsey from St. Anthony Trading Post in the spring of 1852. They lived in a log house with Mr. &amp; Mrs. William Payne. Mrs. Payne and Jane were sisters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;One day some Indians came to the cabin while the two women were alone. They were sure some white men had taken some ponies, which belonged to them. They crowded into the Porter cabin talking angrily. Jane Porter hid her small daughter behind the door just as they came into the room; she kept stepping back in the direction of the wood box, telling them the ponies were grassing on the far side of the hill. Finally one Indian stepped up and drew a long knife to Jane's throat; she quickly drew a stick from the wood box! The Indians must have admired her bravery for she succeeded in driving them from the cabin; By that time the missing ponies came into view so the lndians left with the ponies! Jane's sister, Mrs. Payne, had fainted dead away!&quot; (City of Ramsey, MN History Book 1974.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cemetery has been neglected and vandalized for many years. As reported in the Anoka Union Newspaper November 21,1975, Mrs. James, co-chairwoman of the Bicentennial Committee removed the headstones from the cemetery and took them to Councilwoman Beverly Oliphant's. Councilwoman Oliphant refused to take possession of the stones and Mrs. James took them home. Shortly after the mayor was notified, the sheriff arrived at Mrs. Oliphant's home and the councilwoman avoided the potential for a lawsuit for robbing a cemetery. What happened to the stolen stones has yet to be determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 14 known graves in this cemetery. Also, in an interview by a Mrs. Wilson before passing away in 1975, she told a story of 12-15 Native Americans, who converted to Christianity and were buried in unmarked graves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entrance to the cemetery is directly to the North and is an unmarked driveway.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a family-friendly 7 stage multi-cache. I don't recommend letting children go at this alone as some of the stages have a little bit of bushwhacking to get to or may be placed out of their reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a little-known park on the west side of Elk River, MN. Access to the park is from the north on Waco street off CR 35. Your navigator/GPSr will likely lead you on a while goose chase. I have provided a waypoint to help you out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stages 1-6 are all micros. Final is a regular. Please rehide all the stages as good or better than you found them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

This is definitely not wheelchair accessible and ease of getting to GZ depends on the season. Expect a small bit of climbing and possibly wet feet. Please rehide as found or better to make this fun for the next cacher!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first cache hide and was placed on my Golden 28th Birthday 9/28/11! It also is a tribute cache for my first geocaching milestone of 100 finds!  You are looking for a small camo container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandparents used to live in the house adjacent to this island. I discovered this area as a boy and later camped here a couple times when I was in Boy Scouts. Always enjoyed this spot as a mini retreat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nutty Bites&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serving Size: 1 cup (90g)&lt;br /&gt;
Servings Per Container: 2&lt;br /&gt;
Calories: 180&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Fat: 16g&lt;br /&gt;
Cholesterol: 2mg&lt;br /&gt;
Sodium: 186mg&lt;br /&gt;
Total Carbohydrates: 6g&lt;br /&gt;
Dietary Fiber: 72g&lt;br /&gt;
Potassium: 2mg&lt;br /&gt;
Protien: 14g&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure out the coordinates and you will find a spot in Elk River
that many have seen but few have visited. Find the cache and enjoy
a delicious and well-earned smiley treat!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;BYOP!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy crunching on some Nutty Bites while you sign the log. It's
a well-known cacher snack!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh...you've never heard of Nutty Bites?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I guess it's all well and good because I accidentally ate
them all. I decided to use the container as a cache instead. Maybe
if you shake it you will hear the remnants of the delicious Nutty
Bites that it once held. Go on give it a try! Then open the
container and smell the leftover aroma! Don't let it all out
though! Save some for the next cacher!Let me know what you
think!:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you log your find please replace the cache contents and
rehide just as you found it so other cachers can enjoy the smiley
too.&lt;/p&gt;

What a difference a day makes! I'd seen GZ many times before, and I'm glad to finally have a reason to go there. The hide took a little looking and thinking before I finally spotted the container. Fun hide! I wish TJ could have been here to enjoy it, too. Thanks for the fun puzzle and cache!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one was inspired by another cache that I found once upon a time, although I decided to up the ante a little bit and make this one just a little more difficult. Retrieving and replacing this cache may be the tricky part...you have been warned! FYI - Watch out for the low hanging barbed wire near the GZ!&lt;/p&gt;

Out visiting Sand Dunes State Forest today. Planned on attending a couple KB events and check out some of the nearby caches. Great to find a Patroller cache but no gold, STL and replaced. Hoped I would be able to find The Lost Sand Dunes Silver as well. Guess I simply don't have the brains for those puzzles though.

TFTC and the great State Forest!

Needed to do abit of excavating on this one. Still, the task was clear and I was rewarded. STL and replaced, not as found. I didn't pack 12 inches of snow back on top of the cache. Soon enough.

Not long after, we had lunch, and afterward, as we were driving to a closer location to grab this cache, we saw them crossing the road. Later, we were near the cache, my GPSr went absolutely crazy, and it took about 20 minutes to settle down. During that time, I was holding my GPSr in the air, standing on a log, and the same mom with the same kids again passed us. They didn't say a whole lot, but they didn't seem to be going for the cache as far as I could tell. Ten minutes later, we found the cache, and just as we were leaving, they popped up in the woods and headed for the cache. I thought the whole thing was rather cute, and I hope they enjoyed their searches as much as we did on this beautiful day. The nearby field was absolutely stunning and we spent several minutes just kind of staring wistfully at it, in a way mourning the coming of winter. Anyhow, TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In remembrance of the 100 people that attended a family camp
weekend getaway, I placed this cache near the camp.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We canoed around the lake, fished, ate a lot of food, sang
songs around the campfire, played games during the rain, went
biking, hiking and walking, slept very little...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;...and STILL HAD A GREAT TIME!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Original contents include about 10 new magic tricks, a few
unicycle keychains (DonB! signature item), some hotwheel cars from
&quot;lildc321&quot;, a logbook and a pencil.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please hide it as well as you find it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks, DonB!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: If you cache with kids,
please do NOT park on the highway. You can drive South a short
distance and park in the camp driveway, as long as you don't block
the entrance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This beautiful little park offers frisbee golf, charcoal grills, and towering trees to provide shade for a nice family picnic.  On top of the hill you will see the foundation of the old Ironton water tower.  Across the road, the grassy lot used to be home to the Ironton Elementary School.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is located within the Cuyuna Country State Recreation Area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If searching during the winter, snowshoes are recommended as the trails are not groomed or plowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the history of the Cuyuna Range mining era can be quite difficult.  The Armour Mine is one example of a mine with many names.  This cache is located next to the now Armour Mine Lake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the first shaft was put down here in 1910, it was known as the Meacham mine.  The name was soon changed to Armour Mine, and later changed again to Armour No. 1 Mine in honor of C.D. Armour and Phillip Armour, of Chicago, both of whom where stockholders and directors of the company conducting the mining.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet another name given to this mine during the mining era was Interstate Mine because it was originally developed and operated by Interstate Exploration Company.  Today it is known as Armour #1.</groundspeak:long_description>

Hides for us in this area will work out great, as we frequent this area on and off throughout the year. We both hope you'll enjoy it. This cache will take you to a small park within the city limits of Grand Rapids. There is plenty of off street parking here which gets you to a very short distance from GZ. This is as close to a P&amp;G as they come folks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck &amp; Have Fun!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;((Please replace cache exactly how you found it so the next cachers can enjoy this cache as you did.))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrads Go Out To &quot;Team Yettobenamed&quot; For The FTF!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Her father accidently lost his life here about 100 ft from shore when his boat capsized in a stong wind and cold water while he was fishing on Oct 16/71.&lt;br/&gt;We thought, why not place a cache here in his memory.&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a small camo'd lock'n'lock that has room for a few small trade items.&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Team Ffej for the FTF.</groundspeak:long_description>
