            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is designed to allow locals and passers-by a convenient and easy location to drop off and pick up travel bugs with the hopes that another cacher can help these travel bugs on their journey.

Please take a travel bug if you can help it on its journey and work towards accomplishing its goal.

In order for the travel bug's web page to monitor its progress please go to the travel bug's web site using its tracking number and log that you have picked it up. Then when you place it into another cache log it on that cache page.

Reasons for a bug Bed &amp; Breakfast:
1.You have a new bug to release and want a good place to start it off.
2.You picked up a bug and realize you cannot help it toward its goal.
3.You are about to travel and want to grab a bug to help it on its journey.
4.You are in from out-of-town and want an easy pickup/dropoff spot.
5.You have held a bug for a while and need to move it along.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is at an old cemetery that dates back to the late 1800s. Theres an old church house there also that has been redone somewhat, take a look inside after you have found the cache, its neat!

You are looking for a small jar(peanut butter size) with a white lid, it contains a log and a few small items. This is easily accessed during all seasons, just beware of ticks and snakes during the warm ones!

If there is any maintence needed please let us know! Happy hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>

When you find stage 1, take it from it's hiding place GENTLY and read the backside for coordinates to stage 2. Gently place stage 1 back in it's hiding place and leave it as you found it.

Then head for stage 2 which should be considerably easier. Stage 2 is an ammo can so feel free to bring items to trade. Many of you will find the first stage without too much trouble, but for some of you it might be quite a challenge. Let me know what you think. If you want any hints, you must log a DNF and request some help. I really hope that this cache will challenge everyone.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to improve the cache.

The location of the cache is on the property of a facility for developmentally disabled adults and children. I was on the board of directors of this center for many years, and my wife is on the board now. The center has grown from a small building on the grounds of the elementary school (the building is now the school district's administration building) to a full city block formerly occupied by the high school. This cache was placed with the cooperation and approval of the director of the center. It is not near the locations that the students or clients are, but please be respectful and quiet during the hours of operation (8am to 5pm.) Enjoy the hunt, and good luck!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a small camo plastic container located at the Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge.

Turpentine Creek is a refuge for lions, tigers and bears (I know- Oh My!). The park is opened daily from 9:00-6:00, 5:00 during Daylight Savings Time. There is a fee for entering the refuge, but the cache can be accessed without entering the refuge. 
Take some time to enjoy the area. The deer and llamas are exceptionally friendly. 

www.turpentinecreek.org

***Park in the gift shop parking area. The cache is only a short walk from here. Please do not drive around the building.

**I had to move the cache and the accuracy was not as good, not bad about 18ft, but I thought I would give a few extra hints since I hate looking for caches when the accuracy is way off.
From the parking area, there is a small track with a short (3-4 ft.) drop off on one side.  If you pass the area your GPS points you too by about 30 feet there is an area where you can get down the drop off easily and double back to the cache on the lower part of the track.

The new area does have some plants so use bug spray and watch for ticks!!!

This cache is placed with the permission of the Turpentine Creek staff. 

Original contents were lion and tiger themed items.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a neat place.  I got to go tour it on my birthday and I recently brought them a deer someone hit in the park.  If you are here make sure you go on the tour.  Its a little pricey but you will enjoy.

I took a TB dogtag (loose) and left a periscope toy i got at sonic.  I got some good close up photos of the Llamas too.

NO CACHE AT LISTED COORDINATES

There have been 2 of my caches that BigHef32 has attempted and stated he left a trail of blood at the cache site.
So in lieu of this I came up with this cache idea, the details are as follows...
I have chosen 4 books all named Blood Trail each of these books have a statement on the cover, once you figure out which statement is on which book, and the author of that book, then you can solve the puzzle.

The statements are,
first # for northern coords: There is only one way to track a twisted killer
 your solution for this part is the 3rd letter in the authors last name.
second # for northern coords: A Joe Picket novel
  This solution will be the 1st letter in the authors last name.
first # in western coords: A novel
 This solution will be the 4th letter in the authors first name
second # in western coords: Someone is out to exterminate Canada's most endangered species
 This solution will be the 2nd letter in the authors first name.

A=4
B=7
C=3
D=6
E=9
F=2
G=5
H=7

As you can see there are more choice's than you need THE TRUE COORDINATES ARE

N36 38.1xx  W093 25.6xx

The final location will not require any bushwacking, and there should not be any thing that would cause bleeding... Hopefully.
Please place cache back as you found it

CONGRATULATIONS TO BIGHEF32 FOR THE FTF

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a small camouflaged and well hidden cache located at Lindenlure river access in Linden MO.

The community of Linden started as early as 1833 and had an operating mill from about 1840 through 1922.  The site of the mill is now known as Lindenlure.  Lindenlure is a public river access with canoeing and an easily accessible waterfall formed from a man-made dam. 

The cache area is a very short distance from the road, however there will likely be some dense foliage in the summer.

The area tends to be very busy on warm summer days with lots of gravel beaches on the river to enjoy.  
There will likely be muggles about during these times making it difficult to access the cache without attracting attention.

** 8/9/2008 I checked the cache and it looks like the flooding or muggles go to this one so I replaced the cache.

There is a lot of growth around the cache in the summer so be wary of ticks and Poison Ivy, I gave a good hint so you won't have to wander in it searching.

** The river access is closed at 10:00 p.m.  This is STRICTLY ENFORCED due to past trouble in the area.</groundspeak:long_description>

FTF can have an unactivated Cointown geocoin courtesy of GeoJenC.

I like the icons associated with the various Geocoins so I decided to try this type of cache.  Travel Bugs are also welcome and there might be room for small trade items to keep the interest of the kids.

The cache is less than 50 ft from parking with easy terrain.  There is a drop off near the cache so keep an eye on the little ones.

Permission was given by the very friendly people at the Church who's property this cache is on.  Please be respectful of this type of facility and not attempt during services or if an activity is taking place.

*DO NOT try to access this cache from the highway, you can take Hwy65 to Evans road (west) follow the road and take Southwood (north) to the cache.

**Note &quot;Copy Coins&quot; will be thrown away**

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kickoff/parking coordinates are: N 37 09.255 W 093 18.514 You
can get here going South on Ferguson from Battlefield. Please park
here, there are closer areas to park but they are in neighborhoods
and apartment parking and require the crossing of surprisingly busy
streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distance to the cache will be about .20 from the parking
coordinates over mostly flat terrain, however there will be some
bushwacking required the last 20 feet or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After very heavy rains the walk could be muddy and the cache
could be unaccessible at these times. The cache is on high ground
and should not flood. Please do not attempt at night since the
parking is still near housing and would probably raise unwanted
attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original cache contents were a premade cache given to me on
my birthday by GeoJenC. I have a travel bug I have been waiting to
send out I named Tailgater, so Jenny made a cache filled with
Football items so I would have an appropriate place to start it's
travels.&lt;/p&gt;
I KNOW THERE ARE CLOSER PLACES TO PARK, I WAS ASKED NOT TO HAVE
PEOPLE PARK THERE WHEN GETTING PERMISSION FOR PLACING THE
CACHE.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;*** Just a heads-up, pay attention to the attributes: THORNS,
TICKS, POISON IVY AND POSSIBLY BEES in the cache area. Watch out
for the very big Groundhog holes!! Not much I can do about these
but give an additional warning.&lt;/p&gt;

I parked a block away and froggered my way across Walnut Lawn. Found some thorns and then the cache. Dropped of a TB that I have been hauling around for a few days. Didn't find any others in the cache.

 * Please try to do this cache around the business hours and not
late at night, it is located very near a bank and you don’t want
them to “come for you”. Also you can’t get any of the information
if they are not open. &lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located downtown Ash Grove, Missouri, on Main Street, so it is very
easy to get to.

&lt;p&gt;This cache will
     have a multi purpose in a way. One to have a cache close to my
     home coordinates, second to add more fun to the area, and
     third even have the chance to get a few waymarks while you are
     in town if you are into that part. Do a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.waymarking.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;waymark&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; search on that
     site for postal code &lt;b&gt;65604&lt;/b&gt; and it will come up with a
     bunch.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Nothing to historic or special about the cache itself but the area
is full of history, and there are a few more traditional caches in
the area that you can grab while you are here. Main street has a
few things to offer also, there is a restaurant, bar, historical
museum, library, antique shop, candle shop, music shop, art shop,
and a few others…..&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is hidden outside, so you won’t have to worry about time
limits, it will be available 24/7. If you have been caching a long
time it will become obvious where the cache is, if not, you might
have to have help with the hint. There should be room in there for
A LOT OF GOODIES. Main Street can be very busy at times, so watch
for muggles. There is plenty of sitting room and even a little
table to rummage thru the goodies. Most of the stores/shops in the
area know I am hiding one here so they won’t call the local police
on ya.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There is also a couple WiFi Hotspot here in this area. I am working
on of my own and should be up and running correctly by the time
this cache hits the net. So if you are like me and like to have
your PSP or Laptop with you, it really helps when searching or
logging that find fast, or even to hunt for the next closest if you
haven't already programmed your GPS.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Original contents are in two butter dish's and will be, Autograph
Baseball Card from Don Demeter 1963 Detroit Tigers, Trackable
Dollar, GeoCoin, Calculator, 4 or 5 key rings, ALOT of Beanie
Babies, and who knows what all else, filled to the rim. So FTF will
have a chance for a nice prize.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 ** The owner of
     the building and proprietor of the store granted permission
     for this hide. Be sure to step in and say hi to my mom while
     you are there if it's open, hours should be Tue-Sat 10am to
     4pm, (Nedra) She is the one that thought it would be neat to
     have one here. She likes to meet and talk to people.&lt;/p&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Greetings from Fr. Moses:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Theotokos &quot;Unexpected Joy&quot; Orthodox Church!&lt;br/&gt;
We are a mission of the Orthodox Church in America, located in Ash
Grove, a small town about 20 miles from Springfield, in southwest
Missouri.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Our membership is multi-ethnic, and we follow the Old (Julian)
Calendar, and all services are in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;u&gt;This will be a quick Park N Grab here in Ash
Grove.  Nothing major about the hide, and I am sure you have
seen this type of container before.  Not a total micro/nano :)
just your normal size film canister.  It's NOT on the sign, so
no need to get splinters ;) heheheh  Enjoy the country side
and add another smiley to your list.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello all, Another history lesson to go along with this cache
and the area you will be in today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One note before
we begin, if you do go all the way up the path, PLEASE KEEP THE
GATE CLOSED, there are cows in the field and they don't need to be
out on the road roaming around.  The cache is not through the
gate, but you are welcome to take the  hike up to the
cemetery.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASH GROVE: The final resting place for former
slaves, rural black families and several souls whose names are lost
to time has gained national recognition. Ash Grove's Berry Cemetery
has been named to the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 130-year-old cemetery was deeded as a burial
place for &quot;Slaves, paupers and Indians&quot; who were not allowed
interment at the Ash Grove Cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it's all that's left of a once-thriving black
community in northwest Greene County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They were husbands and wives and children, a
community of people that had hope in the generations to come,&quot; said
Moses Berry, great-grandson of the cemetery's founder, William H.
Berry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;They built their own homes. They built their own
schools. They worked and prayed for their community and left behind
a loving legacy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses Berry, an Orthodox priest who spent most of
his life away from the Ozarks, now lives adjacent to the cemetery
on his great-grandfather's farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berry said his family had always maintained the
cemetery, but it had fallen into neglect before he inherited the
nearby farm eight years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We rescued that cemetery from the woods,&quot; said
Berry. &quot;Tombstones had been knocked down by grazing cattle. We had
to fill dirt in some of the graves that had sunken.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of many volunteers, much of the
one-acre burial ground has been cleared of brush, fenced in and
nursed back to a respectable state. But Berry worries about what
will happen after he can no longer care for the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sought the National Register designation as a
way to encourage future generations, and especially
African-Americans, to remember the cemetery's significance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Berry Cemetery nomination was accepted on the
National Register on Nov. 13. Berry received notification of the
designation in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berry said he hopes the National Registry
designation will help preserve not only the memory of a vanished
black community, but the segregated world in which it
functioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It will be a place where future generations can
look back and recognize what their ancestors accomplished. It says,
'My life is connected to more than just the present.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
---------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;OK, this should be another quick Park N Grab,
Cache is not on or past the gate, again, if you do go up to the
cemetery, PLEASE keep the gate closed. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;ALSO, If you drop the container, it's a goner
:)  No big deal really, just let me know and I will replace
it, so   BE SURE YOU HAVE A GOOD HOLD ON IT, BOTH TAKING
OUT AND PUTTING IN.   THANKS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Ok, the original &quot;AH CHOO! CHOO CACHE&quot;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC266FY&quot;&gt;(GC266FY)&lt;/a&gt; was one of my favorites
and I hated to see it go, but I know how things change.  So,
here is a quick rundown of the original.  Nothing has changed
about the location and dangers of this area if you have small
kids.   Watch them close if they get out of the
vehicle.  It is a very nice place and you will have fun
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the old cache page:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATTENTION!!&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is in no way under the bridge down in the valley.. DO
NOT GO DOWN THERE..  You do not need to cross any barrier or
fence.  If you have kids they may need to stay in the car on
this one just because the guardrail of the bridge has gaps in
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now
to the fun part.. :)&lt;br/&gt;
This is an spot that myself and BegHef32 found while caching
through the Ash Grove area.  While we were there, I asked him
about hiding a cache at this location since out of my 500 caches
finds, this is the most amazing place that I have ever
seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be a very quick park and grab which is on
fairly level ground.  After nabbing the smiley, take time to
ennjoy the view and maybe even take some photos.  I hope
youenjoy this one.. bring your own pen as the container will be too
small to hold one.. parking is available on the north side of the
bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you want an awesome view of where you will be going,
click the link below.. Note:  It will open up a new page in
your browser.  It is safe and virus free.  But with all
things in life, if you don't want to take a chance that's cool
too.  I have been using this site for quite some time and
never had a problem with it.....&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of today :)  06/02/2011, I have my fisheye lens now and
redid the pano :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the link above does not work, here is another one, some

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BEWARE: This cache is dangerous and should only be
attempted by those properly trained in rock climbing or rappelling.
Always perform unfamiliar maneuvers in a safe environment before
attempting them in the field. Never rappel or climb alone. Always
use properly maintained gear and know how to use it. Not following
these warnings could result in serious injury or even death. All
participants visit the cliff at their own risk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Area and The History&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Located two hours south of Kansas City and about 30 minutes west
of Osceola, MO is the town of Monegaw Springs, MO. While there
isn't much left of the original town the area has a rich history
worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache has been placed at a location known as Younger's
Lookout, which is a vista at the top of a cliff on the shore of the
former Osage River, now Truman Lake/Reservoir. Younger's Lookout is
named after the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James-Younger_Gang&quot;&gt;Younger Gang&lt;/a&gt;, a notorious group of outlaws including
Jesse James that used these cliffs as a hide-out from which they
could see the surrounding land for miles. The nearby town of
Monegaw Springs was the site of a famous deadly shootout between
the Younger Gang and the sherrif in 1874.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the river from Younger's Lookout you will see the remains
of the historic &lt;a href=&quot;http://bridgehunter.com/mo/st-clair/monegaw/&quot;&gt;Monegaw Springs Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, and at the bottom of the
climbing route you will see a few collapsed caves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Getting to The Cache&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is hung on a climbing bolt half way down the cliff at
Younger's Lookout, making the cache accessible only by rock
climbing the route or by anchoring a rope from the top and
rappelling. For rigging a rope at the top of the cliff there are
numerous trees to use as an anchor, but make sure to use a backup
anchor or two behind your main anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rappelling&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those attempting to rappel down to this cache should bring at
least 100 feet of rope. There is no landing to rappel to, instead
one must stop their rappel half way down and do all work while only
hanging from the rope. This means that one should know how and have
the proper equipment to lock off their rappel device in order to
retrieve, sign, and replace the cache as found while hanging hands
free on the rope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Again, you will have nothing to stand on or otherwise
stabilize yourself to retrieve, sign, or replace the cache other
than your rope.&lt;/em&gt; As a reminder, with all vertical sports all
unfamiliar techniques should be practiced in a safe environment
before being executed on a rope in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rock Climbing&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I am no climber, and I have no knowledge as to the
difficulty of this route or the condition of its bolts. With my
limited knowledge of rock climbing I would have to guess this is an
intermediate route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rock climbers could either lead climb using the bolted route or
setup an anchor and top rope climb to the cache. I have been told
that this route is listed in some climbing books, but I am not
certain wich books those are. Any better information that could be
provided by any climbers that visit this route would be
appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Required Gear&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rappelling or rock climbing gear. This should always include
but is not limited to a climbing harness, rope, helmet, locking
carabiners, lockable rappel device, and gloves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweezers to extract the log from the cache container.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An adjustable wrench to open/close the mallion the cache
container is attached by.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your own writing utensil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food, water, tp, full tank of gas (see &quot;Services&quot; below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Signing The Cache&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No piggybacking here folks. Don't sign anybody else's name for
them, you did the work to get there, shouldn't they have to as
well? Nobody should sign the log or claim the cache on
geocaching.com unless they have actually climbed to, rappelled to,
or otherwise actually visited the precise location where the cache
is attached to the cliff, retrieved the cache, and signed the log
themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Services&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no gas stations, restrooms, convenience stores,
drinking water, or cell phone signal anywhere near this cache.
Bring everything you need for a self-supported day, including a
full tank of gas. The nearest services are about 30 minutes away in
Osceola, MO. After a hard day of caching I recommend Sugarfoot BBQ
in Osceola, MO for refreshments and caloric content (Just off
MO-13, head West on MO-82 from MO-13 in Osceola)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BEWARE: This cache is dangerous and should only be
attempted by those properly trained in rock climbing or rappelling.
Always perform unfamiliar maneuvers in a safe environment before
attempting them in the field. Never rappel or climb alone. Always
use properly maintained gear and know how to use it. Not following
these warnings could result in serious injury or even death. All
participants visit the cliff at their own risk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also known as GC2XYK6&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

As this is our favorite place to camp, we would like to bring more people to this great park. Cache is a blue welding rod container about 2 feet long.

I used to listen to Steve Martin all the time. I had an extra decon container I thought should go out. Watch out for muggles. 

The area has changed since I initially put out this cache.  It is now a wetland area so be prepared.

For those that don’t know, IPTV is the only television station in Iowa with coverage in all 99 counties.  They have 9 Digital transmitters and 8 Digital translators.

There was a thick coating of ice on everything and the windchill made hunts short which brought my find/DNF average just above 50%. The fresh layer of snow upped the difficulty and terrain just a tad.

Parked nearby and was worried that the guy plowing in the tracked bobcat might muggle me but the cache was nicely placed out of view. Thank You! for using a small container which made the hunt nice and easy.

The cache was crammed full with stuff and I removed a thing or two to make room (A pink golf ball?).

Very nice hanger too!

Cache is in good shape. Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

I say this because you will be looking in the parking lot of City Hall and the Police Station.  You will not need to use the &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; method of caching here, the cache is in plain sight.  It is not on the fence, the fence is private property so please be respectful or you may get to meet the local police.  You may also get taunted by the police if you take too long trying to find it. They know where it is at but won't help you.

Have fun and good luck.  There are Muggles everywhere (especially on Tuesday from 3-7) so use geo-stealth. There will be no hints or clues until it has a couple finds and then we will see if we need one.

Cold, weather moving in, dressed for the conditions.

Ah ha!  :)  Why was it so easy this time.  :)  I think the owner might of helped me out.

It was the end of a long day and Ankeny was keeping me plenty busy but I knew I had to visit this one before the day was done.

Sun was getting low, snow was flying and the wind had picked up. Stayed in the car for a few extra minutes to charge up with heat and read the prior logs.

Mmmm.. Not much there.

Steeled myself and strolled over and after checking a few spots the cache was in hand. Took just a few minutes.

Woo hoo!

Took it back to the car to thaw the cleverly crafted container and after getting it open I marveled at the fine craftsmanship.

Very nicely done!

Logged, put it back together and back out into the cold to replace. Hopefully I didn't replace it too well.

I am going to miss my repeat visits to this place.

Thanks for the cache!

(PS After getting caught up with my logging I discovered this was find #4200.  :)  Very worthy of a milestone.)</groundspeak:text>

Sitting on the bench might give you a bit of a better perspective to find the cache, but it probably won't put you any closer to it. The cache is designed to be winter friendly, but in the heavy snow it might take just a little bit of effort to uncover it. It's not buried, in fact there might not even be much snow touching it; just hiding it. Be on the lookout for a classic &quot;regular&quot; size cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

If only walls (or fences) could talk. The large grassy area enclosed in the fence has been the location of various businesses. Many years ago it was a leather tannery, then a meat processing facility, which closed after a large fire. A few years ago, when the governor of Minnesota made a visit to Albert Lea, there was even an idea pitched for a new Vikings' stadium to be located here. Imagine... Albert Lea as home of the Minnesota Vikings. Skol Vikings!

Skol Vikings

Skol Vikings, let's win this game,
Skol Vikings, honor your name,
Go get that first down,
Then get a touchdown.
Rock 'em . . . Sock 'em
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Go Vikings, run up the score,
You'll hear us yell for more. . .

Take some time to walk the trails and enjoy the scenery and wild life. Thanks to the efforts of the Shell Rock River Watershed board and many others, including the tax payers of Albert Lea, the lake and shoreline have become much more beautiful over the last few years.

There is no need to disturb the plants or flowers around the sign while looking for this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

We once found a cache in a group of pine trees, and the cache description mentioned the cache owner thinking of all the time potential finders would spend in the poking pine needles. So in honor of the owner of that cache, have a great time finding this cache in the tree.

You'll be looking for a small jar hanging from the tree. Have fun!!</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is located very near the main play structure, so extreme stealth may be required. Not only is this cache very kid friendly, but having some kids along for the hunt may act as a great decoy.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;LAGOON PARK – THE JEWEL OF
JORDAN!&lt;/b&gt;

Lagoon Park is the largest of Jordan’s city parks and is
located in the heart of town. It contains several recreational
features and opportunities for everyone to enjoy the great
outdoors!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The biggest and most obvious of these features is the Mill Pond.
The Mill Pond covers 17 acres and is 18 feet at its deepest. The
lake was completely restored in 2008. It was dredged, rebuilt,
improved, refilled and restocked with various spices of fish. Since
the restoration project, it is not uncommon to see people swimming,
fishing, canoeing, and sunning on the beach.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Adjacent to the Mill Pond, Sand Creek flows towards another unique
feature of the park - Sand Creek Falls. While I have never tried
it, I hear of kayakers who run Sand Creek, and fishermen are often
seen wetting a line in the plunge pool.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Like any good municipal park, there is a playground, several picnic
pavilions, numerous picnic tables, a gazebo, horseshoe stations,
two sand volleyball courts, large open areas, a bathroom, and a
warming house (for winter ice skaters).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
At the north end of the park is a patriotic display. There is a
flagpole ensemble, the historic cannon display (refurbished in
2011), and a bench dedicated to our home-town local hero, Spc.
Joshua R. Anderson who was killed in action in Iraq January of
2008.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
With so much recreational opportunities available, it only made
sense that GeoCaching should be part of the plethora of
choices.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Currently, there is one cache located at the south end of the park,
(&lt;i&gt;be sure to add that one to your list too&lt;/i&gt;). Lagoon Park has
been home to several previous caches located at various places
throughout the park (&lt;i&gt;including one of my own&lt;/i&gt;) that have
since been archived. I felt it was time for Jordan to have a
&quot;walking tour&quot; multi cache, and after tossing a couple of different
ideas around, I settled on this walking tour of Lagoon Park.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I hope you enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ABOUT THIS CACHE.&lt;/b&gt;

There are four stages to this Cache. Stages one and two may be a
little more challenging.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;br/&gt;
STAGE ONE IS &lt;u&gt;NOT&lt;/u&gt; LOCATED IN THE ROCKS!!! IT CAN BE RETRIEVED
FROM THE PAVED PATH!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The encrypted hint should help without giving it away
completely.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you complete the whole series, you will have walked close to a
mile and have seen most of what Lagoon Park has to offer! &lt;b&gt;Be
sure to watch out for muggles! Lots of 'em all around!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This multi cache should prove to be family friendly. The container
is suitable for a log book and small tradables, trinkets or travel
bugs. FTF prize was a presidential $1 coin.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Make an “event” out of it. Plan a picnic, some
swimming, fishing, playing, skating, and of course…&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
GEOCACHING!!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The following story is for entertainment purposes only.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Any resemblance to persons, places, or situations either living or
dead, real or fictitious may be purely coincidental.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

Once upon a time there was a police dispatcher who received a radio
transmission from a member of his local fire department.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It would seem that the member of the fire department observed what
they felt was a &quot;suspicious person&quot; hiding an object that gave off
a &quot;worrisome silhouette&quot; in a &quot;precarious position&quot;. (&lt;i&gt;Apparently
this object may or may not have looked a little bit like a green
colored stick of TNT&lt;/i&gt;.)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Given the totality of the facts surrounding this situation, the
member of the fire department called for some assistance from the
the local police department to assist him ascertaining the true
nature of this potentially nefarious act.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The police dispatcher who answered the call for service (&lt;i&gt;being a
GeoCacher himself&lt;/i&gt;) recognized this collection of facts as a
potentional GeoCacher, possibly hiding a new GeoCache. Yet, our
dispatcher had an obligation to dispatch the local police
department to assist the local fire department (&lt;i&gt;in the interest
of public safety&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
After dispatching the police to assist the fire department, the
police dispatcher sent a message to the responding officers sharing
his suspicions.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When the police arrived, the police and fire department worked
together to locate the object, the &quot;suspicious person&quot; was located,
and the dispatcher's suspicions were confirmed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Well, the dispatcher (&lt;i&gt;having never found a FTF before&lt;/i&gt;)
thought that he may have stumbled accross the PERFECT situation for
his first FTF! In fact, if this &quot;suspicious person&quot; had actually
just placed the cache, the dispatcher could make the find prior to
it even being published!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
What a wonderful FTF story this would make for the logs!!!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
But, the bad news was the dispatcher did not have his GPSr with him
that day. He asked himself &quot;How hard could it be&quot;? He had a
detailed description of the &quot;precarious position&quot; - there was snow
on the ground - foot prints easily visible - and, he had not had
his lunch break yet!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Well, the dispatcher did what any &quot;desperate for a FTF&quot; GeoCacher
would do. He punched out for his lunch break and headed off for his
very first FTF!! (&lt;i&gt;Obeying all traffic laws while on the
way&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When he arrived, the police department and fire department had
already cleared the scene. Realizing this park looked much bigger
in &quot;real life&quot; (&lt;i&gt;as opposed to his CAD map&lt;/i&gt;), he started off
looking for the new cache. After finding what he was certain MUST
have been the original sight, searching and searching the
surrounding area, and not finding the new cache, the dispatcher
headed back to his car, head bowed in defeat.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So much for that FTF.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
He returned to the dispatch center, and sent a message out to his
police officers about his crushing defeat.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A few minutes later, one of the responding police officers arrived
at police headquarters, and stepped into the dispatch center. He
plopped the cache on this dispatchers desk, and said &quot;Here it
is&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To an untrained eye, the dispatcher had to admit that the cache did
indeed have a &quot;cartoonish&quot; TNT look to it. But, more embarrassing
to the dispatcher - the cache was &lt;b&gt;NOT NEW&lt;/b&gt;. It had been in
play for several months. It would seem in his excitement to make a
first FTF - he did not even consider the fact that the &quot;suspicious
person&quot; could have been someone &quot;finding&quot; the cache as opposed to
someone &quot;hiding&quot; it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The officer advised the dispatcher that he had left a message
(&lt;i&gt;via geocaching.com&lt;/i&gt;) to the owner of the cache that it had
been &quot;recovered&quot; by the police department, and that if he was
interested in retrieving the cache - to call and make arrangements
to pick it up.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The dispatcher offered his services to the police officer. He told
the officer that he would get in touch with the cache owner and
make arrangements to return the cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The owner did indeed contact the police department through the
dispatcher. The owner adivsed the dispatcher that he would archive
the cache site and that the dispatcher could do whatever he wanted
with the cache. The dispatcher told the owner that he would keep
the cache, and promised that he would do some &quot;&lt;b&gt;GEOCACHE
RECYCLING&lt;/b&gt;&quot; by putting it back out into play somewhere
else.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The dispatcher did just that, and the GeoCache lived happily ever
after.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Hmmm... Ya know, this story reminds me of a different cache I have
stumbled accross in my GeoCaching adventures... Check the most
recent logs on the archived &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC20MHJ&quot;&gt;GC20MHJ - H Wadsworth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Coincidence?? Maybe...&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Or is it something as simple as the nature of the business adjacent
to this cache? I guess you have to be the judge!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please try to use the parking coordinates provided (&lt;i&gt;on
Corporate Drive - also known as Timber Line Court&lt;/i&gt;). Cache is
located on a trail between a residential neighborhood and an
industrial park, and the trail comes pretty close in proximity to a
couple of houses in the neighborhood. A lot of extra activity on
the residential side may stir up some &quot;muggle&quot; attention.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I would HATE to have the police called on this cache!&lt;/b&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was NOT a walk in the park, unless I approached it from the wrong end. Nice stroll along the creek. But it was a long way up an awful steep hill with very slippery grass. I wonder if the owner lives in one of the houses at the top of the hill and placed it by going through his/her backyard to just below the slope. 

However, it was a very clever hide. Best if one looks to the north and it is definitely winter friendly. But according to my GPS, it was about 26 feet off the listed coordinates. 

Fun one! TFTC!!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br/&gt;
It was a warm, dark September evening in 1958. August Kahl and his
fifteen year old son, Loren were loading tomatoes into their farm
truck so they could get an early start to market in South St. Paul
the next morning.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The sound of a jet bomber high overhead was nothing new to the
Kahls. They had heard the sound before. There were the new jet
airliners landing at Wold-Chamberlain, fifteen miles away, and
there were the Air Force bombers on training missions that could be
heard every so often. But tonight the sound seemed unusual, Loren
Kahl followed the path of the sound as it circled around him, it
was getting louder and louder. All at once there was a heavy
&quot;booom&quot; from an area on the other side of the barn. For an instant,
the farm light blinked out, then the Kahls were enveloped in a
fireball that swirled around both sides of the barn. They began to
run towards the farmhouse a hundred yards away...but the fireball
seemed to surround them. The ground was on fire and a noisy wind
was blasting at their unprotected skin. Loren could feel the skin
on his face tighten from the heat, August Kahl tripped on something
and fell headlong into the roaring ground fire, regained his
footing and found his way to the house.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Inside the house, six other members of August's family were
struggling to understand what had happened. The house was an
inferno. Part of the stairway had been carried away and Grandpa
Kahl needed help to get to the bottom. They managed their way out
of the house and staggered some distance away from the heat to look
back and catch their breath, most of them in shock and aghast at
the scene.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Only scant minutes before the cause of the massive explosion and
fire had been an Air Force B-52D Stratofortress maneuvering at
36,400 feet overhead. On a Cold War training mission to simulate a
nuclear strike on the Twin Cities, the plane had been home to six
flight crewmembers and two instructors. The plane from the 69th
Bomb Squadron 42nd Bomb Wing of SAC, had departed Loring Air Force
Base, Limestone, Maine earlier in the day. It had made ECM runs at
Bath, Maine, Albany, New York, Williamsport, PA, Youngstown, Ohio,
and Bellefonte, Ohio. The flight had continued to Richmond,
Indiana, where a GPI Nav-bomb run was started, and which was to
terminate at Minneapolis. There it would be scored for accuracy
from the Air Force Radar Bombing site at Wold-Chamberlain.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Four times the big plane crossed the target with &quot;bombs away&quot; for
the fourth run at 2016CST, Minneapolis. As it rolled off the last
run something went wrong. An elevator trim &quot;excursion&quot; began to
send tremors through the ship. Whatever happened will never be
known, for at this point the tail broke off the airplane, and it
began a high speed plunge straight for the ground. There was no
remark from the crew, and no cockpit voice recorder or black box to
record the last moments. From 36,400 feet, the ship dove towards
earth, and in no more than 108 seconds had crossed through 8.000
feet Moments later, control tower personnel at Wold-Chamberlain
witnessed an explosion in the direction of Inver Grove Heights. The
plane's main structure had impacted on the August Kahl farm a few
miles south of South St. Paul Airport.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Though the crew had remained silent, they had never the less taken
action. Four crewmembers had ejection seats and fired themselves
out into the night almost immediately. The other four crew,
including the two instructors, had no ejection seats.. It was for
them to find an open hatch and leap to safety. Perhaps the
centrifugal force kept them pinned to their crew positions, for
they were unable to exit and rode the plane to the ground, being
consumed in the explosion and fire.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Of the four that ejected and were subjected to a 600 mile per hour
jetstream from outside the ship, flailing arms and legs and contact
with the aircraft structure produced fatal injuries to three. They
were found long after searchers and investigators had arrived,
still strapped in their useless seats, their parachutes ripped to
shreds by air blasts. The co-pilot was the singular survivor. He
had landed in a tree on a farm adjoining the Kahl property.
Neighbors helped him walk to a waiting ambulance some time after
the crash.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Ariel photos taken the morning after the crash showed that the
plane had come in at a flat angle, clipping off the top of a
billboard alongside state highway 52., just fifty yards from the
impact spot. Five craters marked the positions the fuselage and
each pod of two engines. One of the engines had bulleted through
the Kahl farmhouse, smashing off the lower staircase. Pieces large
and small littered the entire farm and spread across neighboring
farms. The tail of the aircraft was found three miles to the
west.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Though the event was traumatic and carried ad front page news in
local newspapers for the next two days, apart from convincing local
citizens that the plane was not carrying nuclear weapons, the
accident was soon hushed up. Recoverable pieces of the aircraft
were taken to the big Air Force Reserve hanger at Wold-Chamberlain
where they were laid out for the Air Force Accident Investigation
team. No further news was given to the public.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As a result of the investigation, numerous changes were adopted in
both the ejection procedure, and in the design of the ejection
seats themselves.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
For the Kahl Family, with August and Loren badly burned, and the
other family members burned and traumatized, they were able to
recover enough compensation to pay for their hospitalization and to
build a new farmhouse on a different spot of ground than where the
former house had stood. In the fall of 1995 when the Kahl farm was
purchased by the city of Inver Grove Heights, these buildings were
burned.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The accident happened on September 16, 1958.
Thirty-eight years later, on September 14, 1996, a stone memorial
was dedicated on the spot where the bomber had crashed. Under the
sponsorship of the Minnesota Aviation Hall of Fame, all of the
major aviation museums in the Twin City area lent their support,
both financially and physically to provide, at long last, a marker
to honor these Cold War Veterans who gave their lives for their
country. Today the stone with a fine etched tablet reminds all
passersby of the sacrifice of these men. The location of the
memorial is at the intersection of Broderick Blvd. And Brooks Blvd.
Near the Inver Hills Community College, alongside Highway 52 in
Inver Grove Heights.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Tired of the bugs while caching we stopped here and watched the&lt;br/&gt;birds play and bathe. Decided to stash a cache here for either a&lt;br/&gt;quick park and grab or great start to the loop around this nice&lt;br/&gt;lake trail. This is smaller than a film container so you will need&lt;br/&gt;your own crayon. Very easy find though.

The wildlife refuge has hiking trails, the education and vistor center, nature photography, wildlife observation, and interpretive programs.

The Long Meadow Lake Unit includes a Hillside trail, Long Meadow Lake trail, Bass Ponds, Hogback Ridge trail, Bluff trail, State Corridor trail, I-494 walkway, and the visitor center.

The Long Meadow Lake Overlook near the visitor center includes 2 free to use telescopes. One of those telescopes has an ID number on it. Use that ID number as the pass code to log this cache.  Enjoy the great view which changes dramatically with the seasons.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located in a medium-sized City of Inver Grove Heights park, that is
complete with a plastic play area for kids, basketball and tennis
courts, and some wooded trails. Not too far from Highway 3, Highway
52 (which, by the way, Garmin Mapsource has labelled backwards),
and Interstate 494. There is also a historic church nearby, as well
as a lake teeming with wildlife. The park closes nightly at
10:00pm.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since almost everyone associates the same thing with the
place-name of Salem, we decided to make this kind of a mystery
cache--all of our initial trade items are wrapped, with simple
clues telling what the contents are--rest assured, everything is
harmless. Feel free to trade whatever you like, wrapped or
unwrapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5/7/03--I just updated the coordinates, by changing the .023 to
.013 in the Latitude--my GPS has been right on whenever I've
checked this cache, so I thought it was everyone else, since the
coords posted in the logs vary quite a bit, but since I copied the
coordinates from my GPS to the cache page by hand, I might've
mistyped them. Sorry about that, and I hope you all enjoyed the
extra challenge. (I just updated the software in my GPS and lost
all the waypoints I had stored, so I don't know if my coordinates
matched).&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mngca.org&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: Park officials do read the cache logs, so please be
sure to stay on the trail to get as close to the cache as possible,
etc. Also note anything positive you do in the area i.e. cached and
trashed, and note how you enjoyed the park. Thank You.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Activites at the fort now include military drills, daily cannon firing, blacksmithing, hearth-cooking, period crafts , and games. There is an admission fee to get inside the actual fort.

After the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862, approximately 1,600 Dakota women, children, and elderly men were held at an internment camp next to the fort. Many died from outbreaks of disease. In 1863 the remaining people in the camp were placed on steamboats and sent to the Crow Creek reservation in South Dakota.

There is a sign at the coordinates which has more information about the internment camp. The code phrase can be found on the sign. The photographer who took the photo is __________.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Valley Park is the largest City of Mendota Heights Park, at 94.4
acres. It has a natural area, paved and dirt trails, a softball
field, soccer fields, tennis courts, a basketball hoop, play
equipment, and a picnic shelter. I had driven past on the freeway
on my way to work, and finally decided to come down and check it
out, and found some cache locations, one of which I'm going to use.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not too far from the paved trail through the park. Remember, the
most direct way isn't usually the easiest--there are plenty of game
trails in the area. The parking lot with all the amenities is
located at N 44°53.476, W 093°07.647. Cache is in a camoflage
painted ammo can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mngca.org&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: Park officials do read the cache logs, so please be
sure to stay on the trail to get as close to the cache as possible,
etc. Also note anything positive you do in the area i.e. cached and
trashed, and note how you enjoyed the park. Thank You.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've checked the coordinates a few times based on the
logs--sometimes my GPS brings me right to the cache, and 5 minutes
later, it shows me at 50 feet away, and other times, it'll show me
at 50 feet away when I get there, and 5 minutes later, it'll be
right on. All I can figure is that there is quite a bit of signal
bounce in the area due to the high-tension wires overhead, the
freeway nearby, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKEE7F - Valley Park parking area&lt;br/&gt;N 44° 53.576 W 093° 07.647</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow has been described as the first truly American poet. His works took distinctly American themes and made them accessible to a worldwide audience. After reviewing Henry Rowe Schoolcraft's publication on the traditions of the Ojibwe Indians of Minnesota and seeing an early photograph of Minnehaha Falls, Longfellow penned 5,314 chanting lines of epic poetry and titled it Hiawatha.
 
Hiawatha became America's most widely read poem of the 19th Century, spreading the fame of Minnehaha Falls and the uppermost regions of the Mississippi. Today, a statue of Hiawatha carrying his bride Minnehaha graces Minnehaha Park, and the Minneapolis Park System operates an information center in a scale replica of Longfellow's home. Unfortunately, the poem also spread wide misconceptions about Ojibwa Traditions, the real history of Minnesota, and the true identity of the famous chief.
 
Who was Hiawatha? The historic figure lived centuries earlier and half a continent away among the Iroquois Nation in New England. In the early 15th Century, about a hundred years before Columbus undertook his voyage, chaos and warfare reigned among the tribes. Hiawatha began as a solitary warrior, living in isolation until called by the supernatural being Deganawida to promote peace among the tribes of the Iroquois. Hiawatha became the founder of the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and his internal peacekeeping measures helped the Five Nations grow and prosper.
 
So how did Longfellow transport Hiawatha across the country? In some Iroquois dialects, Hiawatha closely resembles the name of the deity Tahiawagi. Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, an extensive Ojibwa scholar, made an erroneous connection between Tahiawagi and Manabozo, a deity of similar feats and renowned among the Ojibwas in Minnesota. When Longfellow followed the false trail Schoolcraft laid in his book on Indian legends, the fictional Hiawatha was the result.
 
This very beautiful statue of Hiawatha carrying Minnehaha is on a small island in Minnehaha Creek, just a short distance above Minnehaha Falls. Hiawatha was an Objibwe warrior and Minnehaha was his true love. Minnehaha in the Dakota language means &quot;laughing waters.&quot;
 
Hiawatha and Minnehaha were - characters in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem, The Song of Hiawatha. The poem is based the myths and legends of Indian tribes in the north country, around lakes Michigan and Superior.
 
It took Longfellow about 18 months to write The Song of Hiawatha in 1854-1855. This masterpiece was the most widely read poem in America in the 19th century. Today it remains one of the best known and most loved poems in all of American literature. 

 Here is a familiar excerpt:
&quot;By the shores of Gitche Gumee, 
By the shining Big-Sea-Water, 
Stood the wigwam of Nokomis, 
Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis. 
Dark behind it rose the forest, 
Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees, 
Rose the firs with cones upon them; 
Bright before it beat the water, 
Beat the clear and sunny water, 
Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water. &quot;

To find the code phrase to log this virtual cache, locate the plaque describing the Hiawatha and Minnehaha statue. The plaque is very close to the posted coordinates. According to the plaque, the funds to erect the statue were contibuted principally by the _________ _________ of Minesota. The words in the blanks above are the code phrase. </groundspeak:long_description>

attractive and sometimes very aromatic, little park in the heart of
Minneapolis. Take note of the ratings on this cache. They are
fairly accurate so you should be able to do this one during your
work lunch hour and not come back in too bad of shape.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; You will be looking for a peanut butter jar containing a log book,
pencil and a bunch of brand new trinkets.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Do NOT attempt to find this cache unless you promise to place the
cache as good or better than you found it. There are many shady
characters walking this area so we don't want to lose the cache. I
do not know first hand, but I am guessing you might NOT want to do
this at night. You never know what's going on down in the
bluffs.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
For easier access, take the stairs closest to St. Anthony Main, the
one right past Excel Energy.</groundspeak:long_description>

Spent the afternoon volunteering at the State Fair today, half the day with the MN Geocachers Association at the DNR building and the evening supporting Tarryl Clark at the DFL. Grabbed one cache going to fair and now a couple more on the way home.

Found this one without much trouble, even in the dark, STL and replaced. One bit of confusion for me, when I went to find the next nearest cache my GPS gave me a second Open and Affirming chace, 40' away. Don't know what that was about. I hate not knowing.

Larpenteur from Elmhurst Cemetery at N44°59.525',
W093°07.231'--follow a paved path past the off-leash dog area
through the Ramsey County Open Space to the City of Roseville park.
If you bring your four-legged companion along, remember they can be
off-leash in the off-leash area, but otherwise, local leash laws
apply.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Cache container is an ammo can painted to resemble a grave stone.
I'm starting to accumulate quite a few MIA travel bugs, and I
decided to release the copy tags into circulation, and be creative
in doing so. Thus the Pet Semetary cache--a place where one can put
their dead travel bugs, and watch them come back to life in a
slightly altered form. Before placing your copy bug into the cache,
be sure to virtually reclaim the bug using the number on the copy
tag, and place it in the cache using the drop-down menu when you
post a log. And please only take one bug per visit so there are
still bugs in the cache for the next finder. I'm also placing quite
a few normal trade items, to thin out my growing collection. Also
remember to cache in and trash out.

Folwell Park is 27 acres of fun! It was created in 1917 and designed to be one of the most attractive and complete neighborhood parks in the nation. Enjoy the many fields and courts or take a walk along its many paths. The commitment of the neighborhood has resulted in a popular and friendly park.

We spent about ten minutes looking in the usual sort of spots, and some spots that we felt pretty clever to think of checking, but found nothing but old chewed gum. We were toying with the notion of DNFing, but JJ decided to scratch an itch of curiosity he had ever since pulling up. Holy cats, that was it, and even better the cache title's meaning finally clicked! This is a really well-done hide, and definitely a cache to be proud of.

This is a small camouflaged container with only room for the a log. You will need your own pencil for more than just signing the log.

This area may be a dump zone for snow plows so it could be hard to get to if there gets to be a large mound here. Consider yourself warned.</groundspeak:long_description>

Extending along Bass Lake Road from Brooklyn Boulevard to Highway 100, this project will consist of many design aspects including:

    * Regional Trail Connection.  A missing segment of the regional trail system will be constructed, providing a central connection to existing regional trails.
    * Pedestrian Safety.  Design elements will encourage safe pedestrian routes and street crossings.
    * Water Quality. Biofiltration systems will enable treatment of roadway runoff that may be contaminated with chloride from de-icing efforts before it discharges into Shingle Creek.
    * Streetscaping. Multi-function aesthetic features will promote safety and beauty, including landscaping, pedestrian plaza and benches, lighting and colored concrete.  The look will be coordinated with Xerxes Avenue streetscaping to provide a consistent feel to the area.</groundspeak:long_description>

Center. The only signs of a park is the ones that say &quot;no motorized
vehicles&quot;. Parking is best along Major Ave. FTF prize was a
non-activated 2007 MnGCA geocoin.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This cache was muggled and had to be replaced. I hid a different
container than the original ammo can and hid it a little
differently and hoping this one will last. The originally hide was
placed during my year as Vice-President of the MnGCA and I am
currently the President of the Organization. I started caching in
Feburary 2007 and it has become quite the hobby. I enjoy the many
different aspects of geocaching. I am frequently at WeekNIGHT
Caching as well as many different events. I was also able to
complete the Minnesota State Parks Geocaching History Challenge
this year and I was also talked into doing the Kitchen Cove and
Lair caches this summer.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is my first hide and a tribute to my favorite type of
cache-the ammo can. When I hit my 100th find I made sure it was an
ammo can. This cache is located along the trail along Shingle Creek
in Brooklyn Center that can be taken to a number of parks in the
area. Please be careful of muggles as this is a highly used trail
by both walkers and bike riders. There is also a lot of traffic at
times on nearby road. Please re-hide as found and bring your own
pen or pencil to sign log. FTF coin for FTF goes to Team
Dogs!</groundspeak:long_description>

The hill is mainly used in the winter months for sledding but also used for general fun and horseplay. Stealth will be required when park is busy but the trees can provide some cover. Can you be king of the hill?

 Though much of the Sandplain landscape had taken its current form following the melting of all stagnant ice around 10,000 years ago, some isolated features had yet to be developed.  Peat accumulation, for example, began in earnest during the Holocene, or recent geologic time, and continues to this day in swamps and bogs of the region.  Additionally, rivers and streams have served some role in altering the landscape, slowly eroding and altering their courses.  Some other features of the Sandplain have been less static.  The Sandplain's vegetation has changed through time, both naturally and as a result of human disturbance.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This Cache has been placed by permission and has been an inactive cemetery for over 100 years.

The Foster Cemetery sits in the middle of the City of Ramsey's industrial district. Many individuals pass by this spot every day and don't even know that this piece of history is right under their nose. This cemetery was the first burial grounds in this area and is an important part of Anoka County History.

Alfred Foster who later deeded it to Ramsey Township originally owned the cemetery. It was established prior to 1860, platted in 1861, but the first known burials were those of Richard and Jane Porter who were buried there in 1852-1854 respectively. Burials were evidently made when it was open prairie as no roads lead to this area. One soldier, Charles Pitman. Company C of Minnesota Mounted Rangers is known to be buried there. The last burial in Ramsey Cemetery was that of John C. Bowers who was buried there in 1879 and who was later moved to Oakwood Cemetery in Anoka. The cemetery was abandoned in l905.

Cornelius Pitman was one of the original settlers of Ramsey. He served as one of the first supervisors of Ramsey in 1885, when Ramsey Township was organized. Records show that as early as March of 1864 Mr. Pitman was interested in improving the area, a receipt shows he received $20.00 for furnishing the lumber and for building a bridge on section line 20. He had been a member of a New England colony that made the first settlement in Ramsey Township in 1850.

The first burials at this site were in 1852 and 1854 for Richard and Jane Porter. It is said this ground was broken for the graves of settlers passing through these northern woods. Some members of the clan apparently, were stricken with fever, died and as was the practice of the time, buried along the way.

Richard and Jane Porter came to Ramsey from St. Anthony Trading Post in the spring of 1852. They lived in a log house with Mr. &amp; Mrs. William Payne. Mrs. Payne and Jane were sisters.

&quot;One day some Indians came to the cabin while the two women were alone. They were sure some white men had taken some ponies, which belonged to them. They crowded into the Porter cabin talking angrily. Jane Porter hid her small daughter behind the door just as they came into the room; she kept stepping back in the direction of the wood box, telling them the ponies were grassing on the far side of the hill. Finally one Indian stepped up and drew a long knife to Jane's throat; she quickly drew a stick from the wood box! The Indians must have admired her bravery for she succeeded in driving them from the cabin; By that time the missing ponies came into view so the lndians left with the ponies! Jane's sister, Mrs. Payne, had fainted dead away!&quot; (City of Ramsey, MN History Book 1974.)

The cemetery has been neglected and vandalized for many years. As reported in the Anoka Union Newspaper November 21,1975, Mrs. James, co-chairwoman of the Bicentennial Committee removed the headstones from the cemetery and took them to Councilwoman Beverly Oliphant's. Councilwoman Oliphant refused to take possession of the stones and Mrs. James took them home. Shortly after the mayor was notified, the sheriff arrived at Mrs. Oliphant's home and the councilwoman avoided the potential for a lawsuit for robbing a cemetery. What happened to the stolen stones has yet to be determined.

There are 14 known graves in this cemetery. Also, in an interview by a Mrs. Wilson before passing away in 1975, she told a story of 12-15 Native Americans, who converted to Christianity and were buried in unmarked graves.

The entrance to the cemetery is directly to the North and is an unmarked driveway.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located on Boy Scout Island in Elk River, MN. It is a short hike and a fun mini-adventure to get to. This is definitely not wheelchair accessible and ease of getting to GZ depends on the season. Expect a small bit of climbing and possibly wet feet. Please rehide as found or better to make this fun for the next cacher!

This is my first cache hide and was placed on my Golden 28th Birthday 9/28/11! It also is a tribute cache for my first geocaching milestone of 100 finds!  You are looking for a small camo container.

My grandparents used to live in the house adjacent to this island. I discovered this area as a boy and later camped here a couple times when I was in Boy Scouts. Always enjoyed this spot as a mini retreat.</groundspeak:long_description>

Geo-Bob is a kid that loves Geocaching.
She wanted this to be kid friendly and loaded with SWAG.
This is a pretty fun place to play with a bat and ball.
during certain times, the cache will not be available.

Needed to do abit of excavating on this one. Still, the task was clear and I was rewarded. STL and replaced, not as found. I didn't pack 12 inches of snow back on top of the cache. Soon enough.

This cache is accessible in the winter however snowshoes are recommended as the road will not be plowed.

This cache was placed in 2011 as part of the first Geonuts Passport Challenge.  Even though the challenge is over, this cache remains for your discovery.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In remembrance of the 100 people that attended a family camp
weekend getaway, I placed this cache near the camp.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We canoed around the lake, fished, ate a lot of food, sang
songs around the campfire, played games during the rain, went
biking, hiking and walking, slept very little...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;...and STILL HAD A GREAT TIME!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Original contents include about 10 new magic tricks, a few
unicycle keychains (DonB! signature item), some hotwheel cars from
&quot;lildc321&quot;, a logbook and a pencil.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please hide it as well as you find it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks, DonB!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: If you cache with kids,
please do NOT park on the highway. You can drive South a short
distance and park in the camp driveway, as long as you don't block
the entrance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Stop by to take your picture with the 30 pt buck and visit the area.  At hunting season you will find the 30 pt buck dressed in bright orange.  During the holiday season the 30 pt buck shows off his festive holiday attire.  Bring your ice skates and enjoy the skating rink with your family during the winter.  Bring a picnic lunch (or pick something up locally) and enjoy lunch at the little park.

Be sure to check out The Cuyuna Range earthcache (GC1X84C) while you're here too.</groundspeak:long_description>

Dropped a MNGCA wooden nickel in for the next guy. STL and HTR.

Don't forget to take your picture with Kahnah'beck.  Lots of stealth will be required to find this cache.

Crosby Memorial Park is on the shores of Serpent Lake, which meanders its way from Crosby to Deerwood.

The understanding is that the lake was named for the Ojibwe word “Snake”.  Snake in English did not appeal to settlers, who changed the name to Serpent.  

In 1977 the larger than life Serpent (weighing in at 2500 pounds, 20’ long and 20’ tall) arrived and was named Kahnah’bek Sagahgon, the Ojibwe name for Serpent.

The park also displays a World War II tank and a stone memorial honoring the Moving Wall which was on display in 2010.  

Enjoy the beach, campground, playground, skate park, ball field, picnic areas, and many community events at the Park!</groundspeak:long_description>

Permission obtained from the Minnesota DNR. This cache is located within the Cuyuna Country State Recreation Area.

If searching during the winter, snowshoes are recommended as the trails are not groomed or plowed.

Understanding the history of the Cuyuna Range mining era can be quite difficult.  The Armour Mine is one example of a mine with many names.  This cache is located next to the now Armour Mine Lake.

When the first shaft was put down here in 1910, it was known as the Meacham mine.  The name was soon changed to Armour Mine, and later changed again to Armour No. 1 Mine in honor of C.D. Armour and Phillip Armour, of Chicago, both of whom where stockholders and directors of the company conducting the mining.  

Yet another name given to this mine during the mining era was Interstate Mine because it was originally developed and operated by Interstate Exploration Company.  Today it is known as Armour #1.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This spot can be reached by taking the Century Road off of Hwy 502 and travelling approx. 14 kms. The cache is close to the road and the road is well maintained so it can be travelled by car.
My wife and I like to visit this area in the late fall. Her father accidently lost his life here about 100 ft from shore when his boat capsized in a stong wind and cold water while he was fishing on Oct 16/71.
We thought, why not place a cache here in his memory.
You are looking for a small camo'd lock'n'lock that has room for a few small trade items.
Congrats to Team Ffej for the FTF.</groundspeak:long_description>
