Se encuentran situado en el Campo de los Martires, junto a los bosques de la Alhambra. Accedemos a él desde Plaza Nueva, subiendo por la cuesta de Gomérez hasta llegar a la Puerta Lago e Islote de las Granadas. Una vez aquí, tomaremos por el paseo lateral derecho de los bosques de la Alhambra, que acaba junto al hotel Alhambra Palace. Enfrente vemos un paseo, por el que continuaremos, pasando junto al auditorio Manuel de Falla. Al final de este paseo se encuentra el Carmen de los Martires.

Descripción;
Actualmente este carmen consta de un palacete rodeado de bellos jardines de diferentes estilos, todo ello construido en el siglo XIX. Veremos el jardín romántico, con lago, isla,y torreón, escondidas fuentes; el jardín monacal, con cultivos de plantas aromáticas y medicinales; el jardín oriental con una fuente rodeada de palmeras; el patio islámico, con acequia y gruta. Los jardines nos sorprenderán por su variada belleza, la gran frondosidad de sus parterres y las hermosas fuentes cubiertas de musgo. Además, por su privilegiada situación, las vistas sobre la ciudad, la vega y Sierra Nevada son excelentes desde todo el recinto. Todo esto hace de este lugar uno de los más bonitos jardines de la ciudad, de visita inexcusable.

Historia;
El lugar toma su nombre de los silos y mazmorras que en él existían en tiempos de los árabes, donde se supone que algunos cristianos sufrieron Fuente bajo el Lago martirio, por lo que las Reyes Católicos erigieron una érmita dedicada a los Santos Mártires. Posteriormente se construyó en el lugar un Convento del Carmelitas descalzos, del que fue prior San Juan de la Cruz, entre 1.582 y 1.588. Aún hoy podemos contemplar en los jardines el Cedro de San Juan de la Cruz (en realidad un ciprés), del que la tradición dice que fue plantado por este santo, y que bajo su sombra escribió su obra &quot;La Noche Oscura del Alma&quot;.

El convento fue destruído en 1.842, y los terrenos adquiridos por un particular que edificó en ellos el actual palacete. En 1.958 el Ayuntamiento adquiere la finca, que pasa a propiedad pública. En el año 1.974 es vendida para la construcción de un hotel, que afortunadamente nunca se lleva a cabo, pero se pierde una zona de jardín destinada a bosque y tanto los jardines como el palacete quedan seriamente dañados. Tras la paralización de la obras, el carmen vuelve a ser de propiedad municipal, iniciándose en 1.984 su restauración, primero del placete y posteriormente del lago, acueducto y jardines, abriendose al público a medida que ésta se iba realizando.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Este cache es un homenaje a un veterano cache del mismo nombre, ubicado en la ciudad de Göteborg, Suecia.

El &quot;Göteborg Magnetic&quot; original es un cache muy, muy antiguo, habilitado en el año 2002 y aún activo en la actualidad, que se encuentra escondido en un muelle de carga en desuso junto al Museo Marítimo de Göteborg.

Recuerdo que cuando encontré dicho cache, hace ya varios años, me inundó una sensación de completa perplejidad y sorpresa. No en vano, en España no había visto nada similar, y mi visita a Escandinavia me sorprendió muy gratamente por disfrutar allí de caches escondidos con técnicas de ocultación &quot;avanzadas&quot;, y que se empleaban de manera habitual, que en nuestro país no empezaron a adoptarse hasta quizás el año 2006.

Este cache ha sido ocultado de una manera relativamente similar al original.

Hoy en día, no sorprenderá tanto a aquellos jugadores que tengan una mínima experiencia. Sin embargo para analizarlo y &quot;degustarlo&quot; convenientemente, hay que enfocarlo desde una perspectiva &quot;histórica&quot;, y retrotraernos mentalmente en el tiempo hasta hace casi 10 años; y saber que en aquella época, mientras que en toda la Comunidad de Madrid no había habilitados más de un par de caches, en algunos países europeos ya se estaban haciendo este tipo de cosas.

El &quot;Göteborg Magnetic&quot; Made in Spain es un tupper tradicional de tamaño 'regular', de los de toda la vida, ubicado en entorno urbano, en una zona relativamente céntrica de Getafe, y muy frecuentada, por tanto es imprescindible extremar las precauciones para no levantar sospechas.

Al igual que el original, el cache está ubicado en un objeto con ruedas, aunque no se mueve.</groundspeak:long_description>

Espero que os guste este observatorio y podáis relajaros un rato viendo estos pájaros.

El acceso al cache es bastante sencillo, incluso para ir con niños. En cualquier caso, la zona se puede volver peligrosa si no se va con cuidado. Por favor, tened cuidado por donde os movéis, y prestad atención a los niños para que no se despisten del lugar.

Very quiet place which lets you observe closely a unique kind of bird. You can visit it by day and night, and you will go on watching the birds.
I hope you to like this observatory and you could relax for a while watching birds.

The cache access is quite simple, even to visit with children. Anyway, the area can become dangerous if you don't take care. Watch carefully your kids!</groundspeak:long_description>

El tesoro está en perfecto estado, salvo el bloc de notas que está húmedo, pero se puede escribir con el lapicero.
En cuanto al acceso se trata de un terreno relativamente fácil, Si bien hay que matizar que hay zonas próximas de riesgo (!ojo con los peques¡).
He disfrutado con la experiencia. Muchas gracias.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;La Torre de los Lodones fue declarada Monumento Histórico-Artístico en 1983. Es una de las atalayas musulmanas mejor conservadas de la región madrileña, si bien la construcción actual presenta transformaciones, fruto de una restauración emprendida en 1928, tras el derrumbe parcial de sus muros. Toma su nombre del almez, árbol que también es conocido como lodón, que abundaba en la zona.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;El caserío surgido a sus pies acabó llamándose Torrelodones, y la torre se ha convertido en el símbolo del pueblo, que la ha incorporado en su escudo heráldico. Esta torre o almenara tenía como misión vigilar uno de los caminos que se dirigía hacia los pasos de la Sierra de Guadarrama. Una atalaya cercana a la de Torrelodones es la existente en el término municipal de Hoyo de Manzanares, conocida como La Torrecilla. Todas estas atalayas formaban parte del muy jerarquizado sistema defensivo omeya de la Marca Media, que tenía su centro en Toledo. Construidas por el poder andalusí, entre los siglos IX y XI, controlaban las fronteras más septentrionales. Se levantaban a cierta distancia de los pasos naturales del Sistema Central, al sur de los actuales puertos de Somosierra, Tablada o El León, sobre cerros no muy distantes de las poblaciones o a lo largo de los valles, como el del río Jarama. Mediante sucesivas humadas, avisaban de los posibles ataques cristianos que se podían producir contra las poblaciones andalusíes más en vanguardia, tales como Buitrago de Lozoya, Torrelaguna o Talamanca del Jarama. La atalaya mide cerca de once metros de altura y se ubica en lo alto de un cerro granítico, en la finca Las Marías, está construida enteramente en piedra de granito, labrada en sillares irregulares. El edificio consta de dos núcleos, la torre propiamente dicha y un cuerpo lateral, desde donde se accede.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- La torre es cilíndrica y está coronada por una sucesión alterna de nueve almenas prismáticas y nueve piramidales. Es maciza hasta una altura de aproximadamente tres metros desde el suelo. Mide cerca de once metros de altura y tiene un diámetro exterior de 3,8 metros. En el interior, el diámetro se reduce a 2,5 metros.&lt;br/&gt;- El cuerpo lateral tiene planta rectangular. Sus lados miden alrededor de 5,3 y 3,5 metros. Se encuentra igualmente almenado, con un total de cuatro almenas. Posee una puerta de entrada, que mide 1,5 metros de alto, y un ventanuco cuadrado, de apenas 0,45 metros de lado.&lt;br/&gt;- El interior de este cuerpo lateral integra una cocina de piedra, que tal vez fuera instalada durante las obras de reconstrucción de 1928. Una escalera de diez escalones permite acceder a la base de la torre, que, tras la restauración, se encuentra vana. Para subir al terrado, se ha instalado una escalera vertical de hierro. Desafortunadamente, no puede ser visitado su interior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curiosidades&lt;br/&gt;La atalaya de Torrelodones fue objeto de un atentado el día 1 de marzo de 1979, una jornada en la que se iban a celebrar Elecciones Generales al Congreso y al Senado. Una bomba de relojería, de poca potencia, provocó daños de escasa consideración en el exterior de la torre cilíndrica, abriéndose un pequeño boquete en la base.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Esperamos que disfrutéis en su búsqueda, como nosotros lo hemos hecho al esconderlo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Muy cerca hay otros dos caches en distintas plataformas.

There was still a cold wind but it made ideal walking conditions and I really enjoyed these two. Started off looking the wrong side of the path until I read the clue and then found it straight away.

It was sung at both the wedding of King George VI and that of his daughter, who would go on to become Queen Elizabeth II. It is also often sung at Christian funerals, F.A. Cup and Rugby League Challenge Cup finals, and Military services&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tower of All Saints' Church, founded in 1815, stands guard over the town. The composer of Abide With Me, Rev. Francis Lyte was a vicar at the church. He lived at Berry Head House, now a hotel, and when he was a very sick man, near to dying, he looked out from his garden as dusk fell over Torbay, and the words of that hymn came into his mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All Saints Church</groundspeak:long_description>

For the avoidance of confusion, when I refer to OpenCaching I mean opencaching.org.uk, which predated this site. To refer to this site I use the term GarminCaching.

Found as an OpenCache. Cheekily parked my motor-bike across the bottom of the steps for the few moments it took to run up them to the cache. Mind you, it took a few seconds longer than it should have, as first time round I chose the wrong set of steps :-).

Thanks for the cache,

John was an enthusiastic walker, leading walks along some of&lt;br/&gt;his favourite sections of coastline here in Torbay. Torbay Coast&lt;br/&gt;and Countryside Trust, on behalf of the South Devon Group of the&lt;br/&gt;Ramblers' Association, has created the new trail which links the&lt;br/&gt;existing Dart Valley Trail, Torbay Totnes Trail (T3), Torbay Dart&lt;br/&gt;Link and South West Coast Path with new sections of path to create&lt;br/&gt;one complete route through Teignbridge, Torbay and South Hams. The&lt;br/&gt;route explores over 40 of South Devon's finest heritage features&lt;br/&gt;and is suitable for all types of walker, from the gentle stroller&lt;br/&gt;to the experienced rambler. In just a few footsteps the route moves&lt;br/&gt;from urban life to rural landscape, and takes in woodland,&lt;br/&gt;farmland, Country Park and coastline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trail is divided into four individual sections and each section&lt;br/&gt;is accompanied by a series of interpretation&lt;br/&gt;boards.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container is a click-n-lock style plastic box containing&lt;br/&gt;logbook, pen, and, at the time of hiding, some GeoSwag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area is, of course, popular with walkers - so please exercise a&lt;br/&gt;degree of stealth when retrieving and replacing the cache.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q.

It has been called &quot;The Priest's House&quot;,&lt;br/&gt;suggesting a link with the church, but it may have been built as&lt;br/&gt;the residence of a prosperous local tradesman. The ground floor of&lt;br/&gt;the house contains a dining room and a large vaulted hall that&lt;br/&gt;would have been used for entertaining guests, while the first floor&lt;br/&gt;contains a gallery and three bedchambers. The kitchen was an&lt;br/&gt;outbuilding that exists today only as a few ruined walls, and there&lt;br/&gt;is a small garden adjacent to the house.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mrs Ada Frances Jennings bequeathed&lt;br/&gt;the house to the nation in 1960, together with a sum of money for&lt;br/&gt;its repair. The stone and plasterwork have been extensively&lt;br/&gt;renovated, although many of the original oak beams and carvings can&lt;br/&gt;still be seen. The building contains reproduction furniture and tapestries in the&lt;br/&gt;medieval style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is not located on the premises, but just outside.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Having met up with the cache owner for a couple of hours this morning, we walked up here together. As promised, the view of Cockington Valley was even better from here than it was from &quot;Cockington Valley View&quot; :-).

After Paul had spent the previous few minutes describing his excellent, durable, cheap and effective camo bags, when we got here we found this one had been well chewed by the local fauna. Isn't it always the way :-).

Took a picture (there are 6 or 7 left) and left an orange ping pong ball.  This cache is very well hidden and is right behind a large poison ivy vine.  I'm sure I hit it at least half a dozen times.  You have to be careful in this area with all the people around.  I felt like there was always someone nearby when I was there but I was pretty well camouflaged by the poison ivy!!!  Cache is in good shape although as others have mentioned there is some sort of goop in the bottom of the container.

Found as a TerraCache. A slightly unusual tor, with a gentle slope on the one side and a very steep valley dropping down the other. The views over the valley are outstanding.

The depth of the valley is misleading - while I was there, a helicopter flew along the valley - below me! This is something I'm used to seeing in the Alps, but I didn't expect it on Dartmoor!

Another fairly quick find, thanks, in the nick of time, just before I girded myself up to explore some more difficult terrain.

When I opened the cache there was a smell of lighter fuel from the cigarette lighter inside. I regret I had nothing left with me to replace it with, but I felt I should remove the lighter from the cache.

Thanks for yet another fab cache.

Found as an OpenCache. Wind Tor lived up to its name that afternoon.

Mrs. A and I stopped for a short walk during our journey from Surrey to Looe. I've grown to love Dartmoor, and it's great to be able to bring my wife here; circumstances at that time meant it was rare for us to be able to get away together.

Despite only 3 previous OpenCache logs, the log book was half full with logs by letterboxers :-). It was almost too easy to find - I hid it a little better when I left it, more as I believe Lord Darcy would have liked it hidden.

Thanks for the cache,

Rgds, Andy

The cache is near the old bridge. You don't need to go on the bridge, over barbed wire or take the direct route up the bank. Health and Safety not gone mad. Follow the fence gently up the bank from the track west of the bridge.

This cache was placed by some students of the Maynard School, Exeter, working with the National Trust rangers to produce a beginners' geocache trail around the grounds of Parke. </groundspeak:long_description>

Located in the valley of the Redwater Brook, to the east of the B3212 Moretonhampstead to Princetown road, below the Warren House Inn, the mine was worked between the mid–18th century and 1925.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Also visible from the cache area is the &lt;strong&gt;Warren House Inn&lt;/strong&gt; ...again from Wikipedia -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;... the current building dates from 1845, but the original inn on the southern side of the packhorse track was probably built in the middle of the 18th century, certainly well before the turnpike road was created in 1792. There must have been sufficient packhorse and foot traffic because some time afterwards a small rabbit warren was established nearby to allow the inn to serve rabbit-pie with scrumpy.  ...   The fire in the hearth, it is rumoured, has never been allowed to go out and has itself become part of the folklore of the inn. It is said that when the inn was rebuilt, the glowing embers of the fire were carried across the road on a shovel to the new hearth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a 330ml click-n-lock style box hidden a little distance from the main tor.</groundspeak:long_description>

For the avoidance of confusion, when I refer to OpenCaching I mean opencaching.org.uk, which predated this site. To refer to this site I use the term GarminCaching.

Found as an OpenCache.

Another one that Mrs. A and I found as we made our way across Dartmoor on our way home from Looe to Surrey. We found a letterbox, but no cache. But eventually I came back to the same place and dug deeper :-)

Thanks for the cache,

Stanwey is a short residential road in the Exeter district of Heavitree. Built in the 1930's, it was probably named after William De Stanwey who was Dean of Exeter between 1231 and 1252.

Parking is limited so best to park up and walk from one of the nearby larger roads. Stealth is required.</groundspeak:long_description>

This part of Exeter, with its Sycamore tree lined streets, has been known as known as Southernhay as far back as 1265.
Bordered with both Georgian townhouses and modern offices, this is now the centre of Exeter's commercial area with many banks, insurance companies, solicitors and regional company headquarters.

With many well kept flowerbeds and open grass areas it's an ideal place to break from the pressure of shopping and relax for a while.

This cache meets the GAGB Urban Placement Guidelines.</groundspeak:long_description>

Placed full of family friendly swag - please Trade Up, Trade Even or Don't Trade.

Wimbleball Lake on Exmoor in Somerset, England, is a water supply reservoir constructed in the 1970s and completed in 1979.
There are many miles of paths following the shorelines of the lake, meandering through woodland and onto open moorland. There’s also a wealth of wildlife to watch and discover so whether you’re looking for a leisurely stroll, an active cycle ride or a more challenging walk whatever your ability there is something for everyone at the lake. A complete circuit of the lake is almost nine miles.

Parking is pay &amp; display, unfortunately Wimbleball Lake is not served by public transport, however Exmoor National Park run a Moor Rover service during the summer which is a dial and ride service visit http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/  for more information.

Visitors can also launch their own unpowered water craft or hire from the watersports centre. Wimbleball is also a premier trout fishery offering angling from the banks and boats. Check the SW Lakes website for any applicable fees.

You are now on at the very top of the main carriageway, originally intended to be the entrance to Arlington Court. At the top of this track you will find Woolley Lodge, one of two National Trust Holiday Cottages located on the Arlington Court Estate, this is where the carriageway would have met the road to Barnstaple and beyond.

The cache is in a small ammo box, everythig you require is inside. There is also a small activity to have a go at if you wish to do so.

The access is via an old carriageway, and therefore its suitable for wheelchairs and buggys, however there are two long hills to climb up for it could be hard work.

Welcome to Smallacombe Bridge, which links the Wilderness and Parkland to the wider estate. In front of you, you can see two distinct features on the landscape, the River Yeo, and the parkland that runs up the hill towards the house and grounds.

If you head up the through the Wilderness, you will be fed out into the gardens, for access to the House and Carriage Museum, you will need to head over to the shop to show your NT membership card or pay for an entrance ticket.

This cache is in a small ammo box and inside is everything you need including a small task to carry out if you wish to do so.

Welcome to Woolley Wood, just part of the large Arlington Court estate. You are probably aware that your have been following the Centenary Path, which was put in during 1995. This was the National Trust 100 year anniversary of its formation and as we still do today the main emphasis for the celebration was to open up more footpaths across the country to promote public access.

The fields that you are about to enter are part of the North Woolley Farm, land that is part of the National Trust estate but managed by a tenant farmer. This area of the property is very quiet and it is likely that you will see some of the local Red Deer population.

The cache is in a small ammo box, everythig you require is inside the plastic wallet. There is also a small activity to have a go at if you wish to do so.

Please do not go beyond the gate, it is there to keep the area behind quiet for the Herons who wll be nesting in the tree tops above. The best view of these birds is from the birdhide the opposite side of the lake.
Herons come to nest at Arlington Court from February untill August and make the most amazing pterodactyl sounding calls. If you need another reason for not going beyond the gates, they are known to throw up on anyone who disturbs them below.
The cache is in a smalll Ammo box which contains a plastic envelope with everything you need inside. There is also a small task for you to complete if you wish to do so. We look forward to seeing some of your creations. </groundspeak:long_description>

This series of caches are all located along the RED trail that takes visitors down the Monkey Puzzle Avenue, past the Birdhide, across the dam and back up through the Wilderness. The route should take around 1 1/2 hours and is fully accessable to buggys and wheelchairs, although there are some inclines.

These caches will be available year round, so feel free to try the trail if your out searching for the other series on this National Trust Property. </groundspeak:long_description>

See the related website for the fully downloadable guided walk.
There is a tearooms and toilets up with the Main House, Carriage Museum and Gardens.

“What’s that over there?” is a common question amongst visitors as they walk through the gardens towards the National Trusts Carriage Museum. This site was the location of a bonfire that was held by the residents of Arlington Court to commemorate Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee. It was this spot where everyone would have gathered for the celebrations, in maybe a similar way to the Beacons that we will all be lighting for Queen Elizabeth II 60th anniversary celebrations in 2012.

The cache is in a small ammo box, everythig you require is inside. There is also a small activity to have a go at if you wish to do so.

Nope, no muddy vehicles here, what you’re actually looking at is part of the Arlington Court Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). This in front of you is an Alder and Willow Carr, an area that was formally part of the lake before sediment carried by the river Yeo was trapped by the lake waters and deposited, and over years it now forms what you see, a wet woodland. Essentially a man made SSSI.

The cache is in a medium sized tub wrapped in camo tape, inside is everything that you'll need plus a small activity for you to complete is you wish to do so.

This cache is located on one of the most recognised parts of the Arlington Court landscape. The carriageway that runs through this part of the estate, would have been the desired entrance for visitors to the Chichester family had it been finished. The key componant was the bridge down at the lake. This was never finished even though the bridge piers are in place. If you carry on down the carriageway, you'll come across the birdhide with one of the bridge piers just to the left as you enter the hide.
During April, May and June we ask that all dogs on this part of the property are on a lead, this is to protect the Spring lambs and ground nesting birds.

The cache is in a small Ammo box, inside is an envelope with everything that you'll need plus a small activity for you to complete is you wish to do so.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the Winford Valley, this cache is located right by the footpath, and therefore there in no need to wander afar. It's fairly easy, but someone taller will be needed to retrieve the cache. Sturdy boots are recommended for this walk.

The Winford Valley, is one of the quietist parts of the estate, on this walk your likely to have the Valley entirely to yourself, even though its not far from the House and grounds (there may also be Ruby Red Devon cattle or Shetland ponies grazing the fields). These fields are a real haven for butterflies, from common blue to the rare Marsh Frittilary you'll see a vast collection of colour on show. Come on a hot sunny afternoon to get some good sightings.
The livestock in these fields are managed by the Rangers at Arlington Court, they do very well on the unimproved grassland and they ensure that the habitat is just right for the butterfly populations present.
The cache itself is in an Ammo box and has a plastic envelope inside containing all you need. It also has a small activity for you to complete if you wish to do so. </groundspeak:long_description>

As you may have guessed, you are now stood in School Wood, on just of one of the many permissive paths that cross the Arlington Court Estate. If you carry on in a northerly direction you will eventually end up at Arlington Beccott and the opposite direction will take you to the Old School and Arlington Court

The temple was used from AD340 for about 30 years when it was
ransacked and a smelting furnace erected.&lt;br/&gt;
Some of the wall remains can be seen, but most people walk over
them without realising. Head towards waypoint TEMPLE before getting

Focusing on the history of Brean Down, the geocaches are all
located on open access land and so are accessible year round.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Harry Cox was warden on Brean Down for 40 years from 1909. At that
time, the down was a bird sanctuary looked after by the RSPB.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Harry lived in a modest tin shack pictured below and boiled
rainwater to drink...the cache is located close to where this shack
was.  Please treat this historical area with respect and choose your path carefully if you wish to visit the dew pond.  The best route may not be a direct one from the cache.    </groundspeak:long_description>

As well as exploring the Fort, you can CAREFULLY go down to the

(waypoint STEPS) and see the remains of Brean Down Harbour. </groundspeak:long_description>

Heading along Brean Down doing the Brean Fort WhereIGo cache and bumped into Charlie the GeoDog doing some caches whilst taking his Two legged friends for a bit of exercise [;)], we joined forces to find this cache and complete the WhereIGo. Great location for a cache and so very nice of them to put a fort here to celebrate the cache. Enjoyed exploring the many ruins and admiring the views.

Thanks for the Cache,

&lt;p&gt;No need for Counter Surveillance Measures or Body Armour here,
but there is the possibility of been muggled....!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing a Secret Undercover Geoagent can't handle..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ynysmeudwy :&lt;/p&gt; 

 
&lt;p&gt;The village owes its very existence to the pottery factory which
commenced production in 1848.The nearby Swansea Canal served as the
main vehicle of transportation of Cornish China clay (Kaolin) as
the raw material for the production of porcelain in the area which
was of course rich in that other essential raw material,...COAL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time there were over 400 pottery works in England and
Wales and 32 working in Wales alone including the Cambrian Pottery
in Melincryddan, Neath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first family to own and build the works were the Williams
family who bought the original site of the Ynysmeudwy farm (
variously Ynismudw, Ynysmudw or “ Y Smutw” – the
field of the hermit) which is is now the Ynysmeudwy Arms and is a
family friendly pub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also built Ynysmeudwy House which later became the now
defunct Glanafon Hotel and a string of workers cottages adjacent to
the works. Following the closure of the site most of the pottery
factory was demolished to make way for the opening of the Bryn tin
works which operated until 1941.Now little remains of the original
site following salvaging works by the local authority in the
1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However one of the bridges on the canal which once brought in
the raw materials and shipped out the finished products is now
nicknamed the Potters' Bridge and is a short walk from the cache
location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!!!!!Thanx and Well done to Preseli for being FTF........&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I've finally decided to log my found caches that are cross listed here.

For the avoidance of confusion, when I refer to OpenCaching I mean opencaching.org.uk, which predated this site. To refer to this site I use the term GarminCaching.

Found as a TerraCache. While I enjoyed the &quot;village&quot; caches, this one was my favourite of the day. This sort of cache is the reason I go caching :-) . A lovely walk, and brilliant views.

At the top I battled my way through the prickly gorse to the &quot;obvious marker&quot;, and found the cache slightly exposed. When I opened it I saw, to my surprise, that it had already been found this very day, but by a non-cacher :-) . Quite why someone should struggle through this gorse with no cache as their target beats me, but obviously the are other nutty people in the world apart from cachers :-) .

They had left some packets of coffee and sugar, and a note in the log to say &quot;have a drink on us&quot;. I took these and have indeed &quot;had a drink on them&quot;. If the folks who found the cache visit this site and read this log, thank you for respecting the cache and leaving it tidily. Thank you too for your kind gifts, though if you should take up this game of ours it's generally better not to leave foodstuffs in caches as they attract wild animals.

And thanks too to &quot;The Hornet&quot; for setting the cache, which has been awarded an Amberel TOP CACHE coin, see http://www.amberel.com/topcache.htm .

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Ystrad Fflur Parking: 52º16.523 003º50.385 
&lt;p&gt;Co-ordinates given are for parking which is just opposite the
entrance to the ancient Cistercian Abbey of Strata Florida. To find
the cache you will need to solve the clues below, some of which may
require some research before you get to Ground Zero.&lt;/p&gt;

 
&lt;p&gt;Strata Florida is situated about 1 mile outside of
Pontrhydfendigaid. It was founded by the Norman Robert fitz Stephen
in 1164 about 2 miles away from the present site. Cistercians were
famed for their excellence in water management and in the nearby
area the boggy flood plain was drained, water channels dug and
re-dug. With the land ready, construction began on what was to
become the great monastery of 'Ystrad Fflur' or 'Strata Florida',
meaning 'Vale of the Flowers' from the nearby river Fflur....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remains of the abbey are well worth exploring. There is a
small visitor centre and a small charge (currently £2.90) is made
for entry to the abbey between 10am and 5pm during the summer
months. At other times the abbey itself is open and un-staffed with
no admission charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the answers to the following clues can be found in and
around the churchyard of St Mary's, next to the old Abbey of Strata
Florida and the cache itself is within a short walk too.&lt;/p&gt;
&amp;lt;&amp;gt;The cache itself is at:&lt;br/&gt;
52º16.ABC 003º50.DEF&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;A. Under the beech trees lies Morgan Davies who died on July 12
18&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. Syr David John James LLD xxxx-x&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;xx. This isn't on a
headstone and may require some mirror reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. Local Telephone Box: 01974 x&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;xxxx&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. A famous Welsh Poet is reputed to be buried here. He was
author of:&lt;br/&gt;
 'Morfudd fel yr haul' (Morfudd like the sun), a poem to the wife
of an Aberystwyth merchant that seems to have had a long affair
with Dafydd, and whom he addressed in many poems;&lt;br/&gt;
 and&lt;br/&gt;
 'Trafferth mewn tafarn' (Trouble in a tavern), in which he
recounts an incident in a tavern that would be worthy of any
slapstick film;&lt;br/&gt;
 'Yew' will find a mention of him in the churchyard along with some
dates from which 'D' can be found: x&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;xx -x&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;xx&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E. How many circular impressions are there in the headstone
immediately adjacent to the E wall of the church?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F. How many circular pipes can you see on the outside of the
northern churchyard wall?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are getting close now... Happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FC13GH7 - Cache Location&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;The Final Cache Location</groundspeak:long_description>

Watery Wales 1 is a series of caches on the banks of lakes and streams in the Welsh Hills. Although you can drive very close to most of the caches it is recommended that you park at N52º26.278' W003º53.933' and enjoy the walk between the caches. (mainly along tarmac but very quiet roads).
A traditional cache overlooking Llyn Rhosgoch. Finding this cache requires a short uphill walk along a rocky track and a short scramble over some grassy and often boggy ground. The approach is less accessible than the other caches in the Watery Wales series, although you can get close with an all terrain pushchair and the walk isn't difficult.

Llyn Rhosgoch is a brown trout fishery that is trickle-stocked with trout up to 1.5lbs in weight. Fly fishing is allowed with permits available from the Aberystwyth Angling Association.

Please retrieve and replace the cache carefully, respecting the local environment,</groundspeak:long_description>

A traditional cache on the banks of Llyn Blaenmelindwr. This cache has easy access and is only a few metres from the road. The roads and tracks around these lakes are well used by mountain-bikers with many marked tracks existing through the forests and over the hills.

Llyn Blaenelindwr has wild brown trout and is heavily weeded in places. Fly, spinning and worm fishing is allowed and it is ideal for senior citizens or disabled anglers requiring easy access and obstacle-free fishing. Permits available from the Aberystwyth Angling Association.

The are is also very popular with mountain-bikers and is the intersection of a number of popular cycle trails. Keep an eye out for muggles, especially the two-wheeled variety.

Please retrieve and replace the cache with care, respecting the local environment.</groundspeak:long_description>

Watery Wales 1 is a series of caches on the banks of lakes and streams in the Welsh Hills. Although you can drive very close to most of the caches it is recommended that you park at N52º26.278' W003º53.933' and enjoy the walk between the caches. (Mainly along tarmac but very quiet roads).
A traditional cache on the banks of Llyn Pendam. Although not far from the road you will need to walk a little way along a narrow (and often slippery) track.

Llyn Pendam is a shallow, picturesque lake surrounded by forests. A perfect place for a picnic in the summer and equally pleasant in the winter especially when there is snow on the ground.

The cache itself isn't puschair accessible but it is only a short distance from the tarmac road which is pushchair friendly.

Please retrieve and replace the cache carefully whilst respecting the local environment.</groundspeak:long_description>

Watery Wales 1 is a series of caches on the banks of lakes and streams in the Welsh Hills. Although you can drive very close to most of the caches it is recommended that you park at N52º26.278' W003º53.933' and enjoy the walk between the caches. (mainly along tarmac but very quiet roads).
A traditional cache on the banks of Llyn Syfydrin. Vehicle access ends a mile from the lake (although there are wide forestry tracks leading to it). This cache is easily accessible by foot, bike or with a pushchair except for the last few metres which will require a little scramble on a grassy bank.

Llyn Syfydrin is used by local anglers with fly, spinning and worm fishing
allowed. It has a good head of wild brown trout and the lake is well known for its evening sedge rise. Permits are available from the Aberystwyth Angling Association.

Please retrieve and replace the cache carefully, respecting the local environment.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Watery Wales 2 is a series of caches on the banks of lakes and
streams in the Welsh Hills. Unlike Watery Wales 1, some require a
little more walking across rougher terrain and aren't all suited
for younger children or the physically unfit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole series can be attempted as a circular walk which will
require some navigation through rough ground without any marked
paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anglers Retreat&lt;/strong&gt; is a small fishing lodge on the
banks of the damned lake called 'New Pool'. I'm not an angler
myself but if I was then this place would be a heavenly place to
stay. Sufficiently remote to have a feeling of wilderness to it,
but easy to get to. Amazing views and no doubt some excellent
fishing on the doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to drive all the way to Anglers Retreat along the
gravel surfaced forest tracks that lead off the mountnain road from
Tal-y-Bont t0 Nant y Moch. However there was a temporary 'no
unauthorised vehicles beyond this point' sign part way along the
track when I hid the cache so I heeded the sign and walked the rest
of the way. If walking there is no need to follow the forest track
around a large loop towards Llyn Dwfn but you can take the track
that leads through the forest directly to Anglers Retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hint below gives the game away completely so only decrypt it
if you must!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Llyn Conach is a small cache overlooking the picturesque Llyn
Conach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If approaching this cache from Pen Cregiau'r Llan as part of the
recommended route of the Watery Wales 2 Series then it requires
crossing some very rough terrain which can be boggy in places. Most
OS maps will show this to be through wooded terrain but it isn't as
the forest here has been cleared. From Pen Creigiau'r Llan it is
possible to follow a line of small crags until the scenery opens up
with views over Llyn Conach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache itself is fairly high up on the hill above the lake.
From the cache you can walk down past Llyn Conach towards Llyn Dwfn
where you can join the forest tracks to finish your Watery Wales 2
circuit... I hope you enjoyed the route and you feel it in your
legs later!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If doing this cache on its own the easiest approach is from the
Forest track that leads all the way up to the shores of Llyn Dwfn.
From here it is a fairly short walk over rough ground to the cache
location.&lt;/p&gt;

Watery Wales 2 is a series of caches on the banks of lakes and streams in the Welsh Hills. Unlike Watery Wales 1, some require a little more walking across rougher terrain and aren't all suited for younger children or the physically unfit.

The whole series can be attempted as a circular walk which will require some navigation through rough ground without any marked paths. The recommended route starts with Anglers Retreat and visits the caches in an anti-clockwise direction.

Llyn Penrhaeadr is a short walk from Watery Wales 2 - Anglers Retreat. The cache is high up on the banks of Llyn Penrhaedar not far from the well marked path.

A windy, remote place at most times that sums up 'Watery Wales', although it could make a perfect place for a picnic in the summer. The walk to it is along easily traversed tracks, although they aren't suited to wheelchairs or buggies. An 'all-terrain' buggy would be OK though. 

For those into mountain-biking then the tracks around here are perfect. However, if attempting all of the caches in the Watery Wales 2 series using the recommended route then the going gets a little tougher from here on.</groundspeak:long_description>

A simple cache accessed along a level path besides the banks of the River Cletwr. Park at N52º30.889' W003º58.927' which will leave you with a walk of about a mile along the river to the cache.

The river itself has been channeled and has embankments along either bank to allow farming on the surrounding land. It is still a lovely walk and a perfect place to see wildfowl and other birds with excellent views out over the surrounding farmland and out towards the Dyfi Estuary.

Although flat the path can be muddy and isn't suitable for pushchairs.

Safety Notes: The walk to the cache is easy and there are no special safety issues. However, the footpath does continue out onto the saltmarsh areas of Traeth Maelgwyn. If you follow this please take note of the following:

a] This should go without saying, but don't trespass on the railway line.

b] Take the sign under the railway bridge that says the footpath floods at high tide seriously. It does and becomes impassable.

Watery Wales 2 is a series of caches on the banks of lakes and streams in the Welsh Hills. Unlike Watery Wales 1, some require a little more walking across rougher terrain and aren't all suited for younger children or the physically unfit.

The whole series can be attempted as a circular walk which will require some navigation through rough ground without any marked paths. The recommended route starts with Anglers Retreat and visits the caches in an anti-clockwise direction.

Pen Creigiau'r Llan is a small cache located on the edge of a small babbling stream deep in the Welsh Hills. If approaching this as part of the Watery Wales 2 series using the recommended route it requires some navigation over rough ground without paths. From Pistyll y Llyn you will need to cross a small stream and a couple of stiles then follow the stream up towards its source.

Whichever approach you take access to this cache will require walking over rough and often boggy ground.

The cache itself is located in a sheltered spot that provides a lovely place to sit and watch the world slowly go by whilst contemplating what to write in the log book. You are unlikely to be disturbed by anything other than a passing bird.</groundspeak:long_description>

Watery Wales 2 is a series of caches on the banks of lakes and streams in the Welsh Hills. Unlike Watery Wales 1, some require a little more walking across rougher terrain and aren't all suited for younger children or the physically unfit.

The whole series can be attempted as a circular walk which will require some navigation through rough ground without any marked paths. The recommended route starts with Anglers Retreat and visits the caches in an anti-clockwise direction.

Pistyll y Llyn is the piece de resistance of Watery Wales 2. It can be approached from Cwmyrhaiadr to the North but if approached from Watery Wales 2 - Llyn Penrhaeadr the views open up before you in spectacular fashion.

I won't say too much about this cache as the scenery speaks for itself, but I wouldn't recommend doing this cache on too dreary a day as you may not be able to enjoy the views to their fullest.

The cache itself is in a fairly obvious hiding spot on a small grassy area high above the waterfall. It is not recommend for children, dogs or those with a nervous disposition. It is safe however as long as you don't go close to the edge and the paths that lead to the cache are fine for most people. Please be careful as there are some steep cliffs with long drops nearby.

Please replace the cache well so that Muggles don't stumble across it.</groundspeak:long_description>

There are many possible approaches to this cache. There several
routes to choose from Pennal, the most direct is along Cwm Ebol
then a steep climb up to Tarren Rhosfarch and onto Tarrenhendre.
Other routes from Pennal allow you to a take an alternative way
back down. For a longer walk you can approach from Happy Valley, up
a rocky track and then along the ridge passing Tarren Memorial
cache (GC1E7E) on your way. If you then continue onto the Llaeron
Earth is it? cache before climbing backup to the ridge and then
descending into Pennal and back along the road to Happy Valley it
will form a 14 mile circular route. From the north Tarrenhendre can
be accessed from Dolgoch or Abergynolwyn. Both of these valleys
have great walks in their own right taking you past other caches on
the way to the top of Tarrenhendre. Again, for the fit and
ambitious a circular walk can be taken up one of these valleys,
across the top to Tarrenhendre and then back down the other. This
will incorporate the following caches: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tal-y -lyn Adventure - GC1E84&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quarryman &amp; The Monkey Puzzle Tree - GCTH31&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Llaeron Earth is it? - GCXYZ4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tarrenhendre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dolgoch's Cascading Cache - GCMTXM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
If time and desire permits you could also make a detour to Rhiwerfa
Cache (GCRCG8) between Dolgoch and Abergynolwyn. (If you don't take
the train). Tarrenhendre itself, at 634m, provides excellent views
of Cadair Idris to the NE, Snowdon to the north and the Dyfi Valley
to the south. There is a small cairn at the summit, the cache is
NOT in the cairn. Finding this cache earns a point at

(GC1A8E8)

I know there is another cache in this woodland area (GC1626R) but you can't have too many cache's :) and it's a nice location for a walk.
This one is a microcache so there is no room for gifts etc.
You'll need your own pencil/pen as well.
Have Fun!


Note : 27/04/2010
Don't worry if you can't sign the log, it still counts as far as I'm concerned :)
I'll try and do some maintenance soon!</groundspeak:long_description>

The machine known as ERNIE (or Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment) that draws the numbers for Premium Bonds winners was for a long time housed here in Lytham St Annes. Although ERNIE is long gone now, the site is still often referred to as the Pre-Bonds site.

Until recently the Lytham St Annes site was a very important IT location within the Department for Work and Pensions. It is now used by Hewlett Packard.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Stuart Kings of Scotland believed in “The divine right of the monarch”, that they were chosen by God as the spiritual head of the church and that they were infallible. Many Scots did not agree with this, believing that Jesus Christ only could be the spiritual head of the church. In 1638 they signed the “ National Covenant”, voicing their opposition to the King. This led to a period known as the killing time, where a man could be shot for refusing to take the Kings oath. Those who signed the covenant were known as “Covenanters” and due to the repression enforced by the King, had to meet and worship in secret.
One such place where meetings would take place was at a stone near Shotts , known as the Covenanters Stone or the Fortissat Stone.
The remains of the stone are at the roadside, the cache is located at the base of a tree.
The cache container contains a logbook, pencil and (very)small items.
On a sticker inside the container are the co-ordinates for the bonus cache: &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A small cache near the Blackhill Transmitter, this cache is located on moorland, there are no paths.
Please note that the grounds of the transmitting station are private, there is no need to go through them.

Black Hill television transmitter was first opened in 1957. The first mast was replaced by a more reliable one in 1961, while the original was moved to Selkirk, where it is still in use.
It has the fifth highest population coverage of any UK TV transmitter at around 2.5 million. The mast is 307m high giving a total aerial height of 543m. A new transmitter has been erected adjacent to the old one.
They can be seen for miles, and are very impressive close up.

There are impressive views from here, on a good day Arran can be seen to the West, Ben Vorlich to the North, and an ever increasing amount of windfarms. There are good walks over the hills here if you have time to spare.

There is a CHIRP enabled bonus cache here. Make sure your GPS is CHIRP enabled and on arrival at the cache you should receive co-ordinates for a special bonus cache. PLEASE NOTE THE CHIRP IS NOT A TRADE ITEM AND IS NOT IN THE CACHE CONTAINER, BUT IS HIDDEN NEARBY. Happy hunting!


I was recently asked by Lock1UK if I would put a cache out here, after his cache The Lilly, was destroyed, firstly by a landslip, then a grass fire. Here's hoping this one has better luck...

Between 1796 and 1798 a new reservoir, the largest of its type in the world, was created at Hillend Moss. A construction project of a massive scale for the time, on completion it supplied the Forth and Clyde Canal, via the Monkland Canal, with around 1,011,000,000 gallons of water.

The Lilly Loch was created in 1836, enlarging an existing loch and providing a dam system which supplied water to nearby Hillend Reservoir. The Lilly Loch was named after it's lillies, which were destroyed on the enlargement of the loch. Along with the Black Loch, these three waters supplied water to Hillend Reservoir, for the regulation of the Monkland Canal.

The Lilly Loch was also used to supply water to local distilleries. One of these was Inver House. In the years leading up to the closure of the huge distillery at Moffat Mills it was the largest distillery in Europe, and water from the Lilly Loch was a vital part of this. The distillery is now closed, although the warehouses remain with their barrels of Uisge Beatha maturing within. Many of the whiskies produced with water from the Lilly Loch are now highly collectable, such as Glenflagler and Killyloch.

The loch, while still being used to supply water to Hillend, and the canal, no longer supplies the whisky industry, although the pipeline at the west dam can still be seen, heading off towards Moffat Mills. These days it is mainly used for leisure, either for angling, birdwatching or just walking. Hidden away from Airdrie and Caldercruix by the Moffat Hills, it is hidden from much of the nearby light pollution, and is ideal for watching the night sky.

The cache is located on nearby Drumfin Hill. In 1842 a hoard of Roman coins was found here, some of which can be found at nearby Summerlee, the remainder are in the National Museum of Scotland. In 1955 a pleas was made in the local paper, the Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser, for the return of a stone which had gone missing from the summit of this hill. For many years it had been used to crown the local gala queen, until it went missing, never to be seen again. That the Stone of Destiny had gone missing around this time is purely a coincidence...

I discovered this while out stravaiging. A strange place to find a bench, a small oasis in warm weather. The container is small and will hold TB's and small items. Seeing that this is a CHIRP cache can I ask that you bring BIRD RELATED SWAPS. There's a Kiwi to start you off!
Be aware, in wet weather this cache can be VERY DIFFICULT to get to. I recommend BOOTS OR WELLINGTONS. Don't say you weren't warned... </groundspeak:long_description>

It's said that the name &quot;Blawhorn Moss&quot; comes from many years ago, when a watcher stationed on this high ground could observe coaches coming from Glasgow or Edinburgh and blow a horn, which would alert the workers at the Coaching Inn, allowing them to prepare for the coaches arrival.
The moss itself is owned by Scottish Natural Heritage, and is one of the few rain fed peat-bogs in the central belt. A home to a variety of plant, bird and animal life, including Short Eared Owls, Britain's only daytime hunting owl.
There are some excellent views from here, you can see the Pentlands, Tinto, and the Cant Hills, all of which have caches to visit. </groundspeak:long_description>

Battle of Pinkie Cleugh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September
1547&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Battle of Pinkie Cleugh was fought between the English and the
Scots.  Edward Seymore, protector to Edward IV, King of
England, was intending to continue a campaign in mainland Europe
but needed to sort out his issues with Scotland first.  His
plan was to send his forces north and engineer a marriage between
Edward IV, and Mary, Queen of Scots (Mary was taken to France for
protection).  Thus he would bring the Scottish crown into
English ownership and join the two countries.  This would then
allow him to focus his attentions on mainland Europe.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
18000 mixed units of English troops and artillery marched north,
hugging the coastline, protected by a flotilla of naval ships in
the north sea.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Scots, led by the Earl of Arran, had taken up position to the
west of the river Esk with additional cavalry on Carberry
Hill.  The English approached from the East and took up
position on Fa'side Hill, deploying artillery units on Inveresk
slopes.  Shortly afterwards the Earl of Home, leading 1500
cavalry rode up to the English camp and challenged an equal amount
of Engish soldiers to fight.  The Scots lost most of the
cavalry in the move and were pursued for 3 miles to the west.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In a desperate move to avoid major bloodshed, Arran sent two offers
to Somerset.  The first was that they could settle the battle
in one on one combat, the other was for 20 champions from each side
to settle it.  Both offers were declined.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
On Saturday 10th September, Somerset advanced his army toward the
artillery units to find that the Scots, knowing they would be out
gunned by the English artillery, had moved position and were now on
the eastern side of the Esk - having crossed via the Roman bridge
in Musselburgh - trying to force a close battle.  The Scots
suffered major losses through bombardment from the Naval ships
sitting of the shore in the Forth which also caused confusion and
disorganisation.  Under heavy fire from off the shore, land
based artillery, arquebusiers and archers the Scots were broken and
retreated. Many were slaughtered or drowned as they got caught in
the soft marches to the south of Musselburgh (now Musselburgh Golf
Club).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
6000 Scots were lost and only around 600 english troops were
killed.  The Scots refused to agree terms and Somerset began a
lengthy occupation of the Scottish lowland but eventually withdrew
forces as the troops were an unnecessary drain on the
treasury.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The first modern battle using combined land and sea based units had
now been fought.  This was a significant change to war
tactics. Well done to Interloper for the FTF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PL2AGZ3 - Parking and Battlefield Plaque&lt;br/&gt;N 55° 55.819 W 003° 01.264&lt;br/&gt;Battlefield Plaque</groundspeak:long_description>

The 2nd Battle of Falkirk was fought on 17th January 1746, and was the last Jacobite success before defeat at Culloden. General Hawley was taking his forces from Edinburgh to Stirling to relieve the besieged General Blakeny in Stirling Castle, when the Jacobites were sighted on the moor to the south west of the town of Falkirk. Hawley had to be found at his lodgings and reportedly arrived still wearing his dinner napkin. He formed his men up and with dark approaching and the rain lashing down began the attack. With his artillery peices stuck in the mud, he ordered the Dragoons in to the fray. A volley from the Jacobite forces brought panic to the English ranks, and the Dragoons fled, however with the conditions on the ground and the confusion caused by the Scots forces dispersal around the moor it was many hours before it was ascertained that the Jacobites were victorious. The battle is believed to have only lasted around 20 minutes, Government forces losing around 400 dead to the Jacobites 50.
The recently restored monument marks the area of the battle.
Park near the monument, N55 59.442 W003 48.957. There is no designated parking so take care. A footpath leads away from the monument towards the cache. </groundspeak:long_description>

 This is squishielady and my first cache.  It's pretty straightforward, but a nice area to go for a very short walk.

Original cache contents:
Log Book.
Pen.
Silver Tabby Travel Bug.
Friendship bracelet.

Happy caching :)</groundspeak:long_description>

 This cache sits on the drive way on the way up to the beautiful Spynie Palace.  Once one of the largest fortified buildings in scotland.

A township and bishop's residence sat on this site since the late 12th century.  By the 1500s a large hall was present on the site, and was subsequently fortified with gun holes, and artillery.

The palace fell into disrepair in the late 17th century as the episcopacy of the Church of Scotland was abolished.
