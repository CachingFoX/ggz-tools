It's a wonderful place to come and bird watch, turtle watch or just watch the waves roll by.  Be discrete and careful when looking for this cache. It is located right next to the trail. There is no need to go off the trail or into any sensitive areas at all. There is absolutely NO bushwhacking necessary for this cache. The cache is well hidden and out of view. Please leave it better than you found it. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A real nice place on a hot day, a small swimming hole with a rope swing just off why 41.  Can be busy with muggles at times and be careful parking. Its a small container with a stubby pencil but have your own just in case. And a camera might be a good idea, swim suit too.</groundspeak:long_description>

Spent about an hour there enjoying nature and the cool water.  This find is cool because 100s of people drive by this treasure everyday and have no idea how peaceful it is.

Dust in Gravity.. Everything comes to an end..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congradulations to snakeman911 for the FTF&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
    I was in the area exploring noticed a
Geological
feature of a Slump and Slide formation. The formation is noticeably
visible from the road and you can enter the area from an unlocked
gate or stop and look from the parking area with out making a short
walk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
    Tumey Hills are underlain by marine
sedimentary
rocks primarily of Cretaceous age (65 million years ago). During
the Cretaceous, most of California that we see today was
underwater. Small islands, representing the very highest points of
the present day Coast Range, had just begun to emerge from the
ocean. The present day Central Valley was a shallow sea. Large
sea-dwelling reptiles, such as Mosasaurs and Plesiosaurs, swam the
shallow seas along with sea turtles and other marine animals near
the islands. Both the Tumey Hills and Panoche Hills have produced
important fossil finds,including mosasaurs and hadrosaurs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
    There have been many geological events
that have
molded that area as we see today. Tectonics and erosion have played
a big part in the sculpture of most of California and here is more
evidence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Examples of Slides:&lt;br /&gt;
Slump&lt;br /&gt;
A slump is a downward and outward movement of rock or
unconsolidated material moving as a unit or series of units. Large
blocks of material move suddenly downward and outward along a
curved plane.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rockslide&lt;br /&gt;
Rockslides are the most catastrophic type of landslide. They
involve a sudden rapid slide of bedrock along planes of weakness.
Rockslides are very common in the oversteepened canyons and
drainages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Debris Slide&lt;br /&gt;
A debris slide is a small sudden downstope movement of
unconsolidated material. This type of slide produces a hummocky
surface of low relief.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Get out your TOTT's, you
will need a few of them. There is not any need to take anything

I have found a few of

in Merced.

Really nice area and location to have lunch.
&lt;p&gt;Directly east you will have an
excellent view of Schultz Mountain. According to the posted signs,
you could get a permit to hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road is paved and is
accessible with the family cachemobile. The last cache that was
here disappeared in the triangle and really like recycling cache
spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be on the look out for
slithering creatures!&lt;/p&gt;

Fun&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I recently adopted a new friend
that is 12 years old. Her former owner had some health issues and
Pia was placed in foster care. This Border Collie waited 5 months
to be adopted and glad that I have found this terrific companion.
She loves to get in the car and go caching. We walked through my
favorite Turlock park checking out some of the doggie
entertaining points of the great area that is very pet
friendly.&lt;br /&gt;

please contact me&lt;br /&gt;

I have set the level higher as you will need some sort of
transportation to get to each of the three stages. This cache will
also meet the criteria for 'Central Valley Geocaching Challenge '
GC24H5Z.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The final stage has a challenge question and you must have this
answer to log the final stage&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Question: What is the most points that can be scored with 3 darts
on a traditional dartboard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Conehead get another FTF&lt;/p&gt;

Management, is one of the lesser known gems in the motherlode.
There is no shooting allowed and no green-stickered off-road
vehicle activity is permitted. This area is simply gorgeous in the
springtime as there is a myriad of different wildflowers that
flourish here. It is a popular spot for horses to ride as there are
miles of trails to explore and streams to cross. Enjoy the beauty
that is the Red Hills. This cache, like many others, is located
under a pile of rocks stacked on top of each other.

&lt;br /&gt;
 This cache is certifiably crazy! Most cachers should not attempt
this one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Section 5150 of California's Welfare and Institutions Code
states,&quot;When any person, as a result of mental disorder, is a
danger to others, or to himself or herself, or gravely disabled, a
peace officer, member of the attending staff, as defined by
regulation, of an evaluation facility designated by the county,
designated members of a mobile crisis team provided by Section
5651.7, or other professional person designated by the county may,
upon probable cause, take, or cause to be taken, the person into
custody and place him or her in a facility designated by the county
and approved by the State Department of Mental Health as a facility
for 72-hour treatment and evaluation.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 This cache is just a therapeutic expression of my insanity. I
don't want you to hate me....wait, maybe I do....I don't
know.&lt;br /&gt;
 Seven out of the ten voices in my head say &quot;Don't Shoot!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
You might want the following equipment:&lt;br /&gt;
 Flashlight&lt;br /&gt;
 Rope&lt;br /&gt;
Retrieval Tool&lt;br /&gt;
 This is a dangerous cache and by attempting to find it you agree
to accept all responsibility for your actions. It is best that you
just put this on your ignore list and pretend it never existed.
Consider yourself warned.&lt;br /&gt;
 ('k' has nothing to do with this cache)&lt;br /&gt;
My sympathies to TCCBA for they are apparently afflicted with an
insanity almost as deep-seated as mine!

I made it to the top found the cache and proceed to extract it when it fell out and lost it in the tall grass. We searched for quite some time but only came up with the log. Now we had to replace the log with another container so we sacrificed a pen. Everything was replaced and I was about to replace it as found when it slipped out of my hand and fell into a bottomless hole at the base of the pole to be never heard or seen from again. I'm so sorry. I left the silver tip of the original container on the green box at the base of the pole. I contacted Plantdude and he said he would help replacing the cache. Sorry again! TFTC!!!

AVOIDED. HAPPY HUNTING!
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Illuminati, or the &quot;Enlightened Ones&quot;, trace their origins back
to the 1760s and a man named Adam Weishaupt, who defected from the
Catholic church and organized the Illuminati, financed by the
International Bankers. Since then, according to the Illuminati,
their top goal has been to achieve a “one world
government” and to subjugate all religions and governments in
the process. The Illuminati thus attribute all wars since the
French Revolution as having been fomented by them in their pursuit
of their goals. Weishaupt wrote out a master plan in the 1770s
outlining the Illuminati’s goals, finishing on May 1, 1776.
According to the Illuminati, this great day is still commemorated
by Communist nations in the form of May Day. At the time
Weishaupt’s ideology was first introduced, Britain and France
were the two greatest world powers, and so the Illuminati claimed
credit for having kindled the Revolutionary War in order to weaken
the British Empire and the French Revolution to destroy the French
Empire. In the 1780s, the Bavarian Government found out about the
Illuminati’s subversive activities, forcing the Illuminati to
disband and go underground. For the next few decades, the
Illuminati operated under various names and guises, still in active
pursuit of their ultimate goal. According to the Illuminati, the
Napoleonic Wars were a direct result of Illuminati intervention,
and were intended to weaken the governments of Europe. One of the
results of these wars was the “Congress of Vienna”,
supposedly brought about by the Illuminati who there attempted to
form a one world government in the form of a “League of
Nations.” However, Russia held out and the league of nations
was not formed, causing great animosity towards the Russian
government on the part of the Illuminati.&lt;br /&gt;
Their short-term plan foiled, the Illuminati adopted a different
strategy. The Illuminati say that they achieved control over the
European economy through the International Bankers and directed the
composition of Karl Marx’s Communist Manifesto and its
anti-thesis written by Karl Ritter in order to use the differences
between the two ideologies to enable them to “divide larger
and larger members of the human race into opposing camps so that
they could be armed and then brainwashed into fighting and
destroying each other.” Under new leadership by an American
general named Albert Pike, the Illuminati worked out a blueprint
for three world wars throughout the 20th century that would lead to
a one world government by the end of the 20th century. According to
the Illuminati, the First World War was fought to destroy Czarism
in Russia (the Illuminati had held a grudge against the Czarist
regime since Russia had thwarted its plans for a one world
government after the Napoleonic Wars) and to establish Russia as a
stronghold of Communism. Likewise, the Illuminati claim that the
Second World War pitted the Fascists against the “political
Zionists” so as to build up International Communism until it
equaled in strength that of the United Christendom. According to
Illuminati plans, the Third World War, which is to be fought
between the political Zionists and the leaders of the Moslem world,
will drain the international community to the extent that they will
have no choice but to form a one world government.&lt;br /&gt;
There are people that believe that symbols of the &quot;enlightened
ones&quot; are hidden in plain sight in both the architecture and
currency of these United States. Some say that the year found below
the all-seeing eye on the back of a one dollar bill does not
commemorate the founding of our country but marks the completion of
the Illuminati's plans to form a one world government. Subtract
DLXIV from this number. This will give you a number that stands for
inches. When converted to feet, this number will give you an idea
of what is expected of you upon reaching the posted coordinates. An
&quot;enlightened&quot; cache seeker will be prepared for the darkness!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This Shay #3 locomotive is a standard gauge, two truck, 60-ton
locomotive made by the Lima Locomotive &amp; Machine Company of
Lima, Ohio. It was built on April 30, 1910 and sold to the Standard
Lumber Company in the timber-rich Sierra Nevada foothills in
Tuolumne County, California. That same year, the Standard Lumber
Company pressed this locomotive into service on the Sugar Pine
Railway, the steam-logging railroad division of the company. The
new engine hauled many flatcars filled with timber to the mill in
Standard where they were turned into lumber and sold all over the
state.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1925, #3 had a mishap and collided with another engine,
destroying the original wooden cab. The local workmen at Standard
Lumber Company fabricated the steel cab that can be seen today. It
put in many more years of service before being retired.&lt;br /&gt;
Around 1976 &quot;Ol' Number 3&quot;, as she was called, was relocated to its
current location, the entrance to the Mother Lode Fairgrounds near
downtown Sonora&lt;br /&gt;
During a monsoon-like storm in 1996 this locomotive was almost lost
to posterity. May 15, 1996 brought 3.4 inches of rain in 24 hours,
half of that amount coming down in ONE hour (7 AM to 8 AM) A rain
guage on Big Hill collected 7.6 inches from Wednesday morning to
Thursday afternoon! The Save Mart supermarket had six inches of
standing water in it until the front doors were opened and then a
stream of once good merchandise was strewn into the parking lot and
beyond, up to a half-mile away!&lt;br /&gt;
Near the fairgrounds, the creek bulged against a bridge and ripped
out 200 feet of a slate wall protecting the creek's bank. All that
seemed to be holding the bank together was this 60 ton steam train!
Only now it was sitting on tracks that were hanging 3 ft. above the
missing bank below. Three tow trucks from Vic's Chevron were
dispatched to try and save the locomotive from sliding in to the
creek.&lt;br /&gt;
They attached six steel cables to the locomotive to stabilize it.
Working all day long, dump trucks hauled in over 300 yards of dirt
and rock to be carefully pushed under and around the giant machine
with backhoes. A 125-ton, $600 an hour crane was brought in from
Modesto to hoist Old Shay #3, one end at a time, onto new makeshift
tracks.&lt;br /&gt;
The Modesto Bee reported local city administrator Greg Applegate as
saying, &quot; I don't know what it's going to cost, but it's worth it.
We're saving a piece of history&quot;. Thankfully, this piece of history
is still a local landmark and even gets some attention during the
holidays as it is decorated with Christmas lights. Sonora can be
proud to have such a fine piece of machinery welcome all who visit
this quaint little city in the heart of the gold country!</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I begun searching for this one around 8:30  this morning without using any of the hints. My main focus was on the train, but about 15 minutes into the search something caught my eye. It was no doubt a cache, but not THE cache. Inside said &quot;2009 Sonora Great Geocache Hunt by Professor Geo&quot; and the log had already once been signed back in late december of 09...I was reeeally confused and didn't think it was the cache i was looking for, but signed it none the less and put it back. Later in the day i logged on and took a look at the hints and confirmed that that wasn't the cache and that this FTF was still up for grabs, so i grabbed a friend and scrambled back down there and within about 10 minutes, nabbed my second FTF within 24 hours! Thanks for giving me the opportunity to check out this train! TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br /&gt;
 A giant oak stands tall against the sky,&lt;br /&gt;
A majesty of strength with leaves that cling&lt;br /&gt;
And rustle in the breeze. A watchful eye&lt;br /&gt;
May spot a nest where noisy bluejays sing.&lt;br /&gt;
This tree has lived a thousand years or more&lt;br /&gt;
And gently touched with shade each thoughtful face.&lt;br /&gt;
Its branches, gnarled with age, uplifted---soar;&lt;br /&gt;
On earth, the shadows form a scarf of lace.&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps, a tempest marred this modest oak&lt;br /&gt;
By carving furrows deep within its thigh.&lt;br /&gt;
How often did this giant laugh and joke?&lt;br /&gt;
Did sufferings bring forth a trembling sigh?&lt;br /&gt;
Proud landmark on the hill, for man you hold&lt;br /&gt;
A multitude of secrets left untold.&lt;br /&gt;

I for one have never seen nor heard of such a cache like this. At the posted coordinates you will find a certain object with a small plaque that has instructions on what to do. This object, along with the additional hint on the plaque, will lead you to the actual cache location. The total time to retrieve the actual cache shouldn't take more than 10 or 15 minutes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and have fun!</groundspeak:long_description>

And not like regular mud, but like a sticky red clay mud that clings to whatever touches it, including you, and weighs you down. Also, it's not advised to park in the obvious parking area when wet, the whole lot is full of the sticky clay and it's really easy to get stuck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BYOP and please put cache back the way you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If your from the angels camp area, or drive through it often, you've probably noticed the large mountain west of the town. The one with the radio towers on top. Thats Bear Mountain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once at the cache site, you'll get a good view towards Copperopolis. However, if you want a really good panoramic view, you can hike up the road towards the radio towers. Go at your own risk, though. Theres a few open gates you'll have to pass through with old faded &quot;no trespassing&quot; signs. Once your at the top, you'll be able to see all the way to the delta, all of melones and angels, and all the way to the highest peaks of the sierras! The only time i've ever seen anyone up there is when i was approached by a deputy, however he had no problem with me being up there as long as i wasn't causing any trouble, so it should be all good. Oh,  and if you do hike up there, don't forget you camera! </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a unique challenge. There is
poison oak in the area but it can be avoided. Children not
recommended. Seek only during daylight. Rated 4.5 stars for the
rock scrambling that is involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydraulic mining was a variation on
ground sluicing where the water delivered to the site would be shot
through a nozzle at high pressure onto the face of the cliff,
thereby washing away tons of boulders, gravel, dirt, and ounces of
gold.&lt;br /&gt;
The first use of this method is credited to Edward Mattison in 1853
who supplied the water through a rawhide hose to a nozzle he carved
out of wood. Later miners upgraded their hoses to metal or the more
desirable canvas, and the nozzle soon became iron. Technological
advances made the hose and nozzle connections more flexible and
allowed greater movement. Lavish attention was paid to the design
and specifications of the nozzle and companies began producing
their competing appliances. The product names were various —
Hoskin’s Dictator and Hoskin’s Little Giant are examples. But the
name that stuck was the product name of the Craig Company — the
Monitor.&lt;br /&gt;
The Monitors were powerful to say the least. When the water reached
the Monitor it was compressed into a nozzle that was anywhere from
one inch to eight inches in diameter. The stream of water that
could wash down whole hillsides was impressive to behold. In his
multi-volume 1874 - 1890 classic History of California, the
historian Hubert Howe Bancroft stated that an eight-inch Monitor
could throw 185,000 cubic feet of water in an hour with a velocity
of 150 feet per second. Other accounts of the force are less
technical but just as startling. One description points out that a
strong man could not swing a crowbar through a six-inch Monitor
stream, yet another commented on the striking phenomenon of a
fifty-pound boulder riding the crest of a jet with the power of a
cannonball. Documented evidence recalls that men were killed by the
force of the water from 200 feet away.&lt;br /&gt;
 The Monitors operated twenty-fours a day with the mines
illuminated by high-intensity lighting or locomotive headlights.
The amount of water needed was enormous. At the North Bloomfield
mine, sixty million gallons of water was used daily. Thomas Bell,
the president of the company, estimated in 1876 that the hydraulic
mine would consume 16 billion gallons of water in that year
alone.&lt;br /&gt;
The debris created was equally enormous. North Bloomfield, a mine
about 1 1/8 mile long and 350 - 550 feet deep excavated 41 million
cubic yards of material between 1866 and 1884. In 1891, a group of
government engineers estimated that hydraulic mining had deposited
210,746,100 cubic yards of debris along the basins of three rivers
alone -- the Yuba, American, and Bear.&lt;br /&gt;
 The environmental results were catastrophic. A typical description
was penned in 1868 by Samuel Bowles, a visitor to the California
gold country:&lt;br /&gt;
 Tornado, flood, earthquake and volcano combined could hardly make
greater havoc, spread wider ruin and wreck, than are to be seen
everywhere in the track of the larger gold-washing operations. None
of the interior streams of California, though naturally pure as
crystal, escape the change to a thick yellow mud from this cause,
early in their progress from the hills. The Sacramento River is
worse than the Missouri. Many of the streams are turned out of
their original channels, either directly for mining purposes, or in
consequence of the great masses of soil and gravel that come down
from the gold-washing above. Thousands of acres of fine land along
their banks are ruined forever by the deposits of this character. A
farmer may have his whole estate turned into a barren waste by a
flood of sand and gravel from some hydraulic mining up stream;
more, if a fine orchard or garden stands in the way of the working
of a rich gulch or bank, orchard or garden must go. Then the
tornout, dug- out, washed to pieces and then washed over side-
hills, masses that have been or are being subjected to the
hydraulics of the miners, are the very devil's chaos indeed. The
country is full of them among the mining districts of the Sierra
Nevada, and they are truly a terrible blot upon the face of
Nature.&lt;br /&gt;

It's a 4 star terrain for a reason!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Lost to the relatively new growth of thick pine-oak woodland, Columbia’s Labyrinth is a maze of marble rock spires exposed by hydraulic mining in the mid 1800’s. Exploring Columbia’s Labyrinth today provides a unique balance of historical nostalgia and adventure. The outlandish spires are formed in the right shape and are endowed with the right amount of handholds to provide a technical rock climbing paradise.&quot; You can read more about it here http://mysierramountaintimes.com/2008/04/a-historical-adventure-navigating-columbia%E2%80%99s-labyrinth/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;climbing gear isn't necessary, but the risk of falling down 20+ ft. crevices are still imminent so pleeease be careful and watch your step! I definitely recommend the buddy system on this cache. People have been known to get lost in here so be sure to pack some extra batteries for the gps, just incase. Speaking of gps, the reception may be a little spotty. I don't want this to be a hard find so go ahead and take advantage of the hints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theres a small unmarked trail that goes right through the middle of the labyrinth. You can access that trail from either Columbia College's Arboretum Trail or from Columbia State Park. I'll add waypoints for each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now if your anything like me, you'll want to spend hours exploring the many passages and trails after finding this cache so Good Luck and Have Fun!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;CO27G9Q - College Trail head&lt;br/&gt;N 38° 01.832 W 120° 23.563&lt;br/&gt;Beginning of the trail head from Columbia College's Arboretum Trail&lt;br/&gt;SP27G9Q - State Park Trailhead&lt;br/&gt;N 38° 01.958 W 120° 23.852&lt;br/&gt;Beginning of the trail head at Columbia State Park</groundspeak:long_description>

J and I set out to conquer this cache and enjoy the beautiful weather.  Both objectives were accomplished!  We had to be light on our feet as to avoid the poison oak that has exploded as of late.  I still managed to get it.  We contemplated the meaning behind the &quot;666&quot; reference embedded into the coordinates!  Just a coincidence?  I think not!!  ;o)  We traversed up, down, under, over and through the Labyrinth until we found the treasure we were searching for!  What fun!  Now to head back...&quot;Let's follow our tracks back&quot;, said K.  &quot;No.  I think there is a trail up over this way&quot;, said J.  I thought I had better follow J since he did have the GPS after all.  We didn't search too long for the trail J thought was there, but getting to it was a different story.  The climb out was much more difficult than either of us had thought it would be (based on our walk in).  We made it out and back to our car where we stripped down to our undies, on account of the poison oak soaked clothing, and proceeded to drive home.  Luckily, for local law enforcement, we were not stopped and our journey home was uneventful.  J and I highly recommend you attempt this clever and fun cache!!  The coordinates were spot on and the hints helped us nail this one down.  We may even go back and try to come at it from a different angle next time!  A great challenge!  Thanks!

in the extreme sport of globe riding.&lt;br /&gt;
What is globe riding? Globe riding is the act of rolling down a
hill in a large transparent inflatable rubber globe.&lt;br /&gt;
What does globe riding have to do with the old Columbia School
House? Well, not far from the schoolhouse, on a well defined nature
trail, one can visit a grassy meadow and practice rolling down hill
sans globe. No equipment required.&lt;br /&gt;
All one needs to do is lay prone on the ground at a perpendicular
to the incline and use your upper elbow to start you rolling down
hill. Once you start to roll, keep your forearms folded close to
your chest with your hands near your neck to keep your chin from
hitting the ground.&lt;br /&gt;
The object is to roll down the hill faster than your competitor or
you can try to beat your own time by using a stopwatch.&lt;br /&gt;
Above all, have fun and remember to get up slowly as you will be
dizzy. But what a rush!&lt;br /&gt;

However, i think that definition can be stretched to include asphalt =P&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you haven't seen the music video to Weezer's &quot;Island In The Sun&quot; then you probably won't understand the significance of the cache site. I would recommend watching it before looking for this cache, especially in the summer months. (click link below to see video)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C3zgYW_FAM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I came across this place, I immediately thought of that music video. Not just because it's an island thats usually in the sun, but during the summer months, the terrain is exactly the same! The oak tree, tall dead grass, I even saw some cute little animals running around when i placed the cache!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now about the cache itself. Tis a homemade cache thats well camo'd. The log is in the battery compartment, located on the bottom of the cache. please do not unscrew the top of the cache where the camo is! When putting the cache back, make sure it stays put. I had trouble making it stay when placed.</groundspeak:long_description>

Explore new ways to cook things, explore a piece of machinery to figure out how it works, and especially explore old back roads and structures. For me, there's nothing like getting into my 4WD and cruising down gnarly old forest roads just for the sole purpose of seeing where they go and what might be at the end of the road. Sometimes i come across old mines and dilapidated cabins. Sometimes the road just ends abruptly and i have to either back up a quarter mile or make a 15-point u-turn. Then theres the times where you crest upon a ridge and take in a view that nearly takes your breath away. Thats what this cache is all about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get to this cache, your going to need a good 4x4. Most stock SUVs should make it as long as it has 4LO and good ground clearance...and someone who knows how to drive in extreme off-road conditions. As for the cache, it should be an easy to find ammo-can. With all that said, have fun and BE SAFE!...OH! and don't forget your camera!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located in the El Dorado National Forest near Union Valley Reservoir and just off the main road leading to the Sunset campgrounds. Easy parking and approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big pat on the back for us! This is the first geocache Team Cachew has placed in the wild! And we managed to come up with (what we think is) a great concept for placement. We found this cache container sitting on the trail, a regular piece of garbage that some disrespectful hiker decided to drop in the woods. We thought &quot;that would make a perfect cache container&quot; and then immediately thought &quot;why don't we turn it into one and properly place it in this spot!&quot;. So we cleaned it up and scrounged up some (pretty decent) items for the initial stash. Fortunately, we had something to serve as a log book, and threw a pen in there. And now we're inspired to recycle more aloof discards into fun treasures for others to find. Thanks for visiting and enjoy the view! </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>You might be able to see the reservoir from here, but this cache has an even &quot;bolder&quot; view of the water. Container is a large mixed nut jar.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Check this cache out, and drop in some fresh batteries (or anything else) while you're there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I placed this cache here because I thought that it was a neat place for a cache. It's located by the stream, and by the derelict ruins of the old dam.&lt;br/&gt;The theme of this cache is batteries. So often people will get stuck out in the wilderness with their GPS batteries running out. I left a couple of AA's out there, as well as some various other things. Feel free to leave anything, but if you've got an extra set of batteries lying around, please drop them in. Maybe you'll save someone's life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't worry if you don't have batteries, though, anything is welcome!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">An adventurous cache in a beautiful spot.  The cache sits on top of a dome at 5,500 feet.  It is off-trail and the distance  from the road could be very deceiving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache sits on top of a dome, which is part of the ridge that comes down from Clyde Mountain to the Yuba River at Bowman Lake Road.  There are numerous ways to approach this cache, but a direct route from Bowman Lake Road, while possible, is very steep and clogged with brush.  We parked next to a green gate where the old dirt road crosses the new paved one, walked down (south) this road just past a lake to a fork.  A hundred feet on the right fork brings you to a dead-end.  Head up the steep hill  to the right for a short while, between rock outcroppings to gain the ridge.  From the ridge, Dumbledome should be visible.  For those who are off-trail regularly, this should be an easy adventurous half-day.  I will be posting coordinates for the approach ASAP as hints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are wonderful views in all directions, from the Sierra summits, to the Coastal Mountains and the Yuba River drainage.  Keep your eyes open for the tell-tail signs of glacial activity.  There are erratics (Boulders from distant areas that were dropped here by the glacier thousands of years ago) and lots of scrapes on the rock where the glacier dragged rocks along the surface.  Imagine standing here with hundreds of feet of ice above you.</groundspeak:long_description>

The size of it is certainly not &quot;large&quot; according to what Opencaching considers large, it was small in my book. Large is 5 gallon bucket, this was much smaller than that.</groundspeak:text>

Small children, pets, and persons with weak knees are advised to stay home. Wear gloves and hiking boots, and make the crossing in the morning when it is cool. From the Chevron station in Christmas Valley, Oregon, travel 2 miles east on Christmas Valley Highway to Millican Road. Turn left, keeping to the main paved road for another 7.4 miles, at which point the road will turn east. After another mile, the road will turn north again. Travel one mile north, and at the bend in the road, turn left and travel west along a dirt road which follows a wire fence. At one mile from the pavement you will pass through a gate which you should close behind you. Proceed from this point about one half mile west to the edge of the lava flow and park your vehicle. Proceed on foot through the gate at the end of the fence, and skirt around the lava flow, bearing north and northwest for one mile. This will bring you to a point at the edge of the lava that is nearest to the Twin Fault. At this point, you will enter the lava flow, and travel about .25 mile southwest to one end of the fault, which runs from northwest to southeast.</groundspeak:long_description>

Nice to see them not being used any more. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Tried to locate this close to the highway right-of-way and yet within safe reach.  When I was working summers in northern California, earning money to attend UCSB in Santa Barbara, I worked at Pacific Lumber Company in Scotia.  Those wigwam burners were perhaps 2-3 times the height of this one and were built on concrete piers with tunnels for capturing the ash.  We use to clean the tunnels each summer, during annual maintenance, a task easily qualified for the &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot; program series.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This can be a great outing for 4-wheeling.
However, if all you have is your mother's Buick, you can probably
get there. But you'll &lt;b&gt;wish&lt;/b&gt; you had at least a light-duty
truck.
&lt;p&gt;The cache is about an hour drive out of
civilization. Fairly rough and rocky drive in the last half. This
is a late spring, summer and early fall cache. Sure to be snowed
over in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altitude is 5,000 feet, bring a light
jacket. The cache is up the hill 100 yards or so. Easy hike!! Ammo
container containing: small bungee cord, &quot;eyeball&quot; bouncy ball,
bell, purple die, Cub Scout Wolf neck-tie slide, pen and logbook.
Pretty much &quot;muggle-free&quot; environment unless you count the deer and
elk and the occasional Jeremiah Johnsons. Site is maintained by our
son who has a cabin near the cache. All contact should go through
us (pazooter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and BYOP!&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocachingwa.org&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PZP6HE - Trailhead #2&lt;br /&gt;N 47° 09.626 W 120° 17.251&lt;br /&gt;If approaching from the S.W., at this juncture Colockum Road forks in 3 directions.

&lt;h1&gt;Blue Sky - Coldwater River &quot;S&quot; Bend&lt;/h1&gt;

 



&lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden in a BC Park. BC Parks supports geocaching!
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcgeocaching.com/pdf/BC_Parks_Geocaching_Policy.pdf&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;
is a link to the BC Parks geocaching policies, please familiarize
yourself with them. Through cooperation with BC Parks, we can keep
geocaching a fun and supported activity in BC's Provincial
Parks&lt;/p&gt;
Coldwater River &quot;S&quot; Bend was selected as a cache site to promote
active living and environmentally friendly geocaching. The location
was picked for its close proximity to the Trans Canada Trail in the
Coldwater River Provincial Park. Traditional access to this park is
by way of vehicle, as it is located just off the Coquihalla
Highway. However, one could access and explore this beautiful area
in various ways thus reducing our carbon footprint while caching
and exploring.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
People could access this park in many ways. One could car pool. One
could bike to it. One could walk to it. Also, one could horseback
ride to it. And if one is really creative, one could take the
Greyhound bus and exit the bus at the Coldwater River exit and walk
or bike to the cache. Getting home, well that's where one gets
creative. As you see, if one was to change the way or means one was
to arrive at this cache it would help reduce our carbon impact on
the environment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A suggestion to fully experience this cache is to park where the
old KVR rail bed crosses Brookmere Road. There is a small pull out
just after the cattle guard. From here you step back in time on a
leisurely stroll along the historic old Kettle Valley Railway bed,
now the Trans Canada Trail. This is a great opportunity to really
absorb the sights and sounds surrounding you as you make your way
to the cache. And it is a great place to engage in a variety of
recreational activities, swimming, camping, snow shoeing, hiking
etc. Remember once you are there, take the time to explore the
area, you will discover a lot of history, up and down the
line.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please share your story in your log about how you chose to get to
the cache. Remember, by choosing an alternative method to arrive at
the cache (bike, hike, horse, walk) instead of driving, you have
made a difference in helping your environment.
&lt;p&gt;In these caches, you'll find some ProjectBlueSky geocoins for
the first finders. Please only take one... if you have one from
another cache, please leave them for other people. There are also
some other pins and swag from BC Parks, BCGA and Project Blue
Sky.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would like to give a SPECIAL THANKS TO COULOIR for sending me
here to place a cache!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When we first stopped we thought 'not down and over there surely' , after assessing the situation we found a road and from the parking we were soon at the cache location. 

This is a fantastic location and the views of the Coldwater River pools from the road and bridge are great, seeing what I saw here today, I will be back but perhaps I will bring other fun things other than a gps.

Nice little scramble up to the cache and a well placed cache which accomplishes the intent of the series, well done.

&lt;strong&gt;CONGRATULATIONS to MicheleBe on her FTF!!&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache container is a medium sized round lock n lock with a few swag items and log.  The coords should be accurate to +/- 10 ft.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache was placed to bring you to a relatively unknown and forgotten memorial for a young &lt;strong&gt;British Columbia Provincial Police Constable&lt;/strong&gt; who was killed near the cairn by the McLean Brothers on December 8, 1879.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Tannatt Ussher, usually known as Johnny Ussher, was a settler, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Provincial_magistrate&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1&quot;&gt;provincial magistrate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Commissioner&quot;&gt;Gold Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_Country&quot;&gt;Thompson Country&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia_Interior&quot;&gt;Southern Interior of British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada&quot;&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; in the 1870s.  John Tannatt Ussher was the son of Samuel Ussher Esq., a lawyer in Montreal, and Harriet Rebecca Colclough.  He was born October 17, 1830.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 1879 the renegade sons of former &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamloops,_British_Columbia&quot;&gt;Fort Kamloops&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chief_Trader&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1&quot;&gt;Chief Trader&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_McLean_%28fur_trader%29&quot;&gt;Donald McLean&lt;/a&gt;, led by his eldest son &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_McLean_%28outlaw%29&quot;&gt;Allan&lt;/a&gt; and accompanied by their friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alex_Hare&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1&quot;&gt;Alex Hare&lt;/a&gt;, went on a drunken rampage across the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Country&quot;&gt;Nicola&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_Country&quot;&gt;Thompson Countries&lt;/a&gt;.  The &quot;Wild McLeans&quot; went on a binge of horse-thievery and stealing flour, liquor, ammunition and clothing.  Ussher, whose duties as Gold Commissioner included the roles of constable and jailer as well as magistrate and who had previously demurred on arresting the McLeans, as attempts to hold them in the flimsy jail in Kamloops would prove futile, rode out with John McLeod, with Amni Shumway as guide, and rancher William Palmer, whose prize stallion the McLeans had stolen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ussher and his party surprised the McLeans at Long Lake (near &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quilchena,_British_Columbia&quot;&gt;Quilchena&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Lake&quot;&gt;Nicola Lake&lt;/a&gt;) on 8 December, 1879, and was killed in the ensuing gun battle, which also wounded McLeod and Allan McLean.  Fleeing the consequences of Ussher's killing, the McLeans sought refuge with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_people&quot;&gt;Nicola people&lt;/a&gt; and made a speech to their chief &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chilliheetza&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1&quot;&gt;Chilliheetza&lt;/a&gt;, son of the famous &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_%28chief%29&quot;&gt;Chief Nicola&lt;/a&gt;, trying to enlist their support in a revived version of the abortive uprising planned by the Interior First Nations peoples in 1874.  Chilliheetza refused, knowing that the boys' motivation was not political but caused by drink, and chastised them for their shameful behaviour.  On December 13 the McLeans and Hare surrendered and were brought to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia_Penitentiary&quot;&gt;BC Penitentiary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Westminster,_British_Columbia&quot;&gt;New Westminster&lt;/a&gt; to await trial.  They were, after a second trial had to be held because of technicalities, hung for the murder of Johnny Ussher on January 31, 1881.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Ussher)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The cache is located very close to the trail head for the Johnny Ussher Memorial Cairn which is located on private land.  The owners do not mind people accessing the property as long as you do not leave the gate open, stay to the trail and respect the property by not wandering about, cutting anything or leaving any garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you enter through the gate, go to your right and follow a small trail til you see the power line overhead, then follow the power line to the clearing.  Please don't follow the fence line ahead of you when you go through the gate, as it is currently a dried pond.  The trail you want is short and parallels the road.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The coords are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gate:&lt;/strong&gt; N 50° 30.155 W 120° 18.334 (this is only an approximation, look for a gate, it is not far from the cache, on the other side of the road)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Cairn:&lt;/strong&gt; N 50° 30.089 W 120° 18.140&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please park well off the road. Enjoy the cache and then if you choose to see the cairn, take a few minutes when you get there to reflect &quot;on a brave pioneer who gave his life for law and order on a cold December day nearly 130 years ago.&quot;</groundspeak:long_description>

The second quick look for the &quot;actual&quot; first stage soon led us to the intended final. This was a pleasant surprise as none of us had been up here before. Missed out on a couple of others in the general area but then we have an excuse to come back.

Thanks for the fun today

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache IS AT THE POSTED COORDS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In August I reached a caching milestone, with my two close friends my brother and a fellow I grew up with, at BC’s First Cache, Treehugger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We landed at ground zero after making two dozen drive by’s of the parking lot.  It was an extremely hot day and many people were vying for a coveted parking spot to take in the cooler ocean air near the beach.  Now who would have thought the parking lot would be packed full . . .  not me, a geocacher from the little hamlet of Kamloops, who can always find parking and a spot on a beach . . . lol.  Finally after making the rounds a few more times we spotted a couple from Washington State, who had been kayaking, packing up and preparing to leave.  Ah yes, geo-luck was on our side as we happened to be in the right place at just the right time.  We parked, we walked, we talked, and we laughed all the way up the trail. We hiked and played as we did as kids in the wilds of our hometown on the Sunshine Coast.  It’s a good thing that nobody was around to view the antics of us old guys regressing to young boys.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was a huge milestone for me.   I had made a commitment to myself to pick up zero caches from my last find in the middle of July.  It was essential I did not pick up one cache before my anniversary date.  It was a very long and arduous wait.  Perhaps you might want to try it sometime and then share the feelings you experience with being geo celibate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, you are probably saying, what does his story have to do with this cache.  Well, in my traditional form of hiding something, you will need to read between the lines in order to get into this cache.  Getting there is as easy as loading your gps with the coords and heading out for a short drive in the country.  However, signing the log will be the challenge.  And that my fellow cachers, as Paul Harvey used to say, will be the “rest of the story” that you will write.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will know when you get there what I mean.  So, before you go, print this story so you have it in hand, it is your tool or you will just have taken a scenic country drive with no smiley at the end of the journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use the geo force fellow cacher, bring this story!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Print the story and bring it with you!!  What designates Treehugger (GC1DD) as BC’s First Cache?  Up and under about chest level. Align them with Master.  Now you can sign the log.  Did I say bring the story?</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

you at. Ask yourself, that infamous question. &quot;What does Rokman4
want me to see?&quot;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a fairly simple 2 stage multi in a
majestic place that most people would never stop at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 1 should be self explanatory, especially
where I have placed you with the coords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final stage is a spot to stop and reflect
on the sights and sounds around
you.  This spot was
chosen to calm that inner voice that may or may not like my style
of hiding caches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geocaching is about physical and mental
challenges.  It is you,
the cacher, who has been my inspiration to take on the physical
caches in our area and get involved in the great outdoors, now I
try to give back in the form of being creative and helping others
to think outside the box and learn to observe all around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun, be safe and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Traditional cache on the Iron Mask Batholith.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small custom camo'd lock n lock which contains a log, pencil, sharpener, and small trade items.  Due to the size please keep trade items small.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache will require some looking and perseverance, as  the coords put you 30 feet from the location.  It will be obvious when you stand at the 'exact' coords.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I stopped here after a Great Day of caching and wondered about the history of the area seen from the magnificant view in front of me.  So I did a little research and below is what I found in it's simplist form.  It gave me quite the appreciation for the gem of a city and province we live in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Iron Mask batholith (large body of igneous rock formed beneath the Earth’s surface by the intrusion and solidification of magma) lies in the southern part of the Quesnel trough, also known as the Nicola belt. The most important pre-Tertiary rocks in this belt are Upper Triassic volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Nicola Group. The batholith is a subvolcanic, multiple intrusion which is comagmatic (said of igneous rocks that have a common set of chemical and mineralogic features, and thus are regarded as having been derived from a common parent magma) and coeval (can technically describe any two or more entities that coexist, it is most typically used to refer to things that have existed together) with the Nicola rocks. It is situated along the southwest side of a regional northwest trending fracture zone and is itself cut by numerous northwesterly faults.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The batholith comprises two major northwest trending plutons (a large body of igneous rock formed when magma is injected into the surrounding country rock and crystallizes) separated by 6 kilometres of Eocene Kamloops Group volcanic and sedimentary rocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tertiary rocks occupy what appears to be a graben (the result of a block of land being down thrown producing a valley with a distinct scarp on each side) structure resulting from renewed fault movement around the margins of the plutons during Paleocene or Early Eocene time. The larger pluton, the 18 kilometre long southern part of the batholith, is called the Iron Mask pluton. The smaller Cherry Creek pluton farther northwest, outcrops on either side of Kamloops Lake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The combined exposure of the batholith, including the intervening younger rocks, is about 33 kilometres long and 5 kilometres wide.  Sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the Kamloops Group unconformably overlie the Nicola rocks and the Iron Mask batholith. These include tuffaceous (A sandstone which contains volcanic ash) sandstone, siltstone and shale with minor conglomerate, as well as basaltic (Basalt is a common extrusive volcanic rock. It is usually gray to black and fine-grained due to rapid cooling of lava at the surface of a planet) to andesitic (The class of rock which crystallizes from silicate minerals at intermediate temperatures is sometimes referred to as &quot;andesitic&quot; rock) flows and agglomerates (from the Latin 'agglomerare' meaning 'to form into a ball', are coarse accumulations of large blocks of volcanic material that contain at least 75% bombs) with minor dacite (an igneous, volcanic rock with a high iron content), latite (extrusive igneous rock very abundant in western North America. Usually coloured white, yellowish, pinkish) and trachyte (a light-colored igneous rock consisting essentially of alkali feldspar).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the cache, be safe and enjoy the view in front of you.</groundspeak:long_description>

Having said that, your new Stage 1 is now a MICRO, not a nano and it is LEFT and LOW as you approach the coords after leaving the trail.  I will try to modify the original Stage 1 so it will hold up to the activity it may receive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other two stages should be fairly easy to find, they are where I have you standing and I have made them somewhat obvious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the views as you trek the ridge.

Use extreme stealth and discretion when retrieving this stage.  It is a high muggle area.  This cache is definitely a &quot;really think hard outside the box&quot; type which includes a nano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage 2 is one of my home made &quot;a little bigger than a micro&quot; cache container with the coord's to the cache.  This container has amazing polarity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final is a unique home made cache box that can not be mistaken as a cache box.  The camo makes it blend with the surrounding cover.  Inside it contains small items for trade, a log, a pencil, a pencil sharpener, a trackable geocoin at the time of placing and a como'd micro cylinder for the first to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All coord's have been triple checked, so you will be within feet of the location.  Let your GPS settle down when you arrive.  I took readings on both cloudy and clear days and the GPS bounced until I stepped back and re walked toward the location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This can be a high Muggle area so please use caution when retrieving and replacing the containers.  Also, please place Stage 1 back at the level it was found.  Again, the FTFinder will set precedence.  It is of &quot;utmost importance&quot; the cache is replaced at exactly the same level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have added one hint and will supply additional hints by email if really, really needed.  Have fun, be safe, enjoy the challenge as you think outside of the 'box' and be on high alert for Muggles.</groundspeak:long_description>

I found the cache under a concrete no post barrier that was tilted on its side, balanced on edge so to speak. As seasoned cachers and as newbies, one thing to always, always, ALWAYS REMEMBER is caches are placed with NO RISK TO LIFE OR LIMB!!!!!! I do not know who replaced the cache where it was found previously to my archiving it, however, where it was originally placed was not under a no post concrete barrier in which I would endanger, in this case your limbs.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;PLEASE &lt;u&gt;READ ALL THE DIRECTIONS&lt;/u&gt; CAREFULLY BEFORE PROCEEDING FOR THE CACHE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST AND FOREMOST . . . I can only ask this!  I would like a new cacher with less than 100 finds and who has never had a FTF to be the FTF for this cache.  Again, I can only ASK that you respect my wish.  THANKS!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This cache is on private property with the owners permission (yes I gave myself permission to place it on my property)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is going to take a little time, unless of course you are lucky.  Your challenge is to find the correct last three numbers of the North and West coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the box you will see 16 round headed screws.  On the North marked side is 8 screws and on the West marked side is 8 screws.  These screws are separated by the &lt;strong&gt;green diode&lt;/strong&gt;.  Beside each of these screws you will find a set of three numbers.  Of the 8 number sets on the North and West side, only one on each side is the correct numbers that will complete the North and West coordinates, these will lead you to the final stage of the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have hurd of crappy caches, but have never placed one. So the need to beef up my bovinity prompted me to high tail it up and plop a small container at this location. There was no mis steak here, that's how I dung did it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a micro and coords should be no more than a patty or two off target. The hide will be obvious. I managed to hoof it over the range without incident. There was an udder way to go, however I chose this path. Keep in mind, for me, it was head down, focused, focused, focused, always mooo ving forward ever so carefully to prevent a raw hide. I was glad I trekked in the days light.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember, no sight seeing during the ascent, you will see sights as you horn in on ground zero and that's no bull.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Bessy's field the patties flow,&lt;br /&gt;
Amongst the places bovines go.&lt;br /&gt;
They leave their mark, look low not high,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;To avoid the experience of a bovine pie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A geocaching green bison tube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placed just off the famous Alaska Highway. We just had to put a cache here in honour of G.P cacher: 4 Paws and Then Some. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently the cache had to be moved, and with the help of fellow cacher Kornie the location has been changed. The cache is now closer to the building,&lt;br/&gt;and permission has been recieved for the cache to be there. Happy Caching! &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;While there why not get your pet grooming?</groundspeak:long_description>
