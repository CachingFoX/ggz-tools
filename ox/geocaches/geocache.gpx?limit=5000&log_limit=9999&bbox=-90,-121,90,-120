It's a wonderful place to come and bird watch, turtle watch or just watch the waves roll by.  Be discrete and careful when looking for this cache. It is located right next to the trail. There is no need to go off the trail or into any sensitive areas at all. There is absolutely NO bushwhacking necessary for this cache. The cache is well hidden and out of view. Please leave it better than you found it. </groundspeak:long_description>

This use to be the old road to Morro Bay from Los Osos. Once connecting to Turi road over the bridge now hidden in the trees just beyond the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

 This cache is certifiably crazy! Most cachers should not attempt
this one.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Section 5150 of California's Welfare and Institutions Code
states,&quot;When any person, as a result of mental disorder, is a
danger to others, or to himself or herself, or gravely disabled, a
peace officer, member of the attending staff, as defined by
regulation, of an evaluation facility designated by the county,
designated members of a mobile crisis team provided by Section
5651.7, or other professional person designated by the county may,
upon probable cause, take, or cause to be taken, the person into
custody and place him or her in a facility designated by the county
and approved by the State Department of Mental Health as a facility
for 72-hour treatment and evaluation.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 This cache is just a therapeutic expression of my insanity. I
don't want you to hate me....wait, maybe I do....I don't
know.&lt;br/&gt;
 Seven out of the ten voices in my head say &quot;Don't Shoot!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
You might want the following equipment:&lt;br/&gt;
 Flashlight&lt;br/&gt;
 Rope&lt;br/&gt;
Retrieval Tool&lt;br/&gt;
 This is a dangerous cache and by attempting to find it you agree
to accept all responsibility for your actions. It is best that you
just put this on your ignore list and pretend it never existed.
Consider yourself warned.&lt;br/&gt;
 ('k' has nothing to do with this cache)&lt;br/&gt;
My sympathies to TCCBA for they are apparently afflicted with an
insanity almost as deep-seated as mine!

I made it to the top found the cache and proceed to extract it when it fell out and lost it in the tall grass. We searched for quite some time but only came up with the log. Now we had to replace the log with another container so we sacrificed a pen. Everything was replaced and I was about to replace it as found when it slipped out of my hand and fell into a bottomless hole at the base of the pole to be never heard or seen from again. I'm so sorry. I left the silver tip of the original container on the green box at the base of the pole. I contacted Plantdude and he said he would help replacing the cache. Sorry again! TFTC!!!

AVOIDED. HAPPY HUNTING!
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Illuminati, or the &quot;Enlightened Ones&quot;, trace their origins back
to the 1760s and a man named Adam Weishaupt, who defected from the
Catholic church and organized the Illuminati, financed by the
International Bankers. Since then, according to the Illuminati,
their top goal has been to achieve a “one world
government” and to subjugate all religions and governments in
the process. The Illuminati thus attribute all wars since the
French Revolution as having been fomented by them in their pursuit
of their goals. Weishaupt wrote out a master plan in the 1770s
outlining the Illuminati’s goals, finishing on May 1, 1776.
According to the Illuminati, this great day is still commemorated
by Communist nations in the form of May Day. At the time
Weishaupt’s ideology was first introduced, Britain and France
were the two greatest world powers, and so the Illuminati claimed
credit for having kindled the Revolutionary War in order to weaken
the British Empire and the French Revolution to destroy the French
Empire. In the 1780s, the Bavarian Government found out about the
Illuminati’s subversive activities, forcing the Illuminati to
disband and go underground. For the next few decades, the
Illuminati operated under various names and guises, still in active
pursuit of their ultimate goal. According to the Illuminati, the
Napoleonic Wars were a direct result of Illuminati intervention,
and were intended to weaken the governments of Europe. One of the
results of these wars was the “Congress of Vienna”,
supposedly brought about by the Illuminati who there attempted to
form a one world government in the form of a “League of
Nations.” However, Russia held out and the league of nations
was not formed, causing great animosity towards the Russian
government on the part of the Illuminati.&lt;br/&gt;
Their short-term plan foiled, the Illuminati adopted a different
strategy. The Illuminati say that they achieved control over the
European economy through the International Bankers and directed the
composition of Karl Marx’s Communist Manifesto and its
anti-thesis written by Karl Ritter in order to use the differences
between the two ideologies to enable them to “divide larger
and larger members of the human race into opposing camps so that
they could be armed and then brainwashed into fighting and
destroying each other.” Under new leadership by an American
general named Albert Pike, the Illuminati worked out a blueprint
for three world wars throughout the 20th century that would lead to
a one world government by the end of the 20th century. According to
the Illuminati, the First World War was fought to destroy Czarism
in Russia (the Illuminati had held a grudge against the Czarist
regime since Russia had thwarted its plans for a one world
government after the Napoleonic Wars) and to establish Russia as a
stronghold of Communism. Likewise, the Illuminati claim that the
Second World War pitted the Fascists against the “political
Zionists” so as to build up International Communism until it
equaled in strength that of the United Christendom. According to
Illuminati plans, the Third World War, which is to be fought
between the political Zionists and the leaders of the Moslem world,
will drain the international community to the extent that they will
have no choice but to form a one world government.&lt;br/&gt;
There are people that believe that symbols of the &quot;enlightened
ones&quot; are hidden in plain sight in both the architecture and
currency of these United States. Some say that the year found below
the all-seeing eye on the back of a one dollar bill does not
commemorate the founding of our country but marks the completion of
the Illuminati's plans to form a one world government. Subtract
DLXIV from this number. This will give you a number that stands for
inches. When converted to feet, this number will give you an idea
of what is expected of you upon reaching the posted coordinates. An
&quot;enlightened&quot; cache seeker will be prepared for the darkness!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This Shay #3 locomotive is a standard gauge, two truck, 60-ton
locomotive made by the Lima Locomotive &amp; Machine Company of
Lima, Ohio. It was built on April 30, 1910 and sold to the Standard
Lumber Company in the timber-rich Sierra Nevada foothills in
Tuolumne County, California. That same year, the Standard Lumber
Company pressed this locomotive into service on the Sugar Pine
Railway, the steam-logging railroad division of the company. The
new engine hauled many flatcars filled with timber to the mill in
Standard where they were turned into lumber and sold all over the
state.&lt;br/&gt;
In 1925, #3 had a mishap and collided with another engine,
destroying the original wooden cab. The local workmen at Standard
Lumber Company fabricated the steel cab that can be seen today. It
put in many more years of service before being retired.&lt;br/&gt;
Around 1976 &quot;Ol' Number 3&quot;, as she was called, was relocated to its
current location, the entrance to the Mother Lode Fairgrounds near
downtown Sonora&lt;br/&gt;
During a monsoon-like storm in 1996 this locomotive was almost lost
to posterity. May 15, 1996 brought 3.4 inches of rain in 24 hours,
half of that amount coming down in ONE hour (7 AM to 8 AM) A rain
guage on Big Hill collected 7.6 inches from Wednesday morning to
Thursday afternoon! The Save Mart supermarket had six inches of
standing water in it until the front doors were opened and then a
stream of once good merchandise was strewn into the parking lot and
beyond, up to a half-mile away!&lt;br/&gt;
Near the fairgrounds, the creek bulged against a bridge and ripped
out 200 feet of a slate wall protecting the creek's bank. All that
seemed to be holding the bank together was this 60 ton steam train!
Only now it was sitting on tracks that were hanging 3 ft. above the
missing bank below. Three tow trucks from Vic's Chevron were
dispatched to try and save the locomotive from sliding in to the
creek.&lt;br/&gt;
They attached six steel cables to the locomotive to stabilize it.
Working all day long, dump trucks hauled in over 300 yards of dirt
and rock to be carefully pushed under and around the giant machine
with backhoes. A 125-ton, $600 an hour crane was brought in from
Modesto to hoist Old Shay #3, one end at a time, onto new makeshift
tracks.&lt;br/&gt;
The Modesto Bee reported local city administrator Greg Applegate as
saying, &quot; I don't know what it's going to cost, but it's worth it.
We're saving a piece of history&quot;. Thankfully, this piece of history
is still a local landmark and even gets some attention during the
holidays as it is decorated with Christmas lights. Sonora can be
proud to have such a fine piece of machinery welcome all who visit
this quaint little city in the heart of the gold country!</groundspeak:long_description>

While relatively tame in the summer, in the winter Crystal Falls
becomes a roaring torrent of water that can be heard from a great
distance. This inspired me to place a cache at the &quot;heart&quot; of this
thundering waterfall. Thor challenges you to brave the thunder and
see who comes out triumphant.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a unique challenge. There is
poison oak in the area but it can be avoided. Children not
recommended. Seek only during daylight. Rated 4.5 stars for the
rock scrambling that is involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydraulic mining was a variation on
ground sluicing where the water delivered to the site would be shot
through a nozzle at high pressure onto the face of the cliff,
thereby washing away tons of boulders, gravel, dirt, and ounces of
gold.&lt;br/&gt;
The first use of this method is credited to Edward Mattison in 1853
who supplied the water through a rawhide hose to a nozzle he carved
out of wood. Later miners upgraded their hoses to metal or the more
desirable canvas, and the nozzle soon became iron. Technological
advances made the hose and nozzle connections more flexible and
allowed greater movement. Lavish attention was paid to the design
and specifications of the nozzle and companies began producing
their competing appliances. The product names were various —
Hoskin’s Dictator and Hoskin’s Little Giant are examples. But the
name that stuck was the product name of the Craig Company — the
Monitor.&lt;br/&gt;
The Monitors were powerful to say the least. When the water reached
the Monitor it was compressed into a nozzle that was anywhere from
one inch to eight inches in diameter. The stream of water that
could wash down whole hillsides was impressive to behold. In his
multi-volume 1874 - 1890 classic History of California, the
historian Hubert Howe Bancroft stated that an eight-inch Monitor
could throw 185,000 cubic feet of water in an hour with a velocity
of 150 feet per second. Other accounts of the force are less
technical but just as startling. One description points out that a
strong man could not swing a crowbar through a six-inch Monitor
stream, yet another commented on the striking phenomenon of a
fifty-pound boulder riding the crest of a jet with the power of a
cannonball. Documented evidence recalls that men were killed by the
force of the water from 200 feet away.&lt;br/&gt;
 The Monitors operated twenty-fours a day with the mines
illuminated by high-intensity lighting or locomotive headlights.
The amount of water needed was enormous. At the North Bloomfield
mine, sixty million gallons of water was used daily. Thomas Bell,
the president of the company, estimated in 1876 that the hydraulic
mine would consume 16 billion gallons of water in that year
alone.&lt;br/&gt;
The debris created was equally enormous. North Bloomfield, a mine
about 1 1/8 mile long and 350 - 550 feet deep excavated 41 million
cubic yards of material between 1866 and 1884. In 1891, a group of
government engineers estimated that hydraulic mining had deposited
210,746,100 cubic yards of debris along the basins of three rivers
alone -- the Yuba, American, and Bear.&lt;br/&gt;
 The environmental results were catastrophic. A typical description
was penned in 1868 by Samuel Bowles, a visitor to the California
gold country:&lt;br/&gt;
 Tornado, flood, earthquake and volcano combined could hardly make
greater havoc, spread wider ruin and wreck, than are to be seen
everywhere in the track of the larger gold-washing operations. None
of the interior streams of California, though naturally pure as
crystal, escape the change to a thick yellow mud from this cause,
early in their progress from the hills. The Sacramento River is
worse than the Missouri. Many of the streams are turned out of
their original channels, either directly for mining purposes, or in
consequence of the great masses of soil and gravel that come down
from the gold-washing above. Thousands of acres of fine land along
their banks are ruined forever by the deposits of this character. A
farmer may have his whole estate turned into a barren waste by a
flood of sand and gravel from some hydraulic mining up stream;
more, if a fine orchard or garden stands in the way of the working
of a rich gulch or bank, orchard or garden must go. Then the
tornout, dug- out, washed to pieces and then washed over side-
hills, masses that have been or are being subjected to the
hydraulics of the miners, are the very devil's chaos indeed. The
country is full of them among the mining districts of the Sierra
Nevada, and they are truly a terrible blot upon the face of
Nature.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; What is a zorbonaut, you say? A zorbonaut is a person who engages
in the extreme sport of globe riding.&lt;br/&gt;
What is globe riding? Globe riding is the act of rolling down a
hill in a large transparent inflatable rubber globe.&lt;br/&gt;
What does globe riding have to do with the old Columbia School
House? Well, not far from the schoolhouse, on a well defined nature
trail, one can visit a grassy meadow and practice rolling down hill
sans globe. No equipment required.&lt;br/&gt;
All one needs to do is lay prone on the ground at a perpendicular
to the incline and use your upper elbow to start you rolling down
hill. Once you start to roll, keep your forearms folded close to
your chest with your hands near your neck to keep your chin from
hitting the ground.&lt;br/&gt;
The object is to roll down the hill faster than your competitor or
you can try to beat your own time by using a stopwatch.&lt;br/&gt;
Above all, have fun and remember to get up slowly as you will be
dizzy. But what a rush!&lt;br/&gt;

Big pat on the back for us! This is the first geocache Team Cachew has placed in the wild! And we managed to come up with (what we think is) a great concept for placement. We found this cache container sitting on the trail, a regular piece of garbage that some disrespectful hiker decided to drop in the woods. We thought &quot;that would make a perfect cache container&quot; and then immediately thought &quot;why don't we turn it into one and properly place it in this spot!&quot;. So we cleaned it up and scrounged up some (pretty decent) items for the initial stash. Fortunately, we had something to serve as a log book, and threw a pen in there. And now we're inspired to recycle more aloof discards into fun treasures for others to find. Thanks for visiting and enjoy the view! </groundspeak:long_description>

I placed this cache here because I thought that it was a neat place for a cache. It's located by the stream, and by the derelict ruins of the old dam.
The theme of this cache is batteries. So often people will get stuck out in the wilderness with their GPS batteries running out. I left a couple of AA's out there, as well as some various other things. Feel free to leave anything, but if you've got an extra set of batteries lying around, please drop them in. Maybe you'll save someone's life!


Don't worry if you don't have batteries, though, anything is welcome!</groundspeak:long_description>

Small children, pets, and persons with weak knees are advised to stay home. Wear gloves and hiking boots, and make the crossing in the morning when it is cool. From the Chevron station in Christmas Valley, Oregon, travel 2 miles east on Christmas Valley Highway to Millican Road. Turn left, keeping to the main paved road for another 7.4 miles, at which point the road will turn east. After another mile, the road will turn north again. Travel one mile north, and at the bend in the road, turn left and travel west along a dirt road which follows a wire fence. At one mile from the pavement you will pass through a gate which you should close behind you. Proceed from this point about one half mile west to the edge of the lava flow and park your vehicle. Proceed on foot through the gate at the end of the fence, and skirt around the lava flow, bearing north and northwest for one mile. This will bring you to a point at the edge of the lava that is nearest to the Twin Fault. At this point, you will enter the lava flow, and travel about .25 mile southwest to one end of the fault, which runs from northwest to southeast.</groundspeak:long_description>

 Tried to locate this close to the highway right-of-way and yet within safe reach.  When I was working summers in northern California, earning money to attend UCSB in Santa Barbara, I worked at Pacific Lumber Company in Scotia.  Those wigwam burners were perhaps 2-3 times the height of this one and were built on concrete piers with tunnels for capturing the ash.  We use to clean the tunnels each summer, during annual maintenance, a task easily qualified for the &quot;Dirty Jobs&quot; program series.</groundspeak:long_description>

quad, 4x4, or hiking. Road is quite rough in some sections, so
ground clearance is required. 2wd truck can make it, but 4x4 is
preferred to prevent wheel spin on some of the steeper
sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a decommissioned fire watch tower that you will pass by
on your route to the cache. If you like waymarking I have also
posted a nearby benchmark on waymarking.com. 
(WM6TPN)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is located less than 200 meters from the firewatch tower.
Cache site overlooks an un-named lake below. The views all around
are amazing. I think it will be findable in the winter as the
location should be visible even in the snow (unless its over 10
feet deep, then forget it). A photo hint is in the gallery. Enjoy
this beautiful area, and post pictures if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is a regular sized ammo can, and is placed as a thank you
to the Tulameen Turtles for all the great caches they have placed
in the area. FTF gets a wad of Canadian Tire money.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS VERY CAREFULLY.  STAGE 2 IS THE ONLY PART OF THIS MULTI ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.  MAKE SURE THE LOCK IS LOCKED CORRECTLY.  REHIDE FINAL STAGE WITH LOTS OF COVERAGE, YOU WILL KNOW WHAT I MEAN WHEN YOU ARRIVE THERE.  THANKS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, in order to find stage one coordinates, you will have to figure out the code below (see hint).  This code uses a key word in order to decipher it. The key word you need is the size of the container at the first stage. You have five choices of sizes to work with: large, regular, small, MiCRo, nano. The container holds the coordinates for stage two.  The gps was fluctuating wildly, so find the fraternal order. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;aOehU FVTgY SceTl hjO SchR gVeER caE jSfT bbR TjSaTl hjEahl OaS gHeSR SVl SIiS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have the decoded the aBove coordinates, you will be looking for an obvious, but clever hide. (the previous sentence is a clue to the word combination for the final stage, remember what a synonym is, that is important). Word combination you say? . . . read on . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At stage two I have the owner’s permission for the hide and you will be midway there. To SolVE stage two you will need to print the picture I have included for you and bring it with you to decode the coordinates to the final stage.  Think &quot;green&quot; and you will find stage two, no foraging necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final stage will be the most difficult. Ok, it will be somewhat more difficult than the previous two. To help you, somewhere on this page is a key word you will need to have figured out in order to unlock a word lock on the ammo can. This is a combination lock that uses a secret word to open it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have hidden that secret word within the text of this page in the form of a carrier cipher code. I have also provided you with the location of this code in order for you to understand the code and how to apply it in OrdER to decode the secret word.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And last but not LEast, in the ammo can is another surprise.  No!  Not another one they say!  Yes, one more.  Some of you have solved this puzzle before, some of you have not.  Inside the ammo can is a lock n lock container, and in the lock n lock container is the final puzzle you must solve in order to get to the log and sign it. Please be very careful with this item. You do not have to force it open. It only takes two moves to open it.  Please re-lock so the ammo can cannot be opened, scramble the word and hide the cache exactly as was found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So just to recap:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. - You need to decode the ciphered text above to get to the first stage.&lt;br/&gt;2. - At the second stage you need to decipher the font and bring along a copy of that alphabet with you in order to find the final stage.&lt;br/&gt;3. - At the final stage, which is VERY WELL HIDDEN FOR MUGGLE SECURITY, you will be faced with a word lock. The word you need to unlock the lock is hidden in the form of a code somewhere in the text of this page and I have provided you with the key to using this code.&lt;br/&gt;4. - Finally when you get the lock open you will have one last puzzle to solve in order to log your find. It can be done easily and in two moves, no need to force anything. It has been successfully done. Please do not force it.&lt;br/&gt;5. - When replacing the lock make sure you place it on correctly so the ammo can cannot be opened and then scramble the word for the next cacher.&lt;br/&gt;6. - Lastly, this is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, make sure the ammo can is concealed in the same manner you found it.  Another potentially high muggle area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, this is a challenge that is going to take time and sleuthing, therefore that is the reason for a level five difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a first to find gift, there will be a rare Gold Country FTF non-trackable Nugget Coin.  I have left a note with the log as to how you can contact me to collect your coin.  If you are really puzzled and are losing your hair just email me.  And remember, everything you need to complete this puzzle cache is right here in front of you. The hint section is very, very important!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and Have Fun</groundspeak:long_description>

As much as I hate puzzle and micro caches, this one was gratifying in the end. I find they are very time consuming and most often frustrating, but when you do manage to figure them out, they are rewarding. Thanks. TFTC. TNLN. SL.</groundspeak:text>
