This cache has been placed with the permission of DERM, Rockhampton.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Charles Archer explored the Fitzroy and Dawson River areas looking for suitable grazing lands in 1853-4. He tendered for the Farris Run in Gracemere and travelled overland with livestock to arrive in 1855. His brother Colin was to bring much needed supplies by sea and the two met when the ketch &quot;Ellida&quot; sailed up the coast from Maryborough and along the Fitzroy River. This became the site of Rockhampton. Sleipner, Archer`s horse, was named after Odin`s fabled eight legged horse in Scandinavian mythology.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Approximately 9 km north-east of Rockhampton's city center and standing 604 meters above sea level, you cant miss it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Featuring spectacular views of the Rockhampton region you will view deeply incised valleys, dry rainforests, fleeting glimpses of forest inhabitants and feasting cockatoos which feature strongly in a visit to Mount Archer National Park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mount Archer National Park protects bushland remnants in the Berserker Ranges, a scenic backdrop to Rockhampton. The park covers 4250 hectares of open forest and woodland communities dominated by eucalypts, with a large pocket of dry rainforest in the deeply incised Moores Creek valley. The dry rainforest communities are areas of high conservation value and include several plant species with restricted distributions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The full Zamia Walk is a 12.3km long descent from the top of Mount Archer, through the national park to the park's lower entrance. It is best to walk this track from top to bottom and arrange to be picked up at the lower exit at Sunset Drive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy your visit to Mount Archer by remembering to bring afirst-aid kit, insect repellent, sun protection and plenty of water.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for small container tethered to a fallen tree so you wont be able to move it far. It should be fairly concealed to muggles due to the distance from the main trail. When you get to the river crossing about 60meters upstream you can walk down the riverbank to the cache. To continue onward after the cache,you will need to go back to where you left the trail or you won't find it again.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
From the Sleipner lookout you can see Mt. Risien, Mt. Badger and Mt. Sleipner. It is a 1.2km walk to the lookout on uneven terrain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a camo plastic jar with an &quot;official geocache&quot; sticker on it. It is tethered to a log so you wont be able to move it far. Recent DERM policy regarding geocaching in National Parks has required that all caches contain only a logbook and pen. Please do not leave any swaps of trackables. Make sure you conceal it well once you're done, as it may otherwise be visible to passing muggles.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;You won't find anything standing on the grass&lt;/b&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When I was just a little tacker I used to love going places that my mum and dad didn't want me to. A special favourite of mine was the tree out the front of my house. I could climb all the way to the top and I could see for miles, but my mum was always scared I would fall.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is named for a particular quality that the tree has. Tap at its roots and they make a nice drumming sound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If the water in the creek is high you might not be able to get to it without getting your feet wet. Also, a lot of kids walk home after school through this park, so pick your timing and use stealth if required. When you do find it, be prepared to sign the logbook without moving the cache too far as it is tethered in location. Please don't untie it. There is a pencil provided for logging your find in the original stash, along with some things that were common when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Take bug spray and use caution when climbing trees.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Rocky Creek Glacial Area is a beautiful area not far off the main road. It has a really nice area that you can swim in that is clear flowing water. There is camping allowed, including caravans.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cache;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Its a small systemic plastic container, not painted, with some swaps and log book inside.  You might have to do a bit of climbing around the rocks in the area but its worth it just to see how beautiful the area is. Its not overly hard to find or get there but be carefull climbing around because some areas are slippery so wear good shoes. The GPS gets a little bit wavey in the area due to the high (and large amount) of rocks nearby.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description; (from Narrabri tourism web site);&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rocky Creek Glacial Area is yet another geological wonder to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you jump in your car and head out there be warned, there is no ice to be seen! Nor will you find any of the typical glacial landform features, such as steep sided, flat bottomed, U shaped valleys. These landform features are the result of glaciers which existed during the last one million years, in Pleistocene Epoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rocky Creek glaciation is very much older, dating back some 290 million years to the Carboniferous Period. A vast amount of weathering and erosion occurs in over 200 million years, so all the original glacial landscape features have been eroded away and replaced by those typically associated with running water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How then do we know a glacier did exist in this area? The answer lies in the creek bed. It is best to pick a spot down close to the water where flood borne gravels have ground the rock down and left a nice ‘polished’ surface to look at. You will see it is made up of many different sizes and types of stones, all cemented together in a matrix of finer gravels, sand and clay. It is a conglomerate; or to be more exact it is a fluvio-glacial conglomerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did it form? As a glacier flows it gathers and carries with it broken rock material. Eventually all this transported material is deposited it at its terminus, that is, the point at which higher temperatures cause the glacier to melt. Of course this is the simplified version!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish to continue this geology lesson pick up a more detailed information leaflet at the Visitor Information Centre in Narrabri or Bingara. And if geology’s not your thing the glacial area is also a lovely picnic spot and a great place to go for a swim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camping is permitted in this area although there are no facilities. Please take all rubbish with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Getting there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head north out of town along the Newell Highway towards Moree.&lt;/p&gt;
Just 3km out of town, turn right onto the picturesque Killarney Gap Road (Bingara Road) for a further 67km until you reach the Glacial Area on your left.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Sawn Rocks is within the Mount Kaputar National Park near Narrabri, NSW. This is a beautiful natural area with a short 700m walk along a paved path with some steps. There is plenty of parking with BBQ's and toilets..

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cache is a clear plastic systemic container. You DO NOT have to lift any rocks or distrub any plants or wildlife etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some conditions of placing the cache here include;&lt;br /&gt;
*domestic pets and animals are not permitted;&lt;br /&gt;
*no camping at Sawn Rocks&lt;br /&gt;
*No collection of plants, animals or rocks;&lt;br /&gt;
*all reasonable directions given by any authorised officer of the Service will be complied with; and&lt;br /&gt;
*compliance with all temporary closure notices.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because of this, please respect the area and return the cache exactly as found so that it can remain. Due to the rocks around it can throw the GPS  readings around a bit. There is no need to climb/walk into bush areas. Most importantly DO NOT CLIMB THE ORGAN-PIPING OR THE CLIFF ABOVE THE FORMATION.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sawn Rocks walking track&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wheelchair access: medium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistance may be required to access this area&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The track to the lookout is sealed and slightly undulating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One designated disabled carspot is available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The magnificent Sawn Rocks are one of Australia’s best examples of a rock formation called ‘organ-piping’ – because they look like a wall of giant organ pipes. They are a fascinating reminder of Mount Kaputar’s volcanic past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a short and easy 20 minute walk through rainforest to the lookout at the foot of Sawn Rocks. To get the perfect photograph, it’s worth timing your visit to reach the rocks after midday when the sun is shining directly on the striking cliff face. Treat yourself to a well deserved picnic or barbecue at the lovely Sawn Rocks picnic area on your return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plant communities:&lt;/strong&gt; dry eucalypt forests, wet eucalypt forests&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A nice spot for a picnic, play equipment for the kiddies, hopefully an easy find. An ammo box filled with trinkets from our Antiques Store.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A place I think people may not know is here and may like to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a kid after swimming at the Olympic pool we would go over to the park and wait for our parents to pick us up. It took a lot of guts to be able to jump across into Australia, (a big gap if you only had little legs). It took a long time before I got the guts to do it, and once I made it across I remember crying for quite some time before finding a way back across.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes this place is very quiet, especially in the Winter, but at other times it can be over crowded with muggles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little Australia was designed and built by Mr. Arthur Higgenson who later died on the Burma Railway during World War 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The history of the Lawson Swimming Pool (across the road) began with the building of the Railway to the area in 1867, as it was necessary to supply water to the locomotives traveling in both directions. An earth-wall dam was constructed in the gully north-west of the Railway Station. The water supplying this dam was from springs on the surrounding hillsides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On February 16th, 1880, the area where the dam was situated was notified as a Reserve for Water Supply and Railway purposes, but this was changed and proclaimed for Railway Purposes only on June 10th, 1891. During the 1877-1884 drought, the dam ran dry, and during this time, actually in 1881, the dam was enlarged and the wall raised 7 feet and a timber spillway provided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more info on the very interesting history of the pool please go to the site below. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.midmountainshistory.org/lawson_swimming.html</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Stanwell Park! Railway Crescent
is the first location you encounter when arriving by train of the
South Coast Line, from Sydney or Wollongong.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The railway is important part of history in Stanwell Park, as it
facilitates the transport of coal from the mines in the vicinity
and along the coast. There are many remnant buildings and street
names from the former train path, which are obsolete or otherwise
used today. Some of them host great geocaches, like Dark Side of
the Moon and (GCCA6) and The Blue Hole (GC2HWNP).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Railway Crescent and subsequent roads wriggle down the slopes to
the beach, like a serpent through the mountains (The Arkaroo),
ideal for group of youngsters arriving by train, skateboard under
their feet and surfboard under their arm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not just roads and streets, but also the railway line meanders
along the escarpment curling in a large crescent over the
impressive viaduct in its apex. A walk along the Wodi Wodi track
starting at Railway Crescent leads you into the bush of the
escarpment with great views over the area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last not least, this is the point, where The
Arkaroo arrived first in Little Bulli and fell in love with this
magic place.</groundspeak:long_description>

know their path along the coast. Nevertheless, just before reaching
the spot, a bit of experienced climb with hands on the rock is
necessary.

by placing a few rocks accordingly. Make sure, it's well hidden
from muggle.
&lt;p&gt;Located on the southern fringe of the Royal National Park, the
beach of Stanwell Park and surrounding area are set in an
amphitheatre-shaped valley, framed by 100 m high sandstone cliffs.
Views to the north drop steeply from Bald Hill into a headline made
up by two or three distinct pinnacles, resisting the harsh surf and
weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the interface between land and water coincides with the
interface of sandstone and the underlying Narrabean shale, a
sediment rich in fossils. Younger volcanism has broken through
these ancient layers and form different features along the
coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different hardness and resistance of the various rocks lead to
different erosion, forming the outstanding pinnacles, of which the
eastern most is basaltic while the western is remaining sandstone
on the shale floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Stanwell Park beach, the pinnacles are the most northern
point you can access by walking or jumping from rock to rock near
the shoreline. Access beyond, into Bulgo area of the Royal National
Park is given only by mounting into the escarpment or by the sea -
as a 30 m high, vertical rock wall plunges directly deep into the
water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you reached Ground Zero, it's worth to climb the eastern
pinnacle and have the round view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please Note:&lt;/b&gt; The cache is located
in a so-called &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cache Catching Cage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; which prevents it
from being washed and blown away upon heavy weather. Once you
spotted it, please &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;open it from the uphill side&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; only
by removing that one rock and undoing that little mesh. Make sure
all is secure in place after your transactions. If you are
susceptible to scratches you may want to &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;use gloves&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
for this. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Stanwell Park beach is in exceptional natural
shape, set back in a valley of the Illawarra Escarpment, just south
adjacent to the Royal National Park. It has a total length of 900 m
between the cliff shores, where Bald Hill and Mt Mitchell fall into
the ocean, north and south, respectively.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The sands of the beach may shift considerably from Far North To Far
South, depending on the currents in the ocean. At times, the beach
stretches or retreats by 100 m at one end and adding to the other,
demonstrating the forces and power of the waters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As you walk along the beach, you will see various landscapes,
biotopes, communities, sports, views and landscapes, which make up
the area such a jewel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Starting Far North, you could venture further north hopping from
rock to rock until The Pinnacles (GC2J7JJ), such as some fishermen
do. However, let's stay on the sands today for our walk to the Far
South.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The northern most part of the beach is embraced by a 20-30 m high
wall of colorful sandstone, which is worth to admire. There is
valuable bouldering at some spots, If you like an abseil adventure,
seek Muggle More Than Welcome To Watch (GC2J5TB).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Surfers and board riders enjoy the waters here as the break on the
sand bars is opposite to the rip created by the northern
lagoon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At this place, the sands retreat towards the park, along the
Lawrence Hargrave creek. This flat beach are is often used for
landing of the hanggliders coming down from Bald Hill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tourists and locals meet in the grassland of the park, where picnic
tables are located. Sometimes Indian communities gather here to
enjoy the day after celebrations at the Hindu temple in Helensburgh
nearby.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dunes surround the beach heading further south, at which the
Helensburgh Stanwell Park Surf Life Saving Club is located and,
together with the Wollongong life savers assure a safe swim. Say
hello to the patrol members; a few of them are involved in
geocaching and other outdoor activities!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another broad sand field separates the ocean from the southern
lagoon of Stanwell Creek - seek The Blue Hole (GC2HWNP) further
upstream.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At this place, Nippers meet for training and pointscore every
Sunday morning during the warm seasons. Kids compete in beach
events, such as sprint and flags, while they are approached to the
water by wading for the youngsters, swimming, board race for the
teens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the evening, fishermen occupy the shore line, while surfers are
in the water all day round.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The break is particularly powerful due to the steep slope of the
ground. A short swim out - or on a board or a boat opens splendid
views around the southern cliffs towards Coalcliff and the Seacliff
Bridge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The multi cache has two stations. Fist you
need to seek to the Far North end of the usual sand area, where you
find five dates at the Way Point. At times, they are easy to see,
but it may happen occasionally, that they are covered by
sands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ground Zero Far South is obtained by considering the
coordinates&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
S  34° 14' 19.65&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
E 150° 59' 33.59&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
and subtracting the youngest and the oldest year numbers from the
arc seconds of the latitude and longitude, respectively. Use the 4
digit numbers while disregarding the decimal dot (i.e. divide the
year numbers by 100 when accounting for the decimal dot).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a double check, Far South lies in a radius of approximately 900
m from Far North, with a bearing of roughly 225°.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cache is a boring micro, placed at the published
coordinates. Terrain rating is higher than 1 because you have to
get off the track, bent down, and may get your Sunday suit dirty or
catch a spider web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;However:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The world is full of boring micros, so cache hunters are just going
for numbers, not for quality! Even logs at innovative and demanding
caches may read:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;TFTC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
No full stop '.', no exclamation mark '!', no 'M'. And even if so,
that's not enough! We cache hiders want to know your stories, the
weather conditions, the cache approach, your mood! Are the kids in
the car winching because dad's stopping all 161m for a boring
micro? How did you adjust your travel plans to get here and what
did it cost? What do you have in mind when caching under a narrow
foot bridge? Where are your caching limits, what defines them -
time, length, dirtiness, physical effort, intelligence (we'll find
out here!)? Have you experienced other adventures to get out here,
like hang gliding, abseiling, surfing, beach walking or seeking for
The Arkaroo's caches?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additional Logging Requirements&lt;/b&gt; (optional)&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When you log this cache, we desire you author an individual,
unpublished story of at least 250 words!&lt;br /&gt;
You can write any story, from your childhood, from your first
locomotive ride, philosophizing about Goethe's Faust, your secret
dreams, the precipitation of matter after the big bang, or what
most Aussie logs contain: the spider webs around the cache.
However, the log has to be genuine. If it is found anywhere else,
it will be deleted! So remember: No Plagiarism! This requirement
also excludes a copy of the contents of another story! I.e. if a
cacher logs the 250 random numbers he had in mind, a second cacher
must not do so any more. So hurry up to find and log it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Name of The Cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Read it: &lt;b&gt;! TFTC&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt;M!&lt;/b&gt;, where&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* '!' is the logical NOT operator,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* 'TFTC' is defined as usual in the community,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* 'M' stands for 'Mate' and should never be omitted in Oz,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* '!' is a mark to express exclamation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

needed! If this is your first abseil, then don't do it! Just enjoy
the view! Don't approach GZ without a rope and approved climbing
gear. Stay in front of the guardrail if you are not in full abseil
condition. There is a risk of free fall of 20 m height! The cache
is for the experienced adventurer only and on his own, full risk!
You are warned; it is your responsibility!
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This place may be very busy, and in a normal
cache, you would be bothered by watching muggle, to whom you do not
want to disclose it. Here, let them watch: they won't reach it
anyway!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stanwell Park is a pretty touristic place, just south of the Royal
National Park, in a valley between Mount Mitchel in the south and
Bald Hill in the north. It offers high variety of sporting and
leisure activities, such as swimming, surfing, beach activities,
hang gliding, rock climbing bush walking, fishing, sightseeing. The
picnic area, the beach, the park. These activities attract heaps of
muggles on a nice day. No worries, there is space for
everybody!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ground Zero is located in that beautiful sandstone wall, where the
stone is intersected by the rusty iron precipitates giving to it
the different shades of ocher color. Probably, it's worth to
approach it first from the bottom and spot it! However, the stone
is too brittle to climb up, and it's a 15 m high overhanging. So
walk around and up the street and abseil.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The aim is the adventure; we want you to find it! From the bottom,
you see a deep black hole few meters under the top. It's not there
- although it's a perfect hole for a cache, however, you wouldn't
be able to recover it again! Abseil 1-2 m South of it. Fix the rope
at the obvious structure and go!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you drop it - go around and bring it up
again - it even happened to me when I placed it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We used a 11 mm rock climbing rope of 60 m
length (which is plenty), an abseil eight and an abseil shunt. Take
your helmet because pebbles fall, long pants and solid shoes to
protect from the thorns at the top! One person should secure the
place at the beach and keep muggles in a safe distance.</groundspeak:long_description>

of fall from height or you may get wet feet. I suggest the latter
one. It may be extremely slippery after rain. Use your common sense
of mountaineering and do not hold on loose rocks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Approach:&lt;/b&gt; Haven't tried the direct way - and nobody
does!&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Stanwell Park is a village between Sydney and Wollongong, still
exposing much nature and history. Besides the beach, there is bush,
raising up the Illawarra escarpment. Two creeks come down the
slopes, Hargraves Creek and Stanwell Creek, feeding the Northern
and the Southern Lagoon, respectively. Lawrence Hargraves Drive is
the main road longing the coast, which follows here the ancient
rail path, therefore pretty even and on large foundation,
particularly, when crossing the Stanwell Creek. The waters of the
creek form a hole, called “The Blue Hole”, situated 90
m downstream Ground Zero, which is a pleasant venue for kids, off
the tourist way, jumping into the deep pool on hot days.&lt;br /&gt;

different vegetation areas from the light coastal forests into tall
eucalypts, red gums, palm trees. As you cross the cliffs you'll
enter the plateau with gymea lilies, grass trees and a variety of
gum trees, bottle brush and other banksias. A jewel of natural
bush. I recommend to take the crest down, a little known path
leading down from near the ancient &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GCDFF&quot;&gt;Train Spotting (GCDFF)&lt;/a&gt; cache. This
way, you head down facing Stanwell Park beach with competitive
views.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">What can be better at Christmas Eve on a nice summer day, sitting at altitude in a Divine Armchair and overlooking from the sky the escarpment, the flora, the lizards, the railway, the coke ovens, the village, the ocean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; At this point, the plateau of Mount Mitchell in the Illawarra Escarpment drops abruptly vertical by ~ 30 m of height into the subtropical rainforest above Coalcliff. This basin carved into the sandstone and open to the ocean front is the second part of Little Bulli - the other is Stanwell Park. You want to sit down and rest to enjoy the views over the little ocean village with its beach front and headlands with the rock pool. In the foreground of the valley, the railway line serpents into the tunnel. More interestingly, you see the Illawarra Coke Company to your feet – from a bird's view – and study the coke ovens and the infrastructure in detail. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you dare to look down - I do it only lying on my belly – you will feel the air of the spot. Like from God's Window, you look on to of the forest in which some palm trees stitch out of the eucalyptus green. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACCESS: We followed the cliffs from the water tank. You either walk up Mt Mitchell and follow the coastal track from Stanwell Park or the other side, which leads to the tank. Alternatively an old service track gives access from the north west and you can venture from where the Princes Highway crosses the freeway, which, with permission, could be driven by an all-terrain vehicle og good clearence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXTRAS: Subsequently, pass the Bush Garden cache and venture to the point (34° 14.563'S; 150° 57.988'E), lie on the belly approaching the edge carefully and look down from the rock. You will be particularly impressed. Let me know, what you saw there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ATTENTION: Extreme Danger: There are high cliffs in the area and you have to be careful where you go. Think before! Probably you want to keep an eye on geokids – don't let them run around when they play. Ground zero is approximately 4 m away from the edge, so you would not need to balance on it. If you feel uncomfortable, just scramble on your knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;EX2KK71 - Car Drop&lt;br /&gt;S 34° 14.563 E 150° 57.987&lt;br /&gt;Very interesting point to look down the cliffs. CITO.&lt;br /&gt;KD2KK71 - Water Tank&lt;br /&gt;S 34° 14.436 E 150° 58.157&lt;br /&gt;Good access point to the cliffs.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Easy to find cache, however along unsecured paths. You need to be
experienced in bush walking or hopping along rocks at the
shoreline. The steep slope may be slippery and exposed.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Some people drive their BMW here, but it is advised to leave the
car near the Clifton School of Arts and walk down the hill. There
is a sign telling about the unsecured path which you will take on
your own risk. Arriving at the bottom, enjoy the cliff galleries to
the north, before heading south to ground zero.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A modern car is made out of a multitude of materials produced after
state-of-the-art research. Here you can admire the corrosion and
wear resistance of different metals and polymers. Some of the high
strength steels, as found in the crank shaft and gear boxes, won't
withstand corrosion so well. The exhaust pipe, however, is usually
exposed to very high temperatures and also dry and wet
environmental conditions, withstanding very well the salty water of
a winter road in Germany. Other structural parts are made out of
light metal alloys, which just corrode away, while the wheels have
to be mechanically reliable, wear and corrosion resistant, probably
the best conserved metal on the car. Brake hoses need to be
flexible and resist fatigue and highest temperatures, why they
still look brand new as most of the other parts are gone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Amazing, me coming from Bavaria, finding such a device at the other
end of the world (20-30m north of GZ).&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;KD35HAY - Trailhead&lt;br /&gt;S 34° 15.585 E 150° 58.211</groundspeak:long_description>

because you sought a &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35HAY&quot;&gt;Sheer

&lt;br /&gt;
However, it would be time for a coffee, ice cream or other
amenities, you enjoy with the breeze of the ocean, the views and
the sunshine. There is a little, blue rimmed kiosk, but make sure
you call for the opening hours or for the availabilities.
Otherwise, there are plenty of pubs and cafes only a few hundred
meters from here.&lt;br /&gt;

slippery and exposed. Take all of your care as an experienced
adventurer. Ask the locals for access.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Refreshed at the Beach Kiosk, it's only a short promenade to the
present location, where you can place the sunbeds. Enjoy the bathe
in the ocean or catch a wave, but be careful not to hit the
solids.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Access to here may be from the park opposite the School Of Arts in
Clifton. Surely, the kids have fun coming down in their lunch
break. Beware the path is steep, airy and slithery when wet. Bring
your bottle of water and slip-slop-slap.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The remnants of Clifton Pool prove of better times when swim
championships were held at this location. Come on a sunday and
support your champions in the disciplines. What's your time to swim
50m - give it a try! Not sure the location was closed because of
the vicinity of Wollongong's oldest pub!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Access from Clifton is parking near the School Of Arts, descend at
the other end of the park following a little fisherman's path. From
there, you may enjoy a series of other caches along the way.</groundspeak:long_description>

is at the midpoint between Clifton descent and Wombarra beach, a
quick and easy find once you are out here. You need to hop along
the rocks of the shoreline. If coming from Clifton, be aware of the
risk the exposed and slippery path encounters.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Say in 2061, there is needs for the last coal to mine, imagine the
huge open pit excavators from Thyssen Krupp removing 300m of the
earth surface and digging into the Illawarra escarpment. Meanwhile,
enjoy the place, but don't try to climb the cliffs as the coal is
most brittle and will fall straight upon you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Access from either side, depending on your strength and fitness. At
Clifton, park near the School of Arts and start your way down
across the road to the left of the little park. A sign warns you of
the unsecured path.</groundspeak:long_description>

skills. This is a rock climbing wall for experienced
climbers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
DON'T attempt the cache without all the rock climbing gear. An
abseil from the top may do, but DON'T approach the drop if not
fully secured.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Best approach is by rock climbing on one of the regular routes from
the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stealth required, but once you're up, there is space to unpack the
cache and do your business out of the sights from the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rockclimbing at Nowra is one of the most famous sport climbing
spots along the south coast. Climbers gather here from both Sydney
and Canberra. The Descent Gully Wall you find here contains some of
the mostly climbed routes. Solid rock, caves, cracks - of any
difficulty and exposure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Back in 2003, the Arkaroo climbed here his first climb ever in
Australia, brought here and belayed by a new friend and colleague,
the legend Mike Law, who convinced me that it is a good place to
live here. That day, we also climbed the Turtle Wall roof, to the
right when you look up, with its exposure and abseil into empty
space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To place the cache, Suparki12 lead the climb - his first lead ever
- while The Arkaroo went up subsequently. That day, also Rocksandra
made it up as second for her very first time&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
