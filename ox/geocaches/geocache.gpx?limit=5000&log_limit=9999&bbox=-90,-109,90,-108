            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Mesa Verde, Spanish for &quot;green table,&quot; offers a spectacular look into the lives of the Ancestral Pueblo people who made it their home for over 700 years, from A.D. 600 to A.D. 1300. Today, the park protects over 4,000 known archeological sites, including 600 cliff dwellings. These sites are some of the most notable and best preserved in the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On June 29, 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt established Mesa Verde National Park to &quot;preserve the works of man,&quot; the first national park of its kind. Today, the continued preservation of both cultural and natural resources is the focus of the park's research and resource management staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Description --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Virtual enables the visitor to tour three of the most notable dwellings at Mesa Verde National Park: Cliff Palace, Balcony House, and Spruce Tree House. The tour begins at the Chapin Mesa Museum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: Cliff Palace and Balcony House can only be visited by taking a ranger-guided tour. Tickets must be purchased in advance and in person at the Far View Visitor Center ($3.00 per person). Tours are strenuous, require climbing ladders, and ducking through tight spaces. Due to high demand for tours during the busy summer season, you may be asked to choose only one tour per day between Cliff Palace and Balcony House. Please use the following link to see a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/meve/planyourvisit/hours.htm&quot;&gt;schedule of tours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking the dwelling tours is not necessary in order to find the information required to log this Virtual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your first stop on the tour will be at Spruce Tree House.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spruce Tree House&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Best-Preserved Cliff Dwelling&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cliff dwelling is open year-round, however during the winter months, it is available by free, ranger-guided tour only. This one-hour tour involves a 100ft (30m) descent and ascent on a winding path. Walking distance is 1/2-mile (1km) round trip. &lt;br/&gt;â€¢During the spring, summer, and fall (early March to early November), Spruce Tree House is available on a self-guided basis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the Cliff Palace road, your next stop will be Cliff Palace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cliff Palace&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mesa Verdeâ€™s Largest Cliff Dwelling&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-hour, ranger-guided tour involves climbing five, 8-10ft (2.6-3m) ladders, on a 100ft (30m) vertical climb. Total walking distance is about 1/4-mile (400m), round-trip. The tour begins at Cliff Palace Overlook, an 8-mile (13km), 20-minute drive from the Visitor Center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final stop on this tour is Balcony House, located along Cliff Palace road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Balcony House&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adventurous Cliff Dwelling Tour&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-hour, ranger-guided tour involves climbing a 32 ft. ladder, crawling through a 12ft.-long tunnel, and climbing up a 60ft (20m) open rock face with two 10ft (3m) ladders to exit the site. The tour begins at the Balcony House parking area, a 10-mile (16km), 25-minute drive from the Visitor Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you're here, don't forget to take a tour along the Mesa Top road where you'll be able to see several pit houses as well as the Sun Temple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All overviews are mobility accessible, however, the dwellings are not. Paths are paved, hard-packed dirt and ruins. Please do not leave established trails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Logging Requirements --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to log this Virtual, you'll need to take a tour of Chapin Mesa. There are informational and interpretive signs located at the trailhead to each of these three archaeological sites. Information provided on these signs will provide you with the correct Code Phrase. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ninety percent of Mesa Verdeâ€™s cliff dwellings contain 10 rooms or less. One-third have only one or two rooms. This should help to put the more famous cliff dwellings of Cliff Palace (??? rooms), Spruce Tree House (??? rooms), and Balcony House (?? rooms) into perspective.&lt;br/&gt;Added together, these three dwellings contain how many rooms?     </groundspeak:long_description>

You donâ€™t need a dog to enjoy this area, Denny Lake Park is great for picnicing and bird watching.&lt;br/&gt; Weâ€™re hoping this will be a dog-related cache so weâ€™re leaving a couple of dog TBs and some doggie snacks that weâ€™ll try to keep stocked for the hairy kids.&lt;br/&gt; You can access the cache from either Denny Lake Park or from the dog park (but be sure to put the hairy kids on a leash before leaving the dog park). Thereâ€™s plenty of parking at either the dog park or at Denny Lake Park. There are several entrances into and out of the dog park.&lt;br/&gt; Be careful where the dogs stick their noses and where you stick you hands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 37Â° 21.133 W 108Â° 32.851</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Located below the shade structure just outside of the dog park and just off the the gravel trail that goes around Denny Lake. Under a rock ledge.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache can be found on
the southern tip of a prominent ridge located atop the Book Cliffs
overlooking Palisade, Colorado.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
This cache can be reached via
several different routes. The difficulty is based on an approach
from the Gearhart Mine/Mt. Garfield Summit trails, which, it is
assumed, most cachers will take as it affords them access to the
Mount Garfield Challenge series as well as a number of other
caches. This cache is a good mile east of the Gearhart Geo cache,
so if you are attempting all the caches in the main Mount Garfield
cache cluster keep your water and energy-levels in mind if you are
out on a hot day and decide to head over to get this cache as well.
It is generally very even and easy walking along the top of the
bookcliffs, though, so if you are capable of making the initial
climb up the cliffs, reaching the cache once on top shouldnâ€™t be
too strenuous.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;b&gt;WARNINGS!!!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you do come at this cache from the
west -- depending on your route -- you may come across an area that
has been fenced off with a wooden fence near the edge of the Book
Cliffs. Stay on the north (downhill) side of this fence. The
fencing is in place to block off an area where old mines have been
collapsing beneath the surface. There are some small sink holes in
the fenced area that are visible from the safety of the north side
of the fence, so entering the fenced area can pose a very real
danger. Falling into a sink hole caused by a collapse would not be
a fun thing to have happen. There are signs in place warning you of
this danger, heed the warning and stay outside the fenced off
area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;b&gt;SNAKES!!!!!?????&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep. Rattlesnakes of various sizes
are not uncommon on top of the Book Cliffs. The above picture was
taken just a short distance from the cache moments after it was
placed. As you can see, snakes like to bite things â€“ mostly tasty
lizards. They usually leave humans alone, but will bite if they are
threatened or cornered. Be a careful cacher, and don't blindly
stick your hands into holes or under rocks. Even the smallest of
snakes have teeth that can easily pierce unprotected skin. That
being said, snakes are helpful creatures that help control rodents
and other pests so be nice to them if you see one. Leave them alone
and they'll leave you
alone.&lt;/p&gt;

A nice walk from either parking coordinate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I rated the terrain as a 2.5 because of all the uneven ground and large wood chips. There are multiple mini arroyos so please watch where you walk. There is a chance for some cactus, but only a minor chance. There are a lot of wood chips and shrubs, not very friendly to strollers or wheel chairs, but very family friendly and dog friendly.&lt;br/&gt;My dog loves coming here with me.&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a 2 Cup, Rubbermaid container, clear with screw top lid.

Went out there myself today and found it the lid was missing and everything inside was wet.took a Geo Jeep to send to other location and will leave a new hot wheel later when container is replaced. I found the lid about 50 yards away but it is cracked and does not seal well anymore. thanks for a great time and let me us know when you replace container</groundspeak:text>
