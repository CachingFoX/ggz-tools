            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is only a 2 part Multi-Cache. The 1st stage and the cache are close together so you won’t have to move your car. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The listed coordinates are for the first stage not for the actual cache. The encrypted hint is for the first stage not for the actual cache. The first stage is close to the actual cache. You will need something to write with and something to write on. The coordinates and the hint for the actual cache are at the first stage. Write them down, especially the hint. You have to have the hint to find the actual cache. Once you have the coordinates and hint you are ready to seek out the cache itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The actual cache is log only which is another reason to bring something to write with. The coordinates will get you very close but not right to the cache. At this point, USE THE HINT! You will, most likely, have very bad GPS reception right at the cache. Remember it is log only.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache can only be done for a few hours each day. Afternoons are best. It is available 7 days a week but not on holidays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have permission at the highest levels for the placement of this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good hunting and let me know if you would like additional help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanuk scores FTF!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Here's a quick Multi you can do alone or use it to kick off a long day or two of caching. It is stocked with one of caching's most important items. Double A batteries. This way if you decide to cache on down the trail you can grab a few to keep you going. I will make sure there are always fresh ones in there. Grab what you need. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Ok folks, we're kickin' it old school here. For those of you who were caching in the early days you know what I'm saying. I'm talkin' about the tried and true ammo can in the woods. That's right, just a camoed up 30 cal ammo can. That's what there was back in the day. I had one laying around and decided take a trip down memory lane. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only reason I made this a multi is so you'd know where to park. Of course, being a multi, the posted coords are not for the actual cache. They are for the first stage at which you will obtain the coords for the second and final stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As always, please put everything back like you found it for the next cacher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As mentioned above there are more caches to be had in the area. Use your maps to see what I mean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache itself is in a spot that most folks would want to wear Juneau sneakers. Yep, muskeg but only right at the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kudos to Davidaknz on the FTF!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN2GZ4K - GC2GZ4K Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;The Cache.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Initials only in the log please and BYOP. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I know downtown has lots of caches but I keep getting emails from folks planning cruises wanting to know how many are within walking distance. So I put this one right above the docks. I made it a little tougher than my other downtown caches. Accuracy when I placed it was +-13 feet and the container is small and well hidden. Be careful. If you drop it you will never get it back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck to all you happy hunters.</groundspeak:long_description>

Sharpen your caching skills for this one and bring something to write with. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This cruise friendly cache is a bit tougher than most of my downtown caches. It's location required perfect camo so look hard. This spot is also very busy so you will need to be super stealthy. It is also in one of our urban canyons (lol) so reception on older GPS units or other devices may be marginal. My new unit was able to get +- 15 feet but my old one was +- 30 feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't give up. Keep looking.

The container is&lt;br/&gt;actually a hidden ziplock baggie. I'm not sure if that falls&lt;br/&gt;into the &quot;micro&quot; category or not. I had +-17ft when I placed it due&lt;br/&gt;to the mountain I guess. Sorry it's not more accurate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; You might want to leave the car down the hill somewhere since you&lt;br/&gt;probably will not find parking close to the cache. I have made&lt;br/&gt;finding this one easy since getting to it may have you huffing and&lt;br/&gt;puffing. There is no need to go thrashing around in the trees for&lt;br/&gt;this one. In fact, you will barely have to leave the pavement.&lt;br/&gt;Please respect private property. The&lt;br/&gt;terrain rating of 2 is for the walk up the hill. If you drive up&lt;br/&gt;and find parking it would be a 1. Congrats to&lt;br/&gt;DoubleBugle on FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>GC2M2P8  Walk to the end of Willow. Turn around and walk back towards Maple. As you near the intersection look low along the right hand side of the street. The cache is just a couple of feet off the pavement.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

The Final Stage will require a short walk. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The published coordinates are for the 1st stage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are encrypted hints for each stage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Stage 1: The coordinates for Stage 2 are hidden here. There is no container but the coordinates are NOT visible. After you find them please replace things just as you found them so as not to give it away for the next cacher. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage 2: The coordinates for the final stage are at this location. There is no container and the coordinates are visible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage 3: This is where you'll find the cache. As the cache size and the cache name indicate, the container is a big black 5 gallon bucket. I put a screw on lid on the bucket so you won't need to pry it open. You will not need to remove the bucket from its hiding place. Just unscrew the lid, sign the log, trade swag if you like, and screw the lid back on. The lid has a gasket so it does not need to be tight. If you tighten it too much the next cacher may find it difficult to open. As I did with my last cache, I've placed some other caching essentials in this one. Feel free to take what you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Davidaknz snags another FTF!

The published coordinates are not the location of the cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The cache is not at the coordinates listed but is in that area of town. It is on private property (mine). You do not need to go inside the fence. Since I used a puzzle for the coordinates I made the cache very easy to find. Feel free to park in the driveway if there is room. Otherwise street parking is fine. My neighbors have been clued in so they won't call the police about suspicious cachers. The container is a plastic food storage thing with a locking lid. It is inside another out of place container.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now for the coordinates.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I thought it was about time Juneau had a cache here. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is a nano cache. Those of you familiar with these will understand. For everybody else, you have to bring a pen/pencil as the cache contains only a log. A tweezers can be very handy too as the log can be difficult to remove.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please put the cache back right where you found it. Let me know if the log gets full.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Try to be covert. Sometimes there can be a lot of people around.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks and have fun.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In 1872, Lieutenant General John McAllister Schofield recommended that a naval base be located at Pearl Harbor, Hawai'i.  Near to and in close association with Pearl Harbor, Schofield Barracks is an Army base named after LTG Schofield.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like any Army base, this cache is equipped with Soldiers, identification tags, video surveillance, and a mess hall represented by an Army man (Hooah!), TB dog tags (FTF prize), webcam cache logo pin, and a restaurant coupon.  Due to budget cuts, office supplies are in short supply, so BYOP!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is situated between two pullover areas and features views of Pearl Harbor, Juneau, AK.  It is NOT on the edge nor down the cliff, so don't even try looking there!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to DoubleBugle for the FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Just as in Hawai'i, Schofield Barracks overlooks Pearl Harbor, is vigilant, and on GUARD.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>
