&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Allanton Cemetery was formerly known as Greytown Cemetery, and
before that, Grey Cemetery. Allanton Cemetery is one of the closest
cemeteries to Mosgiel and had a large available area and
improvements had been made to parking and access since East Taieri
Cemetery closed. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allanton,_New_Zealand.html&quot;&gt;More info
from Wikipedia about Allanton&lt;/a&gt;. The cache is a small round black
container.
&lt;p&gt;BYO Writing Instrument!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
No room for travel bugs/coins, so if you're on your way to the
airport I recommend also stopping at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/en/#!geocache/OX37MA7&quot;&gt;
The Trackables Inn&lt;/a&gt;.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Dunedin International Airport is an international airport in the Otago region of the South Island of New Zealand, serving Dunedin city and the Otago and Southland regions. Dunedin International Airport is one of two international airports in Otago, the other being Queenstown International Airport. It is located adjacent to the village of Momona on the Taieri Plains approximately 22 kilometres south west of Dunedin CBD. It has a single paved runway rated for aircraft up to the Boeing 767.It has one terminal building with two airbridges and five gates, and also customs facilities and other amenities. The Dunedin City Council and the Crown each own 50 percent of Dunedin International Airport Limited,a publicly unlisted company which operates the utility. Construction of the airport was completed in 1962, and its primary use was to cater for passengers of short haul aircraft. In about 2005, the check-in space was enlarged and a new international arrival area was added. This airport is the third busiest and largest on the South Island of New Zealand, after Queenstown Airport and Christchurch International Airport.

&lt;p&gt;So....travelling somewhere? Feel free to pick up or drop off some trackables on your way past - they like to keep moving from cache to cache!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It lies close to the southeast shore of the shallow tidal lake which shares its name. The name Waihola is the southern Maori form of the word wai-hora, meaning &quot;spreading waters&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lake Waihola was used in the Central Otago goldrush. Ships used to travel up the Taieri River and across to the southern side of the lake where prospectors would traverse the hills and on to Gabriel's Gully. In the early days of settlement a paddle-steamer, the Betsy Douglas, plied the lake's waters from Owhiro, near Henley in the north to Clarendon at the lake's southern end. Lake Waihola is located at the southern end of the lower Taieri Plains and is the largest of a group of historical lakes that were once distributed between Lake Waihola and Mosgiel. Other neighbouring historical lakes include Lake Tatawai, Loch Ascog, Loch Katrine, Lake Potaka and Silverstream Lagoon...

&lt;br /&gt;
Time to get back to the basics of Geocaching.... Getting out with a GPS, family / friends and visit historical or interesting places.

Richard Pearse, inventor and possibly the first man to make a powered flight.
 
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So... was he the first powered flyer in the world???. Visit the site of his Otago home.Sorry only from a distance!!! Now in private hands. The old house is now been used as a store room.
In 1911 he moved to Milton ( to this house ) and a very secluded area. No houses overlooked his property and the only reported incidents were that of a local farmer who, upon hearing a strange noise, went to look and saw Pearse testing an unusual machine; he didn't stay around to watch. Three people also claim to have seen his aeroplane hanging over yet another gorse hedge. While living here Pearse built a number of farm implements including a topdresser, a potato planter and a plough. Some were successful, others failed very quickly and were abandoned. As with his previous acreage, Pearse was meant to be farming for a living, however what crops there were his neighbours tended and the 300 sheep he owned all but starved to death through lack of food

Clear 200ml container. BYOP. 
Watch out for cars.
