This cache was so wrong at many different levels. TOO SMALL!  We were going crazy. But, once we found it, I laughed my butt off! I am going to go online and buy ten of those containers to drive other people nuts. :-)

You are a SICK individual.

Thanks for the awesome cache!!</groundspeak:text>

Tafoni, concave hollows can be found throughout the park. Skull
Rock is an excellent example of large tafoni, but they come in many
sizes and patterns.

There are a few parking spaces near Skull Rock, but it is a popular
location, so it may be hard to actually find one.
&lt;p&gt;Tafoni are one of those features that still needs a definitive
explanation of their formation. Some are large and spaced apart
like those at Skull Rock. While others appear to be like honeycombs
on the side of granite faces. At Joshua Tree, tafoni are found only
on the granites. The gneisses of the park generally erode much more
easily due to their layered minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theory for the formation of tafoni begins with the thicker
soils that covered the region during the last ice age. Some granite
surfaces were in direct contact with wet acidic soils that weakened
the structure of the rock, much like the soil notches. Some areas may have been slightly more acidic
than others, creating uneven erosion across the buried rock face.
After the soils had been eroded away, these weaker areas eroded
more quickly. Once a slight depression formed, these shaded areas
remained wetter longer than the portion of the rock face that stuck
out. With more water, erosion continued at a faster rate than the
dryer areas enlarging the depressions forming the tafoni.&lt;/p&gt;

Not sure why it's there or what it was used for but we figured it needed a cache since there is not much else to look at out in this part of the desert. An off road vehicle is recommended but you could probably access this by car if the dirt roads are dry. Have a fun ride in the desert :) Don't forget to bring your own writing instrument.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is not located at the
above listed coordinates. There is however a nice 1 1/2&quot;x1 1/2&quot;
white square on the ground. Look into the square to get the last
three digits of the final cache location. (Reuse the degree and
whole minutes from the coordinates listed above)&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is not located at the
above listed coordinates. There is however a nice 1 1/2&quot;x1 1/2&quot;
white square on the ground. Look into the square to get the last
three digits of the final cache location. (Reuse the degree and
whole minutes from the coordinates listed above)&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is not located at the
above listed coordinates. There is however a nice 1 1/2&quot;x1 1/2&quot;
white square on the ground. Look into the square to get the last
three digits of the final cache location. (Reuse the degree and
whole minutes from the coordinates listed above)&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is not located at the

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT NOTICE: If you are coming
from &quot;GC35YFF&quot; or &quot;116 Thinderbird&quot;. You must make a slight detour
just a few hundred feet north along the fence to the gate.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

may pull it up out of the sleeve to use it but please make sure it
goes back in before replacing the cache to ensure protection from
the weather. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Due to fences and natural barriers you may find it best to go out and back the same way, rather than cutting cross-country to other sections. We are not the cache-cops and will not be bothering to check on you, but we do want you to have fun.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache includes a special stamp.
The stamp is attached to the cache sleeve with a small cable. You
may pull it up out of the sleeve to use it but please make sure it
goes back in before replacing the cache to ensure protection from
the weather. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Due to fences and natural barriers you may find it best to go out and back the same way, rather than cutting cross-country to other sections.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the

Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,

Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for

&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho

notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT NOTICE: If you are coming
from &quot;GC35Y7W&quot; or &quot;079 Thinderbird&quot;. You must make a slight detour

You can access the cache from Coyote Butte or by exiting Swan Falls Rd. at N 43° 17.602 W 116° 23.643. The rest is up to you and your GPSr. A high clearance vehicle may be needed. You are looking for an Ammo Can large enough for small trades. The area had signs of some frequent visitors so please rehide as well as you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a remote area. Bring plenty of water and watch for snakes and other desert inhabitants. Don't stick your hands in any holes before looking to see what is inside first. The area seems to be open to shooting, so you may see some target practice happening on your way to the cache, if you don't feel comfortable or safe return on another day when nobody is there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have Fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints SF1DCDZ - Swan Falls Exit N 43° 17.602 W 116° 23.643 Exit Swan Falls Rd. here &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It is totally overgrown.  The original container may be there so let me know if anyone finds it.  However we did put out a decon container to replace it.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache includes a special stamp.
The stamp is attached to the cache sleeve with a small cable. You
may pull it up out of the sleeve to use it but please make sure it
goes back in before replacing the cache to ensure protection from
the weather. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Due to fences and natural barriers you may find it best to go out and back the same way, rather than cutting cross-country to other sections. We are not the cache-cops and will not be bothering to check on you, but we do want you to have fun.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by

notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We

We arrived at the coordinates for this cache and there were tank tracks everywhere but no cache container.  The land in this part of the desert is very flat with no rocks, nothing to hide a cache in, under or behind.  We could only assume that the container was run over by one of the tanks and mashed into the ground.  We tried moving the dirt at the coordinates but found nothing.   We had recently completed the “The Cacher Integrity Test” Wherigo and came across a similar scenario in question Q06 and knew what needed to be done.  Since it was apparent that the cache container was missing we replaced it with a small white bottle and a brand new log.  SL as Team RZR [:D]</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache includes a special stamp.
The stamp is attached to the cache sleeve with a small cable. You
may pull it up out of the sleeve to use it but please make sure it
goes back in before replacing the cache to ensure protection from
the weather. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Due to fences and natural barriers you may find it best to go out and back the same way, rather than cutting cross-country to other sections. We are not the cache-cops and will not be bothering to check on you, but we do want you to have fun.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We
wish you all the best and a safe adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and
hundreds of feet above it. There is plenty of room to be safe. We

may pull it up out of the sleeve to use it but please make sure it
goes back in before replacing the cache to ensure protection from
the weather. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Due to fences and natural barriers you may find it best to go out and back the same way, rather than cutting cross-country to other sections.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho
Geocachers&lt;/a&gt;. The League's email handles hundreds of
notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,
parts of this art are within a 1/2 mile of the Snake River and

notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of your surroundings,

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mountain Home Air Force Base is home
to the 366th Fighter Wing, which reports to Air Combat Command. The
base was opened on August 7, 1943. The base has been home to the
470th Bombardment Group, the 301st Bombardment Group, The 72d
Reconnaissance Squadron, the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Group,
the 4209th Base Service Squadron, the 580th, 581st, and 582nd Air
Resupply and Communications Wings, the 9th Bombardment Wing, the
569th Strategic Missile Squadron, the 9th Strategic Aerospace Wing,
the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, the 347th Tactical Fighter
Wing, the 366th Fighter Wing, the 389th, 390th, and 391st Tactical
Fighter Squadrons, and the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing. That's a
mouthful to say! There is no argument that the base has been a
player throughout history. This geoart of the F-16 while not the
latest aircraft of the 366th Gunfighters is a fitting symbol for
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of caches are maintained by
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idaloc.com//&quot;&gt;League of Idaho

notifications every day. Therefore we read all &quot;Did not find&quot;,
&quot;Write note&quot; and &quot;Needs maintenance&quot; logs but do not have time to
read all the &quot;found it&quot; logs. We encourage you to use cut and past
logs if you like (really we don't mind) on the first 199 caches
then post your thoughts, positive comments, and what ever you want
us to read on the last cache &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC35AXD&quot;&gt;200 Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;. We will be reading
all logs of any type from this last cache.&lt;/p&gt;

Experience America's Great Outdoors with the Bureau of Land
Management! All BLM cache sites in Idaho are located on public
lands, so you're free to explore the area around the cache. We only
ask that you leave these sites as you find them, with no trace of
your visit, so others can share the fun and exhilaration of
discovery. Learn more about the BLM Adventurer Passport at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blm.gov/id/st/en/prog/recreation/what_do_you_want_to/Geocaching.html&quot;&gt;
(visit link)&lt;/a&gt; , where you'll find detailed instructions on how
to download your individual passport (PDF) and place stamps from
the caches you find in your book. Each Idaho BLM geocache box
contains a unique 6-digit hard code and quick code (for smartphone
users) that unlock access to an electronic passport stamp for the
site. Once you've collected all four e-stamps for a BLM District,
bring your passport to the nearest BLM office (listed at the URL
above) and collect a prize. If you find the 4 caches on the list
that takes you to all 4 Districts, you'll be eligible for a State
Adventurer prize! Published with special permisison from

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located on Coyote Butte in the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area in southwest Idaho. You can access the cache by exiting S. Swan Falls Rd. at N 43° 19.886 W 116° 24.827. The rest is up to you and your GPSr. A high clearance vehicle may be needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for an Ammo Can large enough for small trades. The area had signs of some frequent visitors so please rehide as well as you found it. I cleaned up quite a bit of garbage near the cache and it looks pretty good now. Do a little CITO while you're there and we might keep it cleaned up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a remote area. Bring plenty of water and watch for snakes and other desert inhabitants. Don't stick your hands in any holes before looking to see what is inside first. The area is open to shooting, so you may see some target practice happening on your way to the cache, if you don't feel comfortable or safe return on another day when nobody is there. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints A11040E - Swan Falls Exit N 43° 19.886 W 116° 24.827&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It is an awesome find.  We left another TB for the next cachers. Thanks for another great hide.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the first Geocache I've placed! Located in Wilson Creek, ID... Great location for hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding and wildlife / wild horse watching. The terrain is mountainous and rocky. Cache is located at an altitude of approximately 3900 ft. Wilson Creek is off Owyhee Hwy (Hwy 78) about 10 miles south of Marsing, ID. The cache is located off of Wilson Creek Rd (dirt road), most cars without 4WD can make it to the parking area near the cache easily. Once parked, you will need to hike by foot to get to the cache. It is approximately 1/4 mile hike to the cache up the mountain. No need for climbing gear, and you should only need to use your hands to climb occasionally. The cache container is an ammo can. Inside the can I have left some small trade items... 2 &quot;Little Hotties&quot; hand warmers, an Akona water bottle, a small metallic blue LED flash light / batteries, a LEGO Racer #3 from a McDonalds Happy Meal (unopened), a notepad, and last but not least a travel bug. Trading is highly encouraged but be sure to trade with items that are of equal or greater value. Please... No trash in the cache :) FTF... Please take the travel bug on its first adventure! Be sure to bring a camera, the view at the top is really nice and chances are you will see some wildlife. Please re-hide the cache as you found it. This cache is located on public land so please be respectful of the area to ensure it's availability for future use and don't forget... If you pack it in, pack it out! Happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Thinking of the name of this cache, the view of the landscape is deceitful. When you think you've made it your only halfway there.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

You might see wild horses, falcons, an occasional eagle and tons of jack rabbits.  Oh ...and a few cows, which scared the baheegees out of our dog when it came right up to the truck.  Never seen her back away from something quite so fast.  She was too busy watching all the jack rabbits to notice them approach.  We all had a good laugh at her expense. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope you have fun along this stretch of road, the grand-kids had a great time. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Cacher Challenge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is at the listed coordinates, but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;YOU MAY NOT LOG
THIS CACHE AS &quot;FOUND&quot; UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE
CHALLENGE!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;THE GOAL:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find and log &lt;b&gt;3 DIFFERENT STYLE CACHES&lt;/b&gt; owned by &lt;b&gt;10
DIFFERENT IDAHO GEOCACHERS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;THE RULES:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The cache owner must live in Idaho per their opencaching.com
profile page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. You will need to find and log 3 different styles of caches
placed by each of the 10 chosen cache owners. Size, Difficulty and
Terrain are unimportant, but styles are. Allowed cache types
are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Traditional, Multi, Virtual, Puzzle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. All cache finds must be found and logged after 7/1/2010. No
caches found or logged prior to 7/1/2010 will be allowed. Cache
placement dates are insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. No adopted caches – Must be the original cachers hide
only. Neither the original placer nor the adopter can be counted on
an adopted cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. No combining of accounts – All must be logged by one
account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. No finding of your own caches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Post your 30 found caches in a comment on this cache. Make sure you annotate the comment with who the
cache was hidden by and when you found it.  After we verify
your list we will send you authorization to log the
cache.&lt;/p&gt;

Talk about crazy, watching a van full of cachers scramble and trip over each other trying to get to the caches was more fun and laughs than you can imagine! Had a great time finding finds to get a group FTF on this find.  [:)]

Replace the decimal portion of the coordinates you found for stage one with these numbers. The southern-most number goes in the latitude, the northern-most number goes in the longitude. This new set of coordinates will lead you to the nano cache. Those of you who are vertically-challenged may wish to bring something along to help you remedy that. Also, everyone will need to bring their own writing implement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be wary of muggles and have a good time.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So here's the debate, are pancakes best served:
&lt;p&gt;Fluffy&lt;br /&gt;
With Butter&lt;br /&gt;
Whole Wheat&lt;br /&gt;
Buck Wheat&lt;br /&gt;
Betty Crockers&lt;br /&gt;
Aunt Jamima&lt;br /&gt;
With Maple Syrup&lt;br /&gt;
With Boysenberry Syrup&lt;br /&gt;
Dry&lt;br /&gt;
Plain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim insists they are best served moist like his shoes.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; How good are you at following directions?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Don't look on the bridge.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Drive North to the &quot;T&quot; in the road.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Turn Left.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Drive about 0.2 miles.&lt;br /&gt;
5. Park between the ditch and the road.&lt;br /&gt;
6. Walk to the large culvert.&lt;br /&gt;
7. Take note of what direction the water flows.&lt;br /&gt;
8. Stay on the upstream side of culvert.&lt;br /&gt;
9. Center yourself over the opening.&lt;br /&gt;
10. You should be up against a concrete rail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, if you were to make a concrete sandwich for lunch, what would
you put in it? Peanut butter and Cache?&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN2HDQ9 - GC2HDQ9 Final&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Words alone cannot express our sympathy and to say that his time
with us was far too short is an understatement. The reality is that
Mike Davis will be sorely missed by all who loved and knew him. All
of our prayers go out to the family. This one is for you mike. We
hope you like it.</groundspeak:long_description>

I had to give it a high difficulty because I didn't find it and no rating for awsomeness because of the same reason.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located at a marker and an overlook of the bridge that was voted Most Beautiful Bridge of 1976. We are guessing that there wasn't much competition that year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The graceful lines of the White Bird Bridge on north Idaho's US 95 belie the challenge presented in its construction. Begun in 1974, the bridge was the last link in a 10 year improvement effort to widen Idaho's north-south highway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opening of this section eliminated the torturous 23 switchbacks in 7 miles that previously dropped the roadway 3000 feet into the Salmon River canyon from Camas Prairie. Passing 205 feet above White Bird Creek, the bridge is 810 feet long and includes an imperceptible arch which is more concerned with compensating for thermal expansion than imparting strength. The steel structure consists of 2 parallel sets of 11 girder sections. The knee braces are fully boxed while the horizontal sections are open topped &quot;bath tub&quot; girders.</groundspeak:long_description>

The population was 106 at the 2000 census.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the southwest corner of the Camas Prairie, White Bird is near the Salmon River crossing point for the Lewis and Clark expedition. It is also the location of the 1877 Battle of White Bird Canyon, which was the first fight of the Nez Perce war and a significant defeat of the U.S. Army. Chief White Bird was a leader of the tribe. The summit of White Bird Hill is 2700 feet (823 m) above the city, ascended via U.S. Highway 95.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was our first stop on our &quot;leisurely&quot; version of the Quad-Cities Cache Machine today.  It was here that we gave our group the name &quot;10 Stinkers&quot; (later to become 11 Stinkers when Right Wing Wacko joined us) - the smell from the pulp mill was strong and there was a Stinker's gas station just to the north!  It took us a while to find this one as our coordinates had us a fair distance to the east, but focusing on the likely options led us to the prize.  Thanks for the hunt!</groundspeak:text>

Since I've been coming to this park I keep telling myself I&lt;br/&gt;should place a cache here...this time felt right, but I didn't have&lt;br/&gt;any supplies.

The first time I came into Lewiston, I saw this amazing overlook of the town. I stopped across the HWY and just admired the view for a while. I hope you enjoy this scenic view as much as I do. Take pictures and share them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you love this cache; favorite it, share it, or bookmark it. Thanks!</groundspeak:long_description>

While stopped we thought this would be an excellent location for a cache. The view of the HWY stretching both directions as far as the eye can see, in addition to the beautiful wheat fields and rolling hills of the Palouse, make this a great area to stop and stretch your legs. This cache can only be accessed while heading southbound on HWY 95. There is plenty of safe parking for any vehicle, just be careful getting off and back on the HWY as the traffic is moving pretty fast here. You are looking for a green soda preform.</groundspeak:long_description>

I am glad you told me about this cache last night when our paths crossed on the geo trail!! I will have to start looking for these more often now!! I might even place a few for the pathtag!! You were right too, I was very near here last night!! Thanks for the hide!!

North Idaho Roller Derby practices here during the summer months when their regular facility is hosting a multitude of events. If you seek this at the right time, you just might encounter them. I'm not too tall, so it should be no problem to reach for others, but little ones might need to climb to reach it. Might be handicachable if the ground isn't too soft and if you are able to reach the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

As we walked up from the road, looking around, RLD came to a grave, marked with a red dog collar, a doggy bandanna, a plaque reading &quot;SEQUOYA&quot; and the dates 1988-2004, and a headstone with the inscription &quot;If love could have saved you, you would have lived forever.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We were deeply touched, and decided to place our cache nearby, dedicating it to this obviously beloved canine pet, who lived to age 15 or 16.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of the forest cover, we do not guarantee accuracy of the coords, though our Oregon showed a very strong satellite signal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you stand at the foot of Sequoya's final resting place, facing the headstone, look to your right. There is a small group of trees. Cache, a small peanut butter jar, is there, close to ground level. Bark - appropriately! - is the camo. Please replace so that cache is not visible. If the bark we used disintegrates with time, there is more nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Sequoya's grave is outlined with small rocks. You do NOT need to stand or walk on the grave. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need a writing instrument. There is a dollar in the log baggie for the FTF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We think the cache is too close to the road for danger during hunting season, but be aware!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to Cardinal Flyer, Caitlyn, and Etux - Team Nimrod - on their First to Find.

Micro, but there is a small vial inside, containing the log. You will need tweezers to extact the log, and a fine-point to initial it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a cool area. We locals like to walk our dogs here, and the trails are great for cross-country skiing in winter. We've seen elk, deer, and moose. Some folks ride dirt bikes, so beware. But you'll hear them coming! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trail is a loop, and the cache is placed at the start or end of the loop portion. I recommend parking at the Ramsey Road entrance and walking in, but depending on mud, snow, and ruts, you might be able to drive almost to GZ.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to Cardinal Flyer/Team Nimrod on the First to Find!</groundspeak:long_description>

To get a stronger signal, I was about five feet from GZ when I took the coords.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Look for a camoed bison. Just unscrew the bottom, leaving top attached to branch. There is a small clear tube inside, which contains the log and should ensure that the log remains dry. You'll need tweezers and a writing instrument. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This should be available in winter if snow permits parking. </groundspeak:long_description>

There has been a few attempts and some cachers are finding the
&quot;Mountaineering container with paper inside&quot; This is NOT the cache.
I have placed a Lime Green container. No pencil so bring your own.
&lt;br /&gt;
Mount Temple overlooks the Bow Valley in Banff National Park near
beautiful Lake Louise. The summit is at about 3550m so be careful
of weather conditions. Although this is considered an alpine scramble
it is in reality a mountain climb in the truly classic sense. You can park at Moraine Lake parking lot.  Spaces are limited so get there before 7AM. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N 51 21.058 W 116 12.390 Elevation 3532
m&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I found 3 large black/blue rocks that make a triangle. In the
middle were 5 smaller rocks that I removed and put the cache
inside. Then I put the 5 smaller rocks on top of it. The new cache
is a lime green small container with Geocaching writen on it.
The is no writing instrument, so bring your own.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Start of Trail 1863 Meters = 6112 Feet&lt;br /&gt;
Mt. Temple Peak 3555 Meters = 11663 Feet&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
11 Hours to complete.&lt;br /&gt;
5.5 hours to reach the top, 1692 Meters = 5551.18 Feet, 4.6 hours
to come down.&lt;br /&gt;
Mt. Temple is the highest peak in the Lake Louise area. The highest
mountain anyone can scramble in the Canadian Rockies. Difficulty
Rating: D6 - Difficult to Advanced&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What an adventure...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Good luck and BE CAREFUL!&lt;/strong&gt;    </groundspeak:long_description>

In winter, snow may make the trail more of a challenge which is why the terrain rating is 3.5. The second access is from the stairs behind the Centre’s office which is a scenic and restful access that provides benches along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Caching&lt;br/&gt;Koda's Keeper</groundspeak:long_description>
