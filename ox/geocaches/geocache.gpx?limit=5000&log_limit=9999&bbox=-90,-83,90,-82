            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Area&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boquete is located on the highlands of Panama, namely in the province of Chiriqui. The town is within sight of Panama's best known volcano.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Baru Volcano can be seen on clear mornings -otherwise covered in clouds-. If you are situated at the location of this virtual cache, you should see the Baru Volcano bearing 278 degrees at a distance of about 10 kilometers. The volcano is 3,474 meters high and at its summit the lowest recorded temperatures are around zero Celsius, the only place in Panama with such temperatures in natural form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This volcano is dormant but potentially active, in fact in 2006 an earthquake swarm ocurred underneath the mountain. Its last major eruption was around 500 A.D. and there is evidence of another catastrophic eruption around 1450 A.D. Panama was &quot;discovered&quot; in 1501.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rock Formation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When a thick lava flow cools, it contracts vertically but cracks perpendicular to its directional flow with remarkable geometric regularity - in most cases forming a regular grid of remarkable hexagonal extrusions that almost appear to be made by man.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Columnar Basalts are rock formations resulting from the quick cooling of lava flow. Fractures form in a random cellular network (similar to soap bubbles, organic cells, etc.), though the average distribution of sides is six, giving the hexagonal structures an eerie man-made appearance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Location&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully it remains as it is forever as some of these rocks can be seen used in ornaments of fences such as one house on the road to this cache. Nowadays it is exploited as a rock climbing venue though it is PUBLIC property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting There&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't count on public transport unless you hire a local taxi. Best way is by car or rent a motorcycle in the center of town. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Verification By Code Phrase&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After visiting the location of this virtual cache, if you continue northbound on this narrow road (as most people would, few do it southbound) you will eventually come around back down to Los Naranjos. Prior to getting to Los Naranjos on your return you will pass by these coordinates (+/- 3m):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     N 08* 47' 41.5&quot;   W 082* 26' 45.3&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Right there you will find two small businesses (cafe type) competing on the same product. Assuming you continued northbound after finding the virtual cache (or southeast at this very location), What is the motto (in spanish as they advertise it) of the cafe on your left (the better choice BTW)? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important Note to those NOT familiar with PANAMA&lt;br/&gt;If you are a visiting tourist looking to log this location you will probably ask for directions. You should note that the OpenCaching site *incorrectly* labels the cache location as &quot;Las Lajas, Chiriqui, Panama&quot;. The fact is the location name is Boquete, or more specifically Los Naranjos in Boquete. The town of Las Lajas (and district AFAIK) is at least 60 kms away in a straight line and is a coastal area, not a mountain area. So, you have been warned, don't end up in Las Lajas rather than in the indicated coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FINAL NOTES TO REVIEWERS&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to the positive remarks, likewise to Manville Possum for making the point regarding the code phrase, corrective action has been taken so now it can only be logged if one has really been there. </groundspeak:long_description>

The parking lot does have a gate that closes at night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a hidden park at the very end of Wharf, can you find it? Once at the park you will find a picnic table, boat dock and parking lot, which closes at dusk, but will you find the cache?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must use your absolute best stealth as a previous cache in this area has already been muggled!

I hope you enjoy this nice park away from the busy world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should be a easy park and grab, but the park across the street might make you want to stay a little longer. This is a micro with only a log and a FTF prize. So please bring your own pen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to BabyRuthie for FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

It all depends on how many people are out and about or if you can find the cache quickly. This cache does not contain a pen so please bring your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At some points of time, this traffic light blinks. At other times of the day, this traffic light does not blink and is just like an average traffic light. The reason for this programming of the traffic light is the school down the block. This makes finding this cache a little hard. If you go during a certain time and find the muggle activity at a minimum, let everyone else know to make it easier on parking.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">So I was driving around with my fiancée one day and came across this nice little park. When I got home, I checked the web and to my surprise, no Geocache around, until now!!! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Rock Park features about an acre with a playground designed for children aged 6-12 years old, a covered picnic area, a tiny “tot lot” for the smallest members of the family, and a large field to play a game of baseball or soccer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is not in the park, but right near it, in order to find the cache, you need to explore the park a little bit.The posted coordinates are for parking. From the little parking lot follow the path past the Enjoy Your Park sign. On this sign is a phone number, record this number as ABC-DEFG. Now walk to the building to the south of the parking area, it contains bathrooms. On the corner of the building is the year for when the facilities opened. Record this number as HIJK. The last set of numbers you need to find are on the other side of the field to the south of the facilities. In the southeast corner of the field is a metal baseball cage behind home base. You are looking for a silver sticker that has a 9 digit number on it along with a barcode, it is on one of the four metal poles. Once this number is found, take note of it as LMNOPQRS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now time for some math!!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are the coordinates for the final:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 27° (C) (R) . (R+C) (R-B) (L+O)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;W 082° (C+H) (K) . (S) (D-L) (N)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 27° XX.XXX W 082° XX.XXX&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is not behind any fence or in anyones yards, please be as stealthy as you can!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ENJOY!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Mrsirisbowie for her first FTF!!!!!&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;FN2QCVY - GC2QCVY Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;The final is the cache itself!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is one of the oldest cemeteries in the area with the first burial in 1890. The cache however is outside of the property so do not go into the gated area.&lt;br/&gt;This should be a pretty easy find as long as you look low. Please re-hide this like you found it and not in the open!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I always drive past this location as it is on my way home from work and school. I decided to take a better look at this park to find out it contains a little cemetery. Further research on the internet led me to find out its one of the first in the Sarasota area. As a history buff, I found this pretty interesting as its pretty much in my backyard! This cache only contains a log and whatever else you might find inside, just hopefully no water. Please bring your own pen!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to waltersrm for FTF and the free taco coupon!</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a nice stretch of road that is hardly ever used. A great spot to walk laps as there is a sidewalk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Sundays use SUPER STEALTH, a group of guys use the end of the street to fly little model airplanes. I informed them of the cache so we should have no problem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container is a 35mm film canister, should be a really easy find.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A treasure box full of some knick-knacks at the &quot;Bay&quot; also known as the Bluffs of Belleair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fun cache with a log book and something for everyone. It's located in a public park on the water (Clearwater Bay) in Belleair, FL. The park has lots of benches and has a nice view of the water and the intercoastal islands across the bay. There's a water fountain not far from the cache and it even has a water bowl for dogs; so the park is dog friendly. Park on the park side of the road or ride a bike or walk if you're nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache was seeded with some interesting knick-knacks, several from the 1980s. Some of the items include...&lt;br/&gt;* Beads&lt;br/&gt;* Buttons&lt;br/&gt;* Dice&lt;br/&gt;* Wallet&lt;br/&gt;* Map&lt;br/&gt;* Log book + pen + doodles and room for more&lt;br/&gt;* ...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please bring something small to trade with anything in the treasure box, sign the log book, and doodle something!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find the cache, you'll have to head down the hill towards the water. A small amount of climbing on some rocks may be necessary. It's not in plain sight and is not in the water.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Climb down and turn around, look behind some rocks that may be movable</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

of the city's large power generation plants and one of several
refuse-burning power plants in the state. This close proximity of
this wildlife refuge and nature trail, however, softens the urban
industrial feeling of the area by offering hikers an inner city
wilderness experience! You may even encounter wildlife as you
traverse the trails. The bay itself is a haven for bird life -
pelicans, ospreys, egrets, herons and even flamingos and roseate
spoonbills are occasionally spotted here. ...And, depending on the
time of year, the water itself may be home to manatees, rays,
dolphins, small blackfin sharks and schools of redfish and
snook.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

While searching for the cache, take time to enjoy the beautiful
view!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The original cache container includes a variety of small trade
items, the &quot;Sub-bug&quot; TB and a log sheet/pencil.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have fun and please replace the cache as you found it or
better!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Lock 'N Lock container properly by pressing down
on all sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not
stay dry.&lt;/b&gt;

Nice cache. One of the four tabs is broken on the container, though. I don't think it will get wet but it's worth mentioning. Got a beautiful picture of the surf while I was out here!</groundspeak:text>

Anyhow, I found this very small container with ease,  &amp; when I mean small I mean small,   &quot;LOL&quot;

Anyways, I think this container needs the attention of the owner to move it around the area alittle bit and to make the container alittle bit bigger cause u can't really stick anything in this package...


Also what I did do tho with this package was create a new log book page since there was no room on the old page,  there is enough room on this paper to put 160 names &amp; dates when you opened up the package.

This is what is in the package when I opened the package up,

1.   Yellow Rubber Puff Fish
2.   Fake Pirates Money
3.   Blue Jay key Chain
4.   Plastic Roach 
5.   Rubber Alien
6.   2 Pennies
      
     Like I was saying before,  these  items are very very small and that was the only way to fit them in there and there is no more room to fit anything else....     &quot; LOL &quot;

No muggles to worry about on the water side, but it was impossible to be inconspicuous on the road side, so I pretended to be a picture taking muggle, which is what I was doing anyway - I took some pics of some beach bound TBs, one of which I left in the cache.  </groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

some movement up ahead. Too large to be cats and distinctively
canid the movement turned out to be a pair of foxes. I managed to
get off a couple of distance photographs of them before they
scattered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Depending upon your approach the trails in here can be quite
overgrown and sloppy. Bring a trash bag with you. Unfortunately the
county has neglected this nice park and some sections could
certainly use a bit of CITO.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M geocaching
disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I

return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

end? Have they been possessed? We know, we know. But it isn't a
micro and we think that this place is kind of special. We get a
laugh out of the 1st stage every time we drive by it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to find the cache you must complete the following simple
puzzle:&lt;br /&gt;
There is a large object located at the coordinates. OK, it's a car.
A very unique car. Find the VIN number on the car.&lt;br /&gt;
Take the last 3 digits of the VIN and subtract 129 - these numbers
are ABC.&lt;br /&gt;
Take the first 3 digits of the VIN and add 541 - these numbers are
DEF.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Final Cache is located at:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;N 28º02.ABC&lt;br /&gt;
W 082º24.DEF&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M geocaching
disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course you may
have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual cache.
Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it cannot
be seen. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Lock 'N Lock container properly by pressing down
on all sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not
stay dry.&lt;/b&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The University of South Florida Botanical Garden is a non-profit
educational facility that consists of six acres of landscape
displays and greenhouse collections. Its main purpose is to develop
living plant collections, garden displays, education programs and
research programs which promote knowledge and understanding of
plant life and the conservation of biodiversity on Earth. It is
also a great way to learn about local gardening techniques. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Parking and admissions to the gardens is free and the hours are as
follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Monday, Friday, 9 am – 5 pm&lt;br /&gt;
Saturday, 9am – 4 pm&lt;br /&gt;
Sunday, noon – 4 pm&lt;br /&gt;
Closed all major holidays&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 More information can be found at www.cas.usf.edu/garden/. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 You will need to answer the following questions to complete the
coordinates listed below. Enter the results, as indicated by the
letter(s) in the appropriate spots.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 1. According to the plaque regarding flowering trees, how many
species of flowering trees can be located in this garden? (Hint:
You should only be counting the &quot;common names&quot; listed on the
plaque, not the scientific classifications) Subtract this number
from 16 to get A. &lt;br /&gt;
 2.Using the information on the plaque discussing palm trees,
complete the following sentence: Palm trees range from 3 feet to
________feet tall or higher. Subtract 35 from this number to get
BC. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Substitute your answers for the letters to get the final
coordinates:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;N 28º 03.50A&lt;br /&gt;
W 082º 25.3BC&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. &lt;b&gt;Since this is a busy area, please rehide the cache
securely and conceal it well so it cannot be seen.&lt;/b&gt; Have fun and
feel free to post pictures of your favorite plants, flowers or
trees in the garden! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Over&lt;br /&gt;
the years there have been multiple caches at this location.
Should&lt;br /&gt;
be an easy grab.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

While completing the amazing &quot;Morris Bridge Mountain Bike Multi&quot;
hidden throughout this trail system, couldn't help but wondering
about the ominous sounding &quot;Gator Bait&quot; trail, the trailhead of
which is not far from part one of the legacy multi. This beautiful
trail traverses tropically moist swamp land and will probably
present quite a challenge for mountain-bike riders (we &quot;hoofed it&quot;
when the cache was hidden). Terrain may increase considerably
during the rainy season.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

dumbfounded. Sure we could have come up with something, but have
decided to appeal to you, the Geocaching community at large, to
help us name this one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a First to Find prize the Geocacher who claimed the FTF got to
name this cache. &lt;b&gt;Bill Z&lt;/b&gt; had this distinction and recommended
honoring our veterans since the preserve is location not far from
the Veterans' Expressway...so &lt;i&gt;&quot;Salute!&quot;&lt;/i&gt; seemed
appropriate!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The Rocky Creek Trails Nature preserve is a small preserve located
off of the Upper Tampa Bay Trail in Citrus Park. Please enter from
this trailhead. In order to reach this cache, at least the way we
did, you will have to navigate a small stream. The day we hid the
cache it was an easy leap over, this may change depending upon the
rains so please come prepared.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please park at you own discretion, we hiked here on the Upper Tampa
Bay Trail, a nearby side steet or shopping center will probably
work. You cannot park at the trail head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M geocaching
disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Lock 'N Lock container properly by pressing down
on all sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not
stay dry.&lt;/b&gt;

The woods are fairly dense and the creek that cuts the park in half is relatively large and can be difficult to cross depending on how much rain has fallen.

Instead of going home to get the bike and taking the trail all the way up here, I parked at Citrus Park (yes, the park in Citrus Park is called Citrus Park) and crossed the road to the trail.  It's pretty back here, but the trail meanders almost as much as the E trail at the Northwest Equestrian Trail.  Finally got to the obstacle and it was much bigger than I expected, though the drought made passing it much, much easier.  If you've been waiting to do this one, now is the time.  Spotted ground zero even without the GPS as the location just screamed geocache to me.  Then strolled over to lake back here that borders the Veteran's thanks to the hole in the fence likely made by whoever left all those cans of Bud Light behind.  Thanks for taking me here to this nice little patch of land.  I put this one off far to long.  TFTC! </groundspeak:text>

My older model GPS takes a little longer to settle down and Micheal finds it quickly.  Now it is getting too late to look for the other two nearby new hides so I follow Grandpa and Main back to Morris Bridge Road while m^3 runs off to map some more trail.  We meet back at the bike parking area to continue the hunt.  By the way we were not the FTF.  TFTH  </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a lovely portion of the river with mucho Florida wildlife
to see as you make your way from Trout Creek to Lettuce Lake (if
this is the approach you choose to take...you can also approach via
the boat launch at Rotary Park on Fowler Avenue.) If you take the
Trout Creek approach, you will have to paddle through the spillway
and under I-75, but don 't let this dissuade you. Once you get
beyond the Interstate and paddle downstream, it really is a
beautiful and peaceful section of the river.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As far as the cache itself, when we hid it, we were able to paddle
right up to GZ, only getting out of the boat to hide the cache.
However, once the rainy season ends, there's a good chance you will
have to get out of the boat and walk a short distance to your
destination.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M geocaching
disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I stopped by here from memory while paddling by.  The decon's lid was completely off and the log was soaked.  I laid the log out to dry planning to put it back on my way back upstream.  My downstream jaunt did not last too long, since the river was completely blocked at Lettuce Lake.  Some USF students paddled through it, but I did not care to.  So....my trip back upstream was not as delayed as long as I suspected.  I replaced a still wet/damp log and carefully snapped all four corners before heading upstream  I was &quot;pulled over&quot; by the police near the cache.  Officer politely checked to be sure that I had a PFD.  All was good.  </groundspeak:text>

extra disclaimers too!)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1 - You may be tempted to treat this as an Interstate p&amp;g. THIS
IS NOT RECOMMENDED. This cache should be accessed from Trout Creek
Park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2 - Depending on your approach, the last several feet or so may
require some palmetto-whacking. It's not too bad, but if you don't
like palmettos, fell free to pass on this cache. You have been
warned. ;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3 - Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of
course you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the
actual cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well
so it cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

walking from the nearby nature trail...and it was dry (for the most
part). However, since we have been fortunate enough to have so much
rain this year, the cache, for the time being, can definitely only
be accessed by boat. We were able to paddle right up to it as of
September 5, 2009. It has thus been changed to a 5-star terrain for
the time being.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ahhh, yes...yet another in cache in the famous &quot;moist&quot; series (or
perhaps it's &quot;infamous&quot;, depending on your moisture tolerance
level)! We accessed this lovely river-side location on-foot, but it
is also easily accessible via canoe or kayak...during heavy rains,
that may be the only way to access it, in which case the terrain
rating will increase accordingly!&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So, being a short distance away we decide to climb down off the boardwalk and head straight to it.  It did not take long to realize that this was one of the caches that was going to require wet feet.  m^3 said something like &quot;we may as well get wet and get it over with&quot;, so off we go.  Fairly easy to find.  The river was now at and beyond the cache site.  After signing the cache log, m^3 reviews his topo map and says something like &quot;lets bushwhack to Pigskin&quot; (GC18J1J), and also says &quot;we should be getting up out of the water in about 100 meters&quot;.  We are already wet, will be heading away from the river so why not. I look at my GPS, 1/2 mile to go.  m^3 takes his compass bearing and off we go.  After about 100 meters I can no longer see or hear him.  It is still very wet.  The water depth varies from knee deep to crotch deep and no dry ground except for the occasional small tree island.  I keep going figuring that m^3 is off to my right and probably ahead of me.  After a while I stop to remove my phone and wallet from my pocket to place them in my pack. 

That 100 meter water walk ended up being a little bit longer, like the full one half mile to the cache (Pigskin).  When I get to the cache area I spook a flock of turkeys, so I figure m^3 is not around here yet.  Before I find the cache he arrives, seems he was behind me after all.  That did not happen again for the rest of the journey.    TFTH

better initiation to this area than to place a cache at the
location of our first portage of the day. We figured that if you
have to get out of the boat, might as well look for a cache.&lt;br /&gt;

Since this was our 1st foray into a more technical paddle, the name
&quot;Initiation&quot; worked on multiple levels.&lt;br /&gt;

I looked at every tree that matched the hint.  I don't believe that it is located above the current water levels which is 2.5 feet deep at GZ.  So unless it was tethered which I don't think it was when I found it, I believe that this one has floated away.</groundspeak:text>

Started the morning with a quick trip around Weedon Wonderland to check on all stages and then drove to the Hillsborough River for an upstream paddle from Morris Bridge.  There was a gator nearby but he did not want anything to do with me or the cache. 

I guess that it is fitting that I would do one of your kayak caches on the same day you were doing a couple of mine.  Enjoyed the short trip into seventeen runs before heading back downstream.  FTF  TFTH  </groundspeak:text>

way along the Hillsborough River. Cache is more easily accessed
from the Trout Creek area but you can also paddle downstream from
Morris Bridge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We enjoyed paddling this area... there is an abundance of wildlife.
We saw Roseate Spoonbills, Annhingas, Ibis, Egrets, Herons, Turtles
and of course, everyone's favorite, the American Alligator. We
noted gator tracks about the cache site.&lt;br /&gt;

not immediately spot it.&lt;br /&gt;

Other times you may need to use stealth to grab it. BYOP
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Now of course everyone knows that fungus grows in those dark, moist
spots that we know and love so well. Well, poor Carl, as we
affectionately call him, knew this but unfortunately ate the wrong
type of fungus and suffered the fatal consequences! :( But
alas...Carl did not die in vain as his last request was to be a
loyal cache guardian. So in honor of Carl and his encounter with
poisonous portobellos, we place this cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M
disclaimers!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!

I'm happy again.&lt;br /&gt;
I'm laughing at clouds.&lt;br /&gt;
So dark , up above ,&lt;br /&gt;
The sun's in my heart&lt;br /&gt;
And I'm ready for love.&lt;br /&gt;

Let the stormy clouds chase.&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone from the place&lt;br /&gt;
Come on with the rain&lt;br /&gt;
Have a smile on my face&lt;br /&gt;
I'll walk down the lane&lt;br /&gt;
With a happy refrain&lt;br /&gt;
And singin'&lt;br /&gt;
Just singin' in the rain&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I'm dancin' and singin' in the rain&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Couldn't help but hum this classic tune as we hid this cache
amongst the raindrops...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Original cache contents include items such as M&amp;M CD #1 and a
variety of other goodies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so, of course,
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. That being said, the hiding spot should be fairly obvious
once you get within 40 feet of the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please&lt;/b&gt; be sure to secure and conceal the cache well when you
rehide it so it cannot be seen from the trail...and, of course,
have fun!

locating Postpile's 
Big Pine Island Roundabout. While planning our route, IK's Meg
suggested to us that if we cross the river at a point very near to
where we ultimately placed this cache, it would shorten our trip.
She did.... we didn't. After deciding that we were not in the mood
to go for an early morning swim we found an alternative that was
almost as short. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to reach this cache you can either go Meg's way, our way
or by Kayak/Canoe. The choice is yours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh by the way the area immediately surrounding the cache may be
quite moist at times.. so please plan accordingly. &lt;br /&gt;
Be Safe, Have Fun!&lt;br /&gt;

is hidden...it actually relates to an experience we had with one of
our children while on the trail leading to the cache. Fortunately,
all's well that ends well!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway...the cache itself involves approximately 400 feet of
bushwacking off the main trail. Dense tree cover may affect your
final GPS readings so of course you may have to use your geocaching
intuition to find the actual cache. Please rehide the cache
securely and conceal it well so it cannot be seen. Have fun! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

As I tried to get close enough for a picture, it ran off through the palmetto like a torpedo! The Pooch took off like a rocket too, in the opposite direction! After getting her to come back, we bushwhacked in for the cache. We absolutely loved this area! TNLNSL. Thank you to Isonzo Karst for suggesting this area. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Jersey Girl we were feeling a bit delirious as we were working our
way back to our vehicles. Hence the inspiration for this cache. The
cache should be visible from at least 100ft, reaching it is your
challenge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The area in the immediate vicinity of this cache may get quite,
shall we say moist, at times so please plan accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;
 Be Safe, Have Fun.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">While exploring this preserve, we were delighted to wander into
some wonderfully moist swampland...and, whaddyaknow...we just
happened to have some cache fixings in our backpack!  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although the journey is short (less than a mile round-trip), you
may find this hunt to be both memorable and challenging as you
bushwack your way through a beautiful Cypress swamp. Waterproof
boots are advisable and after some significant rain, a canoe or
kayak might come in handy! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache should be easily found once you have made your way to ground
zero. Terrain rating will vary based upon the water levels. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M geocaching
disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Be Safe, Have fun! &lt;br /&gt;

such family member suggested that “maybe you could have one
of your remote caches play the theme from Deliverance when
opened...” Although our caches aren’t THAT scary, we
were inspired. Unfortunately, the theme doesn't play when the ammo
can opens…but the name of the cache remains!&lt;br /&gt;

9:45am     Sign log at “The Grinch”.  Follow some trail then Bushwhack south.
10:04am   Sign log at “Deliverance”.  Bushwhack south. 
10:42am    Arrive at “Dark Green Area Alternative”.   Saw several pigs here but no Cotamundi.  Perform some maintenance.  CITO and re-attach cache to a small branch.  It was lying on the ground.  Placed a nice natural cache container that I found in the dry swamp on the island here.  Too much walking ahead for me to make it worthwhile to haul it out.  
11:09am     Leave “Dark Green Area Alternative”.  Bushwhack south.  Saw several deer including a nice buck.  Tried to follow an east-west blazed trail about .5 miles south of the cache.  Wandered around and picked a place for a future cache placement.
12:17pm    Arrive at the final cache for Big Pine Island after wandering in from “DGAA”.  
12:28pm   Leave the final for “BPI”.  Head south to check on Stage 5.  
12:54pm   Cross the Hillsborough River at N28 04.683, W82 17.973.  Bottom very solid except for the first two steps.  Rolled my pants up to just over the knee and they stayed dry on the crossing.  (Carried Crocs for crossing)
1:03pm   Checked stage 2 of “Return by River”.
Meandered the riverbank upstream.
1:29pm    Checked on stage 1 of “Return by River”.
1:40pm     Checked final ammo can at “The Lost Trail”.
1:49pm     Hang out at a picnic table at Sargeant Park.  Log on to geocaching.com to obtain coordinates for a nearby cache that I have not found.
2:05pm   Sign log at “John B. Sargeants Park”.
Head back southwest into Jefferson Equestrian Area.  Check on stages 4 and 5 of “The Lost Trail”.  
Leave the lost trail to check on stage 3 of “Return by River”.
3:15pm    Leave stage 3 of “Return by River”.  Head over to Cow House Creek.  Follow Cow House Creek downstream looking for a dry crossing.  
3:23pm cross Cow House Creek  (dry)
Enter off road bicycle area.  Check on stage 2 of “The Lost Trail”.
4:10pm  Check on stage 2 of “Mandible Multi”.  
Check stage 1 of “The Lost Trail”.  Head north and cross the Hillsborough River on the highway bridge.  Go back into Washburn.  Check on “Connection”
5:26pm  Arrive back at vehicle in Flatwoods.

venture between Hillsborough County and the City of St. Petersburg,
is located on Gunn Highway north of Erlich Road. Natural features
within the park include two fresh water lakes, pine flatwoods, and
oak hammocks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lake Rogers Park, as well as other County Parks, is a sanctuary for
birds and wildlife.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Facilities at Lake Rogers Park include picnic shelters, picnic
tables, nature trails, barbecue grills, fishing and canoeing. The
park is open from 8 a.m.-6 p.m. daily and is closed for Christmas
holidays.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please be sure to conceal the cache well when you rehide it.
Have fun on your trek around Lake Rogers!</groundspeak:long_description>

I parked at Flatwoods entrance and bushwhacked directly (more or less) to the cache.  I found an object that would be cache worthy and one that M&amp;M would probably choose.  I did find a black frayed cord.  The same type of cord that would be in a camo bag.  But, I could not find a camo bag or a match container.  So either the cache is missing or the grinch did a good job of hiding the goods.  I looked around on the ground an in several nearby crevasses to no avail.  I tied the cord onto the object it was draped over and left something for the next searcher. 

From the cache I bushwhacked east less than 300 feet to the north-south horse trail then headed north to the vicinity of &quot;Hikers Cache&quot; final.  All is well there.  The creek that separates Washburn from Oakridge is almost completely dry.  I have never seen it like that before.  The previous times I have crossed it I was about waist deep in water.  From there I hiked to &quot;Out&quot;.  the cache was located about 2 feet from where I found it a while back.  Looking for some more adventure, I bushwhacked from &quot;Out&quot; back to the Flatwoods entrance, briefly stopping at The Grinch again.   I still did not see the cache.  Attached photo may be a spoiler or it may be a red herring.   I will be back.</groundspeak:text>

Though I was rapidly running out of daylight, I couldn't resist shooting down the Squiggy trail to grab this cache.  (Lenny was out of the question due to time constraints.  And my feet hurt.)   Why are they naming trails after secondary television characters?  While I wouldn't mind a Latka trail, this is a slippery slope.  What's next?  A Maynard G. Krebs trail? A Boner trail? An Urkel trail?!?! Oh, the humanity!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Lake Park is a 589-acre park that is a joint-venture between
Hillsborough County and the City of St. Petersburg. Despite the
activities in the picnic areas, horse stables, rodeo arena, archery
range and BMX bicycle tract, the trails themselves traverse several
Florida habitats. Wildlife includes gopher tortoises, armadillos
and rabbits as well as all sorts of snakes (as always, be
careful!). …And of course you may also be greeted by numerous
horses and leashed doggies, who are also permitted in this
park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Entrance to this great park is free but a $1.00 donation is
requested. We parked near the horse arena and BMX track and
proceeded to the trailhead at &lt;b&gt;N 28 07.324, W082 30.764&lt;/b&gt; . The
walk from the trailhead to the cache is approximately .2
miles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Original cache contents include:&lt;br /&gt;
FM AutoScan Mini Radio&lt;br /&gt;
M&amp;M CDs 1,2,3&lt;br /&gt;
Dolphin magnet&lt;br /&gt;
Plastic whale&lt;br /&gt;
Flamingo keychain&lt;br /&gt;
Aloha friendship bracelet&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Fishing Rules&quot; wall hanging&lt;br /&gt;
Plastic zebra&lt;br /&gt;
package of mini frames&lt;br /&gt;
doggie memo pad&lt;br /&gt;
box of crayons&lt;br /&gt;
several kiddie toys&lt;br /&gt;
logbook &amp; pens&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Since the cache is located only a couple feet off the trail,
please be sure to conceal it well when you rehide it. Have fun!

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As we hiked down this trail we marveled at how, even in the midst
of the constant urban growth going on in New Tampa, this typically
Floridian wilderness is still ever-present and beautiful! Since the
trail itself is almost completely unshaded, please plan your
hiking/biking accordingly and be sure to bring plenty of liquid
refreshments.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A parking lot for this end of the trail is located at N 28º 07.928,
W082º 21.759. If the trail parking lot is closed, however,
recommended parking is in the Chili's parking lot - N 28º 07.931,
W082º 21.802. From there, follow the Bruce B. Downs Trail to the
Flatwoods Trail and on to the cache!&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Original cache contents include items such as M&amp;M CDs #1-3, a
NASCAR memo pad, a variety of bendy animals, keychains and other
novelties along with some kiddie toys.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so, of course,
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please be sure to conceal the cache well when you rehide it
and have fun!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Guess what......this cache is only 2 miles from the entrance to Flatwoods Park on Morris Bridge Road. The original cache placed here was first accessed via a land route from the west by duracell. In his log he writes of getting to within 250 yards of the cache location only to run into one of the 17 runs. In his process of crossing he falls in and ends up ruining a cell phone. 

http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=9bbce45c-22af-4859-bc0f-f34a33f27f64&amp;log=y&amp;decrypt= 

Having hiked and paddled this area I knew that the cache is located on a large island and is surrounded by several of the 17 runs. The river is wide enough and deep enough to make one think twice about crossing. But, I remember a place where it is possible to cross on a fallen tree southwest of the cache. 

I left my office in Tampa at 4:45pm. It was raining. It did not look like rain to the northeast at Flatwoods so off I go. I decided on the drive over to give this one a shot. 

Crossing the paved road, I head easterly towards the cache beginning on the trails. I have a plan but change my mind along the way and start down the trail towards &quot;Out&quot;. When I am .75 miles from the cache I start bushwhacking. 
I crossed several dry and almost dry creeks along the way. Stopped to photograph a cool looking fern garden growing on a large downed tree. Wish I had an ammo can to leave here. When I get to 500 feet from the cache I start walking up and down the river bank looking for the crossing since I did not have the waypoint with me. My first choice does not look good so I continue along the bank till I find a place to cross on a series of logs without getting wet feet. From there it is a short hike to the cache and the virgin log book. Signed log, took a photo and off I go. Not wanting to backtrack I decide to head west-northwest and hope to intersect the unmaintained trail which passes &quot;Ancient Regeneration?&quot;. All works well and I am headed out. Stopped by another cache on the way back to Flatwoods. Got back to my vehicle a little before 8:00pm. The meandering round trip was just over 6 miles.  Thanks for the adventure.

activities in the picnic areas, horse stables, rodeo arena, archery

…And of course you may also be greeted by numerous horses and
leashed doggies, who are also permitted in this park.&lt;br /&gt;

 Entrance to this great park is free but a $1.00 donation is
requested.&lt;br /&gt;

items from a plane crash and to locate the missing Fishing Buddy
(Fishing Buddy is MIA).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are 4 stages and there are NO trails to follow, bushwacking
at it's finest. The 1st stage is a decon can, 2nd stage is a micro,
the 3rd stage is a nantro in a camo-bag which contains the coords
for the final ammo can, also known as the flight recorder box.
Inside the ammo can are 2 new walkie talkies for the first finder.
They are to be used to call for help after completing the mission.
Hints are included because the tree cover makes satellite reception
difficult.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE: Between the 3rd stage and the final cache is &quot;King of the
Swamp&quot;, which we suggest visiting during your mission in the swamp.
It can be completed without doing &quot;S.O.S.&quot; but you will be making
your trip extra long if you do the caches separately.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Be sure to include water, bug spray, a walking stick to remove
spider webs in your way, extra GPS batteries, and the parking
coords for the trip out. The parking coords appear far from the 1st
stage, but you will be pleasantly surprised where you end up at the
end of the mission. This cache was placed by a member of the
FGA.&lt;br /&gt;

the final - it has been replaced twice already. The kids from the

Anyone one who attempts this one in July or August will give new meaning to the term extreme cacher.  As it is, during the dry season it proved to be quite a challenge.

We had a blast doing this one - definitely makes our list of favorite caches.  We used the straight line bushwack method to find all parts of the cache - we are still picking burrs out of parts of our bodies we didn't know existed.[:P]

We found all parts of the cache easily - with the exception of part 3 - the dense tree cover had us walking around in circles for about 15 mins before stumbling across the pill container.  Swapped trinkets and left M&amp;M CD #2.

Thanks you so much for placing this cache

Bloated Cache and Dash&quot; which we had checked on a few weeks earlier
and believed had gone missing. Upon reaching the location of
&quot;M&amp;M-36&quot; we elected to give it one final quick search before
replacing the cache. Of course the cache was there - about 10ft
from its original location.&lt;br /&gt;

 As we were walking further down the trail we noticed a side trail
we had not seen before. Followed it a bit and, well you know the
rest.&lt;br /&gt;

This cache is in a fairly moist area. You may get wet trying to
find this cache. Terrain rating will vary depending upon the season

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Finishing up my unfound caches in Lower Hillsborough Wilderness Park today (at least until the new ones are published for the event).  Of course I did not go far enough to find the trail to the cache area.  And, of course the cache was on the wrong side of the nicely filled Trout Creek.  Bushwhacked through and past several water hazards to the creek.  Did not want to wade the creek so I found a log crossing.  I crossed over to the cache.  Then I bushwhacked south to &quot;08 Cache&quot; purposely staying off the perimeter firebreak.  The transition area between upland and wetland is very sporadic here.  Not the easiest bushwhack I have ever done.  After finding 08 and another cache I looped around and then  I saw the trail, so I walked down the trail.  My log crossing was just 50 feet or so north of the trail.  TFTH

This one was my 100th M&amp;M find.  Thanks

After logging the FTF there I wandered towards this one.  Along the way I experienced a nice dry hike in the &quot;swamp&quot;.  The way I took into the cache passed an old hunt camp(?).  I have posted a photo.  I came to a fence but soon realized that it was not the correct one so I crossed it and headed to the cache.  After logging I took a cross country route northerly to the next one.  Quite easy in the dry swamp, until I got close and had to bushwhack through the palmettos.  TFTH  </groundspeak:text>

As I approached GZ a large deer bounded away.  I only saw the back half but it looked big.  As it turns out he/she was probably within 20 feet of the cache when I spooked him/her.  Another nice M&amp;M location.  I wonder what will happen during the rainy season.  

I cache without descriptions.  Now having read the description I think the cache may have moved. As I approached I thought it would have been in a nearby feature and a little higher than where I saw it.   It was not secured and definitely wasn't hidden.   I left it as I found it.  Next cacher may want to secure and cover per the cache description request. 

BTW I don't remember seeing a TB in the cache.   TFTH

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Last one today.  Hiked in from Flatwoods park.  Did a bit of bushwacking and crossed a creek (not too shallow). From here hiked out to the North trailhead.  Was going to take the road back (2.75 miles), but got a copy of the trail map from the kiosk.  Looks like there is a trail that connects back to the south trailhead.  So back along the trails.  Unfortuntely the trail is not completed yet, I guess you can't always trust the map.  This time I only had to bushwack about .15 miles, but I had to cross that creek again.  It is not shallow.  The creek is very scenic.  Saw several turkeys.  A very large gobbler took flight about 20 feet ahead of me.  That was a sight, watching him navigate through the trees while watching me.  Great hike.  It will be nicer when they finish the trail and hopefully build a bridge.  Currently there is some flagging and orange paint dots on the trees to indicate the intended route. Total trip over 10 miles.  TFTH </groundspeak:text>

I found another abandoned(?) cache about 380 feet ESE from here.  It was in poor shape.  I could not find a listing for it so I am not sure that it was ever published.  See pic.  TFTH</groundspeak:text>

The actual cache location looks like it may have been brought down
by some sort of gravity storm!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although this spot is convenient to the many shopping and dining
options in Wesley Chapel and New Tampa, it is a nice natural spot
to temporarily get away from it all! Although there may be other
parking options, we parked in a nearby commercial parking lot at
&lt;b&gt;N28 11.258 W082 21.641&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;

with the intention of finding some of the caches that lay beyond
where we placed this. Mimi had to make a flight later that
afternoon. This is the point where we stopped and decided that we
wouldn't be able to proceed and have her make it to the airport on
time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As we were drinking some water and preparing for our return trip we
noticed this metal shack in the brush. You know the rest. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M disclaimers! (plus some
extra disclaimers too!)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1 - Depending on your approach, the last several feet or so may
require some whacking through some brambles. It's not too bad, but
if you don't like brambles, fell free to pass on this cache. You
have been warned. ;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2 - Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of
course you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the
actual cache. Please re-hide the cache securely and conceal it well
so it cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This ended up being the only one for the day as the Green Swamp was living up to its name after all the rain this past week!

As it turned out the final of Peccary Chess was not really that close to the potential crossing so I hiked back to the parking.  Headed out for this one at 4:45 p.m. I stopped along the way to find the other new one, then continued to stage 1.  Found it and the final with out any trouble.  After signing the log I just put the GPS away and headed for the setting sun.  That brought me back to the trail.  I still had time to find 4 more caches before arriving back at the parking lot at sunset.  TFTH</groundspeak:text>

The 3-star terrain is based on the fact that the final few hundred
feet to the cache will involve some bushwacking and the actual
cache location may get a bit damp during the rainy season. (OK -

Since we are coming upon our one-year anniversary living in
beautiful Florida, we decided to celebrate by going back to our
roots and a hiding a cache &quot;Island Style&quot;...&quot;Long Island Style&quot;,
that is! So, if you ever find yourself geocaching on Long Island,
say &quot;Hi!&quot; to our LIGO friends and look for similar
types of hides! :-)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Original cache contents include items such as M&amp;M CDs and a
variety of other goodies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so, of course,
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please be sure to secure and conceal the cache well when you
rehide it so it cannot be seen from the trail...and, of course,
have fun while enjoying the nearby lake views!&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The night before placing this cache we were all out for the
midnight release of the Twilight DVD and the next day was to be a
day of spring cleaning without much chance of caching. This was an
agreement since we had done a full day of caching the week before.
However when we got up others on the team got involved in watching
the Twilight movie that we had gotten the night before. While they
were watching it (I have seen it enough and we now have the DVD) I
say &quot;So do you mind if I go grab a couple caches while you finish
the movie&quot; What you don't think I am going to go start spring
cleaning while they are watching the movie!!! So I now have about
two hours to cache! So where to go! That was an easy choice I
needed to clear two nearby caches off my todo list so I threw the
geobike into the geomobile and headed out with my MP3 player! After
completing the nearby caches I headed back and since I have now
started to carry new cache containers with me I started looking for
a place to put out another cache in the area to help draw more
people out to this area! As I am looking for a good spot what song
comes up on my random rotation on my MP3 player but a song from
Twilight. After having my fill of Twilight the night before I
started to forward to the next song but I looked at the title of
the Twilight song and it was &quot;Eyes on Fire&quot; by Blue Fountain. Since
this weekend has been about Twilight and the fact that in this area
you would need to keep you eyes on the fire if there was one it
would be an appropriate name for a cache. Found a cool spot for the
cache placement that looks like it has been through some fires in
the past and survived. Hopefully this cache will its Eye on Fire in
the future! 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Make sure you check out the other caches that are located off this
two track trail. There are still plenty of spots along the trail
for you to leave a cache too! It makes a nice bike ride or hike.
Make sure you bing plenty of water and CITO while in the area. No
telling what you will find.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

You can reach this one by hiking, biking, or horseback. Enjoy the
scenery and if you are out at the right time you might see some
wildlife while out here. This is located right off the trail and
should be an easy find.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Purchased from the Overstreet Family in May of 2006, this 5067
acre park nestled within the Green Swamp Wilderness Area and named
after one of the tributaries that flows through the property was
opened to the public on January 20, 2007. For over 60 years this
property was managed as a cattle ranch by the Overstreet family.
Past activities on the land also included lime rock mining, timber
harvesting, citrus production and turpentining. Comprised mainly of
Pine Flatwoods, Cypress Domes and open pasture land, this piece of
still pristine wilderness is home to many animal species including
the American Bald Eagle, Sherman’s Fox Squirrel, Gopher
Tortoise, White-Tail Deer, Wild Turkey and Bobcat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park is currently equipped with a lime rock entrance road,
grass parking area, wheel chair accessible restroom, informational
kiosk, picnic pavilion and several picnic tables and grills.
Visitors are invited to fish, picnic, and hike or ride their horses
on over 12 miles of trails and enjoy nature study at its
finest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day Use Entrance Fee: $3.00 per vehicle/up to 8 people and $1.00
per person for individuals who walk or bike in. Florida state parks
are open from 8 a.m. until sundown 365 days a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

Pithlachascotee or &quot;Cotee&quot; River if we ever get an ample rainy
season. Terrain rating will vary accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The trails in the Seranova Tract vary from full shade to open sun.
Please plan accordingly - and bring plenty of water.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M geocaching
disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a &quot;special&quot; multi using the Chirp, and it only works
with certain devices.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Simply go to the posted coordinates, and your GPSr will receive
coordinates for the final stage while walking down the pier. If
your GPSr does receive the coordinates I have found it helpful to
place the GPSr on the pier at the GZ and wait a little bit. You do
not have to leave the pier for the Chirp to kick in. You will be
looking for a hanging container.
&lt;p&gt;If you have trouble, make sure that you have the correct device,
latest firmware (your geocaching icon should be an open treasure
box), make sure that chirp searching is turned on in
Setup&amp;gt;Geocaching, and that the heart rate monitor is turned off.
If you can't enable chirp searching in your Setup&amp;gt;Geocaching
menu, then you don't have the right device/firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, you must use one of the GPSr noted above to receive
coordinates to the final stage while at the posted coordinates.
Physically finding the wireless beacon won't help. It has been
programmed by my GPSr and won't work with another GPSr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchased from the Overstreet Family in May of 2006, this 5067
acre park nestled within the Green Swamp Wilderness Area and named
after one of the tributaries that flows through the property was
opened to the public on January 20, 2007. For over 60 years this
property was managed as a cattle ranch by the Overstreet family.
Past activities on the land also included lime rock mining, timber
harvesting, citrus production and turpentining. Comprised mainly of
Pine Flatwoods, Cypress Domes and open pasture land, this piece of
still pristine wilderness is home to many animal species including
the American Bald Eagle, Sherman’s Fox Squirrel, Gopher
Tortoise, White-Tail Deer, Wild Turkey and Bobcat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park is currently equipped with a lime rock entrance road,
grass parking area, wheel chair accessible restroom, informational
kiosk, picnic pavilion and several picnic tables and grills.
Visitors are invited to fish, picnic, and hike or ride their horses
on over 12 miles of trails and enjoy nature study at its
finest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day Use Entrance Fee: $3.00 per vehicle/up to 8 people and $1.00
per person for individuals who walk or bike in. Florida state parks
are open from 8 a.m. until sundown 365 days a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

before grabbing the cache.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Ever wonder how some trails were created? This little spur trail is
not shown on the park map as it is a one way trail to an old fenced
in pasture. N-Gage tracks used to be along this trail to help bring
in supplies. Some of the old state topography maps show the
location of the tracks.
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a cammoed PB jar with some room for
trades.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Purchased from the Overstreet Family in May of 2006, this 5067
acre park nestled within the Green Swamp Wilderness Area and named
after one of the tributaries that flows through the property was
opened to the public on January 20, 2007. For over 60 years this
property was managed as a cattle ranch by the Overstreet family.
Past activities on the land also included lime rock mining, timber
harvesting, citrus production and turpentining. Comprised mainly of
Pine Flatwoods, Cypress Domes and open pasture land, this piece of
still pristine wilderness is home to many animal species including
the American Bald Eagle, Sherman’s Fox Squirrel, Gopher
Tortoise, White-Tail Deer, Wild Turkey and Bobcat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park is currently equipped with a lime rock entrance road,
grass parking area, wheel chair accessible restroom, informational
kiosk, picnic pavilion and several picnic tables and grills.
Visitors are invited to fish, picnic, and hike or ride their horses
on over 12 miles of trails and enjoy nature study at its
finest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day Use Entrance Fee: $3.00 per vehicle/up to 8 people and $1.00
per person for individuals who walk or bike in. Florida state parks
are open from 8 a.m. until sundown 365 days a year.&lt;/p&gt;

Park. Day Use Entrance Fee: $3.00 per vehicle/up to 8 people and
$2.00 per person for individuals who walk or bike in. Florida state
parks are open from 8 am until sundown 365 days a year.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Florida ranks fifth in the nation for Mineral Commodities. The
industrial mineral production value is around $1.92 billion.
Florida’s minerals are utilized worldwide. Most locals think of
phosphate as one of major minerals mined in Florida, which is,
supplying one-quarter of the world’s phosphate needs. However
another of Florida’s top minerals is Limestone. Florida ranks
second nationally in production and fourth in consumption of
crushed stone (limestone and dolostone). Most of the crushed stone
is used for road construction. Limestone can undergo calcinations
and can be used to manufacture Portland and masonry cement. Florida
ranks in the top five states in production and consumption of
Portland cement and is first in the production and consumption of
masonry cement. 



&lt;p&gt;Early mining in Florida was done by Native Americans. They
quarried the mineral chert from limestone for use in points and
tools. In the 1500's, Spanish settlers and soldiers quarried
coquina limestone near St. Augustine to form building blocks for
their forts and homes. Builders in Florida have used Limestone sine
Spanish times. Limestone is still an important industry in Florida
supplying raw materials for cement and road base.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The land where Colt Creek State Park is located was purchased
from the Overstreet Family in May of 2006, this 5067 acre park
nestled within the Green Swamp Wilderness Area and named after one
of the tributaries that flows through the property was opened to
the public on January 20, 2007. For over 60 years this property was
managed as a cattle ranch by the Overstreet family. Past activities
on the land also included lime rock mining, timber harvesting,
citrus production and turpentining. Comprised mainly of Pine
Flatwoods, Cypress Domes and open pasture land, this piece of still
pristine wilderness is home to many animal species including the
American Bald Eagle, Sherman's Fox Squirrel, Gopher Tortoise,
White-Tail Deer, Wild Turkey and Bobcat. The park is currently

chair accessible restroom, informational kiosk, picnic pavilion and
several picnic tables and grills. Visitors are invited to fish,
picnic, and hike or ride their horses on over 12 miles of trails
and enjoy nature study at its finest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artificial lakes in Colt Creek range for four to 25 acres.
These lakes are an artifact of a limerock mining operation while
the land was still privately owned. While the park was being
prepared to be open to the public the state ran into delays while
laying electrical lines in the ground due to the amount of limerock
in the area. They chose to bury the cable anyway to help keep the
area as natual looking as possible. Limerock can still be seen
through out the park along the trails. As trails were made and fire
breaks created many large limerocks were unsurfaced. Some of the
large ones are used throughout the park as barriers while many of
them are still scattered around. Some of these will be the object
of the requirements for this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To receive credit for this Virtual Cache you
must post the answers to the questions below.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. As you drive in toward Mac Lake you
will drive past the information area. Stop and read the
information. Post one interesting fact about the park that you
were not aware of from the display.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Find a &quot;wild&quot; lime rock while hiking
the trails and post the coordinates with your log.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Measure the &quot;wild&quot; lime rock you found
in #2 and post the estimated size in inches at the widest point visible. This cannot
be a lime rock that has been used by the park rangers for barriers
or roadways.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While you are at Colt Creek make sure you check out the many lakes
in the park as most of them were results of limestone mining. Also
be sure to check out the rest of the park caches for additional
history/information about the park. 
&lt;p&gt;Information gathered regarding Florida mining came from Florida
Department of Environmental Protection and personal knowledge of
being a Florida Native.&lt;/p&gt;

I talked to the ranger and was told that they were up to 60 feet deep. Her husband pointed out a 4 foot alligator in the small pond. He was hidden in the cattails just out of photo range.

I was able to sneak up on a small wild rock near Mac lake. It was about 24inches long at its' longest point. I found it near N28° 17.896 W082° 02.465

Thanks for the cache. I learned a lot about the history of the area.</groundspeak:text>

This was a three stage muti cache whic started on the western side
of the Mac Lake, the largest lake in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.floridastateparks.org/coltcreek/default.cfm&quot;&gt;Colt Creek
State Park.&lt;/a&gt; Due to construction it seem the original Stage One
location has issues. So this is now a two stage multi.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The coordinates for the first stage will take you to a view of a
place that was know by the locals as Dinner Pond. This is where
they the cattle workers ate dinner in the shade after a long day
with the cattle. The coordinates from this stage will take you to
the final location. From the final cache site you will be able to
see Duck Pond.
&lt;p&gt;Purchased from the Overstreet Family in May of 2006, this 5067
acre park nestled within the Green Swamp Wilderness Area and named
after one of the tributaries that flows through the property was
opened to the public on January 20, 2007. For over 60 years this
property was managed as a cattle ranch by the Overstreet family.
Past activities on the land also included lime rock mining, timber
harvesting, citrus production and turpentining. Comprised mainly of
Pine Flatwoods, Cypress Domes and open pasture land, this piece of
still pristine wilderness is home to many animal species including
the American Bald Eagle, Sherman’s Fox Squirrel, Gopher
Tortoise, White-Tail Deer, Wild Turkey and Bobcat. The park is
currently equipped with a lime rock entrance road, grass parking
area, wheel chair accessible restroom, informational kiosk, picnic
pavilion and several picnic tables and grills. Visitors are invited
to fish, picnic, and hike or ride their horses on over 12 miles of
trails and enjoy nature study at its finest.&lt;/p&gt;
Day Use Entrance Fee: $3.00 per vehicle/up to 8 people and $1.00
per person for individuals who walk or bike in. Florida state parks
are open from 8 a.m. until sundown 365 days a year.

Glad we did too - this is a beautiful state park and we enjoyed traversing the many terrains as we made our to each of the cache stages, all of which we found readily.

Thanks for a well-executed multi on which we are proud to claim the FTF!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A popular misconception is that the Coriolis effect determines the
direction in which bathtubs or toilets drain, and that water always
drains in one direction in the Northern Hemisphere, and in the
other direction in the Southern Hemisphere. This myth has perhaps
been perpetuated by the Simpsons episode &quot;Bart Vs. Australia,&quot; in
which protagonist Bart Simpson has a young Australian boy confirm
that his toilet water in the Southern Hemisphere spins in the
opposite direction from Bart's own in the Northern Hemisphere. The
myth is also propagated by the plethora of websites claiming that
this fallacy is true. Strangely, many of these sites claim that
drain water spins clockwise north of the equator, and
counterclockwise south of it, which is reversed from direction of
spin that would result from the Coriolis force, if it were a
determining factor.&lt;br /&gt;

Mimi: &quot;I don't think that looks like the hint&quot;
Marc: &quot;Yeah I know it kind of looks like a (deleted).... Oh, I get it!&quot;

Odd thing is we almost hid a cache in this stand of trees last week - at the time we weren't 100% sure of the status of the preserve and many of the trees in the area have slash marks on them, so we opted against it.  Nice spot.

armadillo ran toward us as it did I looked down and noticed a bunch
of holes in the ground and as the armadillo got to where we were
standing he went straight in one for cover. Hence the name of the
cache!

Creek State Park&lt;/a&gt; - Purchased from the Overstreet Family in May
of 2006, this 5067 acre park nestled within the Green Swamp
Wilderness Area and named after one of the tributaries that flows
through the property was opened to the public on January 20, 2007.
For over 60 years this property was managed as a cattle ranch by
the Overstreet family. Past activities on the land also included
lime rock mining, timber harvesting, citrus production and
turpentining. Comprised mainly of Pine Flatwoods, Cypress Domes and
open pasture land, this piece of still pristine wilderness is home
to many animal species including the American Bald Eagle, Sherman’s
Fox Squirrel, Gopher Tortoise, White-Tail Deer, Wild Turkey and
Bobcat. The park is currently equipped with a lime rock entrance
road, grass parking area, wheel chair accessible restroom,
informational kiosk, picnic pavilion and several picnic tables and
grills. Visitors are invited to fish, picnic, and hike or ride
their horses on over 12 miles of trails and enjoy nature study at
its finest. 
&lt;p&gt;Day Use Entrance Fee: $2.00 per vehicle/up to 8 people and $1.00
per person for individuals who walk or bike in. Florida state parks
are open from 8 a.m. until sundown 365 days a year.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Vultures are scavenging birds, feeding mostly on the carcasses of
dead animals. Vultures are found in every continent except
Antarctica and Oceania.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A particular characteristic of many vultures is a bald head, devoid
of feathers. This is likely because a feathered head would become
spattered with blood and other fluids, and thus be difficult to
keep clean. This feature also allows quick cleaning in a nearby
river.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A group of vultures is occasionally called a venue in literature.
When circling in the air, a group of vultures is called a kettle.
The German word Geier does not have a precise meaning in
ornithology, and is sometimes used to refer to a vulture in
English, as in some poetry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M geocaching
disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it

 Steve Irwin, the hugely popular Australian television personality
and conservationist known as the “Crocodile Hunter,” was killed on
9/4/06 by a stingray while filming off the Great Barrier Reef. He
was 44.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Irwin was famous for his enthusiasm for wildlife and his catchword
“Crikey!” in his television program “Crocodile Hunter.” First
broadcast in Australia in 1992, the program was picked up by the
Discovery network, catapulting Irwin to international celebrity. We
placed this cache in his honor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The area where the cache is hidden is quite moist and may even
become moister at times. Terrain rating will vary accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;

spot by without placing a cache. BYOP
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

Creek State Park&lt;/a&gt; - Purchased from the Overstreet Family in May
of 2006, this 5067 acre park nestled within the Green Swamp
Wilderness Area and named after one of the tributaries that flows
through the property was opened to the public on January 20, 2007.
For over 60 years this property was managed as a cattle ranch by
the Overstreet family. Past activities on the land also included
lime rock mining, timber harvesting, citrus production and
turpentining. Comprised mainly of Pine Flatwoods, Cypress Domes and
open pasture land, this piece of still pristine wilderness is home
to many animal species including the American Bald Eagle, Sherman’s
Fox Squirrel, Gopher Tortoise, White-Tail Deer, Wild Turkey and
Bobcat. The park is currently equipped with a lime rock entrance
road, grass parking area, wheel chair accessible restroom,
informational kiosk, picnic pavilion and several picnic tables and
grills. Visitors are invited to fish, picnic, and hike or ride
their horses on over 12 miles of trails and enjoy nature study at
its finest.&lt;/p&gt;
Day Use Entrance Fee: $2.00 per vehicle/up to 8 people and $1.00
per person for individuals who walk or bike in. Florida state parks
are open from 8 a.m. until sundown 365 days a year. &lt;br /&gt;

We actually saw a number of creatures out there today.   After a slight scare when we almost stepped on a rather large (albeit dead) snake, we saw a number of killdeer birds, a heron, our gator friend, grasshoppers-in-love and an armadillo.  ....and of course numerous horses with their people!

&lt;b&gt;Precautions:&lt;/b&gt; Hiking is allowed but not recommended during
general gun hunting season (generally mid-November to mid-January).
Caution is advised during archery, small game, and spring turkey
seasons. Hikers should be aware of hunting dates. &lt;b&gt;The hunt dates
for the Green Swamp for 2007-2008 are located here.&lt;/b&gt;
Hikers must wear 500 square inches of orange clothing above the
waist during hunting seasons. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 A fairly romantic version of the legend as told by Rufus Joseph
Tillman.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 A Spanish soldier fell in love at first sight with an Indian
chief's favorite daughter. Though the chieftain forbade the couple
to see each other, the Spaniard was too lovestruck to stop meeting
the maiden in secret. The father found them out and ordered his
braves to tie the Spaniard high up in the top of an ancient oak
tree. The Spaniard had only to disavow his love to be freed, but he
steadfastly refused. Guards were posted to keep anyone -- the
chief's daughter above all -- from giving food or water to the poor
Spaniard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The Spaniard grew weaker and weaker, but he still would not
renounce his love for the girl. Near the end, the Chief tried to
persuade him once more to stay away from his daughter. The Spaniard
answered that not only would he refuse to disavow his love, but
that his love would continue to grow even after death. When at last
the Spaniard died, the chief kept the body tied up in the tree as a
warning to any other would-be suitors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before long, the Indians began to notice that the Spaniard's beard
continued to grow. The Indian maiden refused ever to take a husband
-- unless the Spaniard's beard died and vanished from the tree. As
the years went by, the beard only grew stronger and longer,
covering trees far from the Indian maiden's village. Legend says
that when the Spanish Moss is gone, the Spaniard's love will have
finally died with it.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Precautions:&lt;/b&gt; Hiking is allowed but not recommended during
general gun hunting season (generally mid-November to mid-January).
Caution is advised during archery, small game, and spring turkey
seasons. Hikers should be aware of hunting dates. &lt;b&gt;The hunt dates
for the Green Swamp for 2007-2008 are located here.&lt;/b&gt;
Hikers must wear 500 square inches of orange clothing above the
waist during hunting seasons. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

encountered a large (10-12ft) gator meandering down the trail

was a monstrous female character whose hair was made of snakes and
whose gaze could turn people to stone. Although this tree's
branches are not made of snakes, they do bare a resemblance to
Medusa's wild hair. ...And although we were not turned to stone as
we gazed upon Medusa Tree, there is a suspicious pile of stone
right nearby...some former geocacher perhaps?!?&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

plenty of water!&lt;br /&gt;

Original contents of cache include such items as M&amp;M CD's 1-3,
a M&amp;M micro container, a rubbermaid cache container, a few
kiddie toys, a log book w/pencils and more!&lt;br /&gt;

Tiger Cubs do stuff - lots of stuff - with their adult partners. This program is intended to open up the world to inquisitive minds along with the caring guidance of adults. The first steps along the Boy Scout Trail are laid here and every rank advancement through the scouting program builds on the basic categories of activity done as tigers. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">While exploring the area, couldn’t help but go back in time
to our childhood in the 1970s when 
&lt;i&gt;The Magic Garden&lt;/i&gt; was on WPIX in NY! As children of the
early ‘70s living in the metro-NY area, we often welcomed
Paula, Carol and Sherlock into our homes and in some weird way,
this garden brought back memories of that flower-childesque show
…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Crews Lake Wilderness Park is a Pasco County Park with the
following facilities:&lt;br /&gt;
Bike Trail&lt;br /&gt;
Boat Ramp &amp; Canoe Access&lt;br /&gt;
Boardwalk&lt;br /&gt;
Tent Camping&lt;br /&gt;
Fishing Pier &amp; Access&lt;br /&gt;
Nature &amp; Interpretive Trails&lt;br /&gt;
Picnic Area &amp; Shelters&lt;br /&gt;
Playground, Rest Rooms and Volleyball.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The park is open from Dawn to Dusk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above coordinates will bring you to the gardens in the park.
Once you find the gazebo, answer the following questions to get the
coordinates for the &lt;b&gt;final&lt;/b&gt; stage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. How many supports are holding up the gazebo? Subtract 7 from
that number to get A.&lt;br /&gt;
2. How many benches are there in the gazebo? Add 88 to that number
to get CD.&lt;br /&gt;
Substitute your answer for the letters to get the coordinates to
the &lt;b&gt;final stage&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;N 28º 22.4A5&lt;br /&gt;
W 082º 32.0CD&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: MM10YJ9 - M&amp;M-108 Final&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Answers to the puzzle:

1. 8 supports holding up the gazebo; 8-7=1; A=1
2. 2 benches in the gazebo; 88+2=90; CD = 90

Final Coordinates = N 28 22.415

On the way back it seemed like we passed every other cacher from the event.  And WWWilma spotted something that may have been a bobcat in the forest.  TFTC!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found stage one with a little help from the gazebo. We were trying to knock off the Crews Lake park caches today. As we were nearing stage two we spotted a family about 25 yards in front of us on the trail. I could hear the dad tell his kids that they were the first people ever to use this trail. I chuckled to myself, waited for them to leave and found Stage 2. I thought they were geocachers, but when I got to the log, I saw that no one had signed it today. I tried to find the adventurous family on the way out to explain what geocaching was, but I couldn't find them so on we went.  Thanks for the hide!</groundspeak:text>

He receives a Bear Scout handbook and Bear neckerchief, but continues to use the Wolf neckerchief slide when beginning the Bear portion of the boy scout trail. He will continue to use the blue Cub Scout Uniform. This part of the boy scout trail is intended to take one school year, preparing the scout to begin earning his Webelos rank after he completes third grade.</groundspeak:long_description>

JG&amp;B and FSUDad, figured we would join the party.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is located down a &quot;rustic&quot; trail. There is &lt;u&gt;no need&lt;/u&gt; to
do any heavy bushwacking to reach this cache, not that we are going
to stop you. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Original cache contents include a variety of trinkets as well as a
log sheet!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And now for the standard M&amp;M disclamers:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Richloam Hunt Dates 2007-08&lt;/b&gt; ARCHERY: September 22
through October 21. GENERAL GUN: November 10 through January 6.
TRAPPING: January 7 through March 1. SPRING TURKEY: March 15
through April 20.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

slydogfl and young Cricket Hunter painting orange blazes and mowing
and clearing trails, thinking that this was our good deed of the
day. But, as it turns out, there was another reason that we were
wandering about the woods...to meet up with a poor, lost hunting
dog who looked like she was on the verge of starvation while we
were hanging out, eating a picnic lunch. So we shared our lunch
with this sweetheart of a canine, contacted her owner (fortunately
she was wearing a tag) and, with the help of everybody involved,
coordinated the joyous reunion between a dog and her humans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So in honor of this feel-good occasion, we place this cache. Hope
you experience similarly good karma while searching! Have fun!

Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so, of course,
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please be sure to conceal the cache well when you rehide it
and have fun! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Lock 'N Lock container properly by pressing down
on all sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not
stay dry.&lt;/b&gt;

The hike to this last one didn't seem nearly as hard as I thought it would be, as if something was pushing me along.  Grabbed the Delorme coin and the Blue Man TB.   I'm leaving the Punch Buggy TB here along with a Maryland CAM 2011 pathtag.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Dusk was falling and the woods were pretty noisy.  Somewhere off the in the woods a rowdy group was making quite a racket having fun with horsepower and mud.  I managed to sneak in, find the cache and return to my car without seeing a soul though.  The log was pretty wet, so I signed gently and left a spare log in a fresh bag just in case.  I dropped in a Dutch TB, [url=http://coord.info/TB2A33E]der waterpas[/url].  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

I checked within a 50ft radius for anything like the description and all I found was the thoroughly dismantled, and empty, geopile.  It was too hot to delay, so I moved on.</groundspeak:text>

this is one of five caches hidden in honor of our favorite alien,

I was about 250 feet from the cache when I stepped over a log and came down less than 15 feet from a Ruffed Grouse and her clutch.  She spooked me silly spreading her wings and screeching as she ran away.  Most of her chicks followed her, or tried to, she was fast.  I had to take five to get my breath back.  I had never seen one up close like that, what a beautiful bird.  I could hear her calling her chicks as I made the find.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Even sinners do that. 34 And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. 35 But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. 36 Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.

&lt;br /&gt;
Well...it would be a great way to get to some of those
out-of-the-way caches? ;)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M geocaching
disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;

One thing that may help others reading this. If you have troubles reading the Bible. Start with Luke. Then move on to Acts, followed by 1st and 2nd Corintians, and then the rest of Pauls letters. It helps put things into perspective. Cache On!!</groundspeak:text>

For those good gentle folk whose heart goes all a twitter every time a new film can is hidden in a 500 acre, sweltering, exhaust laden Wally World parking lot bristling with SUVs driven by soccer moms, I offer my humblest apologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those kind souls who believe slapping a hide-a-key on an uninspired section of guard rail, every 529' and copy/pasting the cache description over and over so they don't need to engage their brain cells, is the quintessential essence of caching, I hope you can forgive me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cache might not be your cup of Earl Grey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for the rest of you kooks, (&quot;Kook&quot; being defined as anyone insane enough to actually enjoy slugging their way through miles of swamp, dodging wild hogs, alligators and venomous snakes, just to look for a metal box full of Dollar Store trinkets), come on down! You'll have a blast!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this beautiful day, several representatives from the Florida Geocaching Association http://www.floridacaching.com/ descended on this patch of woods, hiding gobs of caches for others to find. I was supposed to be out there with them, but Life intervened. The hiders took pity on me, knowing how much I love the swamps, and placed this cache for me, sending me the coords so I could type it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanx guys and gals! You're the kewlest!&lt;/p&gt;

After finding Dale&amp;Barb's &quot;It's a Climb&quot;, we somehow found a muddy passageway to an even swampier site.  After some splish-splashing around, we spotted the Riffster ammo can and made the retrieval.  

Thanks to all those who made this fun caching adventure possible!  ...and thanks for giving one of us a really good excuse to walk around barefoot at the evening festivities!  [:D]

Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;

Dr. Charles Simpson started his practice in 2004 and had such a demand for natural healthcare he decided to open a second practice which is located at 8484 SW 103rd Street Road. This geocache is hidden in between the parking lot of Downtown Chiropractic &amp; the strip plaza with Bills Barber Shop in it. This is a vacant piece of land that belongs to Dr. Simpson. It has been approved by Dr. Simpson and is hidden within this vacant piece of land somewhere and its up to you to find it! GPS Coordinates are as acurate as I could possibly get them. Parking is available in the parking lot which belongs to our office. Our container is a tupperware container and inside you will find some goodies that are available for trading. Also, there is a logbook so bring a pen and happy hunting! :)   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**GPS Coordinates are Accurate as: N 29° 04.286 W -82° 15.621 with address of 8484 SW 103rd Street Road Ocala, FL 34481. ** </groundspeak:long_description>

Great cache to visit if you’re into history.   &lt;br /&gt; From what has been recovered at this site, it appears that the area was used throughout the prehistoric period up to 10,000 years ago.  Some artifacts have been found dating back to the Paleo-Indian period.  The Paleo-Indians were nomadic people who moved around hunting the late Pleistocene mammals such as the bison, camel, deer, and elephants.  When the climate became drier and many large mammals became extinct, pre-historic man changed his lifestyle, resulting in the Archaic culture.  The Archaic people were hunters and gatherers who utilized the resources of their environment as they became plentiful according to the seasons. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Those people would travel throughout the region feeding on nuts, acorns, deer, fish, shellfish and migratory birds as these diverse foods reached their yearly peaks of abundance.  Although the majority of the stone tools found at this site are from the Archaic period, some Paleo-Indian artifacts have also been reported.  In addition, the presence of pottery at this site indicates that later people also lived here. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The development of pottery is indicative of a more sedentary way of life and marks the end of the Archaic period.  Most of what has been found at this site includes stone tools as well as scrapers and cutting tools used to make those tools.  In addition to living here, there is evidence that prehistoric people were also manufacturing tools in this area.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This site seems to be a very rich site with artifacts representative of many different time periods.  It is a significant find in the State.  Before posting your find, please e-mail a message to me describing the trail going to this cache as well as what you saw.  DO NOT be tempted to do any artifact hunting of your own - you will be arrested!

&lt;br /&gt;
Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (August 8, 1896 – December 14, 1953) was an American author who lived in rural Florida and wrote novels with rural themes and settings. Her first novel, &lt;em&gt;South Moon Under&lt;/em&gt;, was published in 1933 and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Marjorie Kinnan was born in 1896 in Washington, D.C., to Arthur Frank Kinnan, an attorney for the US Patent Office, and Ida May Traphagen Kinnan. She grew up in the Brookland neighborhood and was interested in writing as early as age six, and submitted stories to the children's sections of newspapers until she was 16. At age 15, she entered into a contest a story titled &quot;The Reincarnation of Miss Hetty,&quot; for which she won a prize.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
She attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison where she joined Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and received a degree in English in 1918. She was selected as a member of the local senior women's honor society on campus that, in 1920, became a chapter of the national senior women's society, Mortar Board. She met Charles Rawlings while working for the school literary magazine. Kinnan briefly worked for the YWCA editorial board in New York, and married Charles in 1919. The couple moved to Louisville, Kentucky writing for the &lt;em&gt;Louisville Courier-Journal&lt;/em&gt; and then Rochester, New York both writing for the &lt;em&gt;Rochester Journal&lt;/em&gt;, and Marjorie writing a syndicated column called &quot;Songs of the Housewife.”&lt;br /&gt;
In 1928, with a small inheritance from her mother, the Rawlingses purchased a 72 acre (290,000 m²) orange grove near Hawthorne, Florida, in a hamlet named Cross Creek for its location between Orange Lake and Lochloosa Lake. She brought the place to international fame through her writing. She was fascinated with the remote wilderness and the lives of Cross Creek residents, her &quot;Florida cracker&quot; neighbors, and felt a profound and transforming connection to the region and the land. Wary at first, the local residents soon warmed to her and opened up their lives and experiences to her. Marjorie filled several notebooks with descriptions of the animals, plants, Southern dialect, and recipes and used these descriptions in her writings.</groundspeak:long_description>

Rawlings found immense success in 1938 with &lt;em&gt;The Yearling&lt;/em&gt;, a story about a Florida boy and his pet deer and his relationship with his father, which she originally intended as a story for young readers. It was selected for the Book-of-the-Month Club, and it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1939.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
One of her least well received books, &lt;em&gt;Golden Apples&lt;/em&gt;, came out in 1935. It tells the stories of several people who suffer from unrequited love from people unsuited for them. Rawlings herself was disappointed in it, and in a 1935 letter to her publisher Max Perkins, she called it &quot;interesting trash instead of literature.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (August 8, 1896 – December 14, 1953) was an American author who lived in rural Florida and wrote novels with rural themes and settings.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Rawlings' final novel, &lt;em&gt;The Sojourner&lt;/em&gt;, published in 1953 and set in a northern setting, was about the life of a man and his relationship to his family: a difficult mother who favors her other, first-born son and his relationship to this absent older brother. In order to absorb the natural setting so vital to her writing, she bought an old farmhouse in Van Hornesville, New York and spent part of each year there until her death. The novel was less well received critically than her Florida writings, and did little to enhance her literary reputation.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Marjorie Kinnan was born in 1896 in Washington, D.C., to Arthur Frank Kinnan, an attorney for the US Patent Office, and Ida May Traphagen Kinnan. She grew up in the Brookland neighborhood and was interested in writing as early as age six, and submitted stories to the children's sections of newspapers until she was 16. At age 15, she entered into a contest a story titled &quot;The Reincarnation of Miss Hetty,&quot; for which she won a prize.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
She attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison where she joined Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and received a degree in English in 1918. She was selected as a member of the local senior women's honor society on campus that, in 1920, became a chapter of the national senior women's society, Mortar Board. She met Charles Rawlings while working for the school literary magazine. Kinnan briefly worked for the YWCA editorial board in New York, and married Charles in 1919. The couple moved to Louisville, Kentucky writing for the &lt;em&gt;Louisville Courier-Journal&lt;/em&gt; and then Rochester, New York both writing for the &lt;em&gt;Rochester Journal&lt;/em&gt;, and Marjorie writing a syndicated column called &quot;Songs of the Housewife.”&lt;br /&gt;
In 1928, with a small inheritance from her mother, the Rawlingses purchased a 72 acre (290,000 m²) orange grove near Hawthorne, Florida, in a hamlet named Cross Creek for its location between Orange Lake and Lochloosa Lake. She brought the place to international fame through her writing. She was fascinated with the remote wilderness and the lives of Cross Creek residents, her &quot;Florida cracker&quot; neighbors, and felt a profound and transforming connection to the region and the land. Wary at first, the local residents soon warmed to her and opened up their lives and experiences to her. Marjorie filled several notebooks with descriptions of the animals, plants, Southern dialect, and recipes and used these descriptions in her writings.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have placed this series of caches to honor a great American author Majorie Kinnan Rawlings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (August 8, 1896 – December 14, 1953) was an American author who lived in rural Florida and wrote novels with rural themes and settings.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Secret River&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a children's fantasy book by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, author of the &lt;em&gt;The Yearling&lt;/em&gt;. Published in 1955, &lt;em&gt;The Secret River&lt;/em&gt; received a Newbery Honor Award. The first edition, illustrated by Caldecott Medal winner Leonard Weisgard, was issued after Rawlings' death. The book was revised and reissued in 2009 with illustrations by Caldecott Medalists Leo and Diane Dillon. The new edition received an international children's book design award in 2012. &lt;em&gt;The Secret River&lt;/em&gt; is the only book Rawlings wrote specifically for children. The story of young Calpurnia, who goes on a quest to find a magical river and catch fish for her starving family and friends, it has two themes common in Rawlings' writing, the magic of childhood and the struggle of people to survive in a harsh environment.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Marjorie Kinnan was born in 1896 in Washington, D.C., to Arthur Frank Kinnan, an attorney for the US Patent Office, and Ida May Traphagen Kinnan.

You will have to hike out to the Observation Platform, about a 3 mile hike from the parking trailhead to the platform. 3 Mile round trip. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a beautiful hike, if you do this in the morning or late evening you may get to see deer, LOTS of deer! My son and I saw 23 one morning doing this hike! The path is well marked and there is a small nominal fee for parking at the state park ($5 or $6). But well worth it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are a disabled vet, the State of Florida offers free lifetime passes for your family to all State Parks! Just a note for our vets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walk out to the observation platform and tell me how many steps you have to walk up to get to the top. Count the bottom and top step (the platfrom counts as 1). Whats the number?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking is located along US 441, just south of the prairie crossing, on the east side of 441.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is a link to the hike via Garmin Connect. You can even download it to follow if you like!&lt;br/&gt;http://connect.garmin.com/activity/76764185#.Tt5tUEnVMtI.email&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>

Then a few months ago they came along and paved it very nicely. Then landscaped and planted trees along it. It looks more like a driveway than a roadway. While driving down this road make sure to look at the 1 and only home along this road, its beautiful, one of the nicest in the county! Anyway back to the cache. Its a small camo bison tube. Room only for a log, bring your own pencil or pen!! Its placed in a spot that will require to look a bit. Thats part of the fun is where this one is hidden. Nice safe place to pull off the road is within feet. Good luck!! Please do not detach the top from where it is, this will help keep this one from walking away like the last one here. You can unscrew and get to the log without detaching the top of the tube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 2 more caches along this road you may want to consider trying to grab. </groundspeak:long_description>

Looks like a fancy driveway more than a road. But once they paved it, I thought it had too have a few caches along it, to nice a road not to. The cache is a full sized ammo can, hidden in a good spot that you can park along the road and get to within just a few feet of parking.  A great place for TB's. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please place this one back EXACTLY WHERE you found it. That spot I can see on my way home from work by just pulling off the road and looking so I can check on it daily. Its a good spot and you may have to look for a few seconds to find it. Have fun!!  </groundspeak:long_description>

This road was a dirt road and used to be in bad shape, then they paved it a few months ago and have landscaped it and planted some nice trees. It looks like a really nice driveway to someones home. After they paved this and did all this work, I thought this road needed a few small caches along it. Don't forget to try the other two along this road!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a very well camoed Decon container. Cache has room for a log and small items. Cache used to be a micro Bison tube. But this container is much more fun. :) Please place back right where you found it as I can see it on the way home each day to make sure it placed OK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't forget to stop by the others along the short stretch of this road!!  </groundspeak:long_description>

I parked close ground zero and searched location for several minutes and finally made the find. I love cemetery caches no one thinks twice about someone wandering around the area.

Thanks for the cache and the smiley.

The cache sits just outside the Institute of Public Safety Grounds (on public right of way). The Santa Fe College, Institute of Public Safety is just on the other side of the fence. You are very near the center that trains your Paramedics, Police Officers, Deputies, and Corrections Officers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; You may even hear them out on the firearms range, thats the big mounds of dirt south of your position across the pond. The Institute sits on 164 acres and has a Driving Pad, Physical Abilities Course, 3 Firearms Ranges, and is a campus of Santa Fe College. If you drive through our parking lot to take a look at the institute, there is a LARGE Travel Bug in the parking lot near the west end of the main building. All I can say is its Silver in color and the TB # is on the rear drivers side window. Oh and the TB is very patriotic and military!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be safe and no worries, your not being watched, much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a standard ammo can (we use about 250,000 rounds of ammo a year here!) with lots of good swag, and a few travel bugs to start out with. And some very cool collectable &quot;challenge&quot; coins. Also some US Army stuff and flag pins to boot! There are also a few small childs toys for the kids! Please make sure to sign the log and observe the T1L1 rule. And make sure to camo as found, don't want this cache to go walking off! :) Its placed on the public side of the fence, no need to climb it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You do not have to do any bushwacking, just be careful pulling off the road and stopping!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF goes to Paulzoo!!!! Good Job and thanks for stopping by!</groundspeak:long_description>

Although you will find none of those animals near this cache.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located just outside of the Gainesville Regional Airport (GNV) and a easy park and grab on public right of way. A very wide and safe shoulder to pull off onto to park for it and less than 25 or so feet from the road. No need to cross fences or other problems. The cache is a camo painted large plastic Coffee Container with a heavy duty ziplock bag to contain all the contents and keep them dry. Lots of room in this one for travel bugs. So on your way out or on your way in, stop by and trade, move or just get another cache added to your list! </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">While out looking for a place to place the largest ammo can in the south east, I decided this part of the San Felasco Park needed a small cache to hold it over until I could get the &quot;big one&quot; out there. The cache is on a well marked and traveled trail in the park. Its hidden no more than 2 feet off the path and you can reach the cache without haveing to step off the path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container is a cammoed egg. thats right a cammoed Egg! Its to funny you have to see it to believe it. It has a few small items and a log in a small plastic bag in it. Please place back right where you found it so the next person can enjoy the surprise of seeing this where it is. Who would believe an egg in this spot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As per Florida State Park rules all caches must be registered with the Rangers, and he laughed at me! He is a freind of mine and he thought this was too funny. Anyway its safe for kids and they will love finding this one.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Near this spot stands Chennault Plantation. On the night of
5/24/1865, two wagon trains filled with gold containing the last of
the Confederate treasury were robbed at Chennault Crossroads in
Lincoln County.
&lt;p&gt;The geocache is hidden near a granite marker bearing the names
of the families that settled the surrounding area. Look and you
will find the geocache. Look harder and you may just find the lost
Confederate Gold!&lt;/p&gt;
&amp;lt; &lt;br /&gt; Chennault, GA, is located at the crossroads of GA 44 and GA 79 and it is here that part of the Confederate Civil War treasure had been
lost when it traveled by wagon to Georgia with Confederate
president Jefferson Davis in the last days of the Civil War. The
treasure train left Danville, Virginia, on April 6, 1865, with
$327,022 in gold and silver coins, as well as bullion, donated
jewelry, and even floor sweepings from the Dahlonega mint. Some
$450,000 in coins and specie checks (paper money that could be
redeemed for metallic coins) that originated with Richmond banks
also traveled with the fleeing Confederate government. Almost all
the Confederate assets was dispersed, to pay soldiers returning
home, before the capture of Davis on May 10, 1865, near Irwinville.
The remaining funds from the Richmond banks were left in
Washington, Georgia. A detachment of Union soldiers set out to
divert this specie to a railhead in South Carolina. The wagons
stopped for the night at the Chennault Plantation and it was here
that on May 24, 1865, bandits attacked the wagons and $251,029 was
lost. Bank officials eventually recovered some $111,000 of the
stolen money. Union general Edward A. Wild led a search of the area
for more gold and earned notoriety for the arrest and torture of
the Chennault family, who Wild believed were hiding gold but who
turned out to be innocent. As a consequence, Union general Ulysses
S. Grant removed Wild from his command.&lt;br /&gt;

During the summer months, you can find festivals throughout the park and entertainment at the amphitheater. Bring a picnic lunch and enjoy the games or walk the paved pathways. or you might just want to enjoy your lunch at the cache location while you are figuring out where it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: Unfortunately this park isn't pet friendly.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is special to our family because it was the first cache we had ever found. It is the one that got us started on our geocaching journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hidden on 5/15/2004, had 28 finds, and then went missing. The cache was archived by the reviewer on 3/9/2005. The original cacher(s) who placed the cache were geocaching members since 2003 and according to their profile page, the last time they logged on was January the 6th, 2005. So tomorrow being six years since the original cache owners even thought about geocaching, I want to place a cache back at this location remembering our first geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located in a park with paved walkways. You can use the walkways to get to the back of the park then hit the trail for a couple hundred feet. You are looking for a unique natural feature about 60 feet high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache container is a small locking plastic container clearly marked and hidden with a logbook, stash note, and a few trinkets for trading.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Park at the nearest parking spot near the tunnel (south side of the tunnel).  From the parking spot, it's pretty much right below it.  It's located roughly 20ft from parking spot.  The bank is fairly steep, so be extremely careful.  You can see some rocks (about the size of a book bag) right below the parking spot.  There will be bark laying around &amp; up a tree (looks like it's ready to fall off). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As of when it was first hidden on 6/21/2012, the bark is in a &quot;V&quot; shape and I realize that it may change due to weather conditions and/or other people not placing it back in a &quot;V&quot; shape, however I do ask that you please cover it back up w/bark. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a dry bag inside w/a sheet of paper to write on (name/date ect..).  There is enough room inside to place small objects to trade.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>It's quite white under the bark</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thought I would have a few caches devoted to my first date with my
main squeeze, MaeAsh. After chatting on a dating site for a week we
decided to meet face to face over dinner and a movie. After dinner we went to the movie theater at the above
coordinates. The movie was called The Haunting in Connecticut. The
cache can be found using the clues below referring to the movie and
the state.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is hidden at:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
N35° 29.ABC'&lt;br /&gt;
W82° 33.DEF'&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

D=# of &quot;u&quot;s in the name of river that bisects the state&lt;br /&gt;
E=# of &quot;t&quot;s in state bordering to the north&lt;br /&gt;
F=3rd # in year movie was released&lt;br /&gt;

CHECKSUM: A B C D E F=XY X Y=4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a small lock-n-lock less than a half mile from
theater.

The location has been the site of paranormal activity for quite a while including footsteps, voices, apparitions, and an elevator that operated by itself.  People still report hearing screams and seeing a man dressed all in black who walks into the front door of the tavern and vanishes. Asheville's old gallows used to be nearby. Many people claim the man in black is the ghost of the towns executioner from the late 1800's. You're looking for a round brown metal container. Bring your own pen.

In the 4th century, Basilicas began to be used as places of worship. It was during this time that construction of the greatest Basilicas of Rome was started. Today, the term Basilica is a special designation given by the Holy Father to certain churches because of their antiquity, dignity, historical importance or significance as a place of worship.&lt;br /&gt;Presently, there are 56 Basilicas in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;The Basilica of St. Lawrence was completed in 1909 and designed by Raphael Guastavino (1842-1908).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coordinates above will take you near the South entrance of the church. From this sidewalk you should be able to solve the following to get to the cache. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A=first # in church address&lt;br /&gt;B=# of animals in stone carving over door&lt;br /&gt;C=# of number of people not kneeling in stone carving over door&lt;br /&gt;D=last hour of day for confessions on Saturday&lt;br /&gt;E=# of books in stone  carving over door &lt;br /&gt;F=# of mountain tops MINUS # of keys on shield on Basilica sign&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is stashed at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;N35° 35.ABC'&lt;br /&gt;W82° 33.DEF'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHECKSUM: A B C D E F=XY  X Y=3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BYOP.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Most likely you haven't read his novels or short stories in length, but if you've been in Asheville more than an hour, you've probably seen his name: THOMAS WOLFE. He is considered by some to be one of the greatest American authors. In a nutshell, Wolfe's first novel, &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot; was based on his experiences and people in his life in Asheville. Although he used altered names, the characters and events were transparent enough for many citizens to recognize themselves, and not in a good light. Asheville was outraged. The threats became so bad towards Wolfe, he chose to leave town for several years. Eventually after so much notoriety and fame came to the man and his writings, the town's attitude changed and embraced him and his work. He is now considered Asheville's Favorite Son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The listed coordinates are of course NOT the cache location, but the first stop you'll make. To find the cache you will have to make other stops at various locations that are devoted to the man and his life to solve clues for the final coordinates which are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   N35° 3A.BC1'&lt;br /&gt;   W82° 3D.EF0'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And remember to take time to explore and enjoy the places you visit as well as check out the other great caches at and in between the stops. Also, please show respect to the locations and do not disregard any times that are posted that locations may be closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Stop 1)  N35° 35.956'   W82° 32.951'&lt;br /&gt;On October 3, 1900, Thomas, the youngest of eight, was born at his family's home on Woodfin Street. The house is no longer present but a plaque marks the actual location of the house built by his father, W. O. Wolfe, in which Thomas was born.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A  = # of steps up to the plaque MINUS the number of &quot;E&quot;s on the 2nd line on the plaque&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Stop 2)  N35° 35.864'   W82° 33.039'&lt;br /&gt;When Thomas was 6, his mother, Julia Westall Wolfe, purchased a 29 room boarding house she named &quot;Old Kentucky Home&quot;.   She and Thomas, moved into the house while his father and the other siblings stayed at the Woodfin house.  The boarding house, called &quot;Dixieland&quot; in &quot;Look Homeward, Angel,&quot; is now a Historic Landmark. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B  = sum of last 2 numbers in year at bottom of Historic Landmark plaque&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceed to the South side of house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C  = 2nd number MINUS 1st number in the year the children's playhouse was moved from the old house to this house&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Its not required, but please visit the museum across from the back side of the house if you have time. It covers the author's life in great detail. Its very interesting, educational and free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Stop 3)  N35° 35.694'  W 82° 33.074'&lt;br /&gt;Two of his biggest novels were &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot; and &quot;You Can't Go Home Again&quot; published in 1940 after his death(The latter being a loosely autobiographical description of his life during the release of the earlier book). In the middle of downtown Asheville is a statue dedicated to the author.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;D  =  last number in the year the statue was carved&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Stop 4)  N35° 35.828'  W 82° 33.346'&lt;br /&gt;The Thomas Wolfe Auditorium, was built in the 1930s and opened as the Asheville Civic Auditorium in January 1940. In the early 1970s the arena was built and the Civic Auditorium was remodeled and rechristened as the Thomas Wolfe Auditorium.

&lt;p&gt;You will be hiking CNF trail 37. It starts out moderate but
there are two spots where you have to go up and over some flat damp
rocks. At times the trail is narrow with a sharp drop off to the
left and into the stream. It is not dangerous but you need to watch
your step. We love kids, especially our grandkids, but I would not
take a child under five up this trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the falls, there is a fallen tree which blocks the trail.
Just before the double blue blaze, go right and up and around the
tree and then back left to the trail. You are about there. The
cache is a camo painted ammo box. You shouldn't see a lot of people
here but use stealth and replace exactly as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We try to make all of our caches &quot;kid friendly&quot; and please don't
feel that this hike is overly difficult but is too tricky for
toddlers. Marge and I hiked this trail several years ago and forgot
where it was. We took a lot of pictures then and with a little
internet detective work we found it and want to share it with
you.&lt;/p&gt;

Much of the trail is an old Rail Bed where East Tennessee and Western North Carolina cut through the mountain tops and spanned the gorges with trestles to set up a narrow gauge railroad to haul processed iron smelted from magnetite ore found in Cranberry, NC for distribution out of Johnson City, TN.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Jonesborough was founded in 1779, 17 years before Tennessee became a state. It was named after North Carolina legislator, Willie Jones, who supported North Carolina's westward expansion over the Appalachian Mountains.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The town was originally a part of North Carolina. In 1784, Jonesborough was one of the towns that attempted to create a new state called the State of Franklin, named after American founding father Benjamin Franklin. The State of Franklin, however, was never recognized by Congress, and was re-claimed by North Carolina by 1788.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Jonesborough is often considered to be the center of the abolitionist movement within the states that would join the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Elihu Embree printed his publication, The Emancipator, from the town of Jonesborough. Circulation began in 1820, making The Emancipator the first American periodical to be dedicated exclusively to the issue of the abolition of slavery. While Tennessee would later join the Confederacy, most East Tennesseans had Union leanings.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In the 1840s, Jonesborough was home to the Jonesborough Whig, a polemical newspaper published by William G. &quot;Parson&quot; Brownlow. Brownlow and rival editor Landon Carter Haynes brawled in the streets of Jonesborough in May 1840, and over the next several years bashed one another in their respective papers, each managing at times to thwart one another's political ambitions. Haynes left the newspaper business in 1845, and Brownlow (who later served as governor) moved the Whig to Knoxville in 1849.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Today, Jonesborough draws a good deal of tourism because of its historical status as Tennessee's oldest town and its significant historic preservation efforts. The town's museum describes local heritage of tobacco farming. The historic Chester Inn, built in 1797, still stands in downtown Jonesborough. The Jonesborough Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A local legend holds that the ghost of Andrew Jackson occasionally appears in the vicinity of a cabin in a town park. In 1788, future U.S. president Jackson spent several months in Jonesborough awaiting a caravan. During this time, he lodged in this cabin, which belonged to Major Christopher Taylor and was then located about a mile outside of town. In 1974, this cabin was removed from its original spot and reconstructed in the town's park. The ghost supposedly walks up to the front door and disappears into the building. The ghost has also been reportedly seen walking down the street, in the direction of the old courthouse. Jonesborough is also the home to the International Storytelling Center, which holds the annual National Storytelling Festival on the first full weekend in October. The Festival builds on the Appalachian cultural tradition of storytelling and has been drawing people from around the world for more than 35 years to both tell and listen. Large tents are pitched in parks around town and storytellers sit on stages or at the head of the tent to perform. Occasionally performances are interrupted for a moment by a passing Norfolk Southern Railway train. Past storytellers include Carmen Agra Deedy, Syd Lieberman, and Kathryn Tucker Windham. The festival influenced the development of a successful storytelling graduate degree program at the nearby East Tennessee State University.&lt;br/&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonesborough,_Tennessee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This time capsule was placed here at the Jonesborough visitors center by the town of Jonesborough, Tennessee on July 4, 1979 on the towns 200th annivesary, to be opened on July 4, 2079. It reads : Historic Jonesboro Time Capsule, buried here July 4, 1979 on the two hundredth annivesery of Jonesboro, Tennessee 1779 - 1979 To be opened on July 4, 2079. It is located at the sidewalk near the front of the visitors center, the coordinates are within 7 feet or less average of 100 readings, and just a few yards from the Veterans Memorial and the visitors center/museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMA7RG_Historic_Time_Capsule_Jonesborough_Tennessee  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The engine was known as the &quot;Cougar&quot; and ran within the old North
American Rayon facilities. It is unique because it is a steam
engine but had no fire box. Steam was pumped into it from within
the factory. The box car was found abandoned in a field in Shell
Creek. It had previously run on the East Tennessee &amp; Western
North Carolina Railroad or better known as the &quot;Tweetsie Railroad&quot;.
Mountain humorists called the ET &amp; WNC Railroad the &quot;Eat Taters
&amp; Wear No Clothes&quot; Railroad. The name &quot;Tweetsie&quot; was given by
mountain folk because of the shrill &quot;tweet, tweet&quot; train whistles
that were heard through-out the hills. The ET &amp; WNC Railroad
began operations in 1881 and ended on July 13, 1950. At the end of
the train is the caboose (what else)? At this writing, little is
known about it. When I find out more, I will add more information. 
&lt;p&gt;Please use stealth because there could be other visitors. Please

Stopped by to check out the covered bridge nearby and then over to the cache. It was dark and took a while to find.Very cool place. Looks like lots of construction is under way so hopefully on our next trip up we can see the progress. Thanks for the fun!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The cache is only .15 mile from where you will park. Take the
trail to the right (under, over or around the gate) and go straight
ahead. Shortly, you will cross a small stream but most of the time,
you can do it without getting your feet wet. It is uphill from
here. The cache is a camo ammo can filled with all kinds of outdoor
and kids goodies. At the cache hiding place, please put everything
back as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the cache is one thing, what lies behind you is the real
treat. After you find the cache and are on your way back, look for
the fork in the trail about 260 feet from the parking area. Take
the right fork and go down about 150 feet (there are some steps).
You will be rewarded with seeing one of the most beautiful spots in
all of East Tennessee. If you have never taken photos at a cache,
this is the one to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't discovered the name of the area, email me and I
will tell you. If you do know the name, please don't use in your
log because we don't want &quot;let the cat out of the bag&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELP KEEP MOTHER EARTH CLEAN. IF YOU SEE TRASH, PLEASE TAKE IT
OUT (CITO).&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I was out caching with the area's grandfather of caching, no
other than DMFlyer. The road blocked our way (a darn old gate) so
we decided that this beautiful area needed some more caches. We
looked up on the right side of the road and saw some fantastic rock
cliffs, DM said, &quot;don't you think that twin formation looks like a
hoot owl?&quot; Now you know where the name came from. Naming the cache
was one thing, getting to a spot for the hide was quite a different
matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to get to the cache. One is very hard and the
other is extremely hard. The long way or the short way (a matter of
less than 100 feet), take your pick. If you look close enough there
is a trail that goes up the hill and after reaching the top, you
must bushwhack along the edge to the cache. The bushes and thorns
are thick but this is the &quot;easy&quot; way. If you are a mountain goat,
take the short route but be very careful. A walking stick is
mandatory for seeking this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reaching and finding the cache take some time to enjoy the
view. You will be looking down on the Mill Creek which creates the
beautiful Blue Hole. Any time of the year this spot is ideal for
photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is fairly easy. I have included the coordinates for the
closest spot. You will be looking for a 6 inch wide by 10 inch tall
round lock-n-lock that is camo taped. It has some nice goodies in
it so please trade up or trade even. Thanks and have a good caching
day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to find the other 5 caches in the immediate area and a
couple up on top. One is a combo Earthcache/regular cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This town has had several names: Shoate's Ford, Middletown, Union,
Zollicoffer, Union Depot and now Bluff City and this is where you
are going.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It certainly wasn't &lt;b&gt;Great&lt;/b&gt; and calling it a &lt;b&gt;Battle&lt;/b&gt; is
really a stretch, but here is the story. In 1861 Tennessee was the
last state which seceded from the Union. Sullivan County definately
favored the Confederacy while the neighboring counties of Carter
and Johnson leaned toward the Union.
&lt;p&gt;During most wars railroads are important and the Civil War was
no exception. Zollicoffer, as Bluff City was known during the War,
had a strategically important railroad bridge. The East Tennessee
Railroad ran straight through the little town of Zollicoffer and
there it crossed the Holston River. The War came to Zollicoffer
when William B. Carter, an East Tennessee Unionist called on all
Union supporters to ban together and defeat the Confederacy. Plans
were made to burn both the Carter's Depot and the Zollicoffer
bridges. Since the bridge at Carter's depot was heavily guarded and
a spy informed the group that the Zollicoffer Bridge had only two
local guards all attention turned to Zollicoffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime, shortly after November 7, 1861, Colonel Daniel Stover
from Elizabethton recruited 30 men and swore them into the military
and began the journey to Zollicoffer. The men halted about a
half-mile outside of the Town in woods near a hilltop farmhouse.
Three of the men stayed behind to guard the horses while the
remainder proceeded to the bridge. Their information was correct
for there were only two guards, Stanford Jenkins and William Jones
and they were under the bridge. When the guards heard the Yanks,
Jones fled the scene and Jenkins walked from under the bridge and
surrendered. That ended the BATTLE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilson O. Collins, who once employed Jenkins the guard,
M.L.Cameron and J.M.Emmert took turpentine and pine knots and soon
the bridge was ablaze. After the fire was well on its way, the men
returned to their horses and set out for Elizabethton. The only
problem that remained was what to do with Jenkins. Jenkins not only
recognized his old boss Collins, but he knew most of the bridge
burners. Obviously, killing him was the simplest solution. After
Jenkins begged for his life and swore that he would not tell who
burned the bridge he was turned loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jenkins returned, he told the Confederate Authorities all
about who was involved with the bridge burning. So much for his
life saving oath. The Confederates tried to capture all of the
bridge burners but most escaped and joined regular Union units,
especially the 13th Tennessee Volunteer Cavalry U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other times during the War the bridge was burned. After the
War, it was never used again. The pillars you see in and on the
banks of the river are all that remain of the Zollicoffer Bridge.
This ends the story of the Great Battle Of Zollicoffer. It was not
a Gettysburg, but important to the War none-the-less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;General Felix Zollicoffer&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small post script to the story. The town name was after a
Confederate General, Felix Zollicoffer of Tennessee. The General
didn't fair any better than the bridge. At Mill Springs, Kentucky,
on Jan. 19, 1862, he mistakenly rode up to the Union lines and was
shot dead before he could make a hasty retreat.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Edward Cox House is located on an old road which turns from modern Highway 11E one mile north of Bluff City. Owned and restored by the Holston Conference on Archives and History of the Methodist Church, it is now a Methodist Shrine.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Edward Cox built this two-story double hewn log house with a dogtrot (or breezeway) in the middle of the structure. Two chimneys with four fireplace openings flank either end of the house. Cox built the house in 1774. The log kitchen and other dependencies  have not survived.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Edward Cox was born in Baltimore County, Maryland about 1758. In 1773, the year of the first Methodist Conference in America, John Cox and his family, including his son , Edward, were converted, and received into the Church by Francis Asbury.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Soon after his conversion, Edward left home for the West, and settled here on land entered &quot; north of the Holston River.&quot; Edward Cox served in the Revolutionary War militia from 1775 to 1781 reaching the rank of Lieutenant. He is said to have assisted in building three frontier forts, Fort Lee on the Nolichucky River, and Fort Watauga and Womack's Fort. He served under the commands of Captain Robison, Colonel Bletcher, Colonel Isaac Shelby , Colonel Joseph Martin, and Captain Wallace, and acted as an Indian spy. He was with Colonel Isaac Shelby on the South Carolina campaign against the British.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;When the war was over and American independence established, Edward returned to his home and farm.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Edward and his wife, Sarah (Sallie) Meredith Cox soon opened their home for Methodist meetings which he conducted himself. These meetings became so famous that persons from as far as twenty-five miles away would gather here on the Sabbath Day. Several times the famous Methodist Bishop Francis Asbury stayed with the Cox family and preached to those gathered there. It is said that the first Methodist Conference in Tennessee was held in this house by Bishop Asbury.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Edward Cox died in 1850 a few years after his wife's death. They were survived by eight of their ten children. Only two sons, Samuel and John Cox, and one daughter, Elizabeth Cox (Mrs. John Vincent) continued to live in Sullivan County, the others migrated to Arkansas, Indiana and Kentucky. Edward was buried back of the old home near an apple tree. Years later the gravestone found there was placed in a room at the Bluff City Methodist Church for safekeeping.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log listing as found, enter numerals at bottom right corner on tablet at the front door in the code phrase.&lt;br/&gt;http://cacox.net/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I303&amp;tree=cox </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A Native American Trail Tree located along the Great Warriors Path in present day Warrior's Path State Park in Kingsport, Tennessee. Trail trees are trees that were modified by the American Aboriginal peoples in order to signify trails, campsites, or special locations (water supply, food, safety, etc.). Often these were oak saplings that are given a unique bend, usually pointed in the direction of the point of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Native American Trail Tree along the Great Warrior's Path is located at the entrance of a cave that has long been collasped. The Great Warrior's Path was a network of trails used as a trade and war route by the Native Americans, last used in this area by the Cherokee before the White settlers. Likely this trail passed through the area known as Indian Springs and followed Fall Creek to the South Fork of the Holston River, known to the Cherokee as the Hogohegee to a crossing where later pioneers established two ferry crossings in the general area, this tree being closest and directly across from Childress Ferry. This tree likely marked the trail to Watagua and the Yadkin Valley in North Carolina. Just a few miles away is the Long Island of the Holston, Sacred Ground of the Cherokee. Long Island of the Holston was for many years a jealously guarded possession of the Cherokee Indians. It became the scene of momentous events during the early years of exploration and settlement in the Old Southwest, the springboard for the initial settlement of Kentucky and Middle Tennessee. In its environs was fought the battle that gave those feeble settlements precious time to consolidate their positions during the first 2 years of the American Revolution. Long Island derived strategic importance from its location just east of the junction of the North and South Forks of the Holston. Nearby was the crossing of the Great Indian Warpath, a major trail to the northeast from central Tennessee. Thus the island figured significantly in the colonial struggle with the Indians that began in the middle of the 18th century. &lt;br/&gt;Col. William Byrd, leading a colonial expedition into Cherokee country, built Fort Robinson at the river junction in 1761 and introduced white occupation of the area. When Byrd's force abandoned the fort soon afterward, the Indians resumed possession, although more and more white hunters and traders began passing through en route to the hunting grounds of Kentucky and Tennessee. Among them was Daniel Boone. In March 1775, while Richard Henderson was still negotiating with the Cherokees for their Kentucky land, he sent Boone with 30 axmen to open the trail that was to gain fame as the Wilderness Road. Boone's trailmaking began at Long Island on March 10, and 2 weeks later his party reached the Kentucky River, having marked the way that was to lead 200,000 emigrants to Kentucky within the next 20 years. &lt;br/&gt;The Cherokees cast their lot with the British when the Revolution began. Stung into action by colonial settlement on the east Tennessee land they claimed, the Indians moved to crush the frontiersmen in July 1776. The defenders of Eaton's Fort, on high ground near Long Island, sallied onto Long Island Flats and, after a bitter fight, drove the Cherokees from the field. Two months later a punitive expedition against the Indian towns cowed the Cherokees, bringing 2 years of relative peace to the southwestern frontier. At the Treaty of Long Island, in July 1777, the Indians relinquished their claims to the land occupied by whites in east Tennessee. &lt;br/&gt;Besides being the starting point of Boone's Wilderness Road, Long Island was a jumping-off point for the settlement of central Tennessee. Just before Christmas of 1779, Col. John Donelson lead a flotilla of flatboats from there on the long and hazardous voyage down the Tennessee and up the Cumberland to establish Cumberland Colony, the first permanent white settlement in middle Tennessee. The importance of Long Island as a terminus and starting point led to the establishment of a boatyard directly across the river from the west end of the island.&lt;br/&gt;The best place to park and view the Trail Tree is at the Park office parking lot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this listing as found, use a compass to determin the direction and bearing the Trail Tree points. Enter this information in the code phrase. &lt;br/&gt;Example: 280° North West.&lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source other than my own: http://discoverkingsport.com/h-Long-Island.shtml</groundspeak:long_description>

depending on the tides (lake level).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Me Pet Dog&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anchor your boat on the South end of the island. You'll have ta
climb 500 feet to where I think I buried the treasure chest. The
place is full of bilge rats from that British Man-O-War and yar
gonna do a little bush whackin' 'til you get to the top. Just step
over the skeletons and keep on goin' It ain't bad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You be lookin' for a 4 X 6 X 3 camo-taped Rubbermaid box. Trade

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Captain Kid's (Konnarock, that is) Pine Island
Haunted Treasure Chest (camoed ammo box). It is full of plundered
booty that you land lubbers will take a liken to. If you take
something please put something back with equal of better value. If

so don't take the chance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they say, &quot;it's the sailin' trip that counts not the

make good pets so take a few home with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matey, have a good caching day or night. Your choice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Another Of Me Pets&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I buried the captured treasure (I think!) on the
Island of Ghost Timbers. This Island will indeed shiver your
timbers 'cause so many of them burnt up! A fire swept thru here and
turned the whole island into an living inferno. No one survived and
thar's nothin' here but pirate ghosts and the ghosts of the timbers
that long to be sailing masts. Oh yes, thars a buried treasure too!
By the way you bilge rats, it really ain't an island. Maybe it were
at one time or another but now it is a point out into the Sea. Drop
anchor at the Southeast side of the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treasure chest is a camo-taped Rubbermaid box. It is 9 X 6 X

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">During the earlier part of the Revolution, the inhabitants of the Watauga and Nolichucky settlements were driven back to the older and safer settlements in Virginia by the Cherokee Indians at the urging of British agents among the Indians. &lt;br /&gt;The settlers of the Watauga and Nolichucky settlements were warned of the impending onslaught of the Cherokees by four traders from the Cherokee Nation. It appears that the traders who carried the warning were Isaac Thomas, William Falling, Jarret Williams and probably John Bryan(t). The warning was given to these traders by Nancy Ward, who helped them to escape from the Indian towns on the Little Tennessee and Tellico Rivers in present Monroe County, Tennessee. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a three-pronged invasion by the,Indians with the main force led by the implacable foe of the settlers, the war chief of the Cherokees, Dragging Canoe. It was his intention to fall upon the settlers near the Long Island of Holston in what is now Sullivan County, and then carry the battle to the lower Virginia settlements. Thanks to the warning, conveyed to them by the traders and Nancy Ward, militia of the region had gathered. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 20 July 1776 at Island Flats near Long Island of Holston, the frontier militia under command of Captain James Thompson, who lived on the island, met and defeated the Indians. The militia was apparently composed of five companies commanded by Captains John Campbell, James Shelby, William Buchanan, William Cocke, and Thomas Madison in addition to that of James Thompson who was in overall command. Dragging Canoe's party was composed of about 170-200 warriors. &lt;br /&gt;1776: In what some will call the first battle of the CHEROKEE War of 1776, CHICKAMAUGA CHEROKEE (CHICKAMAUGA) Chief Dragging Canoe will lead an attack on the American settlement near Eaton's Station, Tennessee on the Great Island in the Holston River, today. Each side will have a little over 150 fighters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The settlers have been warned of the coming attack, and they are prepared. Dragging Canoe will sustain serious wounds; but, he will survive. The settlers will lose 4 men, the Indians 13. As the CHEROKEEs retreat, they will attack outlaying settlements, killing 18 extra people. This fight will go by many names: &quot;The Battle of Eaton's Station, The Battle of Island Flats, and The Battle of Long Island.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems that for the Cherokees the arrival in Chota of a delegation of fourteen Shawnees, Delawares, and Mohawks calling for combined action against the Americans decided the issue.The northerners were painted black, for war, and carried with them the war belt, nine feet long and six inches wide, made of purple wampum and covered with vermilion. In council a Shawnee offered the belt to Dragging Canoe, who took it, then passed it on to the Raven, who chanted the war song. One by one young warriors eager for battle against the invader took up the belt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia: on every border Cherokee warriors carried the tomahawk, the scalping knife, the faggot, meting out death and destruction. Our concern, however, is with the small, vulnerable settlements on the cutting edge of the American frontier—on the Nolichucky, the Watauga, and the Holston. They got early warning from traders, who had received it from a famous Cherokee woman, Nancy Ward, a niece of Attakullakulla. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three columns totaling 600 to 700 warriors moved north up the Great Valley of East Tennessee. Dragging Canoe led the center column against Eaton’s Station near Long Island on the Holston, now in the neighborhood of Kingsport,Tennessee. Old Abram went after Nolichucky and Watauga.To the west the Raven struck into Carter’s Valley, where the settlers were scat- tered and defenseless. Raven’s column devastated the valley as the settlers fled before the warriors. Cabins and crops were burned, livestock slaughtered, those who failed to get away fast enough killed and scalped. The Raven drove into Virginia as far as Seven Mile Ford on the South Fork of the Holston. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scouts spotted Dragging Canoe’s column making for Eaton’s Station. The fighting men numbered about 170 and were commanded by six militia captains: James Thompson, who was senior and at least in nominal overall command, James Shelby,William Buchanan, John Campbell,William Cocke, and Thomas Madison. On the morning of 20 July 1776, it was decided to meet the warriors in the open. “We marched in two divisions,” the captains reported,“with flankers on each side and scouts before.”The scouts came on 20 warriors. Fire was exchanged.Then “our men rushed on them with such violence that they were obliged to make a precipitate retreat.” Fearing that a large party of Indians might be nearby, they decided to return to the fort, but they had gone only about a mile when Dragging Canoe and his main force, “not inferior to ours, attacked us in the rear. Our men sustained the attack with great bravery and intrepidity, immediately forming a line. The Indians endeavoured to surround us, but were prevented by the uncommon fortitude and vigilance of Captain James Shelby, who took possession of an eminence that prevented their design. Our line of battle extended about a quarter of a mile.We killed about thirteen on the spot, whom we found. . . . There were streams of blood every way, and it was generally thought there was never so much execution done in so short a time on the frontiers.” It is said that Dragging Canoe himself was shot in the leg and suffered a broken thigh.Thus ended the Battle of Island Flats, a skirmish really, but important nonetheless. 46 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following day, 21 July, Old Abram’s warriors fiercely assaulted Fort Caswell on the Watauga, Colonel John Carter commanding.With him were Captain James Robertson and Lieutenant John Sevier.The latter had evacu- ated Fort Lee on the Nolichucky and brought his men and their families to Fort Caswell. Seventy-five fighting men defended the walls. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Abram’s initial assault failed and he settled into a siege, firing now and then at the fort.About 25 warriors attempting to fire the stockade scat- tered when James Robertson’s sister Ann carried a bucket of boiling wash water to the parapet and poured it on the attackers. Although wounded, she kept it up until the warriors retreated. After about two weeks the siege was lifted. Despite almost two centuries of experience fighting the white man, Indians had not yet learned how to take forts held by determined, well-led garrisons.Their only weapons were ruse and starvation.The Cherokee offen- sive was a failure. Only Carter’s Valley had been cleared of whites, but they would come back, they always did, time after bloody time. The Americans did not wait long to strike back. In a remarkable exam- ple of cooperation,Virginia and the Carolinas staged an offensive against the Cherokees that devastated their country. From South Carolina, from North Carolina, from Virginia, militia columns struck deep into Cherokee country, burning and pillaging towns, storehouses, and crops. No memorable battles were fought, only hopeless skirmishes, for the forces arrayed against them were too formidable for the Cherokees to resist.The earth was scorched.The Virginia column alone, Colonel William Christian commanding, reported that the Indians had left behind “horses, cattle, dogs, hogs, and fowl,” and “between forty and fifty thousand bushels of corn and ten or fifteen thou- sand bushels of Potatoes.” The Cherokees, largely a mountain people, were left to face winter without lodges or food.The overwhelming defeat of the Cherokees so discouraged their neighbors to the south, the Creeks, that for the most part they offered little military assistance to the British during the Revolutionary War. The Cherokees were knocked out of the war for six years, and when they rose again a similar campaign, quick and ruthless, by the gifted South Carolina partisan chief Andrew Pickens soon put an end to it. 47 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dragging Canoe and his followers, however, remained intransigent. In March 1777, he withdrew from the Cherokee Nation with some 500 war- riors and their families and settled on Chickamauga Creek, just north of modern Chattanooga,Tennessee. He taunted those who had lost their will to resist as Virginians. He called his people Ani-Yun’wiya—the Real People. The whites called them Chickamauga, a name that would soon command fear and respect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smashing American victory in the Cherokee War, both the success- ful resistance on the Watauga and the Holston and the crushing offensive by the three states, was prelude for further advances by restless American fron- tier folk. Even as full-scale war was waged by Americans and Britons east of the mountains, frontiersmen pushed out into hostile territory first to recon- noiter, then bringing families to settle. But Indian resistance had not ended. Chickamaugas and Creeks from the south, Chickasaws from the west, Shaw- nees from the north would bitterly contest the white advance for decades to come—valley by bloody valley. Out of the countless, long-forgotten clashes that took place, which in our time would be described as “incidents,” let us look at one that occurred three years before Andrew Jackson’s arrival on the frontier, as an example of a not untypical “incident” that reveals the grit and determination of the People of the Western Waters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During this brief period of respite from Indian wars and surprise attacks the first systematic white colonization of the Island Flats began. The land was gertile and lay well, and the region abounded in game. Fort Robinson offered protection from the Indians, and the pioneers had confidence in the treaty of 1761. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this time most of those who had entered the section had been hunters, explorers or Indian fighters, of the type of Daniel Boone, but during this period families came t till the soil and to establish permanent homes, led on by the glowing accounts of fertile valleys which had been carried back across the Blue Ridge Mountains by the the adventurers who had broken the way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new era was beginning for this virgin wilderness which was destined later to become the site of Kingsport. Where before there had been only trackless hunting grounds of the Cherokees, there were now the cabins of the indomitable white man, with his fields of corn and patches of potatoes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... However, this period of peace and colonization was destined to be short lived. The white man's theory of his own inalienable right to possess the rule carried him to unwonted extremes. Treaties with the Indians were systematically broken and all faith of the red man in the encroaching plaeface was shaken. There were thefts, murders, and various outrages. In 1774 these smouldering coals of ill will leaped into flames when a number of the friends and relatives of the Indian chief Logan were cruelly murdered by white settlers on Yellow Creek in Pennsylvania. Along the entire frontier there were Indian reprisals, with burning cabins, crops laid waste, and white men andwomen tortured and scalped. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This culminated in Dunmore's War. General Andrew Lewis was commissioned by Lord Dunmore to rasie a force of 1,500 men west of the Blue Ridge Mountains for service against the Indians. Consequently the pioneersmen of Island Flats were again required to lay down the axe and hoe and pick up the rifle and tomahawk, and their women t mold bullets and parch corn upon which they depended for their daily safety and subsistence. The recruits of the Kingsport section were place under the command of Captains Evan Shelby, William Campbell, and Daniel Smith. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the junction of the Kanawha and Ohio Rivers General Lewis' forces were met, on October 10, by an army of 1,200 Indians, led by Chief Cornstalk, who engaged them in one of the bloodiest and fiercest battles of the Indian wars. This was the battle of the Great Kanawha, more generally known in history as the Battle of Point Pleasant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Indians were decisively defeated and were driven across the Ohio, where a number of their villages were destroyed. In a short time they begged for peace, and after a treaty had been arranged the sturdy pioneers of Island Flats, who had acquitted themselves in their usual creditable manner, returned to their homes and their cultivated fields. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again the peace an security were short lived. Early in 1776 the Indians, nettled by the previous defeats and outrages and incited against the American settlers by the English, again began to put on the war paint and sound the battle cry. In June of that year the Indian princess, Nancy Ward, sent word to the settlements at Long Island that an Indian force of 700 braves was preparing to make a raid. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... The warning of Nancy Ward put the Kingsport settlers on their guard and prevented a general massacre. Hurried steps were taken by the whites for their protection. The forces were gathered together at Heaton's Station, located on the lower slope of Eden's or Chestnut Ridge, probably in the vicinity of where the Holston Sub-Staion of the Kingsport Utilities now stands. This station was not a fort, but as the additional soldiers and refugees came trooping in it was fortified by a stockade of logs and rails, hastily thrown up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small garrison of soldiers was already stationed there, having been ordered to that point by Col. William Preston to protect the frontier. now, a call for help having been sent out, other companies of soldiers arrived, the total numbering about 170 fighting men. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This garrison, having had time to make but very hasty and inadequate arrangements for the defense, was notified by its scouts that a band of 700 picked Indian warriors, led by Dragging Canoe, one of the most cruel and warlike of the Indian chiefs, was approaching in the vicinity of Long Island. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A council of war was held. Although the white men were several times outnumbered by the Indians, they might reasonably expect to hold their fortification against the enemy. On the other had it was likely that the Indians, seeing the strength of their position in the stockade, would not attck them, but instead would go by to massacre and torture the unfortunate settlers in the valleys of Reedy Creek and the Holston River who had not sought shelter at Heaton's Station. Consequently it was decided to sally forth from the improvised fortress and meet the invading savages in the open. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In accordance with this decision they marched out of the stockade on August 20, and proceeded down the river to the Island Flats. There they met an advance guard of some 20 Indians and fired into them. These turned and fled, with no evidence that the main body of the enemy was near. As it was now late in the afternoon it was decided there was little chance of engaging the Indians that day and that it was best to return to the stockade. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After traveling the distance of about a mile on the return trip to the fortress they were notified by their rear guard that the entire Indian force was closing in on them from behind, already formed in battle line. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whites hurriedly got into line and prepared for battle, not without some confusion, however, as the attack was wholly unexpected. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There followed the Battle of Island Flats, the most sanguinary Indian battle ever fought on Kingsport soil. Though shor lived, lasting but about ten minutes, it was fierce and determined, and was marked by many instances of individual heroism. The result was that the Indians, though in superior forces, were completely routed. The scalps of 18 savages were taken (the white men had evidently readily adopted the savage fashion of taking scalps) and it was later learned that a total of about 40 Indians were either slain outright or mortally wounded. On the other hand no white men were killed, and only five were wounded, the name of only one of whom, N.Logan, has been preserved. He was shot through the back of the neck with an arrow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battle was fought on just about the spot where the business section of Kingsport now stands. Theodore Roosevelt, in his &quot;The Winning of the West,&quot; fixes the battlefield as a narrow strip of bottom, covered by black oak saplings, and lying between two parallel ridges. This could have been none other thatn the site of the business section of the present city, with the gently rising ridge of the Watauga Street section on the east and what is known locally as &quot;Cement Hill&quot; on the west. Incidentally this was one of the most decisive victories for the whites in the history of border warfare. A century and a half later the great-grandsons and great great-grandsons of those sturdy pioneers were to build great industrial plants on the blood soaked flats -- empire builders still, and still imbued with that indomitable courage which spells victory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are still many evidences of these old Indian battles. ON the flats about the old dye plant at Kingsport there are to be found many Indian arrow heads and an occasional tomahawk -- the war implements, perhaps, of some brave who died in the Battle of Island Flats. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The indians smarted under the defeat at Kingsport, and planned revenge. They threatened a general war of reprisals throughout the Cherokee nation. The whites learned of this, and learned also that the savages were being urged on by the agents of the English king. Consequently they determined to get the jump on the redskins by invading their territory before they should have time to raid the white settlements. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long Island was regarded as a strategic point, being in a sense the gateway to the Cherokee country. It was a point that must be held by the whites against any possible Indian invasion on the one hand, and was a logical base for aggressive operations against the savages on the other. Consequently Col. William Christian, who was placed in charge of the proposed campaign against the Over Hill Cherokees, decided to build a new fortification there to replace old Fort Robinson, which had fallen into disrepair. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lieutenant-Colonel William russell, acting under orders of Col. Christian, marched with a considerable force of soldiers to Long Island where, in September, 1776, he built Fort Patrick Henry, Kingsport's second fort. This fortification stood on the north bank of the Holston River, on land which is now the property of the Tennessee Eastman Corporation, and at just a little distance from the crossing of the Horse Creek road. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As late as 1853 the ruins of Fort Patrick Henry could be seen, on a commanding site just a little way back from the river bank, the land at that time being owned by Col. George W. Netherland. The location was not far from the site of Fort Robinson, with which the later fort has sometimes been confused by historians. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the fort was completed a force of 2,000 well equipped fighting men was mobilized there by Col. Christian, who had been reinforced by troops from North Carolina under Col. Williams, Col. Love and Major Winston. By the first of October, 1776, just a little more than a month after the battle of Island Flats, this force was ready for the invasion of the Cherokee territory. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The forces left the fort and crossing Long Island proceeded out what would now be the Horse Creek road, encamping the first night near Chimney Top Mountain. Hearing that a force of 3,000 Indians had been mobilized at the French Broad River, the Christian forces proceeded, by forced marches, to that point, but upon arriving there found no enemy forces to meet them. The Indians had estimated the strength of the invading whites and feared to engage them in a pitched battle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In November, having crossed the French Broad into the Cherokee territory, Col. Christian began laying waste the Indian villages which he found unprotected and deserted. The spirit of the Indians was broken; they had foreseen the inevitable dominion of the white man. Consequiently they sued for peace and a truce was agreed upon which provided for a treaty council to be held at Long Island the following year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this Col. Christian withdrew from the Cherokee country and returned to Fort Patrick Henry, where he disbanded his men, leaving a garrison of 600 soldiers in protection of the fort. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This Marker is located in the former schoolyard of the Masonic Female Institute, where Confederate troops stood as they defended Blountville on September 22, 1863. There are other Civil War Trails markers in the foreground, near the Court House and the old Derry Inn to the right, where some citizens took refuge in the basement when the shelling started, not knowing that they were in the line of fire from both Federal and Confederate artillery. This area behind the Inn, next to the Court House where the Slave Quarters were located was shelled heavily from the Federals artillery position, as well as the Court House which is just 50 yards west. Col. James E. Carter's 1st Tennessee Cavalry withdrew that morning of 1863 from the Watauga River to positions such as the one here that had already been prepared to block the Union Col. John W. Foster's cavalry brigade after it crossed the river. Foster took up a position on Cemetery Hill on the western end of town early in the afternoon, and a destructive artillery duel ensued. After four hours of fighting and shelling, the Confederates withdrew to Carter's Depot on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad a few miles east of here as Federals charged through the town near dusk.&lt;br/&gt;Carter lost a cannon and about fifty men captured in battle. The next day, he evacuated the depot, leaving it in Foster's hands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This geocache was placed by a member of the Son's of Confederate Veterans. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The old Captain Kid (Konnarock, that is) has done it again. We
sank a British merchant ship and after making the survivors walk
the plank we buried the booty on The Whale's Backbone Island. Now
listen hear you land lubbers, there ain't no whales backbone on the
island but just after you drop anchor there is an old tree just
laying there that looks like one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old Captain wouldn't horns waggle ye, it's thar and just
ready for the takin'. From whar you drop anchor, it's 'bout 510
feet up to the treasure. You should be a droppin' the anchor on the
east end of the island. Otherwise you'll run aground and become
another ghost ship. The treasure chest is a camo-painted ammo box.
There is a little bush whackin' at the start and a bit of a climb
but it ain't too bad. Arrrgh, and old woman or the little 'ens can
do it after you help them up the bank. Watch out for the big, nasty
old wharf rats!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;b&gt;Me Pet Cat&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treasure chest is full so trade up or even or we'll be a
watchin' and soon you'll be a visitin' Davy Jones locker. Put the
treasure chest back whar you'd found it or you'll be doing the
dance the hempen jig.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;There was a pirate named Capt. Jack. He and I used to sail the
high seas together 'til he tried to horn waggle me out of the booty
from a Spanyerd's ship. I made short order of that bilge rat with
me old cutlass but I should have kept him alive 'til I learnt of
his secret burying ground. Yep, he had a shack that long ago fell
to the elements and close to it be all who fell prey to his knife.
'Tis said that the ghosts of his victims still walk the grounds of
his shack and close by lies the treasure. Look for the beautifal
wench ghost. She used to be Capt. Jack's mate but she crossed him
and now she dead.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Curley, Me Pet&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ain't fer from the anchor point to the shack and where the
treasure may be but it will take a small amount of bush whackin'
and climbing a slick steep hill side. A good ol' hiking stick will
help. You can go in from the back side but your sure to die. Drop
anchor wher I tell ya and find the secret passage (the only) up the
bank to the hill. It's a might too dangerous to go in any other
way. Watch yer step coming back cause if ye take the wrong way, ya
could drop over a steep bank and smash up on the rocks! By the way,
look fer some of me pets (see above picture) amongst the rocks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ye will be lookin' fer a packed full, camo-painted ammo can.
Trade up or even or don't trade. 'member, we'll be watchin'. The
Margarita's guns will blast you off the rock. All cachers should
report what they took and what they left and above all LOG TBs if
they be in the cache! Re bury (hide) the treasure chest jest as ye
found it. Once you found the skeleton, (tin roof and rocks), of
Capt. Jack's shack, you're almost to the treasure site and it is
straight up from thar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;The Family Crest&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get off your land lubbing tails and go pirating with the old
Captain Kid (Konnarock, that is!) The old Captain discovered a rum
runners road to the sea. We call it the Road to Davy Jone's Locker
because that's whar most of the bilge rats we caught end up! If we
don't ketch ya maybe the Revenurers will and ya'll end up doin'
dance the hempen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll be goin' up the road for .14 mile to find the treasure.
It's a might grown up, so be prepared. Thars all kinds of haints
and boogers in these woods. If the pirates won't get ya, then the
haints will!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;b&gt;Another Of Me Pets&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treasure chest is a 10 X 6 X 4 Rubbermaid camo-taped box.
&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; As of April 25, 2009, cache is now a camo- painted
ammo box. Trade up or even or don't trade. We'll be watchin'

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the morning of December 13, 1864, after riding for three days in frigid, winter weather, Union Gen. George Stoneman's forces under Gens. Stephen G. Burbridge and Alvan C. Gillem arrived on the western bank of the Holston River. They massed across the river in the fields surrounding the Rotherwood mansion. The cache location is near where Confederate Col. Richard C. Morgan, commanding 300 men of Gen. Basil W. Dukes brigade, stood on the eastern bank to defend Kingsport. The old Ross Bridge that crossed the north fork of the Holston River and connected the two banks was in disrepair and could not support foot traffic. As a result, the well-positioned Confederate troops were confident in spite of being overwelmingly outnumbered, and they thought that a Union attack was unlikely. While part of the Federal force remained in front, Col. Samuel Patton led two regiments (mostly calvery troopers from East Tennessee) roughly three miles up the western bank to Clouds Ford, where they crossed the river. They then made their way down the eastern bank and surprised the Confederates with a flank attack, capturing Morgan and driving his command toward Bristol. The Federal forces soon set off in pursuit.&lt;br/&gt;Morgan's wagon train was captuerd, the number of Confederate soilders that were killed, wounded or captured differs, even the final resting place of the dead is not known for sure, but there is an unmarked cemetery (N36° 33.218 W082° 36.136) about a half a mile away from the battle site that is said to contain the bodys of those brave men that gave their lives in the defense of Kingsport and for the Confederate States of America.  &lt;br/&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>

Got to area and remembered that I didn't have co-ords. in my gps.  Took a stroll and looked for dmflyers tracks in the snow and looked in other places.  Found in the last place I looked ( too cold to look anywhere else after I found it).  Thanks

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True"> &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attakullakulla or Atagulkalu (Cherokee, Ata-gul' kalu, meaning Little Carpenter)(ca. 1708–ca. 1777), adopted as an infant into the Cherokee tribe, became their First Beloved Man, serving from 1761 to around 1775. His son Dragging Canoe became the war leader of the Cherokee during the Chickamauga wars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the anthropologist James Mooney, Attakullakulla's Cherokee name could be translated &quot;leaning wood&quot;, from ada meaning &quot;wood&quot;, and gulkalu, a verb that implies something long, leaning against some other object. His name &quot;Little Carpenter&quot; derived from the English meaning of his Cherokee name along with a reference to his physical stature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attakullakulla was born to a subtribe of the Algonquian-speaking Nipissing to the North. He was captured as an infant during a raid and adopted by a minor Cherokee chief, making him a member of the Cherokee. He married Nionne Ollie, a Natchez captive adopted as the daughter of his cousin Oconostota. The marriage was permissible because they were of different clans; he was Wolf Clan and she was Paint Clan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He was a member of the Cherokee delegation that traveled to England in 1730. In 1736, he rejected the advances of the French, who sent emissaries to the Overhill Cherokee. Three or four years later, he was captured by the Ottawa, allies of the French, who held him captive in Quebec until 1748. Upon his return, he became one of the Cherokees' leading diplomats and an adviser to the Beloved Man of Chota.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In May 1759, following a series of attacks between colonists and Cherokee, Attakullakulla joined a delegation that went to Charleston to try to negotiate with South Carolina authorities for peace. The colonial governor William Henry Lyttleton seized the delegates as hostages until the Cherokee responsible for killing white settlers were surrendered. Having raised an expeditionary force of 1700, Lyttleton set out for Fort Prince George with the hostages in tow and arrived on December 9, 1759.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freed soon after, Attakullakulla returned to Fort Prince George to negotiate for peace, but his efforts were thwarted by the hawkish Oconostota. The Cherokee gave up two individuals and negotiated the release of a few hostages, including Oconostota. He lured Lt. Richard Coytmore out of the fort; waving a bridle over his head, the chief incited Cherokee warriors hiding in the woods to shoot and kill Coytmore. The garrison in the fort killed all the Cherokee hostages. Hostilities continued between the Cherokee and Anglo-Americans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attakullakulla is believed to have died in 1775/1777. He was succeeded by his cousin Oconostota (who was also his father-in-law).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geocache is located on the Long Island of the Holston River. Long Island of the Holston was for many years a jealously guarded possession of the Cherokee Indians. It became the scene of momentous events during the early years of exploration and settlement in the Old Southwest, the springboard for the initial settlement of Kentucky and Middle Tennessee. In its environs was fought the battle that gave those feeble settlements precious time to consolidate their positions during the first 2 years of the American Revolution. Long Island derived strategic importance from its location just east of the junction of the North and South Forks of the Holston. Nearby was the crossing of the Great Indian Warpath, a major trail to the northeast from central Tennessee. Thus the island figured significantly in the colonial struggle with the Indians that began in the middle of the 18th century. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Col. William Byrd, leading a colonial expedition into Cherokee country, built Fort Robinson at the river junction in 1761 and introduced white occupation of the area. When Byrd's force abandoned the fort soon afterward, the Indians resumed possession, although more and more white hunters and traders began passing through en route to the hunting grounds of Kentucky and Tennessee. Among them was Daniel Boone. In March 1775, while Richard Henderson was still negotiating with the Cherokees for their Kentucky land, he sent Boone with 30 axmen to open the trail that was to gain fame as the Wilderness Road. Boone's trailmaking began at Long Island on March 10, and 2 weeks later his party reached the Kentucky River, having marked the way that was to lead 200,000 emigrants to Kentucky within the next 20 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cherokees cast their lot with the British when the Revolution began. Stung into action by colonial settlement on the east Tennessee land they claimed, the Indians moved to crush the frontiersmen in July 1776. The defenders of Eaton's Fort, on high ground near Long Island, sallied onto Long Island Flats and, after a bitter fight, drove the Cherokees from the field. Two months later a punitive expedition against the Indian towns cowed the Cherokees, bringing 2 years of relative peace to the southwestern frontier. At the Treaty of Long Island, in July 1777, the Indians relinquished their claims to the land occupied by whites in east Tennessee. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides being the starting point of Boone's Wilderness Road, Long Island was a jumping-off point for the settlement of central Tennessee. Just before Christmas of 1779, Col. John Donelson lead a flotilla of flatboats from there on the long and hazardous voyage down the Tennessee and up the Cumberland to establish Cumberland Colony, the first permanent white settlement in middle Tennessee. The importance of Long Island as a terminus and starting point led to the establishment of a boatyard directly across the river from the west end of the island. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sources: http://discoverkingsport.com/h-Long-Island.shtml  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Carpenter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to one of the best fishing holes along Kingsport's Greenbelt multi use trail along the South fork of the Holston River. Located just upstream from the boat landing near the Historic Neatherland Inn Boat Yard district behind the public rest rooms in Riverfront Park. Stealth is a must, seems there are always muggles about in the day, but fishing is permitted until 10:30 PM.&lt;br/&gt;We use heavy tackle here when fishing from the dock, mostly we catch bottom feeders like Suckers, Carp, and Catfish here, but also have caught some nice Smallmouth Bass. Worms seem to be the best bait to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plenty of parking.&lt;br/&gt;Public rest rooms.&lt;br/&gt;Dogs welcome.&lt;br/&gt;Bikes allowed.&lt;br/&gt;No fires allowed.&lt;br/&gt;Not 24/7.&lt;br/&gt;City Park cache.&lt;br/&gt;Multi use trail/Greenbelt.  &lt;br/&gt;Special tool required. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocache is located in the older part of Kingsport near the old Boat Yard and Neatherland Inn, a stop along the old stage route.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kinnie Wagner was a Scott County Native from Speers Ferry near Clinchport. He was a wanted man for the killing of a Sheriff's deputy in Mississippi. He went Outlaw long before he came back here to the area, he joined the Richard Brothers Circus and left Scott County at the age of 16 where he showed off his talent as a trick shot and bronco buster. They called him the Texas Kid, but he had never even cast his shadow in the Lone Star State. Kinnie just came down here to the River for a picnic with his sister that he had not seen in a long time, and he was on the run form the Law. Some Deputys up in Kingsport got word where Kinnie would be from some snitch. Seems another lady was with Kinnie's Sister, and the little Coward that had a eye for her too more than likely called the Law and Ratted Kennie out.&lt;br/&gt; Anyway, the Deputys that left Kingsport that went to arrest Kinnie said to get a box ready, in other words a coffin. They had no intent on arresting Kinnie, or they knew he would resist and that he was armed. He was armed with a large frame .38 holstered on his right side and a .32 on his left in a cross draw position. Kennie got the drop on the Deputys and took cover behind a tree and firing around the tree with both guns he fell all three Deputy's, killing two instantly and severly wounding the third.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;What I have been told seems to be true in most accounts, but so much is missing. Down in the Crooked letter State Kinnie is a Outlaw, which was true, but I think Kinnie was done wrong by the Law and only killed in self defense. After all, he was framed by them over theft of a pocket watch that he was asked to keep by one of them. The whole lot of them was into the moonshine business together.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Before the gun smoke could clear Kennie took a Horse from a young man to make his escape. He told the boy he was not stealing the Horse, but he had to have it to make a quick escape. He headed North across Cherry Hill and made his way to Yuma, Virginia and took refuge in a barn. The land owner may have been a friend, and she talked Kennie into going the next day and turn himself in to the Sheriff in Gate City. There was already a large man-hunt going on for him. He caught a ride in a automobile with some people that were assisting him turn himself in, and they were involved in a collision with another automible driven by a Scott County Deputy somewhere near Moccasin Gap. It was the Deputy's fault, but he made the claim he saw Kinnie and tryed to force the vehicle off the road, but the truth was Kinnie was hidden in the back of the vehicle, and had already surrendered the .38 to the passanger. Seems he had held on to the .32 in case things went wrong again and they tryed to gun him down.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Wagner has become a legend in this mountain country where he grew up and to which he returned in frequent escapes from a life sentence. Fiction has become mixed with the facts, and there are even confliting reports on the number of people he killed. The generally accepted version is there were at least five.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;According to FBI files, Wagner first got into trouble when he was accused of stealing a watch in Mississippi. An ex-circus sharp-shooter, he became embroiled in a gunfight with officers in which his aim was deadly. Thereafter he was a hunted outlaw between periods of imprisonment.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Once, in 1924. he was sentenced to electrocution at Blountville , Tenn. , just across the state line from his home County for slaying two policemen. But he escaped and never was brought back to Blountville for execution of the sentence.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Kennie died in Prison in Mississippi on March 9, 1958 and is buried beside his Mother in the Mountian View School Cemetery in Scott County, Virginia. </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;Me Old Uncle Jack&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Durin' the old Captain's (Konnarock that is) many voyages
on the South Seas I often visited New Zealand. We plundered many of
the local native tribes and many a time we fled for our lives. We
captured a young Maori prince and took him aboard the Margarita.
Yep, he didn't like it at first but he learned to fear the
cat-o-nine-tails. Soon, he became one of me most trusted mates and
still sails with the Captain. Yes, I've offered to set him on shore
but he wants to continue a pirating.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Tawhiri, or did I mention his name, keeps telling us stories of
all of the Maori gods. One of the most important Maori gods is Tane
Mahuta and this is his story:&lt;/p&gt;
Rangi was the Sky Father and his wife was Mother Earth,
Papa. Rangi and Papa could never be separated and their children
could not escape their grasp.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The trapped gods tried in vain several times to separate their
parents until it was the turn of the God Of The Forest, Tane
(TAH-nay) Mahuta. Pushing away his father with his head and his
mother with his feet. Tane finally succeeded. He then set free the
Sun and Moon and decorated the heavens with stars. Tane was also
the one who created the first woman called Hine, whom he
married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their children were the first Polynesian people. One of Tane's
brothers who is the god of winds did not want his parents separated
and expressed his wrath by hurling storms and hurricanes against
Tane's forests&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our sailin' on the South Holston we discovered a monument
to Tane on an island that we named after the god. Here we buried a
fabulous treasure (ammo box). You land lubbers be ye very careful
here because the place is full of the souls of poor mortals who
have found themselves caught in between the battles of Tane and his
brother Tawhiri. None survived and ye might not either!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rebury&quot; the treasure as ye found it and log whatever ye took
and ye left! Don't forget the Margarita is about and will do ye
in!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Two Sullivan County citizens made it through the Civil War. They
were: William H. Blevins (Union) and Joseph C. Jones (CSA). These
two men were 18 and 20 years old when the war began. They were
neighbors, but found themselves on opposite sides of the conflict.
Did they grow up together? How well did these these two men know
each other? Did they meet during the war? Did they talk of the war
after it was over? We don't know the answers to these questions,
but we do know that, they together, rest in peace. 
&lt;p&gt;You must find the resting-places to determine the coordinates
for the cache. Try to find them without the hints (its easy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Blevins:&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;First of all, we want to thank Great-Scott! from Virginia Beach
for his kind permission to copy his idea of a cache. Don't applaud
him too much for he copied the idea from kingsting's cache in
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;b&gt;O. T. I. C&lt;/b&gt; (opposite of C. I. T. O.) cache.
&lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;bviously &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;rashy &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;cky &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;aches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main question presented is: will cachers go after a cache
that is truly lame in all respects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is dedicated to those, &lt;b&gt;(not all),&lt;/b&gt; micros that
have been tossed out of a car window and stuck! We mean those
caches that were placed in trashy locations with nothing to see but
yuck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need to cross the fence or to go near the railroad
tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the &quot;highlights&quot; of our cache:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Crappy location...naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Good coordinates...not a chance, we didn't even stop the
truck. Besides, the old GPSr's batteries were failing, a
thunderstorm was happening and Marge wouldn't keep the antenna
glued to her head. Trees and a power line will drive your GPS nuts.
We will change the coordinates periodically just for the heck of
it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Scenic view....are you kidding, only if you like trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Log....too small and will probably get wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Camo job....very well done if you like cheap colored
tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. No pen....could have put one here but we don't like to spend
money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Nice container....not really although we did spend 3 cents
for it. It will probably fall apart before the next winter is over.
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Tradeables....let the little brats cry, no goodies here for
them. As a matter of fact, if you brings kids here they will
probably catch something and we don't mean the rats that live
here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Spoiler Hint &lt;b&gt;(STOP HERE!!!, read no further if you want to
do it the hard way)&lt;/b&gt;....don't you just hate these kind of hints?
Remember it is a dumb 35mm film cannister and it is behind the
little tree that is in front of and to the right of the concrete
foundations. Under three little rocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. Chances of getting arrested....on a scale of 1 to 10, about
12!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11. First-to-find prize....first choice of any of the garbage
that's lying near the cache..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12. Rating.....yes, it is very over rated. We almost gave it a
5/5 but that would be bragging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13. Attributes....they don't have any that pertains to
bio-hazards! If we post any, they are probably lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14. Health concerns.....too numerous to mention!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15. Parking....plenty room, if you are using a skateboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is not an original idea. There are many other
caches like this out there. They are just not described in the same
way! What are you going to get out of finding this cache? You will
get another smiley and the chance to trash the cache in front of
every other cacher and the chance of catching some scientifically
unidentifiable disease!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take out all of your frustrations with LAME micros on this
cache. It is the whipping post surrogate for all of them! As a
matter of fact, &lt;b&gt;if anything nice is said in the log about the
cache or the cache owner, it will be deleted after we give you a
chance to take the &quot;niceness&quot; out of your log. We don't want to see
anything like, &quot;nice cache&quot; or &quot;good hide&quot;!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's there! It's mocking you and daring you to find it. It
will keep coming up in your searches. If it had a tongue, it would
be sticking it out at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to post spoiler photos of the cache container or the
hiding location and please put everything back as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your shots up-to-date and have a nice caching day!
Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

      THE WACs OF WWII AND TO ALL OF THE DOUGHBOYS OF WWI. It is also dedicated to our son Robert who is currently deployed to Afghanistan. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;Over 150,000 American women served in the Women's Army Corps
(WAC) during World War II. Members of the WAC were the first women
other than nurses to serve within the ranks of the United States
Army. Sixteen women received the Purple Heart, awarded to soldiers
injured due to enemy action. A total of 657 WACs received medals
and citations at the end of the war. By an act of Congress, the
Women's Army Corps ended in 1978 and the Corp was brought into all
but the combat branches of the Army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

WACs Reporting For Duty 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;There were 4,355,000 American men who were soldiers in World War
I. Of this number, 116,708 were killed. These soldiers were
affectionately known as &quot;Doughboys&quot;. In World War II they were
known as GIs. Everyone agrees that the soldier's nickname was
Doughboy but there are a lot of differing opinions as to where the
name came from. There are four theories as to the origin of
&quot;Doughboy&quot;. The &quot;baked goods&quot;, the &quot;button&quot;, the &quot;Pipe Clay&quot; and
the &quot;Adobe&quot; are all theories of the name. Due to space limitations
(or being lazy) I will not explain each theory but if you know or
find the answers and email them to me, you may claim an extra find
for this cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 
The Doughboys 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. At the flagpole take a bearing of NW 320 degrees and walk 60
feet to Ethel Wampler's (our honored WAC) grave. Write down her
birth year______.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Go back to the flagpole and take a bearing of SE 132 degrees
and walk 45 feet to Olinthus L. Grubb's (our honored Doughboy)
grave. Write down his birth year______.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final cache coordinates are: N 36. 35. 51____* W 082. 06.
5___**___**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* last number (digit) of Olinthus Grubb's birth year. ** last
two numbers (digits) of Ethel Wampler's birth year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a cammoed ammo box. Please trade even or up
and please put the cache back where you found it. Stealth is needed
because there are a lot of nearby eyes. Good
luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IF YOU TAKE A TB FROM THIS CACHE PLEASE LOG IT. TB'S ARE NOT
TRADING OR COLLECTING ITEMS (unless you own it).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: EWV7CF - Ethel Wampler's Grave&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: FNV7CF - The Cache&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: OGV7CF - Olinthus Grubb's Grave&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Osama bin Laden, the former head of the Islamist militant group al-Qaeda known for the September 11 attacks, was killed in Pakistan on May 2, 2011, shortly after 1 am local time by Navy SEALs of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group. The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was ordered by United States President Barack Obama and carried out in a Central Intelligence Agency-led operation. Participating units included the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (also known as DEVGRU or SEAL Team Six), the U.S. Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne), and CIA operatives. The raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan was launched from Afghanistan. After the raid, U.S. forces took bin Laden's body to Afghanistan for identification, then buried it at sea within 24 hours of his death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Al-Qaeda confirmed the death on May 6 with posts made on militant websites, vowing to avenge the killing. Other Pakistani militant groups, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, also vowed retaliation against the U.S. and against Pakistan for not preventing the operation. Bin Laden's killing was generally favorably received by U.S. public opinion; was welcomed by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union, and a large number of governments; but was condemned by some, including Fidel Castro of Cuba and Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Hamas administration of the Gaza Strip. Legal and ethical aspects of the killing, such as his not being taken alive despite being unarmed, were questioned by others, including Amnesty International. Also controversial was the decision to not release any photographic or DNA evidence of bin Laden's death to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_of_Osama_bin_Laden&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Big enough for most TB's and Coins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache isn't supposed to be difficult or challenging. I discovered this area while searching for rocks for my fish tank.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About fifteen feet to your right (facing the hill) there is an spring which flows out of the side of the hill and then goes back underground to Big Moccasin Creek.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the Locals has pointed this out to my attention: &lt;br/&gt;That spring you found? Hope that you did not drink any of that water. That's not a spring, It's a poop-ditch where the old Rail Road bed crossed over. You can see the other side. It is made from hand-cut stones, they must not have had any pipe back when they laid that track to Mendora and Bristol. It is mostly full of mud and the water runs under it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is starting out with the following items:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1 Log Book&lt;br/&gt;1 McD Stuffed Toy &lt;br/&gt;1 McD Mushu (from Mulan) figure&lt;br/&gt;4 REAL Sea Shells &lt;br/&gt;1 Rapella Spinner Lure&lt;br/&gt;2 Copy Cat TB's&lt;br/&gt;1 Cache Critter: Baa the Sheep&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Who knows what will come and go as the days pass! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had to move from the area and xenolith999 adopted it.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In Grogan Park in the Town of Gate City, Virginia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A rain garden is a planted depression that allows rainwater runoff from impervious urban areas like roofs, driveways, walkways, and compacted lawn areas the opportunity to be asorbed. This reduces rain runoff by allowing stormwater to soak into ground ( as opposed to flowing into storm drains and surface waters which causes erosion, water pollution, flooding, and diminished groundwater). Rain gardens can cut down on the amount of pollution reaching creeks and streams by up to 30%.&lt;br/&gt; Native plants are recommended for rain gardens because they generally don't require fertilizer and are more tolerant of one's local cilmate, soil, and water conditions. The plants, a selection of wetland edge vegetation, such as wildflowers, sedeges, rushes, ferns, shrubs and small trees take up excess water flowing into the rain garden. Water filters through soil layers before entering the groundwater system. Root systems enhance infiltration, moisture redistribution, and diverse microbial populations involved in biofiltration. Also, through the process of transpiration, rain garden plants return water vapor to the atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the plants in the Rain Garden have markers with their names on them. Enter in the code phrase the name of which plant is not native to the United States.    </groundspeak:long_description>

It was easy to find, but unfortunately not very pretty.  I'll go back in the spring because I'm sure it looks a lot better.

As required, I'm posting a picture and email in the CO the answer to his question.

(Hopefully my name will be entered in a drawing for a pair of cross-country SKI's)

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I ran across this Howitzer in our local Park that has a plaque that identifys it as a M114A2, which it is not. But a Schneider model of 1918.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 155mm Howitzer by Schneider, was the principal heavy howitzer piece of the French Army during the Great War. It started as a private enterprise, the design being made by Schneider to get a contract to equip the Russian Imperial Army with artillery. The gun itself proved to be an excellent piece, and when the War broke out in 1914 it was soon accepted by the French Army as well, who needed these types of modern, heavy howitzers - they had put too much faith in their cherished &quot;75&quot;. The first model, the mle 1915, employed brass cartridges for the charge, which was seen as a drawback, and a new model, the mle 1917, eventually superceded the first. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only difference between the two was some alterations to the Breech. It was a good gun, pretty light (weighing some 1.245 kilos), shooting a 43.5 kilo grenade a maximum range of some 11.500 metres - there were five different types of shells for this gun, including HE, Shrapnel and Gas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The soundness of the design was soon proved by the fact the the Americans adapted it, to equip it's Expeditionary Army in Europe - their copy was called M1917A1. It was still in both French and American service at the outset of the Second World War. (It was also used by a number of other countries, including Finland, who employed the piece with good effect during the Winter War.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The C15S had a swinging loading trough attached to the left side of the cradle. This was a feature that the later C17S lacked. Instead it used a removable loading tray that could be placed on the cradle when loading. Of course the later model had a de Bange pressed asbestos obturation pad on the face of the breech screw for use with bagged charges instead of using brass cases for obturation. Post war Soviet artillery designs (ie: the 122mm M-30 (M-1938) field howitzer, the 122mm A-19 corps gun (M-1931 and M-1931/37) and the 152mm ML-20 gun/howitzer (M-1910/34 and M-1937) all used a Schneider type breech modeled on those of the 105mm L13S field gun (in Russia this was the 107mm M-1910 field gun) and 155mm C15S (or should I say rather, upon the earlier Schneider 152mm M-1910 field howitzer), with separately loading cased ammunition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coordinates for the geocache container should be spot on, but well hidden out of sight. May be challanging to find. Just remember, attempt to find this cache at your own risk; cache owner assumes no responsibility or liability for any damage to person, property, or any other conceivable anything.&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Daniel Boone (October 22, 1734 – September 26, 1820) was an American pioneer, explorer, and frontiersman whose frontier exploits made him one of the first folk heroes of the United States. Boone is most famous for his exploration and settlement of what is now the Commonwealth of Kentucky (Kentucky), which was then beyond the western borders of the settled part of Thirteen Colonies (This region legally belonged to both the Commonwealth of Virginia and to the American Indian Tribes.) Despite some resistance from American Indian tribes such as the Shawnee, in 1778 Boone blazed his Wilderness Road through the Cumberland Gap in the Appalachian Mountains - from North Carolina and Tennessee into Kentucky. There he founded the village of Boonesborough, Kentucky, one of the first English-speaking settlements west of the Appalachians. Before the end of the 18th century, more than 200,000 European people migrated to Kentucky/Virginia by following the route marked by Boone.&lt;br /&gt;Boone was a militia officer during the Revolutionary War (1775 – 82), which in Kentucky was fought primarily between the European settlers and the British-aided Native Americans. Boone was captured by Shawnee Indians in 1778, who after a while adopted him into their tribe, but he later left the Indians and returned to Boonesborough in order to help defend the European settlements in Kentucky/Virginia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boone was elected to the first of his three terms in the Virginia General Assembly during the Revolutionary War, and fought in the Battle of Blue Licks in 1782, which was one of the final battles of the American Revolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the war, Boone worked as a surveyor and merchant, but he then went deeply into debt as a land speculator in Kentucky. Frustrated with all the legal problems resulting from his land claims, in 1799 Boone emigrated to eastern Missouri, where he spent most of the last two decades of his life (1800–20). When Boone and his family settled near Defiance, Missouri, that land west of the Mississippi River belonged to the French Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte, and not to the United States. That huge area of land was bought from the French by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boone remains an iconic figure in American history. He was a legend in his own lifetime, especially after an account of his adventures was published in 1784, making him famous in America and Europe. After his death, he was frequently the subject of heroic tall tales and works of fiction. His adventures—real and legendary—were influential in creating the archetypal Western hero of American folklore. In American popular culture, he is remembered as one of the foremost early frontiersmen. The epic Daniel Boone mythology often overshadows the historical details of his life.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.danielboonetrail.com/map.php?recordset=6

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Hanging Sheriffs of Scott County, Virginia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The word Sheriff comes from old England. Each Shire had a headman known as a Reeve. The title Shire Reeve gradually came to be run together in the single word Sheriff. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sheriff was the chief law enforcement in a Shire, a name for the division into which England is divided, which corresponds to counties in America. The Sheriff, with his appointed staff of deputies, maintained law and order, executed mandates of the Shire, maintained the jail and custody of prisoners there in, summoned jurors to court sessions and in the early day of the Shire, executed criminals who were condemned to death. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the early days of Scott County 1832-1885 the Sheriff did the same thing the sheriffs did in England. In Scott County there have been four sheriffs who had to carry out the order of the court and the unpleasant duty and hang the convicted for murder. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sheriff George McConnell was born February 24, 1770 in Lebanon, Dauphin, Pennsylvania. He came from Pennsylvania to Virginia and settled within the present limits of Russell County at Elk Garden, later migrated to the present limits of Scott County. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He was commissioned a justice of the peace February 15, 1815 by Governor William C. Nicholas for Scott County upon the recommendation of the court that he was a suitable person to hold such office. The oldest justice in said office in a county became sheriff. He held the office until he became the oldest justice and because of this became sheriff of the county. He served (1831- 1832). He hanged John Tumms November 9, 1832 for the murder of John Wright, the first man hanged in Scott County. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sheriff George McConnell was a weaver by trade. In those days most every one had a spinning wheel to spin their wool and linen into thread, but not every one had a loom. So they took their thread to George McConnell to be woven into cloth. While living in Pennsylvania he had been a merchant and in Russell County at Elk Garden before moving to Scott County. He was also a farmer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He married Susannah Schnebeli. Sometime down through the years the name became Snavely which means &quot;Dweller in a grove on a narrow strip of land. American Varant of Schnebli. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten children were born to the union of Sheriff George and Susannah Snavely McConnell. George Jr. married Polly Compton, Kate married Jerry Lawson, Thomas Price married first Lindy Phillips and second Mary Davis, Elizabeth married James Stallard, Henry married Sallie Kilgore, Joab Watson married Rebecca Kilgore, Priscilla married Jacob Cox, William G. married Drussilla Fugate, Samuel R. married Nancy Allen, Susan married Nathan Dougherty. Samuel and Susan were twins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sheriff George McConnell died in 1845. Susannah died in 1855. They are buried in the oldest known McConnell Cemetery in Scott County which is near Twin Springs High School at Glade Hollow. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benjamin Estill was judge when George McConnell was sheriff. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1858 Baxter I. Pate was in the Scott County jail at Estillville (now Gate City) for the murder of John Lutteril. The murder was committed in an upper room of the old corner hotel (later Compton Hotel) which is now a vacant lot opposite Quillen Hardware. Pate's execution was the second execution by judical decree in Scott County. Baxter Pate was in jail under an assumed name, McDaniel Rhea. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thomas Strong, one of the guards at the hanging, said &quot;I do not believe Pate was hanged because of some very strange actions and maneuvers which took place that day.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drayton S. Hale states, &quot;Twenty years after the hanging I spent the night with a Mister Kelly in Russell County, who advised me that Pate was not hanged but lived in one of the Western states. Mr. Hale was also an eye witness to the hanging which took place June 25, 1858.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The letter which Pate wrote from the Estillville jail in 1858, resulted in the plan which saved his life by means of a fake hanging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He was placed alive in the casket which his brother Masons had brought from North Carolina and hauled back toward home. He was from the Bee Log Community of Yancey County, North Carolina. He was freed at the Tennessee-North Carolina line and headed for Texas where he prospered. The casket was given a proper burial in the family cemetery. No one now remembers which field stone marks the grave. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two persons were sent from Scott County to open the grave and verify his death, but were prevented from doing so under threat of death. In the meantime a Mason was serving as Sheriff of Scott County (1857-58). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rufus Boyd Fugate was born in the Rye Cove section of Scott County in 1828. He was a large landowner and farmer. He was of the Methodist faith and one of the oldest members of the Rye Cove Masonic Lodge and served as master of the lodge many times. He also served as District Deputy Grandmaster of the Twelfth Masonic District. He married Sarah Jane Young from Stickleyville, Virginia. Rufus Boyd Fugate died in 1903. His wife, Sarah died in 1919. They are buried in the Fugate Cemetery in the Rye Cove. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rufus and Sarah Fugate had one son, James Colbert Fugate, born 1854, died 1939. He married a Margaret Elizabeth Thomas born 1851 died 1946. To this union nine children were born, six sons and three daughters. Listed below are their names and birth dates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lucinda Venus, 1876, William Rufus, 1877, James Edwin, 1880, Charles Radford, 1882, Elbert C. 1884, Eugene Dedrick, 1885, Nancy Jane, 1887, Patton Thomas, 1889 and Emma K., 1895. Elbert C. deceased in infancy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: No one living today knows who instigated the fake hanging. Was it the sheriff, his deputies, or his brother, Masons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Samuel V. Fulkerson was judge when Rufus Fugate was sheriff. During the July 1877 term of the Scott County Court, Daniel Dean was indicted for the murder of Henry Fugate. The case was tried three times. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first trial resulted in a mistrial because one-of the jurors voted for an acquittal of the accused, believing him innocent. At the second trial the jury could not agree on a verdict. A jury was brought from Washington County for the third trial and found Dean guilty of murder in the first degree purely on circumstantial evidence and sentenced him to death by hanging. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The junior who hung the first jury was J.R. Wilhelm. He was later elected Sheriff and it became his duty to hang Dean even though he believed him innocent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the way to the place of execution, Sheriff Wilhelm ask Dean, &quot;Did you murder Henry Fugate?&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To which Dean replied, &quot;No sir, I am as innocent as a newborn baby.&quot; Daniel Dean was hanged December 19,1879. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sheriff Wilhelm was the son of Charles Wilhelm and Adline Davis Wilhelm. Charles Wilhelm came from the Rhine Valley in Germany to America. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1860 census gives J.R. Wilhelm's age as 21 and his wife, Rebecca, age 20. She was from Tennessee, and one daughter, Nancy, age 6 months. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1870 census shows three children, Nancy, age 10, Charlotte, age 6 and Jonathan, age 3. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1880 census shows two children Charolette, age 16 and Jonathan, 13. Nancy is not mentioned in the 1880 census. I could not find any record of the family in the Scott Census after 1880. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has been told that he hanged Dean on the morning of December 19 and left the county that night, but we now know this is not true. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He resigned his office in June 1880 and vanished and was never seen or heard from by any Scott Countian again. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;George Gibson and Wayne Powers were hanged February 6, 1885 for the murder of Will Gibson by Sheriff W.C.R. Strong, known to his friends as &quot;Uncle Bill Strong&quot;. He was elected twice and faithfully served Scott County as High Sheriff. His first term was 1883-87 and it was during this term he hanged Gibson and Powers. His second term was 1891-1905. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Judge John A. Kelly was the judge during his first term as sheriff and Judge H.S.K Morrison was judge during his second term as sheriff. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sheriff Strong was the son of Samuel and Nancy Kilgore Alley Strong. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He was the grandson of The Rev. Robert Kilgore who built the Kilgore Fort House and the great-grandson of Patrick Porter who built Porter's Fort on Fall Creek near Dungannon. He was born March 31, 1839 and died December 11, 1918. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sheriff Strong was thrice married; first to Lizzie Fields, and to this union eight children were born. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hiram M. married first Louemma Lane and second Sarah Loving. Mary D. married Zion Frazier. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nancy married Wales Peters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elizabeth married John R. Stallard. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abijah married Emma Quillen. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robert married Lucy Peters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Samuel married Sidney Wax. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amanda married Isaac J. Taylor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His second marriage on February 15, 1888 to Elizabeth L. Carter and to this union one son was born, William C. who married Lottie Gilliam. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His third marriage was to Mattie V. Pendleton and to this union one daughter was born and she married Clarence Williams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time and place for the execution was fixed within limits by sentence of the court, between specified hours usually between 10 in the forenoon and 2 in the afternoon. The day of execution was on a Friday. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was not until 1908 General Assembly Legislators became alarmed by the spectacle of public hanging. The General Assembly mandated that all public hanging in the Commonwealth should cease. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this article we turn the pages of time to a period many years prior to the General Assembly of 1908 and reflect on court records, census records, and genealogy records of &quot;The Hanging Sheriffs of Scott County&quot;. &lt;br/&gt;Source:http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~vaschs2/hanging_sheriffs.htm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geocache is located along the upper sidewalk of Jackson street at the location of the old Compton Hotel. I can't remember the year that the site was razed, but I do remember the old delapidated building, and there was a Barber Shop on the corner of the structure. My family history that has been passed down to me by my Grandmother tells of a story about a Civil War veteran that was known as Wild Bill from Nickelsville. Little is known about him and it seems likely that he enlisted under a different name to the 48th Virginia regiment of the Clinch Mountain Boomers, or the 64th Virginia Mounted Infantry. He was a horse soilder according to my Grandmother, and a man of ill repute. They say he had his horse trained to stomp wounded enemy soilders that were left on the battle field. One of the storys about him took place at the Barber Shop here at the old Compton Hotel. Seems Bill was &quot;Shell Shocked&quot; and nearly deaf. He seldom ever spoke and never engauged in public conversation, and had one of the coldest, darkest stares. Most overlooked him, and no one crossed him. No dought Bill was a hard man. The story that I was told is that he would come to the Barber Shop maybe once a year for a hair cut. When the Barber was finished Bill would just stand up and walk off without paying. Another customer once questioned the Barber as to why he did not charge Bill, and the Barber responded &quot;the poor old SOB has it hard enough the way he is&quot;. He can pay if he wants to, and it's fine with me if he don't. &lt;br/&gt;There are two Cemeterys on the family property, one I was told by my Great Grandfather who was born in 1880 that it is a Slave cemetery, and I have traced deeds to the property to 1828. The other Cemetery is where my Dad, Grand Parents, and Great Grand Parents are buried. In one corner there are what appears to be two sunken unmarked graves, likely the final resting place of Cousin Bill from Spivey Mill, not Nickelsville. Nickelsville is likely where Bill enlisted in the Confederate Army under the name of Gilliam.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this listing, enter in the code phrase the number of drain holes in the wall along the sidewalk in front of the old hotel site at the listed coordinates. </groundspeak:long_description>

This beautifully landscaped area contains a wide variety of recreational opportunities in a rustic and wilderness setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The park contains many pathways for walking and trails for hiking.  One namely, the Black Forest Trail.  This area was the site of an event in my life in which i tried to make some major changes in the way i was living.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is my first cache.  Its filled with goodies and in an area where i expected to see more caches.  Happy hunting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a container approx. 6&quot; in length and 1.5&quot; in diameter.  It is black/tan in color.   </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Carolina, Clinchfield &amp; Ohio Railway built the taller of the two structures which stand before you in 1908. At 167 feet over the Copper Creek - Clinch River junction, the Copper Creek Viaduct was then one of the tallest railroad bridges in the eastern United States. Construction of this trestle and many other bridges and fifty five tunnels by the CC&amp;O opened up coal deposits in Virginia and Kentucky via a superbly engineered direct rail route to numerous cities in the Carolinas, Georga, and Florida. Prior to its compltion, alternate rail routes to these markets were over on hundred miles longer and featured some of the steepest grades in the United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than a century later this viaduct is still a vital link in the rail network of Clinchfield's successor company, CSX transportation. An average of 18 to 24 coal trains currently pass daily over this bridge, keeping the lights on in such major cities as Charlotte, Columbia, Jacksonville, Orelando, and Charleston. Northbound coal empties are returning to the rich coal seams of Eastern Kentucky, Virginia, and Southern West Virginia. Additional trains carrying general merchandise, grain, plastics, lumber, chemicals, and aggregates also pass over the trestle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lower bridge was constructed by the Southern Atlantic &amp; Ohio railroad around 1890 and is currently owned by Norfolk Southern corporation. Close to one hundred per cent of the business is handled by Norfolk Southern, though they are competitors, allow each to use the others tracks, so trains of both railroads can often be seen on either of the Copper Creek trestles. NS &amp; CSX have joint trackage rights over these trestles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highest trestle is over Copper Creek in southwest Virginia, and is known as the Copper Creek viaduct. From the surface of the stream to the track or rails on top of the trestle the height is 185 feet, and its length is 1,160 feet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: DC&amp;R marker at the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A side note that I find of interest is that my Great Grandfather was one of the men that helped build the taller trestle. A family member has a picture of him shoveling coal into a steam dingy that was a steam powered device that used a belt to supply power to the cranes used to build the trestle. </groundspeak:long_description>

Rumor is that Jim once swimmed across a River to where some poachers hounds had tree'd a big Coon. He tied some of the Hounds to a tree and waited out the poachers to retrieve their Hounds, then he arrested them.&lt;br/&gt;You won't have to swim a River to get to this geocache, but you will have to cross Copper Creek either by wading or useing the swinging bridge at Double Ford Road.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I added a new pathtag to our collection. This is one cool tag. My pathtags series must have been a good idea, now opencaching.com and pathtags.com are partners. How about that?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;This was a group project coin that originated in the pathtag community forums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It used to be, long ago that everyone came in with a smile on their face. They sat down at their computers and called up the geocaching.com website, eager to log into the Geocoin forums and &quot;chat&quot; with their many good friends. They talked about geocoins, and tracking numbers, how to log a coin and where to buy them. Time passed, geocoins evolved...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pathtags were born! The newest coolest thing since the geocoin. Small enough to fit into most any micro and trackable through their own website. News of these small wonders spread through the geocoin forums, with occasional pictures in the token threads or what's in your mailbox threads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Word of these wonderful little coins reached the GC headquarters and the Frog was not happy! &quot;What's all this talk of trackable coins?&quot; said he, &quot;I've never seen these before. They don't belong in my kingdom, they don't have my seal of approval. Remove them at once!&quot; Thus the guards tredge out of the castle and back to their computers and began removing all trace of such a thing as a pathtag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;___________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;Sorry got carried away there. Pathtags are great and fun and yes trackable on their own website, so if you find one of these tags in a cache or an envelope go ahead and log it in, there's great fun to be had in collecting and trading tags. Check out our forums you'll see! But don't bother mentioning it on Geocaching.com!&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Really a great write up by the tag designers, and true it is, and if I mention the &quot;P&quot; word one more time, my account will be BANNED from Groundspeaks forums. Thankfully OpenCaching.com and Pathtags.com are partners and I can combine two of my hobbys on one site.  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Making Moonshine is a American tradition here in the hills and hollers of the Appalachain Mountain region. Many of the people that settled in this area were the Scots and Irish, and their decendents are still here today with roots deeper than when Danl' Boone and his Ax Men cleared the Wilderness Road to Kentucky.&lt;br/&gt;Many to this day will argue with you that because Moonshining is part of their heritage, they have the right to distill alchol, and I agree with them. Only one MAJOR problem, the Law don't agree and it is illegal to distill one drop of alchol. You can brew all the beer or wine that you can drink, but un-taxed likker is illegal.&lt;br/&gt;Making Moonshine requires many skills, and there is only one rule. Don't get caught. That's where &quot;likker drops&quot; come in handy. You never do business face to face, you drop off and pick up the things that you need for the ingredents for your mash. You never have to use cash, your product pays for everthing, then you sell your tax free illegal product. Just like a famous Moonshiner once said, &quot;a gallon of likker will sale when a bushel of taters won't&quot;. And he knew well what he was talking about.&lt;br/&gt;So let's make some likker, virtual likker anyway. I'll mark some drop off points along a out of the way route for the ingredients that we will need for some corn squzeeings. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I'm goning to need some sugar. Even good malted corn needs that little extra kick, and only Dixie Crystals seems to do the trick.&lt;br/&gt;It's made from pure cane, and works better for making Christmas candy too. And unless you are in the candy business, buying too much sugar may attract attention. Kinda like buying lots of propane in 100 lb clyinders in the summer time. Most of the old timers say that a wood fired still gives the Moonshine a better flavor. I just don't see how, but I like a hot dog roasted on a stick over a fire better than one microwaved. There could be something to it, or a culteral art being lost.  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">NATURAL TUNNEL STATE PARK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Commonwealth of Virginia acquired the tunnel and 100 surrounding acres in 1967 from the Natural Tunnel Chasm and Caverns Corp. to establish Natural Tunnel State Park. Approximately 750 additional acres were later acquired and the park opened in 1971.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Natural Tunnel, called the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World&quot; by William Jennings Bryan, has been attracting sightseers to the mountains of southwestern Virginia for more than 100 years. Today it is the focal point of Natural Tunnel State Park, a park which offers visitors not only spectacular sights but also swimming, camping, picnicking, hiking, a visitor center, an amphitheater and interpretive programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creation of Natural Tunnel began more than a million years ago in the early glacial period when groundwater bearing carbonic acid percolated through crevices and slowly dissolved surrounding limestone and dolomite bedrock. Then, what is now Stock Creek was probably diverted underground to continue carving the tunnel slowly over many centuries. The walls of the tunnel show evidence of prehistoric life, and many fossils can be found in the creek bed and on tunnel walls.&lt;br/&gt;History of the Area&lt;br/&gt;Daniel Boone was probably the first white man to see the tunnel. However, no one wrote of it until Lt. Col. Stephen H. Long explored the site in 1831 and published an article in a geology journal in 1832. The areas near the tunnel were mined for saltpeter during the Civil War. In 1890 the South Atlantic and Ohio Railroad arrived and, making use of the natural formation, laid tracks through the tunnel. In 1906 Southern Railway acquired the tracks and created a passenger line, the Natural Tunnel Line, that went through the tunnel. Large coal deposits were discovered in the area shortly thereafter, and although they no longer carry passengers, trains continue to this day to carry coal through Natural Tunnel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Source: http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state_parks/nat.shtml&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">During the 1700's the Virginia frontier was still &quot;Indian Country&quot; and life was perilous for the few Whites that settled here. To protect themselves during Indian attacks, frontiersmen often built specially designed fortications known as Blockhouses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Blockhouse here at Natural Tunnel State Park is a recreation of the one built by John Anderson near the Moccasin Gap. It was a starting point on the road through the wilderness of Kentucky, and the station where travelers used to wait until parties collected large enough to defend themselves against Indians on the journey.&lt;br/&gt;http://www.danielboonetrail.com/photos.php?id=18&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While all Blockhouses were not identical, most were designed with features that made them easier to defend than a standard cabin. Bullets often penetrated the chinked spaces between logs in a cabin, so the logs of a Blockhouse were squared up tightly and fit together without chinking.&lt;br/&gt;Windows were replaced with small rectangular openings called firing ports, which enabled those inside to shoot out at attackers from any direction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second story of a Blockhouse usually extended beyond the first floor walls and had firing ports cut into the second story floor. This allowed those upstairs to fire down on anyone that managed to get close to the walls below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fireplace and chimney of a Blockhouse were built on the inside. This prevented the attackers from tearing the chimney down and enrering the building through the fireplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the East wall are wrought iron hangers that were used to hang meat or other items out of reach of varmits as a means of storage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Password is number of firing ports in the Blockhouse. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Kilgore Fort House is the only fort still standing of the twelve structures that once extended from Castlewood to Cumberland Gap along the Wilderness Road. The buildings protected early settlers from roaming bands of Indians during the late 1700s, at which time may similarly fortified houses could be found dotting the frontier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Around 1790, Reverend Robert &quot;Robin&quot; Kilgore built this fort on the shaded bank of Copper Creek to shield his wife and family from Indian attacks. He constructed the building from white oak log timbers, notched and joined at the ends, then chinked between with mud. Doors were made of heavy timbers that could be secured from the inside with a heavy bar. Although later inhabitants cut out windows, the original fort had only small gun ports in the walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kilgore Fort House was built with defense in mind, but was also a family's home. A stone fireplace and chimney were used for cooking and heating, and the building was divided up into two stories with two rooms on each floor. If occupants were attacked, they first retreated to the back room on the first floor, then could further retreat upstairs to make their final defensive stand in the northeast room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kilgore Fort House was restored in 1973 to 1974 and is privately owned. Visitors are welcome to view the historic landmark from the road, two miles west of Nickelsville, on highway 71.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this listing, enter the number of the information marker at the viewing area in the code phrase.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The cache name comes from the book and movie A Bridge Too Far.
Written by Cornelius Ryan, the World War II epic was a historic
telling of the failed attempt to capture several bridges to Germany
in WWII. The failed campaign was called Operation Market Garden.
Both the book and the movie were highly acclaimed by critics and
the viewing audiences for it's realism and grand scale. Marge and I
placed this cache after finding the Riverview Cemetery cache
(GCY7NC) which is a short drive down the road. Maybe this will help
draw more cachers to the area. After doing these two caches, you
have got to climb to the On Top Of Men-do-ta....(GC9718) cache.
It's grand!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a small magnetic key-holder. Please bring your own
pen. It shouldn't be hard to find but you may have to look a little
bit. If you want to make it easy see the hint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your camera and have a good caching day.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When the American Civil War broke out many brave son's of the Commonwealth joined the Confederate States of America to fight for their homeland and the Southern cause. One of these brave men was William Sevier McConnell, the second child of Ritchie and Nancy Allen McConnell. The family lived near here in Twin Springs just outside of Nicklesville. His Grandfather was Sheriff &quot;Hanging&quot; George McConnell who was married to Susanna Schnebeli (Snavley) and they were early pioneers in Scott County, Virginia. Sheriff George was the first Sheriff to hang a man in Scott County as his duty of Sheriff, which earned him the name of &quot;Hanging George&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;William Sevier McConnell enlisted in the Nickelsville Spartan Band in 1861 as 5th Sergeant in the Virginia 48th Infantry, Company E under the command of Henery M. McConnell which was part of the Army of Northern Virginia, which was organized at Big Spring near Abingdon, Virginia in September of 1861. The 48th fought in Jackson's Valley Campaign and later assigned to General J.R. Jones and W. Terry's Brigade of the Army of Northern Virginia and participated in many bloody conflicts, including the battles of Cross Keys, Port Republic,Cedar Mountain, Manassas, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg. Sgt. McConnell in his service to the 48th was promoted to 1st Lieutenant and commanded his Company and was promoted to Captain in October of 1863, and commanded his regiment at Payne's Farm just before the Battle of Mine Run, November 24th, 1863.&lt;br/&gt;Capt. McConnell was captured at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House on May12th. 1864, just a week after the Battle of the Wilderness just a few miles away.&lt;br/&gt;Capt. McConnell was taken as a Prisoner of War to Point Lookout, MD. He was POW there from May 14th, 1864 to June 23rd, 1864. On June 25th, 1864 Capt. McConnell was sent to the Federal POW Camp at Fort Delaware, Del. Once a Fort, now a prison. Capt. McConnell was imprisioned there for about two months before being transferred to Hilton Head, South Carolina as a POW on Morris Island which is locared in Charleston Harbor. There Capt. McConnell and other Confederate prisioners were used as human shields on the battlefield, exposed to cannon fire from both Confederate and Federal guns. In all they endured 45 days exposed to shellfire in an attempt to silence the Confederate artillery at Fort Sumter, and they soon came to be known as &quot;The immortal Six Hundred&quot;. On October 21st, 1864 Capt. McConnell was transfered to Fort Pulaski, Georgia where he remained until his final transfer on March 12th, 1865 to Fort Delaware. Capt. McConnell officially rendered  his oath of allegiance to the United States of America on June 16th, 1865.&lt;br/&gt;He returned to his home in Scott County, Virginia six months later and married Lucy Louisa Compton on January 15, 1866. They had three childeren. Martha, Mary, and William Paris McConnell.&lt;br/&gt;Just on a side note, Capt. McConnell's gravestone and the one placed by the Son's of Confederate Veterans are the only ones in the family Cemetery that face West and not East. Normally this is a tradition in the area to disrespect the dead, but this is in the family cemetery. I'm sure that he wanted to be remembered as a Rebel against the United States of America because of his treatment as a POW.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In memory of my friend Wayne G. McConnell, a local historian that took the time to teach me quite a bit of local history in the Nicklesville area.</groundspeak:long_description>

In this piece of land are buryed over 13 Confederate Soilders, their names are presently unknown, but efforts are underway to find some record of their names and place of burial. Near by is the Tombstone of John Dunlap Gay, a young Confederate Soilder who became ill with Typhoid Fever as his unit was marching through the area. A Nickelsville family took him in and cared for him until his death. Many years after the War, James Monroe McConnell was traveling through Clark County Kentucky selling fruit trees when he contacted a Mrs. B.  F. Curtis, Mr. Gay's sister, and told her of her brothers death and burial in Nickelsville, Virginia. Through their efforts this Tombstone was erected in the 1890's. &lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In 1831, James Culbertson built a grist mill on Amos Branch outside Nickelsville. The mill was a simple log structure, but it quickly became the bustling center of the community, providing residents with corn meal and flour for their tables, feed for their livestock, and a lively place to exchange information and gossip. Farmers traveled for miles on horseback with their sacks of grain, or in horse-drawn wagons with loads of Indian corn and wheat. The mill created a community and also relieved the farmers of the arduous task of grinding grain on hand “gritters”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later, the land and mill passed into the hands of Valentine Bush and his wife, Nancy Gose Bush, who moved to the area from Russell County. The Bush family added a water-powered sawmill upstream and a water-powered wool carding machine downstream. They also continued to operate the grist mill until April 1, 1895, wen a fire broke out in the structure. By the time help arrived, the mill was too far gone to save.But the community could not function without a mill. Over the next two years, Valentine Bush, now 88 years old, and his sons constructed the historic Bush Mill that now stands outside Nickelsville. The mill continued to operate until well into the 1950's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this listing as a find, enter the date on the front of the Mill and what is written above it.</groundspeak:long_description>

We don't call ourselves nothing, not Home Guards, National Guards, or even Virgil's Knights like some of the folks up the River in Dungannon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geocache is a lock-n-lock painted and marked as so, and stocked with OX swag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I stop here and drink Beer every day on my way to work, so I will maintain this geocache. It is large enough to hold trackables and other nice items. Like AK-74 in photo. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please do not leave ammo in cache. We have enough, thank you. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The M60A3 is a fully tracked, heavily armored, close combat tank. Enhancements over the M60A1 consist of a laser rangefinder, an improved engine and transmission, a thermal shroud for the main gun, an engine smoke generator, a solid state computer, and a thermal gunner's sight. The M60A3 was last producedfor the U.S. Army in 1980, however, production continued for Foreign Military Sales until May 1985. The main gun is the M68 105mm rifled cannon. Secondary armament includes an M85 .50 caliber machine gun, and two six-barreled smoke gernade launchers. The tank carries 63 main gun rounds, 900 .50 caliber rounds and 5,950 7.62mm rounds. The crew consistsof a commander, gunner, loader. and driver. The system has a combat weight of 5.7 tons, and has a top speedof 30 miles per hour. The M60A3 carries 375 gallons of fuel, giving it a cruising range of 280 miles. &lt;br/&gt;Lenght 372&quot;&lt;br/&gt;Width 142&quot;&lt;br/&gt;Height 127&quot;&lt;br/&gt;Weight 55-57 Tons  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to our continuing Fallin' For Virginia series of caches.
This cache is the beautiful Garrett Creek Waterfalls. The falls are
about 40 foot high and 40 foot wide. Park at the wide spot in the
road on the left hand side at the given coordinates. Coordinates
are not super accurate due to being in a narrow valley. Best
accuracy obtained was 29 feet. Nothing real dangerous here but
don't pull you car too far off the road and when going to the top
of the falls (to find the cache), don't fall over the edge. After
finding the cache, you may want to walk down the road a bit to get
a better view of the falls. Many thanks to the owner of this
property for granting permission. Out of respect and thanks to Mr.
Mullins, please use CITO. Not reccomended for very small children.
Enjoy Nature's beauty and have a good caching day. Bring your
camera. Please put cache container back exactly as you found
it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;

     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;NOTE: On June 20, 2006 we replaced the muggled cache.
New container is a bit smaller and is a 6 inch diameter round
rubbermaid box. Room for small trade items. Kept same coordinates
but moved cache 30 feet up (falls) trail from the old spot. You may
need to use new hints.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKPX2A - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 36° 45.407 W 082° 04.991&lt;br /&gt;Parkingt</groundspeak:long_description>

This was the first geocaching event hosted by Scott County Tourism, and T-shirts and a geocoin were included with this pathtag.&lt;br/&gt;There is another pathtag created for Scott County Toursim that was part of a challange, and is not listed on the pathtag site. The first to log 15 of 20 geocaches placed by SCT was my daughter, and it took over a year for 15 caches to be placed. She was FTF on several hides and recieved a letter for being the first County resident to complete the challange.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The Cabin Creek Waterfall is about 70 foot plus high. Now, there
is only a small amount of water falling but it is still worth
seeing because of the rock formations. Early this past spring when
we found the falls, the water was really flowing. The creek finally
empties into the North Fork of the Holston River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is too dangerous and also posted so do not attempt to go off
the road (to the left) to get closer to the falls. You can view and
photograph the falls very well from the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you will see, the road is narrow and goes down through a
valley which made it very difficllt to get good/accurate GPS
readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;If you are able to get a good reading at the cache site, please
post the coordinates.&lt;/b&gt; You may need to use the hints. Marge and
I want cachers to find our caches without too much difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The cache container is a small camo-taped box which is 1 by 2 by
6 inches. Room for small tradeables only i.e. pins, etc. Please put
the cache back the way you found it. Thanks and have a good caching
day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: Our Fallin For Virginia XI - Falls Hill Creek cache

This is another beautiful but &quot;unknown&quot; waterfall of Southwest
Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falls Hill Creek tumbles down the mountain to shortly join the
North Fork of the Holston River. Along the way, it forms two falls
(35 feet and 20 feet high respectively). Here you get two falls for
the price of one plus a narrow ravine which forms a pretty rock
flume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk back up the road for about 120 feet to get the best view of
the larger falls. There is no need to leave the road to view the
falls or to find the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother Nature was trying to out do herself with this one. Please
bring your camera and &lt;b&gt;please put the cache exactly back where
you found it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very close by is our Fallin For Virginia V - Cabin Creek cache
(GCWQ2K). Yes, this one is number &lt;b&gt;eleven&lt;/b&gt; and in less than
two miles is number &lt;b&gt;five&lt;/b&gt;. What can we tell you. We take 'em
as we see 'em or in other words, we cache them as we find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy and have a good caching day.&lt;/p&gt;

features some of Southwest Virginia's most beautiful waterfalls.
Take your camera and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fall Creek begins way up in the mountains and empties into
the Clinch River at Dungannon, Virginia. Before the Creek becomes
part of the Clinch it displays a beautiful waterfall. You may not
be able to get close to the falls because there is a very sharp
drop (maybe 150 feet) into the Creek valley. If you are real
careful, you can make your way down to the Falls. You must find the
cache and view the Falls from the road. Even though you will not be
close and there are a lot of trees, the view is still very
nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a short walk from the parking area. You are looking
for a magnetic key-holder. Please replace the cache exactly as you
found it. Thanks and have a good caching day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to &lt;b&gt;mtmanva2&lt;/b&gt; for help in placing this
cache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKWW4Q - Park Here&lt;br /&gt;N 36° 49.822 W 082° 26.969&lt;br /&gt;Parking for cache</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We used our Cell phones with GPS to try to find this. We lost our cell signal and apparently the app relies on the cell data to draw the map. I had my GPS position but we didn't know where to go exactly.  We did get close - probably less than 20 feet or so.  One side of the creek is private property and is posted as no trespassing. The other side is very difficult terrain but we are pretty sure the cache is on that side. very steep cliffs and thick brush combined with no cell signal made it impossible.  I should have brought my Garmin - maybe that would have worked since it works off of just GPS.
We didn't see any signs with any of the names listed, just went by the GPS locator.
I'll be back......and better prepared.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our continuing Fallin' For Virginia cache series. The
series features some of the most beautiful water falls of Southwest
Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is placed very near the Upper Falls of the Little
Stony Creek. The trail follows the Little Stony Creek for 2.8 miles
through a 400 feet deep and 1700 feet wide gorge. You are not going
nearly that far but it is worth taking the hike the whole distance.
Many rapids, stone formations and small waterfalls can be seen
along the trail. There are three other caches along the trail
within a .5 mile hike from the parking area. They are: The
Troll...(GCMDGK), Fallin'...VIII (GCWW5M) and
Granny's...(GC57DF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special thank you goes to &lt;b&gt;mtmanva2&lt;/b&gt; for his help in
placing this cache. He is what caching is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a small Rubbermaid container that is
camo-taped. You may need to use the hints because GPS reception was
most difficult. &lt;b&gt;Please post your coordinates if your GPSr is
receiving with good accuracy.&lt;/b&gt; Take your camera, bathing suit
and picnic supplies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Please place the cache and everything else back as you found
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't forget &lt;b&gt;CITO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Have a good caching day.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKWW5C - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 36° 52.167 W 082° 27.827&lt;br /&gt;Parking area for Upper falls</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Must have over-looked this one again today, was kinda busy looking for snakes because we had our hopes up in finding one after we found a dead timber rattler missing the head and tail down near the falls. I don't understand why someone would take the head and the rattles and leave the good eating part. After looking at the clue, we had to be close. At least the GPS was half-way working, but too much signal bounce. I lost signal at the 2nd bridge all the way to the 4th bridge, without good clues this place is very tough to cache. Thanks for the hide, I'll keep searching.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the latest edition of our Fallin' For Virginia cache
series. We are attempting to bring you to the most beautiful
waterfalls of Southwest Virginia. This waterfall is just below the
Upper Water Falls of the Little Stony Creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the parking area you will pass the Upper Falls and it's
cache (GCWW5M) Continuing down the trail will bring you to the
Troll cache (GCMDGK) and then to this falls and cache. If you go an
another short distance you can find &quot;Granny's&quot; cache (GC57DF). The
entire trail is 2.8 miles in length through a 400 foot deep and
1700 foot wide gorge. Of course, you are not going that far but you
might want to. The trail is fairly gentle and there are many
wonders of nature to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPS reception was very difficult so you may need to use the
hints. &lt;b&gt;If you don't mind, post your coordinates at the cache if
your GPS is recieving with good accuracy.&lt;/b&gt; You are looking for a
camo-taped Rubbermaid container. Please put the cache and
everything else back the way you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By all means, take your camera. Take good walking shoes and your
bathing suit (warm weather only, ha!). Great place for a picnic.
Please practice CITO. The place is very clean but there are those
who respect nothing. When placing the cache, we saw some trash but
didn't have a bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to give a special thanks to &lt;b&gt;mtmanva2&lt;/b&gt; for acting as
the guide for the trip and help in placing the cache. He is what
caching is all about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKWW5M - Perking

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The small town of Appalachia, Virginia is surrounded by numerous coal camp communities. They include Andover, Arno, Derby, Roda, Imboden, Exeter, Dunbar, Pardee, Osaka, and Stonega. Many of these communities formed at the beginning of the century with the arrival of the mining and railroad industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year, usually in the first week of August, the residents of Appalachia and the surrounding area celebrate their heritage in a week long celebration known as Coal/Railroad Days. The festival includes a 5K road race, music concerts at the town's amphitheater, amusement rides, street vendors, a parade, and numerous other festival type events. Twice, Coal/Railroad days has coincided with other celebrations in Appalachia. In 2000 the town took part in a mass high school reunion, known as Appy 2000. In 2006, the festival was part of the Appalachia 100 celebration that marked the 100th birthday of the Town of Appalachia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town of Appalachia holds two world records. Bee Rock Tunnel, the world's second-shortest railroad tunnel, and the Peake Building. An apartment house with street-level access on all four floors. It is listed as a virtual geocache &quot;Happy at Appy&quot; - GCB9B8 http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=c131ed45-d6fa-4328-bdac-2b1d690610ef&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here along Main street is a veterans memorial wall that honors veterans that have lived in Wise County. One is Sgt. Edward R. Talley. He was a United States Army Soldier who received the Medal of Honor for his actions near Ponchaux, France during World War I. He was a Sergeant in Company L, 117th Infantry, 30th Division when he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions on October 7, 1918.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undeterred by seeing several comrades killed in attempting to put a hostile machine gun nest out of action, Sgt. Talley attacked the position single-handed. Armed only with a rifle, he rushed the nest in the face of intense enemy fire, killed or wounded at least 6 of the crew, and silenced the gun. When the enemy attempted to bring forward another gun and ammunition he drove them back by effective fire from his rifle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this listing as a find, enter in the code phrase  the middle name of the persons name on the memorial brick to the left of Sgt. Tally's memorial block on the wall.       </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
FTF Honors to
drmageek24!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;With black ravens scavenging the grounds, Draygo scouted this
location on a dark dark storm cloudy day. While exploring the area
he came across what had to be a giant's footprints in the snow that
were nearly melted away by the constant drizzle of rain. Each
stride was a full yard apart and the length of each footprint was
16+ inches! Be on the look out.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enjoy the view, take photos, and tell about your experience
finding the cache. Just don't be shy to share a story. Please
assure that the cache is hidden from view when placing it
back.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cache is a small 'lockit' container with several
tradable items and can only be accessed during the day since it is
law to stay out of cemeteries at night and out of respect pass this
one up during a funeral service. There's only one way in and one
way out with one place to park at the top.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache should be a quick find so parking in the road
shouldn't be a problem. But if using the pull off, be advised not
to park there when wet for the possibility of getting bogged down
in the muck.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please log all trades and try to trade up if possible. What I
place in a cache is based on the conduct of the geocachers. So far
it seems like I'm going to have to set out 35mm canisters.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Challenge yourself to a 2 star terrain and an overall rating
of 2 by walking up the hill to this cache from the Norton
Presbyterian Church parking lot. Do so if you geocache for the
exercise or feel uncomfortable driving up. A sponge animal capsule
has been placed in the cache to signal a leak.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A place dedicated to the town's founder Harvey Wells and to some of our fallen Military.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a nano so bring your own pen or pencil it is log only also and if you have the time you can scout around for a &quot;proto&quot; cache placed during Wellston's Centennial in 1973.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also you &quot;Might&quot; need tweezers to remove the log being the cache is really small. Also there is a good chance that muggles will be about so use your best &quot;Secret Agent Fu&quot; and engage in some misdirection when you go about finding and replacing the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

I've enjoyed the first few (of many) caches I've found in the state so far, and wanted to give back.  Cache is a 50 cal ammo can with various swag, including an unactivated geocoin key-chain for the FTF.  Cache is placed on private property with the owner's permission.  From where the cache is, you can see the bird-feeder in back, and may be able to catch a glimpse of the variety of birds that hang out here.  The area also gets frequent visits from squirrels, raccoons, and deer.  Also, take a good look around.  Depending on the time of day and the weather, you may see one or two travel bugs parked next to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrats to illinitrekker and StarWarsFan98 on FTF!

Here you will find the latest count of caches in the series&lt;br /&gt;and find out how you can add your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it looks like downtown, Athens doesn't have a&lt;br /&gt;downtown! Instead, we have &quot;uptown&quot;. Court Street is a place where&lt;br /&gt;you can get the full feel of this town. In the summer, it's true&lt;br /&gt;small town, with the street made from local brick and a nice, slow&lt;br /&gt;pace. In the fall, however, it becomes a busy college town with&lt;br /&gt;lots of activity going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that, because this is in Uptown, you will have to feed a&lt;br /&gt;parking meter if you come during the day on Monday-Saturday. Cache&lt;br /&gt;is a micro container attached with velcro. The business at this&lt;br /&gt;location has given permission to hide the cache here and will be&lt;br /&gt;keeping an eye on it. If they're open, you can poke your head in&lt;br /&gt;and say hi to Allen. I stop in and see him every couple of&lt;br /&gt;weeks!&lt;/p&gt;

Had to use 4wd on this road to get back to the cemetery.  If it is icy/snowy, beware because you can get down the hills but may not get back up without 4wd [;)]

Found the cache with little trouble, very nice hide!  Glad to see this cemetery with an active cache, it is such a neat spot to visit.

I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival. It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward forever more. ” &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adams' prediction was off by two days. From the outset, Americans celebrated independence on July 4, the date shown on the much-publicized Declaration of Independence, rather than on July 2, the date the resolution of independence was approved in a closed session of Congress&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most enduring myths about Independence Day is that Congress signed the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. The myth had become so firmly established that, decades after the event and nearing the end of their lives, even the elderly Thomas Jefferson and John Adams had come to believe that they and the other delegates had signed the Declaration on the fourth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a remarkable series of coincidences, both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, two founding fathers of the United States and the only two men who signed the Declaration of Independence to become president, died on the same day: July 4, 1826, which was the United States' 50th anniversary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the above information was taken from Wikipedia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some very interesting facts we did not know about our independence. We should be thankful every day for our independence.  A lot of men and women have paid heavy prices for us to have it.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Robinsons Cave is located behind Dunkle Hall in New Straitsville.  Please follow the signs and go across the correct foot bridge. It's a fairly easy walk up recently added steps which take visitors easily to the cave. Not wheelchair friendly, dawn to dusk&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mississippian Period began around 359 million years ago and ended around 318 million years ago. Mississippian-age rocks crop out in a north-south band in east-central Ohio from the Ohio River to near the Lake Erie shore and then eastward in northeastern Ohio. They are well exposed in much of this area because they consist primarily of erosion-resistant sandstones and sandy shales that form prominent cliffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Early Mississippian progressed, coarser sands representing the offshore portions of delta lobes formed by many west-flowing streams built up thick deposits of sand and sandy shale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the more interesting units of the Lower Mississippian is the Black Hand Sandstone. The nearly pure quartz sandstone reaches about 200 feet in thickness in the Hocking Valley and crops out to the north into Licking and Richland Counties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mississippian rocks have been important to the economic development of the state, although it is less today than in the past. The Black Hand Sandstone and Buena Vista Sandstone of the Cuyahoga Formation have been important building stones. The Buena Vista of southern Ohio is still quarried. Oil and gas have been produced in modest quantities from Mississippian rocks, particularly the Black &lt;br/&gt;Hand in the subsurface of southern Ohio. The Bedford Shale was once an important source of clay for bricks and tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the most spectacular scenery in Ohio is due to thick, erosion-resistant sandstones of Mississippian age. The Black Hand Sandstone, in particular, forms high cliffs, large rock-shelter caves, and waterfalls in its areas of outcrop from Hocking County northward to Richland County.  Robinson's cave is one of those rockshelters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Citation&quot;Mississippian Period&quot;, Ohio History Central, July 1, 2007,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On a forested hillside south of New Straitsville, this cave offered a secluded location with great acoustics where large groups of Hocking Valley coal miners could meet in secret. Beginning in about 1870, labor-organizing meetings were held at the cave by various emerging unions including the Knights of Labor. New Straitsville resident Christopher Evans, a well-known union organizer, used Robinson's Cave to lead miners throughout the long Hocking Valley Coal Strike of 1884-1885. These meetings gave the miners a voice in the formation of a national organization called the National Federation of Miners and Mine Laborers, later renamed the National Progressive Union. The cave was also where non-union miners met to plan to set the Columbus &amp; Hocking Coal &amp; Iron Company mines on fire in a desperate attempt to end the Hocking Valley Strike. In 1886, the Knights of Labor founded the National District Assembly #135, a rival for the National Federation of Miners and Mine Laborers. Oddly, both headquarters were located in New Straitsville. Dissension between the two groups hurt labor negotiations, but Christopher Evans continued to hold meetings to settle differences. In response to a miner's death in 1889, the feuding miners used Robinson's Cave to reconcile once and for all. Evans called miners together again in 1890 for the first organizational meeting of the United Mine Workers of America, the name formally adopted at their next meeting in Columbus. This series of historic meetings is why Robinson's Cave is referred to as the secret birthplace of the United Mine Workers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this Earthcache, you must identify the darkest colored layer in the exposed strata of the cave walls.  You must then read the posted history in the area, and tell us the local &quot;slang term&quot; for what is contained in that layer. Please post of photo of yourself at the cave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to illinitrekker, StarWars98 and the non-logging member for FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

Built as a guard lock, it was intended to permit slackwater navigation of the Hocking River by regulating water depths where river and canal met. Those plans were later abandoned and the mechanism was converted to a lift lock, which raised and lowered boats as required by changes in the canal's elevation.&lt;br/&gt;Please CITO</groundspeak:long_description>

You will want to park at the Creek Side Meadows Picnic/Parking area and take the Cemetery Ridge Trail to the cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking Coordinates &lt;br/&gt;N 39° 35.336 W 082° 34.653&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Creekside Meadows trail will take you to the Cemetery Ridge Trail. You will want to go North from parking lot. Please always practice CITO in all Parks or Cache sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Cache was placed not only for fun and swag but has a history lesson to it as well. Don’t worry no grading or testing will be done. The walk to the cache is all the way up to a ridge top that will lead to the cache. Again it is a bit of an uphill trek on the way in. When you reach the cache you will find something near that you don’t have the privilege of seeing often and maybe for some never. Anyway it is a very interesting area and we hope you enjoy it as much as we have. There is much more to see and many more trails to hike in the park as well. On your way into the park you will go by a large rock sitting beside the road (It has been called Leena, or Leaning rock) and sometimes will have sticks appearing to hold it up that people stop and leave. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Container is a camo gallon size container&lt;br/&gt;Original Contents: Hot Wheels car on card, Three stretchy spiders, 1974 Gremlin Travel Bug, Fairfield county parks Frisbee, Three Dinosaurs, NASCAR Metal Stamp, First to Find prize package.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special Prize package for FTF &lt;br/&gt;No hints needed&lt;br/&gt;Please Re-Hide well&lt;br/&gt;Place with Permission and permit&lt;br/&gt;Permit Number 09-001-08&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to Ken Brown and Marty Shull for their time and the permit.</groundspeak:long_description>

It was a cold and blustery day and we decided to take the Fern Trail up to the Cemetery Ridge Trail.  We figure we hiked about 5 miles total and getting the cache was the perfect thing to do in this awesome park!

Stop picking plaster.&lt;br/&gt;3.If it is or ever has been alive, it's not the cache or the hiding place.  Many living things reside here, please be respectful to their house.&lt;br/&gt;4.This cache was never intended to be easy.  It's not a dirty trick, it's just plain hard.&lt;br/&gt;5.The cache is in plain sight.&lt;br/&gt;6.It's not under anything, so flipping, moving, deconstructing, removing, or disassembling ANYTHING is not only not required, but is also severely frowned upon by the owners of the cache and the site itself.&lt;br/&gt;7.There is very little in the garden that isn't intended to be there.  Do not step on ANY plantlife while visiting the garden.  The plants may look like weeds to you, but they are not.  Some of the beds were planted with seeds, and the plants are still growing.  Please be respectful to the hard efforts of your local Geocachers by practicing CITO, and treading lightly.&lt;br/&gt;8.The code on the back of the log must be verified for your prize, but signing the log will get you a smiley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entrance located within 25 feet of on-street parking. Enter the store that sells air and sunshine.  On community property that is available only during day light hours. Feel free to CITO the place as you look.  Probably not handicap accessible due to a couple steps.  IF YOU FIND THE CACHE, IT UNSCREWS.  IF YOU TRY TO PULL IT APART, YOU WILL BREAK IT.  Be sure to screw it all the way back down, the last turn seems like too much, but it needs to be closed.  The only hints for this one are in the poem above.&lt;br/&gt;  There are a few local characters you will no doubt either run into, or at least see on your visit here.  They are harmless for the most part.  They are good for a story or 30 about days gone by in this lonely little place.  I have talked to a couple of them, but only about history.  If any of the Sunday Creek people stop in to say hello, they like hearing about how far you traveled to see their garden.</groundspeak:long_description>

Thanks for the cache! Be back next year!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">OMG!!! Wow, what can we say about this cache that hasnt already been said. We cannot believe we finally found it, and what better time to find it than at the recent C.I.T.O. and 1K milestone celebration. We have looked for this little bugger for so long, its nice to be able to take a smilie for it but we are sad to see it go. This little cache has brought us so much in the past two years, we appreciate everything that the cache owners have put into this little bugger that has brought us so much. We have spent so much time here, lost so many hours of sleep ever this one, driven many hours just to pull a slew of DNFs - this had to be on of the best caches we have ever done :) But to find it during the C.I.T.O. was the best - and we were glad it didnt turn out to be the group find we thought it might. Everyone made the find their way and got to experience that moment of jubilation when then got their hands on the cache, and then figure out a way to sneak it back into place so the next finder could experience the thrill of the adventure. We were probably the 5th group to find it during the event, but no one spoiled it for us, and we have to thank them for that :) We are sure it was difficult to hold in the excitement of finally making the find on this one. So ... thanks to TeamGuisinger on the really nice and creative cache and giving us the hours of frustration in looking for it. Also, thank you for the friendship and the opportunity to meet and make so many friends here - THIS IS WHAT THIS CACHE INSPIRES !!! Took: a sigh of relief after finding the cache, Left: a feeling of accomplishment on finally finding this cache, SL. TFTC!!!</groundspeak:text>

Well this year it was different :)

Latito was found!  We were 4th to find today.  Great,  great hiding spot and I cannot believe we did not see this before.  Very clever. 
Thanks so much to TeamG and TeamDotOne for  the effort put into the event  and  for bringing a lot of friendly wonderful people together with two common goals :
Clean up  the garden…and FIND THAT DARN CACHE!     Now we can take this one off the list but we will still stop and visit the garden.
Now let’s talk about that  confounded  Bridge.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well - this was creekstompers first attempt at Latito.  We have never done any of your other caches, and we thought hey, what the heck let's try the one that no one has found yet.  Wouldn't it be something to get a FTF on the most elusive cache ever logged?

We walked through the front door of the store that sells air and sunshine.  We both stood there for several minutes, and didn't say a word, taking it all in.  Reading the poem over and over, over and over, over and over.  Taking the &quot;hint&quot; from the recent log you posted.  Then started looking.  The leaves made it almost impossible, and if we would have known we could have taken much leaves and debris away.  It is obvious the local kids are vandalizing it and homeless may be living there.  The place seems unsafe, but safe at the same time?  The local drunk guy was watching us and we were surprised that he didn't walk down to ask us for money.  It seemed so odd to be in such a small town rummaging around someone else's building and &quot;stuff&quot;.  We tried to imagine what this place could have been, how old the building was, what used to be in the showcase windows up front.  But none of that helped us to find this one.

We may clearly be in over our caching ability on this one.  It is intriguing, but at the same time, so frustrating that we might just wait for someone to find this before attempting it again.  We don't want to say we are giving up, but due to the distance required to travel to search it we may not be able to come down here and search it very often.

No complaints here, and to the one who is the FTF on this one - we would love to meet you and hear the grand story behind this one ;)  You will be the hero of the local caching community.

While following the gps, I thought that I saw a tack and went to check it out while the others followed the electronic arrow.  It ends up my &quot;fire tack&quot; was a trail marker, so I met back up with the group as they were crossing the stream.  After a short hike up the hill we found the first real fire tack, and quickly had the final spotted.   I originally nominated dkington to be the one to &quot;go in&quot;, but when I saw how awesome the hiding spot was I just dove right in and got the container!   Awesome hiding place!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">First night cache of the evening, a perfect start to the Perry Co. Nocturnal Trifecta.  I absolutely love this patch of woods at night. The cache was perfect, especially the final.   It was so cool to open the log book, and see the names of countless others that had been here before me and imagining their joy at reaching this place.  I then imagined  Native Americans treasuring this spot for all that it has to offer, surely this was once a dwelling place.

Thanks for the cache.

They weren't responding via phones, so we just hoped they were there...pulled up and flashed our brights at all of the headlamps and scared them a bit by announcing they shouldn't be out there!  They finally realized who it was and daddy joined them on the walk as the lil ruts were sleeping already!  daddy enjoyed strategically replacing rocks across the stream so richie wouldn't get his toesies cold and then he enjoyed the final location!  well worth the hike.

Muggles where EVERYWHERE today, and we just didn't feel comfortable going up to the bridge and looking since we know this has been a trouble spot for muggle activity.  We waited probably ~30 minutes before heading out.  There just wasn't going to be a good break to find it today....and you know we will be back since we travel this route often! 

We are surprised that illinitrekker didn't beat GeoServidor to the FTF on this one!! [;)]  Congrats GeoServidor!</groundspeak:text>

I hope that any who hunt it will keep that in mind and do their best to not break it and re-hide it well. Thank you in advance! (and don't worry you don't have to risk life and limb)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is placed approx. 500 feet from the road. Park alongside and follow the left side of the stream to the cache. If you immediately get on top of the hill it's a fairly level hike. There is overgrowth, but not many thorns/briars. Bring the bug spray.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is VERY well hidden and will probably (hopefully) take you a while to find. When you finally find it, please be gentle in removing it.  It is much easier to retrieve than to replace. A somewhat significant amount of upper body strength will be required to replace the cache. It's easier with a partner. I was able to do it without much trouble. Bring a pair of gloves. If for any reason you are unable to put it back, first...try harder, then contact us ASAP so we can do it.  Our other cache in this area has been muggled several times and I would hate for that to happen again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reception is bad in the valley. Coordinates were taken over several days and averaged. &lt;br/&gt;No hints as of yet. We will post one if we feel it is necessary. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;June 2012-After a long time in a sad state, this cache has been returned to it's original glory.  If you found it in a sad state, we encourage you to visit again and take an additional smiley. :)</groundspeak:long_description>

When I saw the deficiency of boats pulling into the parking lot, I was set a bit at ease.  However, for the first few hours of the event, this island was calling out to me.  I wanted to just paddle over there and see what was going on. Had I read the cache page before hunting, I would have been set at ease a little more!
Myself Alfamonkey, and daige4 set sail as only an armada of determined terrain junkies could. We paddled our way to the island, and after a brief glance, precious breadcrumbs were spotted.


Fabulous cache, on a fabulous island, on a fabulous day, with fabulous friends.

Thanks Team G

We arrived fully prepared for the exercise, and noticed upon exiting the vehicle that we were gonna &quot;wing it&quot;.  We made an initial pass to make sure it was gonna work, and after returning to the car to grab some gear, we plopped down in our new ride.  We felt the burn for about 20 odd minutes, and ran it ashore.  Made the grab, and hotfooted it back to the &quot;parking area&quot;.  TFTC TNLNSL  	[}:)]</groundspeak:text>

We saw the whole park series pop up on the Blackberry late Saturday night.  Loaded up the kayaks and headed out at the crack of dawn.  We KNEW we had to get there early, because with the likes of GeoServidor, illinitrekker, Team G and CTeam who could possibly beat us to the location (we drove only a few miles for this one [;)]), we would have to get there REAL early.  

We are paddling up to the island, mist still rising off the water, and with all the boats around we got worried.  Not another STF for creekstompers (would have been one of dozens).  When we pulled out the blank white paper, I think the whole lake heard us cheering!  We could NOT pass up this water cache, as we are avid kayakers.  We were just thrilled to get the FTF on this one.  Stuck around and did some fishing, JB creekstomper caught a 9&quot; crappie, but no bass today.

GeoServidor, we took the FTF prize and it paid for some gas in the creekstompers truck.  We know it's hard to beat you to the FTF in your neck of the woods, so we hope you take that as a compliment!  Sorry we didn't get to meet you out on the water.

Long pants, boots, and bug spray are also recommended. The given
coordinates will take you to a stump. Park on the road directly in
front of that spot. Use your flashlight to lead you to the correct
stump and note the type of marker that is used because you will be
looking for individual ones throughout your journey. Walk directly
past the stump until you find the arrow that points you in the
right direction. You will be traveling on an old railbed and you
will not see any more markers until you reach the end of it. From
that point you must use your flashlight to find the markers. Once
you reach the first single marker, you are following single markers
until the final location. You are in for a fairly easy hike with a
couple small hills and a few &quot;twists&quot; thrown in. Nothing terribly
strenuous, no vertical climbing involved. Use your track log. After
you find the cache continue to follow the markers until you reach
some place you've been before. From there your track log or common
sense will get you to your vehicle. PLEASE NO SPOILERS! </groundspeak:long_description>

We started out taking a guess on the parking, then found the first set of tacks pointing the way.  We made quick work out of one section, but the crossing slowed us down a little.  At one point, we started following different fire tacks and lost the trail.  We decided to retrace our steps and found the one we missed and continued on.

You gotta slow down, and suck it in to make the winding way through this forest.  I probably spent more time looking up at the canopy than I did for the reflectors.  I just gotta see this place in the daytime!  These woods are a dense wonderland.  The the sounds from the shadows were deafening at times. The midnight chorus of creatures calling out to each other created an ambiance of  excitement, almost like trespassing into another realm.  Thanks for my favorite (by far) nocturnal caching adventure.

At least, several of our presidents did. Located just west of Lancaster, south of US 22 lies a most unusual walled cemetery. It is a (12-sided figure), constructed of hand-dressed native sandstone. The stones are placed without mortar and the corners are shaped from mitered stone. &lt;br/&gt;The Stonewall Cemetery, on the road of the same name, is the burying place of the Wilson family, early pioneers of Fairfield County. Nathaniel Wilson II, a Scotsman, brought his family to this area, probably over the nearby Zane's Trace. He settled in Hocking Township in 1798. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The background of this pioneer shows that his father, the first Nathaniel Wilson, was born in 1660. He and a Richard Cameron were taken prisoner by Charles I of England at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge in Lanarkshire, Scotland in 1679. Cameron's hands were cut off, but Nathaniel, then 19, managed to escape with Cameron's now useless sword. He made his way home and eventually reached Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. He reared his family there and died in 1753, at age 93, leaving the Cameron sword and old Scotch Bible to his eldest son, Nathaniel II. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Nathaniel Wilson II immigrated to the Ohio wilderness and built a humble log cabin in a clearing, and hung the old Cameron sword over its doorway in the living room. Beneath the sword were inscribed the words: &quot;The sword of the Lord and Gideon.&quot; Mr. Wilson embraced the ideas and peculiarities of the Old Scoth Covenanters, among which was a great reverance and respect for the dead. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Others on this frontier did not seem to share his same ideals; therefore, he envisioned something special for his family. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wilson II died on March 21, 1814, and was buried in the old city graveyard at High and Chestnut in Lancaster. His son, Nathaniel Wilson III, inherited his father's reverence for the dead. He finished the paperwork, and before deeding it to the president, had neighboring settlers Samuel and Emanuel Carpenter lay out a plan for enclosing it with a stone wall in 1816. There were nine marked graves in the little cemetery. The remains of Nathaniel Wilson II and his wife Elizabeth were moved to Stonewall Cemetery and placed in unmarked graves when the old city cemetery was moved in 1907. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wilson III deeded the cemetery to President James Monroe on Oct. 24, 1817, to be held by &quot;his successors in office forever, in fee simple forever in trust for the said Nathaniel Wilson and his heirs.&quot; The deed was legal and was witnessed by two Lancaster men. Thomas Ewing, who later served as Secretary of the Interior and Treasury, and William I. Thomas. No evidence has been found that President Monroe accepted the deed. Although started as early as 1812, it was not officially granted until 1940, under the signature of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On July 5, 1961, James M. Hengst, Nathaniel Wilson II's great-great grandson, purchased 1.046 acres surrounding and including the cemetery. In 1966, the cemetery was transferred to the Fairfield Heritage Association. In 1978 Heritage had it restored with a public preview on Oct. 8. However, vandals hit several times in the 1980s and destroyed many of the stones. It was cared for by the Hocking Township Trustees for a time and is now preserved as a Fairfield County Historical Park. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wall wasn't started until 1838. The sandstone probably came from a quarry on nearby Allen's Knob in Shallenberger State Nature Preserve. The stones, about 18 inches thick, were shaped at the quarry to fit each into the other. At the corners, the stones were shaped with angles, thus avoiding mortar. Each of the 12 sides is 29.5 feet in length. The wall stands today without a crack and with no settling. It is considered to be the finest example of dry masonry in the state of Ohio. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the quarry and the cemetery, Nathaniel III read to the workman from his Bible. According to I Kings 6:7, Solomon's temple was &quot;built of stone made ready before it was brought thither so that there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building.&quot; Stonewall Cemetery was built in the same manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pockets in the tops of the wall indicate that an iron fence was planned, but never constructed. The stone work of the wall included an arch over an iron gate forming the cemetery entrance. Over the gate a semicircle of smooth stone, different from that in the wall, is fitted into the arch, and bears the following inscription: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;This wall which encloses the family burying ground of Nathaniel Wilson (one of the early pioneers of the west who departed Cumberland County, Pennsylvania and settled near this place A.D. 1797 when all around was one continued and uninhabited wilderness) was commenced by him A.D. 1838 and finished the following year by his son Gustin, the former having suddenly died May 12, 1839.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the center of this plot Nathaniel planted a Cedar of Lebanon tree which he obtained from Mt. Lebanon in the Middle East. The founder's plan for the graves is outlined in his will. His wife was to be north and his own south of the Cedar. Over each grave is a sandstone slab, and at either end is an upright stone, slightly higher at the head supporting the inscribed marble slab at a slight angle. The inscribed stones are all about 20 inches above ground level. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The little cemetery has seen much in its many years and the passage of time has not been kind. Lightning struck the Cedar, and it has been replaced by a new Cedar of Lebanon. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nathaniel Wilson III's will, executed in 1838, set aside a tract of land of the perpetual growing of locust posts to keep the cemetery fenced. This tract of land, willed to President Martin Van Buren, was bounded on the north by the road leading from Lancaster to Amanda. With changes in the route of this road, once known as the Zanesville-Maysville Turnpike, it is difficult to locate this tract of land known as the &quot;President's Acre.&quot; &quot;The President's Cemetery&quot; and &quot;The President's Acre&quot; are different plots of ground within Section 15 of Hocking Township. Nearby on US 22 is the original Wilson homestead. It has a beautiful tree-lined lane reminding one of a southern plantation. What stories our ancestors had to tell. &lt;br/&gt;********************************************************************&lt;br/&gt;Cache has Log Only &lt;br/&gt;Bring Pen/Pencil</groundspeak:long_description>

If you're right, you can log a second smiley after I verify.  The physical cache will not tell you the answer, but will give you a general direction.  Can you guess where I hid the answer?

At one time, I&lt;br/&gt;could hop on my bigwheel at the posted coords, and down I'd go.&lt;br/&gt;Across the parking lot, down again, between the houses and down&lt;br/&gt;some more. I had a great time with frisbees and boomerangs here&lt;br/&gt;too. I used to stare in awe at the 15 foot icicles hanging from the&lt;br/&gt;sides of the church every winter, and play on the back steps while&lt;br/&gt;waiting on my mom after church. You could say, I've spent alot of&lt;br/&gt;time here. Now I can say, it's your turn. If damage occurs to&lt;br/&gt;anything here, I will yank this cache.

No... OH NO, it was not climbing a tree, or in a tunnel... Nope, it was not underwater, or on the side of-nor on top of a building... THIS (hallelujah) WAS IT!

I walked up the hill while a group of cachers from the north were knee-deep in the search, and I put my finger right on the cache, and said...  Huh, That was easy.

I know this my read like I am gloating, but I am not.. I am still in complete and utter confoundediscombobulatorystupedification over this find.

I don't know what else to say...

really-

Awesome hide TeamG, It must have been my prayers to the dark lord...  Thanks for a Truly Epic day of caching for me, well, an epic 2 weekends in a row!

We spent a short time searching here and there in what we thought were some potential hiding spots, when drainhook comes up the hill and within seconds had the cache in hand. It was a totally hilarious moment, and it was fun watching him make the find in the fashion he did. Very sneaky and well hidden :) But like he said, what can be said but ... TNLNSL.

From the late 1800s to sometime around 1930, they made soda pop in several different flavors.  They were the first of its kind in New Lex, and had a special system for filtering their water.  They also had an icehouse, and in the later years, they made and sold ice cream.  Be careful, as the broken bottles of years past are scattered everywhere.

I figured that since only one cache would fit in this space, I'd make the most of it.  You can pull right up to stage one as long as it hasn't been raining recently, otherwise it could get muddy, and you could get stuck.  If this is the case, please feel free to park in any of the nearby parking lots, which are visible from anywhere near stage one.  There is a fence along the creek that was put up only to keep soccer balls out of the creek.  This fence is a breeding ground for poison ivy, so be aware.  Small prize for FTF.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Aside from the CITO at Latito, and Beechescope, this was my only real target for the day.
Crazy to think of the caches that I found today..  this is surreal... Anyway, back to the topic at hand.
I crawled on my belly through the first stage, then drug my face in the dirt on the 2nd (Much to the enjoyment of DrDemento Mr.G).  
The rest of this cache is right up my alley! Yay, time to look like I halfway know what I am doing!

I always wonder if I could &quot;commando&quot; my way through little multis....  you know, if I get hung up on a stage,,, If I would be able to find another stage without coords...
Well, I pegged the final pretty quickly, However, there is something about this cache that makes me doubt that I would have went for it....

Great cache, the funnest part of my day, aside from the 15 seconds spent at Extra Ecclesiam!

Peanut Enjoyed it too
Oh Yeah ~FTF!</groundspeak:text>

 :pinches nose:

This one here is a real stinker!   My blowholes are still burnin'.  Luckily I have smelled this odor before, and could tell what I was steppin' in, or this one would have been on the DNF list!

Killer cache at both stages!

And, it was Nice to meet teamharrison here midway through the search for stage 1.
Took The GPSr coin to move along.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What can I say?  This cache was a microcosm of a geocacher’s life.  It has puzzles, physical challenges, special equipment required (for most of us mortals – more later).  It involved persistence, cleverness, physical endurance and my favorite – begging for hints.  Many, many thanks to our cache owner hosts for joining us today.  They provided some on the spot cache maintenance, hints and encouragement on stage 3, and cold water after it was all done!

Stage 1:  I made my second biggest contribution of the day here – I found the decoy.  It took a little awhile to spring stage 2 coords free.   I believe it was Alfamonkey who figured it out.  The gals were probably quite happy as they were up there trying all the other wrong guesses we were all tossing out. 

Stage 2: Since the stage needed a little maintenance it took us a little longer. The CO came over wondering why we weren’t getting it and fixed the issue.

Stage 3: (AKA the back breaker).  My personal biggest contribution was at this stage.  Landondena and I decided to do our own re-enactment of “Titanic” (the non-musical version) – it was great entertainment value.  Undaunted, us two soaked binge rats paddle over to the spot (OK you COULD walk I guess, but we had the boats….) with no GPS (and no clue) and start searching.  To make a l-o-n-g story shorter – the whole team proceeds to spend the next few hours here.  We all spent a bit of time looking in the wrong direction and then probably used the wrong initial approach when we did get on the right track.  This stage was my personal longest time looking for 1 stage - ever.  At one point I figured the cache should be renamed “6-6-6”.  Our hosts were very patient and did throw us some hints as the cross-lake begging ensued.  But I was sure the little sucker was GONE!  I felt less embarrassed when the CO paddled over couldn’t find it for right away.  One of the gals found it before him and we heard the holler from across the lake (I was in bratt mode at the time and smoozing with the park ranger that stopped by.)

Stage 4: Just like some caches, this one was uneventful.  Quick paddle, fast hike, and only a short hunt.  Assisting Landondena into almost a face plant was my highlight of the stage.  Signed the log even though we were going for the final.  My signing fingers were getting itchy – never done just 1 cache in a day before.

Stage 5:  Probably everyone’s favorite.  Bushwacked in (why did they plant those pines trees SO close together???)  Got to the GZ.  I tried to scrabble straight up – no good.  Tried circling to the right – no good.  Meanwhile half the team successfully went up to the left.  But that was only after one of the gals (not to mention any names, but her new caching name will be Crazyspidermonkey) went right up a crevice to the top.  After making up the top up the face of the cliff, she later proceeds down to the cache.  And while the climbers were setting up ropes so she could repel down from her perch, she comes back up again.  Not to waste lugging her harness along, I guess, she does repel down from the top.  This stage is a “5” terrain for most, as there are probably very few people as crazy-brave, skilled, and double jointed as CSM.

My personal highlight was repelling for the first time! (OK, I’m hooked - where do I buy some gear?)  Took the horse trail back (learned about the anti-poison ivy plant) and bid our farewells.
Many thanks to the rest of the team for the quick training and use of their gear – especially to whoever belayed me the one time!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">First off, HIGH FIVE to brtruitt, ExtheFlow, djstitan5, and JNLE4!

The 5 of us set off with high hopes of conquering this beast. These hopes were not to be thwarted by falling rocks, poison ivy, seemingly impenetrable thorns, miscommunication, mr. mucky muck, nor ghastly flattulence. 

Stage 1 stoked my fires for adventure, and assured me that this was going to be &quot;my kind&quot; of cache.
 (no equipment necessary).
 We found the key much quicker than we knew. Each of us had to take several spins around the maypole before the gates fell open. Yes I tried the correct key a few times to no avail since I was the first one in the hidey hole. Br made matters much easier by bringing the gates to us after his knock on the wooden door to stage 1.  This proved to be very helpful, and JNLE4 spun it the right way to make the find before Br had a chance to chew through the blasted thing.

Stage 2 took a couple of minutes to walk to, as we parked about .1 away, and only seconds to locate, and retrieve the coords. This was still a great stage, and I loved the idea.

Stage 3 is where we were led astray, and much time was lost trying to use the suggested coords. Br and I eventually left the rest of our group paddling around the lake suggested for stage 3, and headed out by van for a litlle recon. We found the correct approach. The paddle to stage 3 was deliberate, and uneventful, as we were on a mission, and djstitan5 was supplying the natural jet boost to the canoe. The cache could have taken much longer to locate under different conditions, but we found the mark after a short search high and low. 
Excellent hide on this stage as well. 

Stage 4 - during the paddle, and hike, I think all of us were itching to scale new heights. We were geared up for something serious, something dangerous... The hike up the hillside built this anxious excitement up more and more with each step. Watching the arrow twitch, and the feet drop down to below 10'.
&quot;found it&quot; burps out from above ExtheFlow's beard... What? &quot;Yeah, it is right there&quot;.  We considered severely upping the terrain on the rehiding of this stage, you know,  to keep the little bit of verse accurate.  
&quot;... pack your ropes inside your boat&quot;
However, we did not engage in any unethical rehiding of caches on this journey, but it was VERY tempting!

2006. It is one of 14 a permanent caches placed around Rushcreek
Lake so make a day of it. Please remember to CITO when you visit! 
&lt;p&gt;The terrain is fairly level with some overgrowth. Long but easy
walk. The cache however will not be easy to get your hands on. If
you are not comfortable retrieving the cache, please do not attempt
it. You may use what nature has given you or figure it out for
yourself, but you have to sign the log. Any online logs without
matching paper logs will be deleted. Seeing the cache doesn’t
count. Not recommended for people over 200 pounds or people who
lack balance, coordination or common sense. Please use the buddy
system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is regular size ammo can with plenty of room for trades.
Please replace exactly as you found it. Bring your own pen.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to our first “BoC” cache. BoC stands for Best of Columbus
and these caches will be placed throughout the city in areas that
we frequent and adore. This particular location first caught our
attention late in 2006 and we have been coming back ever
since.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This building once housed the Third Street School from the late
1800’s to early 1900’s. Construction began on the building in 1864
and it is currently the oldest Columbus City School still standing
(although students stopped attending in 1925). If you venture
inside, you can almost imagine desks in rows and the patter of
little feet running across the hardwood floors. Close to the cache
location is an old stone marker identifying its public school
number and is worthy of a look. It is currently managed by the
Columbus Recreation and Parks Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need to enter the premises to claim a find. You are
looking for a magnetic micro as this site will not accommodate a
regular container. Please be mindful of sidewalk traffic as you
attempt to find, although you should be well concealed from any
onlookers. This cache is in the heart of German Village and there
are many notable places to see and visit after finding the cache.
Please replace the container exactly as found. BYOP. Happy
Hunting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While several readings were taken and the average of those was
used for the final coordinates, there are buildings nearby and
signal bounce may occur. Therefore the hint is a spoiler.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;A small bison tube in a place of serenity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daylight caching only.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cemetery is adjacent to Mohan Hall, an infirmary for ill priests and sisters. Park in a visitor slot only please.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Dominican Sisters of St. Mary of the Springs were founded in 1822. The first congregation of Dominican Sisters started in Kentucky where Mother Angela Sansbury, along with eight other women, responded to a call from Dominican Father Wilson for women to respond to the needs of the frontier church and teach and form an &quot;Order of Preachers&quot; (O.P.). Angela’s marker can be seen from the bench at the front of the cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of the Dominican Sisters of St. Mary of the Springs is told in the book &quot;A Place of Springs&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache was placed after meeting Ruth Casper, the editor of the book. Grammi met her at church and was asked to explain geocaching to her. Permission was given to place the cache near the cemetery on the grounds where the early sisters are buried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the serenity of the location and please be respectful of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

If you are to become true ninja you must work
harder.&lt;br /&gt;
Your path in life will not be an easy one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To log a smiley you must simply sign the log.&lt;br /&gt;
To truly complete this geocache, you must &lt;i&gt;sabotage the
enemy!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please do not give anything away in your logs! &lt;u&gt;Do
not&lt;/u&gt; sabotage anything in or around the cache. Remember Stage 2;
Leave No Trace!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the same container and log from the archived version of
this cache. FTF'ers will not see a clean log.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
To survive, you must master these skills I teach
you. Ninjitsu powers of stealth and secrecy. You must become kage;
shadow warriors.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This training is the most difficult you have faced.
Your mission is to infiltrate the Mock Park Ninja clan and
assassinate their leader. The leader holds a list of ninjas that
pose a threat to his numbers.&lt;br /&gt;
Show no mercy in this task, and destroy your enemies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Keep in mind: The Ninja Training series of caches were hidden
without climbing gear or any outside assistance. They were intended
to be found the same way, but it's more important to me that you be
safe. Use gear if you need it.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Imported to OpenCaching on 07/19/2011.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A properly themed cache in Gahanna's Veterans Memorial Park.  The inspiration for the hiding spot came after a recent Spykids find.  Bring your own writing utensil.  You may want to print this out and bring it with you so you have something to write on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is replacing “A Patriotic Cache” (GCQT8X) that we previously had in this park.  We were hoping not to have to do a micro, but there are limited hiding spaces in the immediate area.  We hope to add to its appeal by having you complete a scavenger hunt and puzzle before claiming your find.  Don’t worry though, the answers are all readily available at the memorial and within 10 feet of the epicenter.  The posted coordinates will take you to the middle of the memorial where your search will begin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a quick walk around the pillar housing the eternal flame.  Pay particular attention to the year the following branches of the military were founded: Air Force, Army, and Coast Guard.  You will need to rely on Roman numerals to compute one year.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, take a walk around the base of the monument and locate the memorial brick for Bobby B Wright.  Your search should be concentrated within the immediate three feet of bricks surrounding the base, otherwise your search could take some time.  Pay attention to the years Bobby served in the USAF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The actual cache will be at the following coordinates.  All you have to do is solve some problems to get the numbers you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N  - A0*0B.0CD&lt;br/&gt;W -  EF*GF.EFG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A:   Add the last two digits of the year the Army was founded.  From your answer, subtract the total of the first two digits of the year the Army was founded.  Your answer is A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B:  How many years did Bobby serve during his second tour of duty?  Your answer is B.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C &amp; D:  Take the two-digit year (from the plaque) in which Bobby completed his first tour of duty and add to it the last two digits of the year in which he began his second tour of duty.  Your answer is CD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E &amp; F: Take the four-digit year the Air Force was founded and subtract the four-digit year the Army was founded.  From this number, subtract the last two numbers of the year the Coast Guard was founded.  Your answer is EF.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;G:  The number that corresponds with the month the memorial was opened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>

This ammo can is located just off the path, in the hiking trails of the &quot;Infirmary Mound Park&quot;; minimal bushwhacking is required.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Parking and trailhead coordinates are provided. Please rehide as found for the benefit of cachers that follow. A large, printable trail map of the park (in .PDF format)is available at http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7316582/IMPTrailmap.pdf&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;According to “History of the Licking County Infirmary” (by Bill Markley), the Licking County Infirmary was created in 1838, and under the direction of it’s newly elected president (successful local farmer Walt Wright) and superintendent (businessman Truman B. French), basic housing supplies were purchased. The vision for a county “Poor House” was realized on this property on December 11th, 1838, providing a home for the county’s destitute, homeless, and other less fortunate members of society.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Many of the “inmates” (as they were so referred) were crippled or mentally ill, and several suffered from consumption (the latter stages of tuberculosis). Prostitutes and unmarried, pregnant females were also common residents.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Local townspeople were employed as medical staff, blacksmiths, weavers, shoemakers, and to provide transportation for the inmates, and in 1841, local farmhands (and some able-bodied inmates) were hired to plant crops on site to help provide wheat, corn, hay, oats and potatoes for the facility. Cattle, sheep and hogs grazed the fields, and fruit trees provided even more produce.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;An additional stone building was erected in 1944 to serve as expanded housing, and in 1849 more buildings were added, including a “spinning and weaving” house, a shoe shop, a bake house, a wash house, store houses, a slaughter house, milk houses, a smoke house, an ice house, a wood house, a hog house, stables, barns, etc…&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Population of the “Infirmary” (as it became known) increased steadily from the initial 13 residents on it’s first year anniversary, to over 100 residents in 1853. By 1862, the original log residence had been replaced by a brick structure, and annual production of the resident farms and fields had skyrocketed; according to the 1866 annual report, “…1600 bushels of corn, 400 bushels of wheat, 700 bushels of potatoes, and 7902 pounds of pork…” (among many other items) had been produced that year alone.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The success of the Infirmary continued for several years, until 1869, when a small fire broke out in a stone outbuilding which housed the mentally ill. 10 inmates were trapped in their cells and perished in the fire.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;During the 1890’s, electric, gas heating, and phone services were added. Plumbing was updated, a hospital facility was created, nurses were hired, and a new barn was built.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In 1918, a public sentiment towards Prohibition caused a steep decline in Liquor License Fees used to finance the “Infirmary Fund”, which forced the Commissioners to borrow $3,000 to pay off outstanding bills and to meet further expenses. Bonds were also sold to generate revenue for what became known as “The County Home”.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In the 1920’s, many of the severely mentally ill residents were moved to other institutions and sanitariums as a cost cutting measure. Private agencies such as the Red Cross assisted with transportation. Farmland was leased out, and excess crops and livestock were sold in an effort to raise more revenue for the struggling Home.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The institute continued to struggle financially in the 30’s and 40’s, and in 1951 a devastating fire destroyed a barn, livestock, crops and equipment. In 1967, the Commissioners voted unanimously to move the Infirmary’s residents to the Licking County Tuberculosis Sanitarium Building, and in 1969, the move took place.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;By 1990, the main residential building had seriously deteriorated, and was demolished in 1997. “Infirmary Mound Park” (a 326 acre park featuring picnic shelters, hiking and horseback trails, and fishing areas) now resides on the site of the former institute, and is maintained by the Licking Park District. The location also houses the LPD’s main offices.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The site is also home to &quot;Infirmary Mound&quot; (hence the park name) believed to have been constructed by the “Moundbuilders”, prehistoric people who inhabited this area of Ohio centuries ago. Most of the mound has been lost due to the utilization and development of the surrounding property, but a portion of the mound is still visible at N 40 01.383 W 82 30.855, near the park’s Arena.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Special thanks to Cathy Fetter of the Licking Park District for her help in obtaining permission for the placement of this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

The path that leads to what we truly desire is long
and difficult, but only by following that path do we achieve our
goal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To log a smiley, you must simply sign the log...but it'd be really
radical of you to make the climb.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Keep in mind: The Ninja Training series of caches were hidden
without climbing gear or any outside assistance. They were intended
to be found the same way, but it's much more important to me that
you be safe. Use gear if you need it.&lt;br /&gt;

Easy access and parking, but the cache itself is slightly more difficult to get to (but easy to find).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't forget to bring your own writing instrument.  The cache might contain a coin or two from time to time, but not much else will fit in there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you come at the right time, you will probaly see plenty of ducks and geese and maybe someone fishing.

&lt;br /&gt;
This is a pretty typical hide in the woods. As the title says, my
dog needed a walk so I hid a cache. You won't have to get sopping
wet, climb in a sewer drain, climb 50ft in a tree or any of that.
There is a paved path part of the way, then a dirt path will get
you very close. It is hidden on a river bank, so be careful if it's
muddy. Have fun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is a small waterproof container with a log, pen and room for
very small swag.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Park closes at dark.

Carya ovata&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinctive, shaggy bark,
conspicuous on tall straight trees, gives this species its name. It
grows well in both wet and dry areas, but prefers well-drained
soils. In Ohio it is widely distributed, and probably can be found
in every county. It commonly is found in association with oak
trees. The wood is hard, strong, tough and elastic, and is used in
handles for tools and in athletic equipment. The wood also makes
excellent firewood, and often is used in smoking meat. As with
other edible nuts, squirrels compete with humans for this
fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After taking a while to learn some knots and practicing hanging myself in my garage, I wanted to get out and try a climb.  I mentioned to a few people that I'd like to do it soon, so plans were made to go after a few targets today.  This was the first on the list.

I went out early and was practicing with the throw line, since that's one thing I haven't practiced yet.  I took a while, but I started to get the hang of it...but I definitely need some more practice on that.   After a while, TeamMonroes showed up and showed me his throwing technique, and eventually we secured a good position in the tree and got the rope up and ready to climb.  I went up first, using SRT and cleared the rope from branches for DRT climbing.  Using only the knots I had practiced to climb was tough, but I have the basic mechanics down and made it up.

TeamMonroes went next, then blandestk, then theladybee.  It was a good climb on ropes but the tree was moving in the wind more than I liked.  While on the ground, I thought the height would bother me more than it did, but during the climb I managed to keep cool for the most part.    Tftc.</groundspeak:text>

Had a nice chat with the property managers, they didn't mind at all that we were there.  Had quite a group of onlookers cheering me on and taking photos.  Awesome hide Gancho!

Please address any questions or concerns to Wally Spence, or Board Member Mary Kay Booher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need the following combination to open the padlock:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CLOCKWISE to 32 three times&lt;br/&gt;COUNTER-CLOCKWISE to 13 twice&lt;br/&gt;CLOCKWISE to 24&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one really is child's play! No hints, no tricks, no puzzles... just an ammo can in the woods. Nothing more classic that that!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LOTS of swag for the kids. Remember, trade up, trade even, or don't trade at all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is on level ground, but requires a tiny bit of bushwacking towards the end. The location and placement definitely make this one family friendly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a replacement for a muggled container, hence the added &quot;security&quot;. We wanted to make sure the replacement was around a long time for everyone to enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please keep in mind that this is a working theater, so please approach the cache site quietly if there is a show in progress. Access to parking may be limited due to a full parking lot during performances. The cache in located OUTSIDE of the fenced in area (the cache cannot be accessed from within the fence) and is available 24/7, but the *optimum* time to avoid large crowds is to visit before 7pm or after 11pm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please don't park at the C-Tec Career Center... the cache is not located on or near that property. Instead, park at N 40 06.106 W 82 25.588.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This location is home to Ohio's oldest summer-stock community theater, which originally began in a barn in Heath, Ohio, July 8, 1969.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1976 it was relocated to it's current location with the help of Newark Area Jaycees and the Ohio National Guard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site was also the scene of a devastating fire in 1987 which destroyed the original structure, but the Newark community rallied their support once again and rebuilt. Much of the reconstruction work was done by the Building Trade Classes of the neighboring Licking County Joint Vocational School, under the supervision of Jim Shoemaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support from Newark Theater Community continues to this day, and through the efforts of the theater's board of directors, countless local donations, and the tireless dedication of the theater's former Managing Director Matthew Trombetta, a multi-million dollar capital improvement expansion is almost complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To learn more about this location, please visit http://www.weathervaneplayhouse.org&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is dedicated to our dear friend Matthew Trombetta, former Managing Director of Weathervane Playhouse, who we lost to a tragic automobile accident in the summer of 2010. This cache was his creation, and the continuing success of Weathervane Playhouse is a part of his legacy. He will be forever missed. </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Follow the chain link fence W from the parking lot, then N... stick to the fence until the GPS shows less than 15 feet... it'll make the terrain *much* easier.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Geocaching brought me to Alum Creek
today, in search of a messy hike, and a terrain challenge worthy of
4 stars.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unable
to find what I was looking for, I decided to make one for myself,
and the rest of you who may come here looking for the same sort of
adventure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You will be able to pull-off
the side of the road for stage one, and make the quick grab. Pay
attention to your surroundings...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please park at the parking
coordinates for stage 2, to keep the terrain rating accurate, and
truly find&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redemption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring your own
Pen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congrats to Team_JNLE4 &amp; Lttledude9 on the
Co-FTF!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations to 5BizzyBs on his monumental
3,000th milestone here on 10/11/09&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located at the Chambers Road covered bridge. There is parking very
close to the cache, and the terrain is a short walk on a grassy
surface, and a little bit of roadway. The cache is located just
inside the bridge. Not under, and no climbing is needed at
all.

&lt;p&gt;Built in 1883, this bridge spans 73 feet across the Big Walnut.
It is a Childs type truss, which was developed in 1843 by Horace
Childs, and used exclusively after 1883 by Ohio bridge builder
Everett Sherman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not necessarily the most impressive covered bridge in
Ohio, but it's all that Delaware County has to offer. I know that
there are folks out there who are interested in seeing all the
covered bridges out there. It appears that this one could use a
little more attention than it gets. It's on backroad in the
northeast corner of Delaware County. Because it's in the middle of
nowhere, it seems that the local kids have targeted it for a little
late night grafitti. Because of that I have to give this one an &quot;R&quot;
Rating for language. Hopefully though if it does get a little more
attention, people won't be so apt to deface this piece of
history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a little pull off on the eastern side of the bridge, on
the south side of the road. I've tucked this cache away to make it
difficult for non-cachers to find, but I don't want it to be
difficult for those who are looking for it. If you don't want help,
stop reading and have at it. Otherwise....The cache is in the south
eastern corner of the bridge. When you walk up to the bridge, if
you look down near the road surface, you will see a metal plate
that holds a timber in place vertically. About a foot up from the
road surface you will see the end of a timber laid horizontally.
The container is a rectangular Altoids tin that is magnetized to
the metal plate, and tucked up behind the horizontal beam. It's
hard to explain, and may make more sense when you get there. I have
included a pic below if you want to look at it. Like I said I've
given this away because it's a tough hide, but I want Geocachers to
find it easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of that said, the road doesn't seem to be often used,
but you may want to keep your eyes and ears open. Be careful out
there. I don't suggest doing this one at night, because not only
would it be more difficult for traffic to see you, but there are a
couple of houses nearby, and I wouldn't want them to think that
you're up to no good.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Ohio DeLorme Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Map located at: http://www.userfriendly.net/delorme/mapdefs/ohdc_s.jpg
&lt;br /&gt;
The map above is based on the base map for the
DeLorme Ohio Atlas. While you do not need to have a DeLorme Atlas
to use these map pages, they may be easier to use if you do have
one.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What is the DeLorme Challenge?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 2004, Haicoole unveiled the 
California DeLorme Challenge cache. This popular challenge
cache has since been repeated in many other states. TeamDotOne
thought that we should join in the fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The DeLorme Atlas &amp; Gazetteer is published for all 50 states.
These maps are a favorite among travelers and outdoors enthusiasts,
and are available at many locations, including online directly from
DeLorme. The goal of this cache is simple: to find a cache on each
and every page of the Ohio State DeLorme Atlas &amp;
Gazetteer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The image above shows the geographical extents of each of the pages
of the Ohio DeLorme Atlas &amp; Gazetteer. The final cache
coordinates can be obtained by successfully finding a cache on each
page of the Atlas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to claim this cache, you must first let us know which
caches you found to meet the requirements for each Atlas page. See
details below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some specific guidelines for this Challenge:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As mentioned above, the posted coordinates are not the actual
coordinates for the cache. The physical cache may actually be quite
some distance from these coordinates! The terrain rating and
attributes apply to the final cache location, and more details will
be provided when you become eligible to seek the final cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally accepted rules, guidelines and conditions for logging
a cache find apply. These must be bona fide caches listed on
Geocaching.com that you have personally (physically) found and
logged.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have debated long and hard about allowing you to count finds
prior to the issuing of this challenge vs. starting everyone with a
clean slate, allowing only finds after the date the cache is
published. We suspect counting prior finds means several people are
very near to meeting or completing the challenge. Completing a
DeLorme Challenge is a mark of a home state caching honor rather
than a competition to do it first. To make the challenge
&lt;b&gt;fair&lt;/b&gt; to all, caches found prior to the creation of the Ohio
DeLorme Challenge will &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; be counted, even if they meet all
other Challenge requirements. 

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On pages that you can verify that you have previously found all
caches, you may fulfill the requirement by setting a cache.
Remember that all caches must meet Groundspeak guidelines,
including not setting vacation caches that cannot be maintained.
This is the only case where hides will be allowed to fulfill the
challenge requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All cache types count as finds for the DeLorme Challenge with
the exception of events (CITO included) and locationless
caches.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Ohio DeLorme Atlas pages that include space not located in
Ohio, only caches in the Ohio portion count. We will go off of the
posted coordinates for a cache (including multicaches and puzzles)
when determining in which state or page a given cache falls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atlas page 29 is all over Lake Erie. You do not need to find
caches on this page. Thanks to KEWAH for posting a correction for
page 29 &quot;Technically, there IS a cache on page 29. It's KIH2O
(GCVKBK), out near Kelley Island,&quot; and we received another
correction from HercJerk stating that &quot;I did notice there are now
three other caches on the Lake Erie page 29. They are GC1JGD2,
GC1JC1G, and GC8A3A,&quot; however we are still not requiring this page
to be completed but feel free to grab that cache if you would
like.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever there is a cache shown on two different pages, these
caches may be counted for only ONE of the pages. Pages 73 and 87
have two separate maps to cover little sections of Ohio. You must
log a cache in each of these pages (e.g. 73A and 73B).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the various editions and versions of the DeLorme Atlas do
not seem to have changed much in terms of page boundaries, the
image above derived from the information in the cache owner's copy
(Seventh Edition, © 2004) will be considered definitive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While you may have others with you when you find the final
cache, only those who have fulfilled ALL criteria for this cache
will be allowed to log it as a find. Find logs by other cachers
will be deleted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When in doubt, ask. We can discuss it or even seek guidance
from others, but the final decision rests with the cache
owners.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that this is a game and is supposed to be fun!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many thanks go out to Haicoole for the original idea for this cache
and to the owners of other 
DeLorme Challenge caches, especially PA Reviewer's 
Pennsylvania and Moun10Bike's 
Washington version, from which we have borrowed
liberally.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How can I play?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's easy! The preferred method is to create a shared bookmark list
of the caches claimed as eligible finds. Simply send us an e-mail
at teamdotone@gmail.com to alert us
that you've completed all the pages. Include a link to your
bookmark list. This is the best way to share cache information in a
manner that's consistent with Groundspeak's terms of use for pocket
queries. If you don't create a bookmark list, send us a file
containing your claimed eligible finds. (.GPX or .LOC format is
highly preferred, but &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; GPX files using the proprietary
Groundspeak extensions to the GPX namespace). This alternative is
offered for geocachers who are not premium members, or for anyone
having difficulty with managing a bookmark list. We will review
your list of finds in order to verify compliance with the cache
requirements. Please allow up to one week for the verification
process -- we are expecting many Ohio cachers to join in the fun,
that means a bit of data 'crunching' will have to be performed.
Once everything checks out, we will send you an e-mail with
instructions, including the correct coordinates to take you to the
final cache, and some background information about the cache
location. The find cannot be logged until the physical container is
found and the logbook inside is signed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To help you figure out which caches are on which map pages, we have
the following files available.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
* Google Earth KMZ or
KML&lt;br /&gt;

* Garmin Mapsource&lt;br /&gt;

* Magellan GS or
SD&lt;br /&gt;

* GPX or
LOC&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many thanks go out to Mount10Bike for graciously
creating and supplying these files for use by the
challengers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The files have lines showing the borders of the Atlas pages. If you
develop a similar file for a different mapping software format,
send it to us and we will host that for everyone else's benefit as
well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tracking the Progress of Geocachers Taking on the
DeLorme Challenge:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We encourage everyone to make their DeLorme Challenge 
bookmark lists &quot;public&quot; and &quot;shared,&quot; so that everyone can see
how other geocachers are coming along. &lt;b&gt;Tip: Include a bookmark
to this cache page on your list, and then everyone's lists can be
accessed from right here.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We also ask that you think of the *best* cache that you found on
each page of the Atlas, for inclusion on your DeLorme Challenge
bookmark list. That way, everyone will see how hard you worked to
complete the challenge, and we will have a very nice compiled list
of Ohio's best caches. This is just a suggestion, not a
requirement. If the only cache you found on an Atlas page is a
micro at a highway rest stop, it's still eligible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Those accepting the DeLorme Challenge are encouraged to post notes
here on the cache page to let everyone know they are working on it,
and to keep us informed of their progress. GOOD LUCK, AND HAVE
FUN!&lt;/li&gt;

  I went out to grab this one after finishing up some running around.  At the time it looked like it was about ready to start pouring rain, thankfully it held off....now it's nice and sunny.  How's that for Ohio weather?!  An interesting nugget of information...if you come into town from the west then you'll pass the R.B. Powers Company.  They make all of the award ribbons for the Ohio State, and many county fairs.  All of the ribbons and awards I've collected while in 4-H have come from here.

so there is no need to search on or near any headstones.
&lt;p&gt;As with any cemetery cache, please be respectful of your
surroundings. Area is closed from dusk until dawn.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This one is not close to home in the literal sense, but more in a
historical sense. The nearby church was attended by my
Great-Great-Grandfather Levi, though he was not buried at this
cemetery.
&lt;p&gt;Levi operated a granary in nearby Edison. Sadly one of his
children fell and suffocated in that granary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one of his children grew up to be a semi-pro basketball
player in his youth, then went on to open a pottery company, and
Hupmobile dealership in Edison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container you're looking for is an &quot;Eclipse&quot; mint tin. It's
rectangular in shape, painted to match its surroundings, and
magnetic. It is too small for anything but very small trade items.
As such you will find only a logbook in there, unless someone adds
something later.&lt;/p&gt;

can be challenging at times. Not recommended for younger kids.
Older kids can handle.

This is a regular sized ammo box. Location should be fairly obvious
once you locate the general area. After heavy rains, you might have
to cross standing water, so come prepared. There are trade items,
both kid and older related items. Hoping to see TB's and Geocoins
making their rounds through this area. &lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well, this was a strange one.  My family was &quot;creeking&quot; near the location for this cache, and coincidentally was planning to do some geocaching when we were done.  I happened to find this cache just laying next to the creek, but we were about 3/10 of a mile away from where the cache should have been.  I don't think there is any way that it could have washed to this location, so I think it was certainly moved by a muggle or something.

We tried to replace the cache to it's proper location, and I'm pretty sure that we got it to the right place.  </groundspeak:text>

to November 2, 1865. What event took place here? Well, that is for
you to figure out when you arrive. The purpose of this cache is to
take you to a place you likely would not have stopped before. A
brief history lesson if you will. After finding this cache, be sure
to visit &lt;i&gt;Iberian Badger&lt;/i&gt; (GCRYQW) to learn more to this
story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a multi-cache. The coordinates will take
you to stage 1. At this stage, you will see a historical marker.
You need to find 2 numbers off of this sign. The numbers will be
hyphenated. You need to multiply the number to the left of the
hyphen by 3 and subtract that number from the last 3 digits of the
North Coordinate. Take the number to the right of the hyphen and
add it to the last 3 digits of the West Coordinate. The coordinates
to work with are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;N 40 42.496&lt;br /&gt;
 W 082 39.904&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, punch in your numbers, hop in your car, and
take the short drive to the location of the final cache. This is a
short drive, around 2 miles. Be sure to BYOP, as the cache will not
hold one. Please make sure to use pulloff at stage 1, and ONLY hunt
this cache during daylight hours!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE: Please ignore the title name I put in the logbook of the
final. I decided to change the name when I listed it. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

For those that have hunted Courtney's Hike (GC14KXY), or are going
to in the future, and want a more satisfying hike through the
woods, this is the hunt for you. I recommend finding Courtney's
Hike first, then going to this one. This cache was entitled
&quot;Straight Line Winds&quot; due to the fierce storms and straight line
winds that took place here a few years back. Winds topped 100MPH
just to the NNE of this location, and you can still see some of the
damage if you drive Orweiler Rd. just off of Bowers Rd. near the
Boy Scout Camp. Some of the trees in the cache area were toppled
from lesser winds in this storm, but still nothing to laugh about.
I highly recommend turning tracking ON on your GPS for return to
your vehicle after this one. It is very easy to get turned around
in here. Well stuffed ammo can, hidden in a usual way. Please
return the way you found it, or better if not hidden well when you
find it. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another cache in the park system of Galion, Ohio.
This cache was named for the location it is near. During the warmer
months, there will be quite a few kids on the soccer fields, so
extreme caution is needed during these periods. Cache is a camo
lock n lock. Should be an easy find. Please do NOT go on the South
side of this tree line. You can access from the North side very
easily. The South side is private property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache was placed in coordination with the CITO
Amicks CITO event, April 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take some time while looking for this cache and
enjoy nature. Some of these areas have been designated Pheasant
lands, and Pheasants can be seen year round. Nothing like the
calling of Pheasants on a warm summers evening. Also, deer are
normal in this area, so be sure to bring a camera. This cache is
available year round, and will be a little tougher in the warmer
months as the undergrowth will hamper your caching ability. There
are trails back through this area, so no bushwacking is necessary.
You will be looking for an ammo can. Please access this cache from
the &quot;rock&quot; side (east) rather than the wood side (west), as this is
how it is intended to stay hidden. Thanks! Please return this cache
as you find it to prevent muggles from locating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 This is the second cache in the series Take Me To Something
Patriotic. In this series, you will travel to locations that are
patriotic in nature. I have given this multicache this name as an
event that would happen yearly near this site. Being a local
trumpeter, I would be asked to play &lt;i&gt;Taps&lt;/i&gt; during a wreath
laying ceremony on various patriotic and rememberance days through
the year. This was at the old location, which was about 150' to the
West of the current location of this memorial. Since the move,
there have been no wreath laying ceremony, and no &lt;i&gt;Taps&lt;/i&gt;,
hence The Silent Trumpeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you arrive at this location, you will need 2 different sets
of year numbers. The first year number will be on the left side of
the main memorial plaque. You need to add the 4 digits of this date
together, and subtract that number from the last 3 digits of the N
coordinate. Take the 2nd year, on the right side of the plaque, and
add those 4 digits together. Subtract that number from the final 3
digits of the W coordinate. The coordinates to use are listed
below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;N 40 42.551&lt;br /&gt;
 W 082 49.092&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please spend some time at the 1st stage and pay respects for
those who have served our country. Also, please post your photos,
but be careful not to disclose the dates needed to complete this
multi! At the final, please rehide as found. There is a good amount
of kid activity in this location, and if hidden properly, they
should not find it. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just a quick note...as of Veterans Day 2007, there has been a
wreath laying ceremony at the memorial, complete with Taps.&lt;br /&gt;

 This is the first cache in the series Take Me To Something
Patriotic. In this series, you will travel to locations that are
patriotic in nature. The brick pictured&lt;br /&gt;
 is to honor the service of my wife's father, whom passed away a
few years ago. At this multi-cache, Where Eagles Soar, you will
need to do a little&lt;br /&gt;
 math to find the coordinates to the final. In the picture above,
you will see a brick.You need to find this brick in the area at the
above&lt;br /&gt;
 coordinates. There will be a series of dates after the word
&quot;NAVY&quot;, which have been edited out of this photo. To get the
coorinates to the final stage,&lt;br /&gt;
 you must add the digits of the 1st year together, and subtract
that number from the last 3 digits of the North Coordinate. 2nd,
you must add the digits of the&lt;br /&gt;
 2nd year together, and subtract that number from the last 3 digits
of the West Coordinate. The Coordinates to work with are:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;N 40 42.256&lt;br /&gt;
 W 082 49.179&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you do your math, hop in your car and drive a couple of
miles to the final location. You will find a small loc-n-loc
container with room for small trades.&lt;br /&gt;
 Please rehide as found, and BYOP. Take some time to pay tribute to
those who have served our nation at the 1st stage, and please post
your pictures near this &quot;patriotic&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
 location.&lt;/p&gt;

We looked through a few times, what an amazing time it was to think of all the bricks represent.  I can't imagine the stories that might have been shared by this wonderful group of americans.  We foun it and made our way to the cache hide location.  It was a tough walk for me with a couple of bad knees, but Buckeye_FAN was patient and tok it easy on me.  

We ran out of time cahing today because I had to get back to Shelby to anounce a Shelby girls basketball game. (Or else we would have been still caching today!) Liked 
the hide. SL TNLN

&lt;p&gt;This is not your typical puzzle. I
wanted people to understand a little bit about the history of
Galion, so what better way than with a Crossword Puzzle! Instead of
solving some hard problems, you have a few simple tasks. The tasks
will be below each of the Puzzles headers. Have fun, and learn
something about Galion's History! The final is a camo'd ammo can,
stuffed full of goodies. Please re-hide as found as this is a high
muggle area! Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer the questions below, and fill
in the Main Puzzle with those answers. I have provided links at the
bottom of this puzzle for you to find your answers. Take some time
to study the webpages, as you might learn a thing or two about the
area you are going to visit. &lt;b&gt;*NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; This puzzle will NOT
print, so you must write down your answers on a sheet of paper and
transfer to Puzzle 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In keeping with tradition of last year, I have
placed this cache for my 30th birthday. I have grown up in Galion
all 30 years, so Zero to Thirty seemed fitting. The other part is a
no brainer :) Anyways, easy find. A 2 difficulty because for
vertically challenged people this one might be a little more
difficult. Quick P&amp;G for most. BYOP as there is not room. See
you along the caching trail!&lt;/p&gt;

Crawford County Road Rally hosted by Captphil and Moonrock611. What
a great event, and what more fitting way to show our thanks than to
hide a cache at the event location!&lt;br /&gt;

Park at Main Parking area N40&lt;br/&gt;48.656 \ W082 01.410. Wooster Memorial Park has very nice walking&lt;br/&gt;trails of several levels of difficulty. You are looking for the red&lt;br/&gt;trail loop that traverses the upper portion of the park. There are&lt;br/&gt;two ways to use in order to get to the cache off the loop. Our&lt;br/&gt;recommendation is to take the red trail to the right, or East&lt;br/&gt;through the park. This trail will take you up and around the best&lt;br/&gt;and most scenic views of the area. However, if you are looking for&lt;br/&gt;a reasonably fast find, then go the opposite direction on the red&lt;br/&gt;trail. Be prepared to cross the creek in several locations and&lt;br/&gt;steep inclines as well. There are a few walk over bridges but most&lt;br/&gt;of the creek crossing is by way of makeshift crossings. It is a&lt;br/&gt;very relaxing area after a hike of this type. Signal strength in&lt;br/&gt;the final cache area should not be a problem as there is a full&lt;br/&gt;view of the sky. Please help keep this area as clean and pristine&lt;br/&gt;as possible, and carry any trash out that you see. Be certain to&lt;br/&gt;completely close the container as well.

His birth date is unknow but what is know is that he was a man who helped in securing this countries freedom. For this man served his county during its birth, by enlisting during the Revolutionary war. Even though this is a small cemetery, it is well taken care of. So be respectful and only cache during daylight hours. There is a small staircase that will lead you to the cache, and you should park in front of it.</groundspeak:long_description>

I've had a special interest in trains all my life. My dad was employed with the former Nickel Plate Railroad and Norfolk and Western Railroad for 41 years, retiring in May 1983 as a Chief Clerk. My brother has been with the Railroad 35 years (since 1972) presently as a Yard Master. Even I was employed as a clerk in my twenties for nearly eight years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for the Mad River and NKP Railroad Society/Museum I have been an active volunteer member for 34 years-since 1973 and most of the years as a Board Member/Officer; as a Golden Life Member since 1984.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache contains a log sheet, pencil and several small trinkets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;	</groundspeak:long_description>

The day started off nice enough, weather looked like it was going to hold up, so off we go heading west. We managed to make pretty quick work of this one and then get back on our way for the next cache. Nice to see all the trains nearby and nice area for a cache. TNLNSL. TFTC!!!</groundspeak:text>

We most of these caches in our sights when we came out a few months back to do the LoCo CITO event, but due to time constraints we never made it as far out as we wanted, so we decided today was the day :) Man we made this really harder than it had to be - found a shorter way back in to the cache location once we were AT the cache location but we enjoyed the nice walk back to the spot  and managed to make pretty quick work of this one, and get back in the car and head off for the next cache.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a cache find for all those heart broken cachers who just
cant seem to catch a break when it comes to being the First To Find
a cache. Every cacher who finds this cache gets to claim F.T.F.
honors. This cache container is a simple tree hanger hidden in
short stretch of pine trees, The coords will take you the middle
tree of the cluster. From end to end there is only 17 trees spaced
close together. Every hunter who finds this cache, if you are
willing, can move it one tree away from its hidding spot. Thus
traveling away from the starting point. This way the next finder
will be the First To Find it in its new hidding spot. When rehiding
the cache please keep it in the row of trees running east/west. Do
not place in the trees running north/south.
