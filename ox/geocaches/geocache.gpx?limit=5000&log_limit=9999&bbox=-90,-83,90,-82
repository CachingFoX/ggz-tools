 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

of the city's large power generation plants and one of several
refuse-burning power plants in the state. This close proximity of
this wildlife refuge and nature trail, however, softens the urban
industrial feeling of the area by offering hikers an inner city
wilderness experience! You may even encounter wildlife as you
traverse the trails. The bay itself is a haven for bird life -
pelicans, ospreys, egrets, herons and even flamingos and roseate
spoonbills are occasionally spotted here. ...And, depending on the
time of year, the water itself may be home to manatees, rays,
dolphins, small blackfin sharks and schools of redfish and
snook.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Please be sure to conceal the cache well when you rehide it. Have
fun!

 &lt;p&gt;Difficulty is due to the constant muggle population so be

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

While searching for the cache, take time to enjoy the beautiful

The original cache container includes a variety of small trade

Have fun and please replace the cache as you found it or
better!&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Lock 'N Lock container properly by pressing down

Anyhow, I found this very small container with ease,  &amp; when I mean small I mean small,   &quot;LOL&quot;

Anyways, I think this container needs the attention of the owner to move it around the area alittle bit and to make the container alittle bit bigger cause u can't really stick anything in this package...


Also what I did do tho with this package was create a new log book page since there was no room on the old page,  there is enough room on this paper to put 160 names &amp; dates when you opened up the package.

This is what is in the package when I opened the package up,

1.   Yellow Rubber Puff Fish
2.   Fake Pirates Money
3.   Blue Jay key Chain
4.   Plastic Roach 
5.   Rubber Alien
6.   2 Pennies
      
     Like I was saying before,  these  items are very very small and that was the only way to fit them in there and there is no more room to fit anything else....     &quot; LOL &quot;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

for safety. BYOP
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As we were walking the trails in this undeveloped park we noticed
some movement up ahead. Too large to be cats and distinctively
canid the movement turned out to be a pair of foxes. I managed to
get off a couple of distance photographs of them before they
scattered.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Depending upon your approach the trails in here can be quite
overgrown and sloppy. Bring a trash bag with you. Unfortunately the
county has neglected this nice park and some sections could
certainly use a bit of CITO.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M geocaching
disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

several habitats, full facilities and easy access from anywhere in
Tampa. There are trails for both bikers and hikers as well as a
playground and even a &quot;dog park&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;

 This cache is located in the hardwood hammock between the
boardwalk and the bicycle trail in the fish management area of the
park. Be sure to read the signs regarding local wildlife!&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There was a cache located in this park that we found close to three
years ago that has been long archived. Seeing that there were no
caches currently placed in the park and remembering that the park
provided nice views of the Hillsborough River and Dam we decided to
place a cache here.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Depending upon your approach you may have to navigate a small
stream to find the cache, or not.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M geocaching
disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;

area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

end? Have they been possessed? We know, we know. But it isn't a
micro and we think that this place is kind of special. We get a
laugh out of the 1st stage every time we drive by it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In order to find the cache you must complete the following simple
puzzle:&lt;br/&gt;
There is a large object located at the coordinates. OK, it's a car.
A very unique car. Find the VIN number on the car.&lt;br/&gt;
Take the last 3 digits of the VIN and subtract 129 - these numbers
are ABC.&lt;br/&gt;
Take the first 3 digits of the VIN and add 541 - these numbers are
DEF.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Final Cache is located at:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;N 28º02.ABC&lt;br/&gt;
W 082º24.DEF&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it cannot

stay dry.&lt;/b&gt;

riding my tail as I was coming down this frontage road. I didn't
know he was back there until I went to make a turn. Scared the
living daylights out of me. Make sure you pull fully off the road
and be careful if it is wet. Looks like others have gotten stuck
nearby before. BYOP
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

 You will need to answer the following questions to complete the
coordinates listed below. Enter the results, as indicated by the
letter(s) in the appropriate spots.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 1. According to the plaque regarding flowering trees, how many
species of flowering trees can be located in this garden? (Hint:
You should only be counting the &quot;common names&quot; listed on the
plaque, not the scientific classifications) Subtract this number
from 16 to get A. &lt;br/&gt;
 2.Using the information on the plaque discussing palm trees,
complete the following sentence: Palm trees range from 3 feet to
________feet tall or higher. Subtract 35 from this number to get
BC. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Substitute your answers for the letters to get the final
coordinates:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;N 28º 03.50A&lt;br/&gt;
W 082º 25.3BC&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. &lt;b&gt;Since this is a busy area, please rehide the cache
securely and conceal it well so it cannot be seen.&lt;/b&gt; Have fun and
feel free to post pictures of your favorite plants, flowers or
trees in the garden! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Over&lt;br/&gt;
the years there have been multiple caches at this location.
Should&lt;br/&gt;
be an easy grab.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

While completing the amazing &quot;Morris Bridge Mountain Bike Multi&quot;
hidden throughout this trail system, couldn't help but wondering
about the ominous sounding &quot;Gator Bait&quot; trail, the trailhead of
which is not far from part one of the legacy multi. This beautiful
trail traverses tropically moist swamp land and will probably
present quite a challenge for mountain-bike riders (we &quot;hoofed it&quot;
when the cache was hidden). Terrain may increase considerably
during the rainy season.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

dumbfounded. Sure we could have come up with something, but have
decided to appeal to you, the Geocaching community at large, to
help us name this one.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As a First to Find prize the Geocacher who claimed the FTF got to
name this cache. &lt;b&gt;Bill Z&lt;/b&gt; had this distinction and recommended
honoring our veterans since the preserve is location not far from
the Veterans' Expressway...so &lt;i&gt;&quot;Salute!&quot;&lt;/i&gt; seemed
appropriate!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The Rocky Creek Trails Nature preserve is a small preserve located
off of the Upper Tampa Bay Trail in Citrus Park. Please enter from
this trailhead. In order to reach this cache, at least the way we
did, you will have to navigate a small stream. The day we hid the
cache it was an easy leap over, this may change depending upon the
rains so please come prepared.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please park at you own discretion, we hiked here on the Upper Tampa
Bay Trail, a nearby side steet or shopping center will probably
work. You cannot park at the trail head.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M geocaching
disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Lock 'N Lock container properly by pressing down
on all sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not
stay dry.&lt;/b&gt;

The woods are fairly dense and the creek that cuts the park in half is relatively large and can be difficult to cross depending on how much rain has fallen.

Hint: the cache is not in a stump but rater a cavity in an old cypress tree.  </groundspeak:text>

Instead of going home to get the bike and taking the trail all the way up here, I parked at Citrus Park (yes, the park in Citrus Park is called Citrus Park) and crossed the road to the trail.  It's pretty back here, but the trail meanders almost as much as the E trail at the Northwest Equestrian Trail.  Finally got to the obstacle and it was much bigger than I expected, though the drought made passing it much, much easier.  If you've been waiting to do this one, now is the time.  Spotted ground zero even without the GPS as the location just screamed geocache to me.  Then strolled over to lake back here that borders the Veteran's thanks to the hole in the fence likely made by whoever left all those cans of Bud Light behind.  Thanks for taking me here to this nice little patch of land.  I put this one off far to long.  TFTC! </groundspeak:text>

My older model GPS takes a little longer to settle down and Micheal finds it quickly.  Now it is getting too late to look for the other two nearby new hides so I follow Grandpa and Main back to Morris Bridge Road while m^3 runs off to map some more trail.  We meet back at the bike parking area to continue the hunt.  By the way we were not the FTF.  TFTH  </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a lovely portion of the river with mucho Florida wildlife
to see as you make your way from Trout Creek to Lettuce Lake (if
this is the approach you choose to take...you can also approach via
the boat launch at Rotary Park on Fowler Avenue.) If you take the
Trout Creek approach, you will have to paddle through the spillway
and under I-75, but don 't let this dissuade you. Once you get
beyond the Interstate and paddle downstream, it really is a
beautiful and peaceful section of the river.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As far as the cache itself, when we hid it, we were able to paddle
right up to GZ, only getting out of the boat to hide the cache.
However, once the rainy season ends, there's a good chance you will
have to get out of the boat and walk a short distance to your
destination.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M geocaching
disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;

I laid the log out to dry planning to put it back on my way back upstream.  My downstream jaunt did not last too long, since the river was completely blocked at Lettuce Lake.  Some USF students paddled through it, but I did not care to.  So....my trip back upstream was not as delayed as long as I suspected.  I replaced a still wet/damp log and carefully snapped all four corners before heading upstream  I was &quot;pulled over&quot; by the police near the cache.  Officer politely checked to be sure that I had a PFD.  All was good.  </groundspeak:text>

extra disclaimers too!)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
1 - You may be tempted to treat this as an Interstate p&amp;g. THIS
IS NOT RECOMMENDED. This cache should be accessed from Trout Creek
Park.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
2 - Depending on your approach, the last several feet or so may
require some palmetto-whacking. It's not too bad, but if you don't
like palmettos, fell free to pass on this cache. You have been
warned. ;)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
3 - Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of
course you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the
actual cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well
so it cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

walking from the nearby nature trail...and it was dry (for the most
part). However, since we have been fortunate enough to have so much
rain this year, the cache, for the time being, can definitely only
be accessed by boat. We were able to paddle right up to it as of
September 5, 2009. It has thus been changed to a 5-star terrain for
the time being.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Ahhh, yes...yet another in cache in the famous &quot;moist&quot; series (or
perhaps it's &quot;infamous&quot;, depending on your moisture tolerance
level)! We accessed this lovely river-side location on-foot, but it
is also easily accessible via canoe or kayak...during heavy rains,
that may be the only way to access it, in which case the terrain
rating will increase accordingly!&lt;br/&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So, being a short distance away we decide to climb down off the boardwalk and head straight to it.  It did not take long to realize that this was one of the caches that was going to require wet feet.  m^3 said something like &quot;we may as well get wet and get it over with&quot;, so off we go.  Fairly easy to find.  The river was now at and beyond the cache site.  After signing the cache log, m^3 reviews his topo map and says something like &quot;lets bushwhack to Pigskin&quot; (GC18J1J), and also says &quot;we should be getting up out of the water in about 100 meters&quot;.  We are already wet, will be heading away from the river so why not. I look at my GPS, 1/2 mile to go.  m^3 takes his compass bearing and off we go.  After about 100 meters I can no longer see or hear him.  It is still very wet.  The water depth varies from knee deep to crotch deep and no dry ground except for the occasional small tree island.  I keep going figuring that m^3 is off to my right and probably ahead of me.  After a while I stop to remove my phone and wallet from my pocket to place them in my pack. 

That 100 meter water walk ended up being a little bit longer, like the full one half mile to the cache (Pigskin).  When I get to the cache area I spook a flock of turkeys, so I figure m^3 is not around here yet.  Before I find the cache he arrives, seems he was behind me after all.  That did not happen again for the rest of the journey.    TFTH

Started the morning with a quick trip around Weedon Wonderland to check on all stages and then drove to the Hillsborough River for an upstream paddle from Morris Bridge.  There was a gator nearby but he did not want anything to do with me or the cache. 

I guess that it is fitting that I would do one of your kayak caches on the same day you were doing a couple of mine.  Enjoyed the short trip into seventeen runs before heading back downstream.  FTF  TFTH  </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Just park your canoe or 'yak and grab this Decon as you paddle your
way along the Hillsborough River. Cache is more easily accessed
from the Trout Creek area but you can also paddle downstream from
Morris Bridge.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We enjoyed paddling this area... there is an abundance of wildlife.
We saw Roseate Spoonbills, Annhingas, Ibis, Egrets, Herons, Turtles
and of course, everyone's favorite, the American Alligator. We
noted gator tracks about the cache site.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You should be able to see the cache from the river although you may
not immediately spot it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M geocaching
disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual

cannot be seen. Have fun! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

Other times you may need to use stealth to grab it. BYOP
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm laughing at clouds.&lt;br/&gt;
So dark , up above ,&lt;br/&gt;
The sun's in my heart&lt;br/&gt;
And I'm ready for love.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Let the stormy clouds chase.&lt;br/&gt;
Everyone from the place&lt;br/&gt;
Come on with the rain&lt;br/&gt;
Have a smile on my face&lt;br/&gt;
I'll walk down the lane&lt;br/&gt;
With a happy refrain&lt;br/&gt;
And singin'&lt;br/&gt;
Just singin' in the rain&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I'm dancin' and singin' in the rain&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Couldn't help but hum this classic tune as we hid this cache
amongst the raindrops...&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Original cache contents include items such as M&amp;M CD #1 and a
variety of other goodies.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so, of course,
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. That being said, the hiding spot should be fairly obvious
once you get within 40 feet of the cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please&lt;/b&gt; be sure to secure and conceal the cache well when you
rehide it so it cannot be seen from the trail...and, of course,
have fun!

locating Postpile's 
Big Pine Island Roundabout. While planning our route, IK's Meg
suggested to us that if we cross the river at a point very near to
where we ultimately placed this cache, it would shorten our trip.
She did.... we didn't. After deciding that we were not in the mood
to go for an early morning swim we found an alternative that was
almost as short. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In order to reach this cache you can either go Meg's way, our way
or by Kayak/Canoe. The choice is yours.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Oh by the way the area immediately surrounding the cache may be
quite moist at times.. so please plan accordingly. &lt;br/&gt;
Be Safe, Have Fun!&lt;br/&gt;

is hidden...it actually relates to an experience we had with one of
our children while on the trail leading to the cache. Fortunately,
all's well that ends well!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Anyway...the cache itself involves approximately 400 feet of
bushwacking off the main trail. Dense tree cover may affect your

intuition to find the actual cache. Please rehide the cache
securely and conceal it well so it cannot be seen. Have fun! &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

some wonderfully moist swampland...and, whaddyaknow...we just
happened to have some cache fixings in our backpack!  &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Although the journey is short (less than a mile round-trip), you
may find this hunt to be both memorable and challenging as you
bushwack your way through a beautiful Cypress swamp. Waterproof
boots are advisable and after some significant rain, a canoe or
kayak might come in handy! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Cache should be easily found once you have made your way to ground
zero. Terrain rating will vary based upon the water levels. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M geocaching
disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual

9:45am     Sign log at “The Grinch”.  Follow some trail then Bushwhack south.
10:04am   Sign log at “Deliverance”.  Bushwhack south. 
10:42am    Arrive at “Dark Green Area Alternative”.   Saw several pigs here but no Cotamundi.  Perform some maintenance.  CITO and re-attach cache to a small branch.  It was lying on the ground.  Placed a nice natural cache container that I found in the dry swamp on the island here.  Too much walking ahead for me to make it worthwhile to haul it out.  
11:09am     Leave “Dark Green Area Alternative”.  Bushwhack south.  Saw several deer including a nice buck.  Tried to follow an east-west blazed trail about .5 miles south of the cache.  Wandered around and picked a place for a future cache placement.
12:17pm    Arrive at the final cache for Big Pine Island after wandering in from “DGAA”.  
12:28pm   Leave the final for “BPI”.  Head south to check on Stage 5.  
12:54pm   Cross the Hillsborough River at N28 04.683, W82 17.973.  Bottom very solid except for the first two steps.  Rolled my pants up to just over the knee and they stayed dry on the crossing.  (Carried Crocs for crossing)
1:03pm   Checked stage 2 of “Return by River”.
Meandered the riverbank upstream.
1:29pm    Checked on stage 1 of “Return by River”.
1:40pm     Checked final ammo can at “The Lost Trail”.
1:49pm     Hang out at a picnic table at Sargeant Park.  Log on to geocaching.com to obtain coordinates for a nearby cache that I have not found.
2:05pm   Sign log at “John B. Sargeants Park”.
Head back southwest into Jefferson Equestrian Area.  Check on stages 4 and 5 of “The Lost Trail”.  
Leave the lost trail to check on stage 3 of “Return by River”.
3:15pm    Leave stage 3 of “Return by River”.  Head over to Cow House Creek.  Follow Cow House Creek downstream looking for a dry crossing.  
3:23pm cross Cow House Creek  (dry)
Enter off road bicycle area.  Check on stage 2 of “The Lost Trail”.
4:10pm  Check on stage 2 of “Mandible Multi”.  
Check stage 1 of “The Lost Trail”.  Head north and cross the Hillsborough River on the highway bridge.  Go back into Washburn.  Check on “Connection”
5:26pm  Arrive back at vehicle in Flatwoods.

&lt;br/&gt;
When you find out things about yourself&lt;br/&gt;
That you hadn't ought to know&lt;br/&gt;
When your grandma calls and books you&lt;br/&gt;
on the Jerry Springer Show&lt;br/&gt;
And you find out you and your wife of 10 years&lt;br/&gt;
Just might be related&lt;br/&gt;
Brother, life's not over&lt;br/&gt;
It's just simply complicated.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There's other situations that might challenge you I guess&lt;br/&gt;
When your daughter tries out for the football team&lt;br/&gt;
And your son tries on her dress.&lt;br/&gt;
And you start to think that the devil's in charge&lt;br/&gt;
Of how you're situated.&lt;br/&gt;
Life is still worth living&lt;br/&gt;
It's just simply complicated&lt;br/&gt;

I parked at Flatwoods entrance and bushwhacked directly (more or less) to the cache.  I found an object that would be cache worthy and one that M&amp;M would probably choose.  I did find a black frayed cord.  The same type of cord that would be in a camo bag.  But, I could not find a camo bag or a match container.  So either the cache is missing or the grinch did a good job of hiding the goods.  I looked around on the ground an in several nearby crevasses to no avail.  I tied the cord onto the object it was draped over and left something for the next searcher. 

From the cache I bushwhacked east less than 300 feet to the north-south horse trail then headed north to the vicinity of &quot;Hikers Cache&quot; final.  All is well there.  The creek that separates Washburn from Oakridge is almost completely dry.  I have never seen it like that before.  The previous times I have crossed it I was about waist deep in water.  From there I hiked to &quot;Out&quot;.  the cache was located about 2 feet from where I found it a while back.  Looking for some more adventure, I bushwhacked from &quot;Out&quot; back to the Flatwoods entrance, briefly stopping at The Grinch again.   I still did not see the cache.  Attached photo may be a spoiler or it may be a red herring.   I will be back.</groundspeak:text>

Though I was rapidly running out of daylight, I couldn't resist shooting down the Squiggy trail to grab this cache.  (Lenny was out of the question due to time constraints.  And my feet hurt.)   Why are they naming trails after secondary television characters?  While I wouldn't mind a Latka trail, this is a slippery slope.  What's next?  A Maynard G. Krebs trail? A Boner trail? An Urkel trail?!?! Oh, the humanity!

Hillsborough County and the City of St. Petersburg. Despite the
activities in the picnic areas, horse stables, rodeo arena, archery
range and BMX bicycle tract, the trails themselves traverse several
Florida habitats. Wildlife includes gopher tortoises, armadillos
and rabbits as well as all sorts of snakes (as always, be
careful!). …And of course you may also be greeted by numerous
horses and leashed doggies, who are also permitted in this
park.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Entrance to this great park is free but a $1.00 donation is
requested. We parked near the horse arena and BMX track and
proceeded to the trailhead at &lt;b&gt;N 28 07.324, W082 30.764&lt;/b&gt; . The
walk from the trailhead to the cache is approximately .2
miles.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Original cache contents include:&lt;br/&gt;
FM AutoScan Mini Radio&lt;br/&gt;
M&amp;M CDs 1,2,3&lt;br/&gt;
Dolphin magnet&lt;br/&gt;
Plastic whale&lt;br/&gt;
Flamingo keychain&lt;br/&gt;
Aloha friendship bracelet&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;Fishing Rules&quot; wall hanging&lt;br/&gt;
Plastic zebra&lt;br/&gt;
package of mini frames&lt;br/&gt;
doggie memo pad&lt;br/&gt;
box of crayons&lt;br/&gt;
several kiddie toys&lt;br/&gt;
logbook &amp; pens&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Since the cache is located only a couple feet off the trail,
please be sure to conceal it well when you rehide it. Have fun!

As we hiked down this trail we marveled at how, even in the midst
of the constant urban growth going on in New Tampa, this typically
Floridian wilderness is still ever-present and beautiful! Since the
trail itself is almost completely unshaded, please plan your
hiking/biking accordingly and be sure to bring plenty of liquid
refreshments.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A parking lot for this end of the trail is located at N 28º 07.928,
W082º 21.759. If the trail parking lot is closed, however,
recommended parking is in the Chili's parking lot - N 28º 07.931,
W082º 21.802. From there, follow the Bruce B. Downs Trail to the
Flatwoods Trail and on to the cache!&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Original cache contents include items such as M&amp;M CDs #1-3, a
NASCAR memo pad, a variety of bendy animals, keychains and other
novelties along with some kiddie toys.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so, of course,
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual

and have fun!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Guess what......this cache is only 2 miles from the entrance to Flatwoods Park on Morris Bridge Road. The original cache placed here was first accessed via a land route from the west by duracell. In his log he writes of getting to within 250 yards of the cache location only to run into one of the 17 runs. In his process of crossing he falls in and ends up ruining a cell phone. 

http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=9bbce45c-22af-4859-bc0f-f34a33f27f64&amp;log=y&amp;decrypt= 

Having hiked and paddled this area I knew that the cache is located on a large island and is surrounded by several of the 17 runs. The river is wide enough and deep enough to make one think twice about crossing. But, I remember a place where it is possible to cross on a fallen tree southwest of the cache. 

I left my office in Tampa at 4:45pm. It was raining. It did not look like rain to the northeast at Flatwoods so off I go. I decided on the drive over to give this one a shot. 

Crossing the paved road, I head easterly towards the cache beginning on the trails. I have a plan but change my mind along the way and start down the trail towards &quot;Out&quot;. When I am .75 miles from the cache I start bushwhacking. 
I crossed several dry and almost dry creeks along the way. Stopped to photograph a cool looking fern garden growing on a large downed tree. Wish I had an ammo can to leave here. When I get to 500 feet from the cache I start walking up and down the river bank looking for the crossing since I did not have the waypoint with me. My first choice does not look good so I continue along the bank till I find a place to cross on a series of logs without getting wet feet. From there it is a short hike to the cache and the virgin log book. Signed log, took a photo and off I go. Not wanting to backtrack I decide to head west-northwest and hope to intersect the unmaintained trail which passes &quot;Ancient Regeneration?&quot;. All works well and I am headed out. Stopped by another cache on the way back to Flatwoods. Got back to my vehicle a little before 8:00pm. The meandering round trip was just over 6 miles.  Thanks for the adventure.

…And of course you may also be greeted by numerous horses and
leashed doggies, who are also permitted in this park.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Entrance to this great park is free but a $1.00 donation is
requested.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache contains a theme. The mission is to locate different
items from a plane crash and to locate the missing Fishing Buddy
(Fishing Buddy is MIA).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There are 4 stages and there are NO trails to follow, bushwacking
at it's finest. The 1st stage is a decon can, 2nd stage is a micro,
the 3rd stage is a nantro in a camo-bag which contains the coords
for the final ammo can, also known as the flight recorder box.
Inside the ammo can are 2 new walkie talkies for the first finder.
They are to be used to call for help after completing the mission.
Hints are included because the tree cover makes satellite reception
difficult.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
NOTE: Between the 3rd stage and the final cache is &quot;King of the
Swamp&quot;, which we suggest visiting during your mission in the swamp.
It can be completed without doing &quot;S.O.S.&quot; but you will be making
your trip extra long if you do the caches separately.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to include water, bug spray, a walking stick to remove
spider webs in your way, extra GPS batteries, and the parking
coords for the trip out. The parking coords appear far from the 1st
stage, but you will be pleasantly surprised where you end up at the
end of the mission. This cache was placed by a member of the
FGA.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide all stages securely and conceal them well so
they cannot be seen. &lt;b&gt;Please be especially sure to well conceal
the final - it has been replaced twice already. The kids from the
youth camp hang out in these woods.&lt;/b&gt; Be Safe! Have Fun! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate each stage please be
sure to seal each container properly - otherwise they may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

Anyone one who attempts this one in July or August will give new meaning to the term extreme cacher.  As it is, during the dry season it proved to be quite a challenge.

We had a blast doing this one - definitely makes our list of favorite caches.  We used the straight line bushwack method to find all parts of the cache - we are still picking burrs out of parts of our bodies we didn't know existed.[:P]

We found all parts of the cache easily - with the exception of part 3 - the dense tree cover had us walking around in circles for about 15 mins before stumbling across the pill container.  Swapped trinkets and left M&amp;M CD #2.

Thanks you so much for placing this cache

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Finishing up my unfound caches in Lower Hillsborough Wilderness Park today (at least until the new ones are published for the event).  Of course I did not go far enough to find the trail to the cache area.  And, of course the cache was on the wrong side of the nicely filled Trout Creek.  Bushwhacked through and past several water hazards to the creek.  Did not want to wade the creek so I found a log crossing.  I crossed over to the cache.  Then I bushwhacked south to &quot;08 Cache&quot; purposely staying off the perimeter firebreak.  The transition area between upland and wetland is very sporadic here.  Not the easiest bushwhack I have ever done.  After finding 08 and another cache I looped around and then  I saw the trail, so I walked down the trail.  My log crossing was just 50 feet or so north of the trail.  TFTH

This one was my 100th M&amp;M find.  Thanks

After logging the FTF there I wandered towards this one.  Along the way I experienced a nice dry hike in the &quot;swamp&quot;.  The way I took into the cache passed an old hunt camp(?).  I have posted a photo.  I came to a fence but soon realized that it was not the correct one so I crossed it and headed to the cache.  After logging I took a cross country route northerly to the next one.  Quite easy in the dry swamp, until I got close and had to bushwhack through the palmettos.  TFTH  </groundspeak:text>

At the end of the initial two-rack into this preserve, we were
pleased to turn onto this shady, semi-tropical section of the trail
system here. If approached the same way we approached this hiding
spot, an animal trail should take you pretty close to GZ.&lt;br/&gt;

As I approached GZ a large deer bounded away.  I only saw the back half but it looked big.  As it turns out he/she was probably within 20 feet of the cache when I spooked him/her.  Another nice M&amp;M location.  I wonder what will happen during the rainy season.  

I cache without descriptions.  Now having read the description I think the cache may have moved. As I approached I thought it would have been in a nearby feature and a little higher than where I saw it.   It was not secured and definitely wasn't hidden.   I left it as I found it.  Next cacher may want to secure and cover per the cache description request. 

BTW I don't remember seeing a TB in the cache.   TFTH

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Last one today.  Hiked in from Flatwoods park.  Did a bit of bushwacking and crossed a creek (not too shallow). From here hiked out to the North trailhead.  Was going to take the road back (2.75 miles), but got a copy of the trail map from the kiosk.  Looks like there is a trail that connects back to the south trailhead.  So back along the trails.  Unfortuntely the trail is not completed yet, I guess you can't always trust the map.  This time I only had to bushwack about .15 miles, but I had to cross that creek again.  It is not shallow.  The creek is very scenic.  Saw several turkeys.  A very large gobbler took flight about 20 feet ahead of me.  That was a sight, watching him navigate through the trees while watching me.  Great hike.  It will be nicer when they finish the trail and hopefully build a bridge.  Currently there is some flagging and orange paint dots on the trees to indicate the intended route. Total trip over 10 miles.  TFTH </groundspeak:text>

cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay

All your life you have to deal with ups and downs&lt;br/&gt;

Don't forget to balance on your ready feet&lt;br/&gt;

The actual cache location looks like it may have been brought down
by some sort of gravity storm!
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Although this spot is convenient to the many shopping and dining
options in Wesley Chapel and New Tampa, it is a nice natural spot
to temporarily get away from it all! Although there may be other
parking options, we parked in a nearby commercial parking lot at
&lt;b&gt;N28 11.258 W082 21.641&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;

The swamp is encroaching the area. You are looking for a camoed

with the intention of finding some of the caches that lay beyond
where we placed this. Mimi had to make a flight later that
afternoon. This is the point where we stopped and decided that we
wouldn't be able to proceed and have her make it to the airport on
time.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As we were drinking some water and preparing for our return trip we
noticed this metal shack in the brush. You know the rest. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M disclaimers! (plus some
extra disclaimers too!)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
1 - Depending on your approach, the last several feet or so may
require some whacking through some brambles. It's not too bad, but
if you don't like brambles, fell free to pass on this cache. You
have been warned. ;)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
2 - Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of
course you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the
actual cache. Please re-hide the cache securely and conceal it well
so it cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all

dry.&lt;/b&gt;

This ended up being the only one for the day as the Green Swamp was living up to its name after all the rain this past week!

As it turned out the final of Peccary Chess was not really that close to the potential crossing so I hiked back to the parking.  Headed out for this one at 4:45 p.m. I stopped along the way to find the other new one, then continued to stage 1.  Found it and the final with out any trouble.  After signing the log I just put the GPS away and headed for the setting sun.  That brought me back to the trail.  I still had time to find 4 more caches before arriving back at the parking lot at sunset.  TFTH</groundspeak:text>

The 3-star terrain is based on the fact that the final few hundred
feet to the cache will involve some bushwacking and the actual
cache location may get a bit damp during the rainy season. (OK -

Since we are coming upon our one-year anniversary living in
beautiful Florida, we decided to celebrate by going back to our
roots and a hiding a cache &quot;Island Style&quot;...&quot;Long Island Style&quot;,
that is! So, if you ever find yourself geocaching on Long Island,
say &quot;Hi!&quot; to our LIGO friends and look for similar
types of hides! :-)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Original cache contents include items such as M&amp;M CDs and a
variety of other goodies.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so, of course,
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please be sure to secure and conceal the cache well when you
rehide it so it cannot be seen from the trail...and, of course,
have fun while enjoying the nearby lake views!&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The night before placing this cache we were all out for the
midnight release of the Twilight DVD and the next day was to be a
day of spring cleaning without much chance of caching. This was an
agreement since we had done a full day of caching the week before.
However when we got up others on the team got involved in watching
the Twilight movie that we had gotten the night before. While they
were watching it (I have seen it enough and we now have the DVD) I
say &quot;So do you mind if I go grab a couple caches while you finish
the movie&quot; What you don't think I am going to go start spring
cleaning while they are watching the movie!!! So I now have about
two hours to cache! So where to go! That was an easy choice I
needed to clear two nearby caches off my todo list so I threw the
geobike into the geomobile and headed out with my MP3 player! After
completing the nearby caches I headed back and since I have now
started to carry new cache containers with me I started looking for
a place to put out another cache in the area to help draw more
people out to this area! As I am looking for a good spot what song
comes up on my random rotation on my MP3 player but a song from
Twilight. After having my fill of Twilight the night before I
started to forward to the next song but I looked at the title of
the Twilight song and it was &quot;Eyes on Fire&quot; by Blue Fountain. Since
this weekend has been about Twilight and the fact that in this area
you would need to keep you eyes on the fire if there was one it
would be an appropriate name for a cache. Found a cool spot for the
cache placement that looks like it has been through some fires in
the past and survived. Hopefully this cache will its Eye on Fire in
the future! 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Make sure you check out the other caches that are located off this
two track trail. There are still plenty of spots along the trail
for you to leave a cache too! It makes a nice bike ride or hike.
Make sure you bing plenty of water and CITO while in the area. No
telling what you will find.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

This location will get quite wet during the rainy season, terrain
difficulty is rated accordingly. &lt;br/&gt;

You can reach this one by hiking, biking, or horseback. Enjoy the
scenery and if you are out at the right time you might see some
wildlife while out here. This is located right off the trail and
should be an easy find.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Purchased from the Overstreet Family in May of 2006, this 5067
acre park nestled within the Green Swamp Wilderness Area and named
after one of the tributaries that flows through the property was
opened to the public on January 20, 2007. For over 60 years this
property was managed as a cattle ranch by the Overstreet family.
Past activities on the land also included lime rock mining, timber
harvesting, citrus production and turpentining. Comprised mainly of
Pine Flatwoods, Cypress Domes and open pasture land, this piece of
still pristine wilderness is home to many animal species including
the American Bald Eagle, Sherman’s Fox Squirrel, Gopher
Tortoise, White-Tail Deer, Wild Turkey and Bobcat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park is currently equipped with a lime rock entrance road,
grass parking area, wheel chair accessible restroom, informational
kiosk, picnic pavilion and several picnic tables and grills.
Visitors are invited to fish, picnic, and hike or ride their horses
on over 12 miles of trails and enjoy nature study at its
finest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day Use Entrance Fee: $3.00 per vehicle/up to 8 people and $1.00
per person for individuals who walk or bike in. Florida state parks
are open from 8 a.m. until sundown 365 days a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

Pithlachascotee or &quot;Cotee&quot; River if we ever get an ample rainy
season. Terrain rating will vary accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The trails in the Seranova Tract vary from full shade to open sun.
Please plan accordingly - and bring plenty of water.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M geocaching
disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a &quot;special&quot; multi using the Chirp, and it only works
with certain devices.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Simply go to the posted coordinates, and your GPSr will receive
coordinates for the final stage while walking down the pier. If
your GPSr does receive the coordinates I have found it helpful to
place the GPSr on the pier at the GZ and wait a little bit. You do
not have to leave the pier for the Chirp to kick in. You will be
looking for a hanging container.
&lt;p&gt;If you have trouble, make sure that you have the correct device,
latest firmware (your geocaching icon should be an open treasure
box), make sure that chirp searching is turned on in
Setup&amp;gt;Geocaching, and that the heart rate monitor is turned off.
If you can't enable chirp searching in your Setup&amp;gt;Geocaching
menu, then you don't have the right device/firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, you must use one of the GPSr noted above to receive
coordinates to the final stage while at the posted coordinates.
Physically finding the wireless beacon won't help. It has been
programmed by my GPSr and won't work with another GPSr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchased from the Overstreet Family in May of 2006, this 5067
acre park nestled within the Green Swamp Wilderness Area and named
after one of the tributaries that flows through the property was
opened to the public on January 20, 2007. For over 60 years this
property was managed as a cattle ranch by the Overstreet family.
Past activities on the land also included lime rock mining, timber
harvesting, citrus production and turpentining. Comprised mainly of
Pine Flatwoods, Cypress Domes and open pasture land, this piece of
still pristine wilderness is home to many animal species including
the American Bald Eagle, Sherman’s Fox Squirrel, Gopher
Tortoise, White-Tail Deer, Wild Turkey and Bobcat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park is currently equipped with a lime rock entrance road,
grass parking area, wheel chair accessible restroom, informational
kiosk, picnic pavilion and several picnic tables and grills.
Visitors are invited to fish, picnic, and hike or ride their horses
on over 12 miles of trails and enjoy nature study at its
finest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day Use Entrance Fee: $3.00 per vehicle/up to 8 people and $1.00
per person for individuals who walk or bike in. Florida state parks
are open from 8 a.m. until sundown 365 days a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's

opened to the public on January 20, 2007. For over 60 years this
property was managed as a cattle ranch by the Overstreet family.
Past activities on the land also included lime rock mining, timber
harvesting, citrus production and turpentining. Comprised mainly of
Pine Flatwoods, Cypress Domes and open pasture land, this piece of
still pristine wilderness is home to many animal species including
the American Bald Eagle, Sherman’s Fox Squirrel, Gopher
Tortoise, White-Tail Deer, Wild Turkey and Bobcat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park is currently equipped with a lime rock entrance road,
grass parking area, wheel chair accessible restroom, informational
kiosk, picnic pavilion and several picnic tables and grills.
Visitors are invited to fish, picnic, and hike or ride their horses
on over 12 miles of trails and enjoy nature study at its
finest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day Use Entrance Fee: $3.00 per vehicle/up to 8 people and $1.00

Park. Day Use Entrance Fee: $3.00 per vehicle/up to 8 people and
$2.00 per person for individuals who walk or bike in. Florida state
parks are open from 8 am until sundown 365 days a year.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Florida ranks fifth in the nation for Mineral Commodities. The
industrial mineral production value is around $1.92 billion.
Florida’s minerals are utilized worldwide. Most locals think of
phosphate as one of major minerals mined in Florida, which is,
supplying one-quarter of the world’s phosphate needs. However
another of Florida’s top minerals is Limestone. Florida ranks
second nationally in production and fourth in consumption of
crushed stone (limestone and dolostone). Most of the crushed stone
is used for road construction. Limestone can undergo calcinations
and can be used to manufacture Portland and masonry cement. Florida
ranks in the top five states in production and consumption of
Portland cement and is first in the production and consumption of
masonry cement. 



&lt;p&gt;Early mining in Florida was done by Native Americans. They
quarried the mineral chert from limestone for use in points and
tools. In the 1500's, Spanish settlers and soldiers quarried
coquina limestone near St. Augustine to form building blocks for
their forts and homes. Builders in Florida have used Limestone sine
Spanish times. Limestone is still an important industry in Florida
supplying raw materials for cement and road base.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The land where Colt Creek State Park is located was purchased
from the Overstreet Family in May of 2006, this 5067 acre park
nestled within the Green Swamp Wilderness Area and named after one
of the tributaries that flows through the property was opened to
the public on January 20, 2007. For over 60 years this property was
managed as a cattle ranch by the Overstreet family. Past activities
on the land also included lime rock mining, timber harvesting,
citrus production and turpentining. Comprised mainly of Pine
Flatwoods, Cypress Domes and open pasture land, this piece of still
pristine wilderness is home to many animal species including the
American Bald Eagle, Sherman's Fox Squirrel, Gopher Tortoise,
White-Tail Deer, Wild Turkey and Bobcat. The park is currently
equipped with a lime rock entrance road, grass parking area, wheel
chair accessible restroom, informational kiosk, picnic pavilion and
several picnic tables and grills. Visitors are invited to fish,
picnic, and hike or ride their horses on over 12 miles of trails
and enjoy nature study at its finest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artificial lakes in Colt Creek range for four to 25 acres.
These lakes are an artifact of a limerock mining operation while
the land was still privately owned. While the park was being
prepared to be open to the public the state ran into delays while
laying electrical lines in the ground due to the amount of limerock
in the area. They chose to bury the cable anyway to help keep the
area as natual looking as possible. Limerock can still be seen
through out the park along the trails. As trails were made and fire
breaks created many large limerocks were unsurfaced. Some of the
large ones are used throughout the park as barriers while many of
them are still scattered around. Some of these will be the object
of the requirements for this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To receive credit for this Virtual Cache you
must post the answers to the questions below.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. As you drive in toward Mac Lake you
will drive past the information area. Stop and read the
information. Post one interesting fact about the park that you
were not aware of from the display.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Find a &quot;wild&quot; lime rock while hiking
the trails and post the coordinates with your log.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Measure the &quot;wild&quot; lime rock you found
in #2 and post the estimated size in inches at the widest point visible. This cannot
be a lime rock that has been used by the park rangers for barriers
or roadways.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While you are at Colt Creek make sure you check out the many lakes
in the park as most of them were results of limestone mining. Also
be sure to check out the rest of the park caches for additional
history/information about the park. 
&lt;p&gt;Information gathered regarding Florida mining came from Florida
Department of Environmental Protection and personal knowledge of

I was able to sneak up on a small wild rock near Mac lake. It was about 24inches long at its' longest point. I found it near N28° 17.896 W082° 02.465

This was a three stage muti cache whic started on the western side
of the Mac Lake, the largest lake in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.floridastateparks.org/coltcreek/default.cfm&quot;&gt;Colt Creek
State Park.&lt;/a&gt; Due to construction it seem the original Stage One
location has issues. So this is now a two stage multi.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The coordinates for the first stage will take you to a view of a
place that was know by the locals as Dinner Pond. This is where
they the cattle workers ate dinner in the shade after a long day
with the cattle. The coordinates from this stage will take you to
the final location. From the final cache site you will be able to
see Duck Pond.
&lt;p&gt;Purchased from the Overstreet Family in May of 2006, this 5067
acre park nestled within the Green Swamp Wilderness Area and named
after one of the tributaries that flows through the property was
opened to the public on January 20, 2007. For over 60 years this
property was managed as a cattle ranch by the Overstreet family.
Past activities on the land also included lime rock mining, timber
harvesting, citrus production and turpentining. Comprised mainly of
Pine Flatwoods, Cypress Domes and open pasture land, this piece of
still pristine wilderness is home to many animal species including
the American Bald Eagle, Sherman’s Fox Squirrel, Gopher
Tortoise, White-Tail Deer, Wild Turkey and Bobcat. The park is
currently equipped with a lime rock entrance road, grass parking
area, wheel chair accessible restroom, informational kiosk, picnic
pavilion and several picnic tables and grills. Visitors are invited
to fish, picnic, and hike or ride their horses on over 12 miles of
trails and enjoy nature study at its finest.&lt;/p&gt;
Day Use Entrance Fee: $3.00 per vehicle/up to 8 people and $1.00
per person for individuals who walk or bike in. Florida state parks
are open from 8 a.m. until sundown 365 days a year.

Glad we did too - this is a beautiful state park and we enjoyed traversing the many terrains as we made our to each of the cache stages, all of which we found readily.

Thanks for a well-executed multi on which we are proud to claim the FTF!

We located the cache after walking in circles around it and on the way out stopped a family from out of town to tell them about Geocaching.  I gave them the website and they seemed very interested in hunting for treasures. We took nothing, left nothing and signed the log. The half mile nature trail was very enjoyable.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A popular misconception is that the Coriolis effect determines the
direction in which bathtubs or toilets drain, and that water always
drains in one direction in the Northern Hemisphere, and in the
other direction in the Southern Hemisphere. This myth has perhaps
been perpetuated by the Simpsons episode &quot;Bart Vs. Australia,&quot; in
which protagonist Bart Simpson has a young Australian boy confirm
that his toilet water in the Southern Hemisphere spins in the
opposite direction from Bart's own in the Northern Hemisphere. The
myth is also propagated by the plethora of websites claiming that
this fallacy is true. Strangely, many of these sites claim that
drain water spins clockwise north of the equator, and
counterclockwise south of it, which is reversed from direction of
spin that would result from the Coriolis force, if it were a
determining factor.&lt;br/&gt;

Mimi: &quot;I don't think that looks like the hint&quot;
Marc: &quot;Yeah I know it kind of looks like a (deleted).... Oh, I get it!&quot;

Odd thing is we almost hid a cache in this stand of trees last week - at the time we weren't 100% sure of the status of the preserve and many of the trees in the area have slash marks on them, so we opted against it.  Nice spot.

place in theis area to hide the cache we heard some rustling in the
nearby brush. The park ranger who was with us went and
investigated. He soon found the source of the noise and an
armadillo ran toward us as it did I looked down and noticed a bunch
of holes in the ground and as the armadillo got to where we were
standing he went straight in one for cover. Hence the name of the
cache!

Creek State Park&lt;/a&gt; - Purchased from the Overstreet Family in May
of 2006, this 5067 acre park nestled within the Green Swamp
Wilderness Area and named after one of the tributaries that flows
through the property was opened to the public on January 20, 2007.
For over 60 years this property was managed as a cattle ranch by
the Overstreet family. Past activities on the land also included
lime rock mining, timber harvesting, citrus production and
turpentining. Comprised mainly of Pine Flatwoods, Cypress Domes and
open pasture land, this piece of still pristine wilderness is home
to many animal species including the American Bald Eagle, Sherman’s
Fox Squirrel, Gopher Tortoise, White-Tail Deer, Wild Turkey and
Bobcat. The park is currently equipped with a lime rock entrance
road, grass parking area, wheel chair accessible restroom,
informational kiosk, picnic pavilion and several picnic tables and
grills. Visitors are invited to fish, picnic, and hike or ride
their horses on over 12 miles of trails and enjoy nature study at
its finest. 
&lt;p&gt;Day Use Entrance Fee: $2.00 per vehicle/up to 8 people and $1.00
per person for individuals who walk or bike in. Florida state parks

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Vultures are scavenging birds, feeding mostly on the carcasses of
dead animals. Vultures are found in every continent except
Antarctica and Oceania.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A particular characteristic of many vultures is a bald head, devoid
of feathers. This is likely because a feathered head would become
spattered with blood and other fluids, and thus be difficult to
keep clean. This feature also allows quick cleaning in a nearby
river.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A group of vultures is occasionally called a venue in literature.
When circling in the air, a group of vultures is called a kettle.
The German word Geier does not have a precise meaning in
ornithology, and is sometimes used to refer to a vulture in
English, as in some poetry.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
 Steve Irwin, the hugely popular Australian television personality
and conservationist known as the “Crocodile Hunter,” was killed on
9/4/06 by a stingray while filming off the Great Barrier Reef. He
was 44.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Irwin was famous for his enthusiasm for wildlife and his catchword
“Crikey!” in his television program “Crocodile Hunter.” First
broadcast in Australia in 1992, the program was picked up by the
Discovery network, catapulting Irwin to international celebrity. We
placed this cache in his honor.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The area where the cache is hidden is quite moist and may even
become moister at times. Terrain rating will vary accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;

spot by without placing a cache. BYOP
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

The trails in the Seranova Tract vary from full shade to open sun.
Please plan accordingly - and bring plenty of water. You have been
warned.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;...And now for the standard M&amp;M geocaching
disclaimers!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

Creek State Park&lt;/a&gt; - Purchased from the Overstreet Family in May
of 2006, this 5067 acre park nestled within the Green Swamp
Wilderness Area and named after one of the tributaries that flows
through the property was opened to the public on January 20, 2007.
For over 60 years this property was managed as a cattle ranch by
the Overstreet family. Past activities on the land also included
lime rock mining, timber harvesting, citrus production and
turpentining. Comprised mainly of Pine Flatwoods, Cypress Domes and
open pasture land, this piece of still pristine wilderness is home
to many animal species including the American Bald Eagle, Sherman’s
Fox Squirrel, Gopher Tortoise, White-Tail Deer, Wild Turkey and
Bobcat. The park is currently equipped with a lime rock entrance
road, grass parking area, wheel chair accessible restroom,
informational kiosk, picnic pavilion and several picnic tables and
grills. Visitors are invited to fish, picnic, and hike or ride
their horses on over 12 miles of trails and enjoy nature study at
its finest.&lt;/p&gt;
Day Use Entrance Fee: $2.00 per vehicle/up to 8 people and $1.00
per person for individuals who walk or bike in. Florida state parks
are open from 8 a.m. until sundown 365 days a year. &lt;br/&gt;

We actually saw a number of creatures out there today.   After a slight scare when we almost stepped on a rather large (albeit dead) snake, we saw a number of killdeer birds, a heron, our gator friend, grasshoppers-in-love and an armadillo.  ....and of course numerous horses with their people!

Thanks for a fun caching experience!

&lt;br/&gt;
 A fairly romantic version of the legend as told by Rufus Joseph
Tillman.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 A Spanish soldier fell in love at first sight with an Indian
chief's favorite daughter. Though the chieftain forbade the couple
to see each other, the Spaniard was too lovestruck to stop meeting
the maiden in secret. The father found them out and ordered his
braves to tie the Spaniard high up in the top of an ancient oak
tree. The Spaniard had only to disavow his love to be freed, but he
steadfastly refused. Guards were posted to keep anyone -- the
chief's daughter above all -- from giving food or water to the poor
Spaniard.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 The Spaniard grew weaker and weaker, but he still would not
renounce his love for the girl. Near the end, the Chief tried to
persuade him once more to stay away from his daughter. The Spaniard
answered that not only would he refuse to disavow his love, but
that his love would continue to grow even after death. When at last
the Spaniard died, the chief kept the body tied up in the tree as a
warning to any other would-be suitors.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Before long, the Indians began to notice that the Spaniard's beard
continued to grow. The Indian maiden refused ever to take a husband
-- unless the Spaniard's beard died and vanished from the tree. As
the years went by, the beard only grew stronger and longer,
covering trees far from the Indian maiden's village. Legend says
that when the Spanish Moss is gone, the Spaniard's love will have
finally died with it.&lt;br/&gt;

encountered a large (10-12ft) gator meandering down the trail

reminded us of the mythological Medusa. In Greek mythology, Medusa,
was a monstrous female character whose hair was made of snakes and
whose gaze could turn people to stone. Although this tree's
branches are not made of snakes, they do bare a resemblance to
Medusa's wild hair. ...And although we were not turned to stone as
we gazed upon Medusa Tree, there is a suspicious pile of stone
right nearby...some former geocacher perhaps?!?&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Precautions:&lt;/b&gt; Hiking is allowed but not recommended during

for the Green Swamp for 2007-2008 are located here.&lt;/b&gt;
Hikers must wear 500 square inches of orange clothing above the

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Project 365 is a year long project during 2011 to create 365 new
caches in the Central Florida area. My goal during 2010 was to find
at least one cache every day to complete my 365 grid. Since I
completed that with the help of a lot of local cachers I wanted to
return the favor and place some new caches in my normal caching
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started caching, not a day goes by when I don't pass an
area and think &quot;That's a good spot for a cache.&quot; Now let's see if I
can remember them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a variety of caches ranging from park and grabs to
difficult. Some will be power runs, some may make you take a long
hike or bike ride, while others may require a boat or kayak. Let's
see how many you can find over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;

Tiger Cubs is an exciting introduction to the scouting program for first grade boys (or 7 years old) excited to get going! Tiger Cubs do stuff - lots of stuff - with their adult partners. This program is intended to open up the world to inquisitive minds along with the caring guidance of adults. The first steps along the Boy Scout Trail are laid here and every rank advancement through the scouting program builds on the basic categories of activity done as tigers. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">While exploring the area, couldn’t help but go back in time
to our childhood in the 1970s when 
&lt;i&gt;The Magic Garden&lt;/i&gt; was on WPIX in NY! As children of the
early ‘70s living in the metro-NY area, we often welcomed
Paula, Carol and Sherlock into our homes and in some weird way,
this garden brought back memories of that flower-childesque show
…&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Crews Lake Wilderness Park is a Pasco County Park with the
following facilities:&lt;br/&gt;
Bike Trail&lt;br/&gt;
Boat Ramp &amp; Canoe Access&lt;br/&gt;
Boardwalk&lt;br/&gt;
Tent Camping&lt;br/&gt;
Fishing Pier &amp; Access&lt;br/&gt;
Nature &amp; Interpretive Trails&lt;br/&gt;
Picnic Area &amp; Shelters&lt;br/&gt;
Playground, Rest Rooms and Volleyball.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The park is open from Dawn to Dusk.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above coordinates will bring you to the gardens in the park.
Once you find the gazebo, answer the following questions to get the
coordinates for the &lt;b&gt;final&lt;/b&gt; stage.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
1. How many supports are holding up the gazebo? Subtract 7 from
that number to get A.&lt;br/&gt;
2. How many benches are there in the gazebo? Add 88 to that number
to get CD.&lt;br/&gt;
Substitute your answer for the letters to get the coordinates to
the &lt;b&gt;final stage&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;N 28º 22.4A5&lt;br/&gt;
W 082º 32.0CD&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 
&lt;/p&gt;

On the way back it seemed like we passed every other cacher from the event.  And WWWilma spotted something that may have been a bobcat in the forest.  TFTC!

As we were nearing stage two we spotted a family about 25 yards in front of us on the trail. I could hear the dad tell his kids that they were the first people ever to use this trail. I chuckled to myself, waited for them to leave and found Stage 2. I thought they were geocachers, but when I got to the log, I saw that no one had signed it today. I tried to find the adventurous family on the way out to explain what geocaching was, but I couldn't find them so on we went.  Thanks for the hide!</groundspeak:text>

If a Cub Scout has completed the second grade (or is 9 years old) and has earned the Bobcat Badge, he may start earning the Bear rank. He receives a Bear Scout handbook and Bear neckerchief, but continues to use the Wolf neckerchief slide when beginning the Bear portion of the boy scout trail. He will continue to use the blue Cub Scout Uniform. This part of the boy scout trail is intended to take one school year, preparing the scout to begin earning his Webelos rank after he completes third grade.</groundspeak:long_description>

JG&amp;B and FSUDad, figured we would join the party.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Cache is located down a &quot;rustic&quot; trail. There is &lt;u&gt;no need&lt;/u&gt; to
do any heavy bushwacking to reach this cache, not that we are going
to stop you. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Original cache contents include a variety of trinkets as well as a
log sheet!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;And now for the standard M&amp;M disclamers:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Dense tree cover may affect your final GPS readings so of course
you may have to use your geocaching intuition to find the actual
cache. Please rehide the cache securely and conceal it well so it
cannot be seen. Have fun! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Richloam Hunt Dates 2007-08&lt;/b&gt; ARCHERY: September 22
through October 21. GENERAL GUN: November 10 through January 6.
TRAPPING: January 7 through March 1. SPRING TURKEY: March 15
through April 20.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;After you locate the cache please make
sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all
sides until they snap in place - otherwise the cache may not stay
dry.&lt;/b&gt;

slydogfl and young Cricket Hunter painting orange blazes and mowing
and clearing trails, thinking that this was our good deed of the
day. But, as it turns out, there was another reason that we were
wandering about the woods...to meet up with a poor, lost hunting
dog who looked like she was on the verge of starvation while we
were hanging out, eating a picnic lunch. So we shared our lunch
with this sweetheart of a canine, contacted her owner (fortunately
she was wearing a tag) and, with the help of everybody involved,
coordinated the joyous reunion between a dog and her humans.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So in honor of this feel-good occasion, we place this cache. Hope
you experience similarly good karma while searching! Have fun!

sure to seal the Decon container properly by pressing down on all

Since I get down to Crystal River every few months to visit family I was hoping this would hold out for a possible first to find.  Having found this cache when it was listed on geocaching.com (http://coord.info/GCYFFC) I was pretty sure what I should be looking for.  Alas, I came up very empty after more than an hour of searching.  I did run into some very inquistive [url=http://www.dickbrewer.org/fox_squirrel.html]Sherman's Fox Squirrels[/url], a trio of them in fact. They were so much fun to watch and did everything but talk to let me know I was in their territory. 

Really wish I'd checked the history on this listing more thoroughly before I headed out to the woods this morning though.  Seems like it was just imported into OX and not updated.  The hunting dates have changed for sure.

I ended up not finding the container (nor the empty decon noted be previous searchers on the original geocacing.com listing.  Was the container ever really checked on or replaced?

Hopefully the owner can update the listing text and then check on the hide.

For those good gentle folk whose heart goes all a twitter every time a new film can is hidden in a 500 acre, sweltering, exhaust laden Wally World parking lot bristling with SUVs driven by soccer moms, I offer my humblest apologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those kind souls who believe slapping a hide-a-key on an uninspired section of guard rail, every 529' and copy/pasting the cache description over and over so they don't need to engage their brain cells, is the quintessential essence of caching, I hope you can forgive me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cache might not be your cup of Earl Grey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for the rest of you kooks, (&quot;Kook&quot; being defined as anyone insane enough to actually enjoy slugging their way through miles of swamp, dodging wild hogs, alligators and venomous snakes, just to look for a metal box full of Dollar Store trinkets), come on down! You'll have a blast!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this beautiful day, several representatives from the Florida Geocaching Association http://www.floridacaching.com/ descended on this patch of woods, hiding gobs of caches for others to find. I was supposed to be out there with them, but Life intervened. The hiders took pity on me, knowing how much I love the swamps, and placed this cache for me, sending me the coords so I could type it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanx guys and gals! You're the kewlest!&lt;/p&gt;

Park on HWY 41 near the rock pillar. This pillar was built in the '30s as the entrance to what is now Whispering Pines Park.
A quick visit to the historical society failed to dertimine what the structure this cache is near use to be, but you will see, it's old.</groundspeak:long_description>

Dr. Charles Simpson started his practice in 2004 and had such a demand for natural healthcare he decided to open a second practice which is located at 8484 SW 103rd Street Road. This geocache is hidden in between the parking lot of Downtown Chiropractic &amp; the strip plaza with Bills Barber Shop in it. This is a vacant piece of land that belongs to Dr. Simpson. It has been approved by Dr. Simpson and is hidden within this vacant piece of land somewhere and its up to you to find it! GPS Coordinates are as acurate as I could possibly get them. Parking is available in the parking lot which belongs to our office. Our container is a tupperware container and inside you will find some goodies that are available for trading. Also, there is a logbook so bring a pen and happy hunting! :)

Great cache to visit if you’re into history.   &lt;br/&gt; From what has been recovered at this site, it appears that the area was used throughout the prehistoric period up to 10,000 years ago.  Some artifacts have been found dating back to the Paleo-Indian period.  The Paleo-Indians were nomadic people who moved around hunting the late Pleistocene mammals such as the bison, camel, deer, and elephants.  When the climate became drier and many large mammals became extinct, pre-historic man changed his lifestyle, resulting in the Archaic culture.  The Archaic people were hunters and gatherers who utilized the resources of their environment as they became plentiful according to the seasons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Those people would travel throughout the region feeding on nuts, acorns, deer, fish, shellfish and migratory birds as these diverse foods reached their yearly peaks of abundance.  Although the majority of the stone tools found at this site are from the Archaic period, some Paleo-Indian artifacts have also been reported.  In addition, the presence of pottery at this site indicates that later people also lived here. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The development of pottery is indicative of a more sedentary way of life and marks the end of the Archaic period.  Most of what has been found at this site includes stone tools as well as scrapers and cutting tools used to make those tools.  In addition to living here, there is evidence that prehistoric people were also manufacturing tools in this area.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site seems to be a very rich site with artifacts representative of many different time periods.  It is a significant find in the State.  Before posting your find, please e-mail a message to me describing the trail going to this cache as well as what you saw.  DO NOT be tempted to do any artifact hunting of your own - you will be arrested!

 Placed at the enterance to the Kanapaha Prairie. No bushwacking required. There is a large selection of SWAG and other various items including various kids little toys, US Army pins or Pens. Please place back as found, and camo as found.. Your looking for a camo painted plastic container6X6X8. Has lots of good SWAG!!

Park by the mailboxes for out of the way parking. People are parking in this area all the time to get their mail, will not attract attention, hopefully. Watch out for muggle traffic at rush hour times. :)

FTF goes to mvb0002!!! Good job. Thanks for the nice comments on the cache. :)

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There is no place to hide a cache at this very ecologically sensitive spot. You will have to hike out to the Observation Platform, about a 3 mile hike from the parking trailhead to the platform. 3 Mile round trip. 

This is a beautiful hike, if you do this in the morning or late evening you may get to see deer, LOTS of deer! My son and I saw 23 one morning doing this hike! The path is well marked and there is a small nominal fee for parking at the state park ($5 or $6). But well worth it. 

If you are a disabled vet, the State of Florida offers free lifetime passes for your family to all State Parks! Just a note for our vets.

Walk out to the observation platform and tell me how many steps you have to walk up to get to the top. Count the bottom and top step (the platfrom counts as 1). Whats the number?

Parking is located along US 441, just south of the prairie crossing, on the east side of 441.

Here is a link to the hike via Garmin Connect. You can even download it to follow if you like!

 This cache is located on what used to be a pretty poor dirt road. Then a few months ago they came along and paved it very nicely. Then landscaped and planted trees along it. It looks more like a driveway than a roadway. While driving down this road make sure to look at the 1 and only home along this road, its beautiful, one of the nicest in the county! Anyway back to the cache. Its a small camo bison tube. Room only for a log, bring your own pencil or pen!! Its placed in a spot that will require to look a bit. When you find it, please make sure to place it back EXACTLY as you found it. Thats part of the fun is where this one is hidden. Nice safe place to pull off the road is within feet. Good luck!!

There are 2 more caches along this road you may want to consider trying to grab.</groundspeak:long_description>

 This road was a very poor old dirt road, and then they came along and paved it and landscaped it and planted some beautiful new trees. Looks like a fancy driveway more than a road. But once they paved it, I thought it had too have a few caches along it, to nice a road not to. The cache is a full sized ammo can, hidden in a good spot that you can park along the road and get to within just a few feet of parking.  A great place for TB's. 

Please place this one back EXACTLY WHERE you found it. That spot I can see on my way home from work by just pulling off the road and looking so I can check on it daily. Its a good spot and you may have to look for a few seconds to find it. Have fun!!  </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Look at the fallen tree sticking out in the direction of the road. There is a hollowed out section near the end. Now look behind that.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

This road was a dirt road and used to be in bad shape, then they paved it a few months ago and have landscaped it and planted some nice trees. It looks like a really nice driveway to someones home. After they paved this and did all this work, I thought this road needed a few small caches along it. Don't forget to try the other two along this road!

This cache is a very well camoed Decon container. Cache has room for a log and small items. Cache used to be a micro Bison tube. But this container is much more fun. :) Please place back right where you found it as I can see it on the way home each day to make sure it placed OK.

Don't forget to stop by the others along the short stretch of this road!!  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This area is very nice, and is a result of the downturn in the construction business. This area was being developed then the crash and it all stopped. This cache is in a vacant lot that I have checked with the owner (realator who actually really liked the idea of a cache to draw people to the area of course). 

This is a large bison tube, green which is placed right where you think one should go if you have been caching for a bit. Coords were averaged over a period of time and should be very good.

If you have been caching before you will know right where the cache is. I have placed a Pathtag in the tube for the FTF! Small items will fit, but BYOP. No pen or pencil in cache, so bring one! Please replace right where you found it and camo it please, don't want to make it to easy for the next person right!!!

Also as a side note and has nothing to do with the cache, the Doctors Office in the small shopping center this is right behind, is GREAT!! I use them and the Doctor was a Dr. for NASA! And the PA is a experienced combat medic! They are the best in the area and if you need a doc, I recommend them. LOL.  </groundspeak:long_description>

 This cache should be an easy stop and grab. Your hunting a micro camo bison tube. This was a perfect place for a cache for the family to look for it. Should be an easy grab. A few thorns in the area but you don't have to get stuck by them to get to the cache, I just walked around them.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is dedicated to men and women who serve in our Public Safety area. The cache sits just outside the Institute of Public Safety Grounds (on public right of way). The Santa Fe College, Institute of Public Safety is just on the other side of the fence. You are very near the center that trains your Paramedics, Police Officers, Deputies, and Corrections Officers. 

 You may even hear them out on the firearms range, thats the big mounds of dirt south of your position across the pond. The Institute sits on 164 acres and has a Driving Pad, Physical Abilities Course, 3 Firearms Ranges, and is a campus of Santa Fe College. If you drive through our parking lot to take a look at the institute, there is a LARGE Travel Bug in the parking lot near the west end of the main building. All I can say is its Silver in color and the TB # is on the rear drivers side window. Oh and the TB is very patriotic and military!

Be safe and no worries, your not being watched, much.

The cache is a standard ammo can (we use about 250,000 rounds of ammo a year here!) with lots of good swag, and a few travel bugs to start out with. And some very cool collectable &quot;challenge&quot; coins. Also some US Army stuff and flag pins to boot! There are also a few small childs toys for the kids! Please make sure to sign the log and observe the T1L1 rule. And make sure to camo as found, don't want this cache to go walking off! :) Its placed on the public side of the fence, no need to climb it.

You do not have to do any bushwacking, just be careful pulling off the road and stopping!

FTF goes to Paulzoo!!!! Good Job and thanks for stopping by!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Near this spot stands Chennault Plantation. On the night of
5/24/1865, two wagon trains filled with gold containing the last of
the Confederate treasury were robbed at Chennault Crossroads in
Lincoln County.
&lt;p&gt;The geocache is hidden near a granite marker bearing the names
of the families that settled the surrounding area. Look and you
will find the geocache. Look harder and you may just find the lost
Confederate Gold!&lt;/p&gt;
&amp;lt; &lt;br/&gt; Chennault, GA, is located at the crossroads of GA 44 and GA 79 and it is here that part of the Confederate Civil War treasure had been
lost when it traveled by wagon to Georgia with Confederate
president Jefferson Davis in the last days of the Civil War. The
treasure train left Danville, Virginia, on April 6, 1865, with
$327,022 in gold and silver coins, as well as bullion, donated
jewelry, and even floor sweepings from the Dahlonega mint. Some
$450,000 in coins and specie checks (paper money that could be
redeemed for metallic coins) that originated with Richmond banks
also traveled with the fleeing Confederate government. Almost all
the Confederate assets was dispersed, to pay soldiers returning
home, before the capture of Davis on May 10, 1865, near Irwinville.
The remaining funds from the Richmond banks were left in
Washington, Georgia. A detachment of Union soldiers set out to
divert this specie to a railhead in South Carolina. The wagons
stopped for the night at the Chennault Plantation and it was here
that on May 24, 1865, bandits attacked the wagons and $251,029 was
lost. Bank officials eventually recovered some $111,000 of the
stolen money. Union general Edward A. Wild led a search of the area
for more gold and earned notoriety for the arrest and torture of
the Chennault family, who Wild believed were hiding gold but who
turned out to be innocent. As a consequence, Union general Ulysses
S. Grant removed Wild from his command.&lt;br/&gt;

Cache is located off one of the paved walking trails. You are looking for a small locakable container with a few trinkets for trading.

I signed the log and didn't take anything as I did not have anything to leave. While sitting there signing the book, it was hard to believe I was sitting between a retail store and a neighborhood.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is special to our family because it was the first cache we had ever found. It is the one that got us started on our geocaching journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hidden on 5/15/2004, had 28 finds, and then went missing. The cache was archived by the reviewer on 3/9/2005. The original cacher(s) who placed the cache were geocaching members since 2003 and according to their profile page, the last time they logged on was January the 6th, 2005. So tomorrow being six years since the original cache owners even thought about geocaching, I want to place a cache back at this location remembering our first geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located in a park with paved walkways. You can use the walkways to get to the back of the park then hit the trail for a couple hundred feet. You are looking for a unique natural feature about 60 feet high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache container is a small locking plastic container clearly marked and hidden with a logbook, stash note, and a few trinkets for trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Like the State Quarter Series there will be 50 caches but unlike the State Quarter Series, there will be no useless trivia, just the facts ma'am.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Mount Frissell, 2,454 feet, located on the border of southwest Massachusetts and northwest Connecticut, is a prominent peak of the Taconic Range. The peak and northern part of the mountain are located within Massachusetts. The southern slope of Mount Frissell is located within Connecticut and rises to the highest elevation within that state, 2,379 feet. Bear Mountain, located 1.3 miles to the east, is the highest mountain summit in Connecticut. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

You are looking for a .50 cal ammo can stocked full of goodies. Be on the look out for the next High Point cache - Ebright Azimuth.

&lt;p&gt;You will be hiking CNF trail 37. It starts out moderate but
there are two spots where you have to go up and over some flat damp
rocks. At times the trail is narrow with a sharp drop off to the
left and into the stream. It is not dangerous but you need to watch
your step. We love kids, especially our grandkids, but I would not
take a child under five up this trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the falls, there is a fallen tree which blocks the trail.
Just before the double blue blaze, go right and up and around the
tree and then back left to the trail. You are about there. The
cache is a camo painted ammo box. You shouldn't see a lot of people
here but use stealth and replace exactly as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We try to make all of our caches &quot;kid friendly&quot; and please don't
feel that this hike is overly difficult but is too tricky for
toddlers. Marge and I hiked this trail several years ago and forgot
where it was. We took a lot of pictures then and with a little
internet detective work we found it and want to share it with
you.&lt;/p&gt;

trail and walk along a very nice stream. Be stealthy because there
could be hikers and fishermen (or women) in the area. If seen,
pretend you are trying to catch snakes. That's always good for
clearing out a crowd. We initially stocked the cache with all kinds
of outdoor and kids goodies. The container is a 1.1 gal. Rubber

20 feet or so. Kids can go along but let an adult go the last 20

The falls are classifyed as a cascade type waterfall. Laurel Creek has cut a winding path and deep gorge through the bedrock of the mountains on it's way to the Doe River. Much of the trail is an old Rail Bed where East Tennessee and Western North Carolina cut through the mountain tops and spanned the gorges with trestles to set up a narrow gauge railroad to haul processed iron smelted from magnetite ore found in Cranberry, NC for distribution out of Johnson City, TN. Daily freight and passenger service started in 1882. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Jonesborough was founded in 1779, 17 years before Tennessee became a state. It was named after North Carolina legislator, Willie Jones, who supported North Carolina's westward expansion over the Appalachian Mountains.
 
The town was originally a part of North Carolina. In 1784, Jonesborough was one of the towns that attempted to create a new state called the State of Franklin, named after American founding father Benjamin Franklin. The State of Franklin, however, was never recognized by Congress, and was re-claimed by North Carolina by 1788.
 
Jonesborough is often considered to be the center of the abolitionist movement within the states that would join the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Elihu Embree printed his publication, The Emancipator, from the town of Jonesborough. Circulation began in 1820, making The Emancipator the first American periodical to be dedicated exclusively to the issue of the abolition of slavery. While Tennessee would later join the Confederacy, most East Tennesseans had Union leanings.
 
In the 1840s, Jonesborough was home to the Jonesborough Whig, a polemical newspaper published by William G. &quot;Parson&quot; Brownlow. Brownlow and rival editor Landon Carter Haynes brawled in the streets of Jonesborough in May 1840, and over the next several years bashed one another in their respective papers, each managing at times to thwart one another's political ambitions. Haynes left the newspaper business in 1845, and Brownlow (who later served as governor) moved the Whig to Knoxville in 1849.
 
Today, Jonesborough draws a good deal of tourism because of its historical status as Tennessee's oldest town and its significant historic preservation efforts. The town's museum describes local heritage of tobacco farming. The historic Chester Inn, built in 1797, still stands in downtown Jonesborough. The Jonesborough Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.
 
A local legend holds that the ghost of Andrew Jackson occasionally appears in the vicinity of a cabin in a town park. In 1788, future U.S. president Jackson spent several months in Jonesborough awaiting a caravan. During this time, he lodged in this cabin, which belonged to Major Christopher Taylor and was then located about a mile outside of town. In 1974, this cabin was removed from its original spot and reconstructed in the town's park. The ghost supposedly walks up to the front door and disappears into the building. The ghost has also been reportedly seen walking down the street, in the direction of the old courthouse. Jonesborough is also the home to the International Storytelling Center, which holds the annual National Storytelling Festival on the first full weekend in October. The Festival builds on the Appalachian cultural tradition of storytelling and has been drawing people from around the world for more than 35 years to both tell and listen. Large tents are pitched in parks around town and storytellers sit on stages or at the head of the tent to perform. Occasionally performances are interrupted for a moment by a passing Norfolk Southern Railway train. Past storytellers include Carmen Agra Deedy, Syd Lieberman, and Kathryn Tucker Windham. The festival influenced the development of a successful storytelling graduate degree program at the nearby East Tennessee State University.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The engine was known as the &quot;Cougar&quot; and ran within the old North
American Rayon facilities. It is unique because it is a steam
engine but had no fire box. Steam was pumped into it from within
the factory. The box car was found abandoned in a field in Shell
Creek. It had previously run on the East Tennessee &amp; Western
North Carolina Railroad or better known as the &quot;Tweetsie Railroad&quot;.
Mountain humorists called the ET &amp; WNC Railroad the &quot;Eat Taters
&amp; Wear No Clothes&quot; Railroad. The name &quot;Tweetsie&quot; was given by
mountain folk because of the shrill &quot;tweet, tweet&quot; train whistles
that were heard through-out the hills. The ET &amp; WNC Railroad
began operations in 1881 and ended on July 13, 1950. At the end of
the train is the caboose (what else)? At this writing, little is
known about it. When I find out more, I will add more information. 
&lt;p&gt;Please use stealth because there could be other visitors. Please
bring your own pen.&lt;/p&gt;

Stopped by to check out the covered bridge nearby and then over to the cache. It was dark and took a while to find.Very cool place. Looks like lots of construction is under way so hopefully on our next trip up we can see the progress. Thanks for the fun!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The cache is only .15 mile from where you will park. Take the
trail to the right (under, over or around the gate) and go straight
ahead. Shortly, you will cross a small stream but most of the time,
you can do it without getting your feet wet. It is uphill from
here. The cache is a camo ammo can filled with all kinds of outdoor
and kids goodies. At the cache hiding place, please put everything
back as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the cache is one thing, what lies behind you is the real
treat. After you find the cache and are on your way back, look for
the fork in the trail about 260 feet from the parking area. Take
the right fork and go down about 150 feet (there are some steps).
You will be rewarded with seeing one of the most beautiful spots in
all of East Tennessee. If you have never taken photos at a cache,
this is the one to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't discovered the name of the area, email me and I
will tell you. If you do know the name, please don't use in your
log because we don't want &quot;let the cat out of the bag&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELP KEEP MOTHER EARTH CLEAN. IF YOU SEE TRASH, PLEASE TAKE IT
OUT (CITO).&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I was out caching with the area's grandfather of caching, no
other than DMFlyer. The road blocked our way (a darn old gate) so
we decided that this beautiful area needed some more caches. We
looked up on the right side of the road and saw some fantastic rock
cliffs, DM said, &quot;don't you think that twin formation looks like a
hoot owl?&quot; Now you know where the name came from. Naming the cache
was one thing, getting to a spot for the hide was quite a different
matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to get to the cache. One is very hard and the
other is extremely hard. The long way or the short way (a matter of
less than 100 feet), take your pick. If you look close enough there
is a trail that goes up the hill and after reaching the top, you
must bushwhack along the edge to the cache. The bushes and thorns
are thick but this is the &quot;easy&quot; way. If you are a mountain goat,
take the short route but be very careful. A walking stick is
mandatory for seeking this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reaching and finding the cache take some time to enjoy the
view. You will be looking down on the Mill Creek which creates the
beautiful Blue Hole. Any time of the year this spot is ideal for
photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is fairly easy. I have included the coordinates for the
closest spot. You will be looking for a 6 inch wide by 10 inch tall
round lock-n-lock that is camo taped. It has some nice goodies in
it so please trade up or trade even. Thanks and have a good caching
day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to find the other 5 caches in the immediate area and a
couple up on top. One is a combo Earthcache/regular cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
This town has had several names: Shoate's Ford, Middletown, Union,
Zollicoffer, Union Depot and now Bluff City and this is where you
are going.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It certainly wasn't &lt;b&gt;Great&lt;/b&gt; and calling it a &lt;b&gt;Battle&lt;/b&gt; is
really a stretch, but here is the story. In 1861 Tennessee was the
last state which seceded from the Union. Sullivan County definately
favored the Confederacy while the neighboring counties of Carter
and Johnson leaned toward the Union.
&lt;p&gt;During most wars railroads are important and the Civil War was
no exception. Zollicoffer, as Bluff City was known during the War,
had a strategically important railroad bridge. The East Tennessee
Railroad ran straight through the little town of Zollicoffer and
there it crossed the Holston River. The War came to Zollicoffer
when William B. Carter, an East Tennessee Unionist called on all
Union supporters to ban together and defeat the Confederacy. Plans
were made to burn both the Carter's Depot and the Zollicoffer
bridges. Since the bridge at Carter's depot was heavily guarded and
a spy informed the group that the Zollicoffer Bridge had only two
local guards all attention turned to Zollicoffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime, shortly after November 7, 1861, Colonel Daniel Stover
from Elizabethton recruited 30 men and swore them into the military
and began the journey to Zollicoffer. The men halted about a
half-mile outside of the Town in woods near a hilltop farmhouse.
Three of the men stayed behind to guard the horses while the
remainder proceeded to the bridge. Their information was correct
for there were only two guards, Stanford Jenkins and William Jones
and they were under the bridge. When the guards heard the Yanks,
Jones fled the scene and Jenkins walked from under the bridge and
surrendered. That ended the BATTLE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilson O. Collins, who once employed Jenkins the guard,
M.L.Cameron and J.M.Emmert took turpentine and pine knots and soon
the bridge was ablaze. After the fire was well on its way, the men
returned to their horses and set out for Elizabethton. The only
problem that remained was what to do with Jenkins. Jenkins not only
recognized his old boss Collins, but he knew most of the bridge
burners. Obviously, killing him was the simplest solution. After
Jenkins begged for his life and swore that he would not tell who
burned the bridge he was turned loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jenkins returned, he told the Confederate Authorities all
about who was involved with the bridge burning. So much for his
life saving oath. The Confederates tried to capture all of the
bridge burners but most escaped and joined regular Union units,
especially the 13th Tennessee Volunteer Cavalry U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other times during the War the bridge was burned. After the
War, it was never used again. The pillars you see in and on the
banks of the river are all that remain of the Zollicoffer Bridge.
This ends the story of the Great Battle Of Zollicoffer. It was not
a Gettysburg, but important to the War none-the-less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;General Felix Zollicoffer&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small post script to the story. The town name was after a
Confederate General, Felix Zollicoffer of Tennessee. The General
didn't fair any better than the bridge. At Mill Springs, Kentucky,
on Jan. 19, 1862, he mistakenly rode up to the Union lines and was
shot dead before he could make a hasty retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Death of Gen. Felix Zollicoffer&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use stealth since this can be a very busy area. Please bring
your own pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; We moved and replaced the cache on Jan. 22, 2010.
It is now a waterproof match container..&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Edward Cox House is located on an old road which turns from modern Highway 11E one mile north of Bluff City. Owned and restored by the Holston Conference on Archives and History of the Methodist Church, it is now a Methodist Shrine.
 
Edward Cox built this two-story double hewn log house with a dogtrot (or breezeway) in the middle of the structure. Two chimneys with four fireplace openings flank either end of the house. Cox built the house in 1774. The log kitchen and other dependencies  have not survived.
 
Edward Cox was born in Baltimore County, Maryland about 1758. In 1773, the year of the first Methodist Conference in America, John Cox and his family, including his son , Edward, were converted, and received into the Church by Francis Asbury.
 
Soon after his conversion, Edward left home for the West, and settled here on land entered &quot; north of the Holston River.&quot; Edward Cox served in the Revolutionary War militia from 1775 to 1781 reaching the rank of Lieutenant. He is said to have assisted in building three frontier forts, Fort Lee on the Nolichucky River, and Fort Watauga and Womack's Fort. He served under the commands of Captain Robison, Colonel Bletcher, Colonel Isaac Shelby , Colonel Joseph Martin, and Captain Wallace, and acted as an Indian spy. He was with Colonel Isaac Shelby on the South Carolina campaign against the British.
 
When the war was over and American independence established, Edward returned to his home and farm.
 
Edward and his wife, Sarah (Sallie) Meredith Cox soon opened their home for Methodist meetings which he conducted himself. These meetings became so famous that persons from as far as twenty-five miles away would gather here on the Sabbath Day. Several times the famous Methodist Bishop Francis Asbury stayed with the Cox family and preached to those gathered there. It is said that the first Methodist Conference in Tennessee was held in this house by Bishop Asbury.
 
Edward Cox died in 1850 a few years after his wife's death. They were survived by eight of their ten children. Only two sons, Samuel and John Cox, and one daughter, Elizabeth Cox (Mrs. John Vincent) continued to live in Sullivan County, the others migrated to Arkansas, Indiana and Kentucky. Edward was buried back of the old home near an apple tree. Years later the gravestone found there was placed in a room at the Bluff City Methodist Church for safekeeping.

British war ship and shot all the sailors and buried them and the
booty on Dead Man's Island. Sometime it ain't even an island
depending on the tides (lake level).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Me Pet Dog&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anchor your boat on the South end of the island. You'll have ta
climb 500 feet to where I think I buried the treasure chest. The
place is full of bilge rats from that British Man-O-War and yar
gonna do a little bush whackin' 'til you get to the top. Just step
over the skeletons and keep on goin' It ain't bad!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You be lookin' for a 4 X 6 X 3 camo-taped Rubbermaid box. Trade

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Captain Kid's (Konnarock, that is) Pine Island
Haunted Treasure Chest (camoed ammo box). It is full of plundered
booty that you land lubbers will take a liken to. If you take
something please put something back with equal of better value. If
you don't matey, we'll be watching your boat and will fire a shot
across your bow. The old Captain ain't that good of a shot no more,
so don't take the chance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they say, &quot;it's the sailin' trip that counts not the
arrival&quot;. Someone must have said it or the old Captain wouldn't
have repeated it! Or maybe he made it up. No matter, getting to the
island is up to you. Drop anchor on the South end and climb. There
are spooky things in the woods so we double dare you to try to find
it at night. It's a good one during the day but it's double the fun
at night!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Me Pet Bird&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you land lubbin', Wal Mart lamp posts huggers let go and
start on an adventure. If you find a skeleton or two in the woods,
just step over them and keep on goin'. There may be puddles of
blood so don't drink or step in 'em! The wharf rats that you'll see
make good pets so take a few home with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matey, have a good caching day or night. Your choice!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Captain Kid's The
Margarita&lt;/b&gt;

the South Holston Seas. Them Spanyerds thought that they could out
sail us and run our blockade but to Davy Jones Locker they went! Oh
it was a beautiful, galleon but she now sleeps with the fishes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;b&gt;Another Of Me Pets&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I buried the captured treasure (I think!) on the
Island of Ghost Timbers. This Island will indeed shiver your
timbers 'cause so many of them burnt up! A fire swept thru here and
turned the whole island into an living inferno. No one survived and
thar's nothin' here but pirate ghosts and the ghosts of the timbers
that long to be sailing masts. Oh yes, thars a buried treasure too!
By the way you bilge rats, it really ain't an island. Maybe it were
at one time or another but now it is a point out into the Sea. Drop
anchor at the Southeast side of the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treasure chest is a camo-taped Rubbermaid box. It is 9 X 6 X
4. Trade up or trade even or don't trade. Me hearties, put
everything back jus' as ye found it! See me ship (and it's guns)
below and thats what will get ya if don't!&lt;/p&gt;

sank a British merchant ship and after making the survivors walk
the plank we buried the booty on The Whale's Backbone Island. Now
listen hear you land lubbers, there ain't no whales backbone on the
island but just after you drop anchor there is an old tree just
laying there that looks like one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old Captain wouldn't horns waggle ye, it's thar and just
ready for the takin'. From whar you drop anchor, it's 'bout 510
feet up to the treasure. You should be a droppin' the anchor on the
east end of the island. Otherwise you'll run aground and become
another ghost ship. The treasure chest is a camo-painted ammo box.
There is a little bush whackin' at the start and a bit of a climb
but it ain't too bad. Arrrgh, and old woman or the little 'ens can
do it after you help them up the bank. Watch out for the big, nasty
old wharf rats!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;b&gt;Me Pet Cat&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treasure chest is full so trade up or even or we'll be a
watchin' and soon you'll be a visitin' Davy Jones locker. Put the
treasure chest back whar you'd found it or you'll be doing the
dance the hempen jig.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;There was a pirate named Capt. Jack. He and I used to sail the
high seas together 'til he tried to horn waggle me out of the booty
from a Spanyerd's ship. I made short order of that bilge rat with
me old cutlass but I should have kept him alive 'til I learnt of
his secret burying ground. Yep, he had a shack that long ago fell
to the elements and close to it be all who fell prey to his knife.
'Tis said that the ghosts of his victims still walk the grounds of
his shack and close by lies the treasure. Look for the beautifal
wench ghost. She used to be Capt. Jack's mate but she crossed him
and now she dead.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Curley, Me Pet&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ain't fer from the anchor point to the shack and where the
treasure may be but it will take a small amount of bush whackin'
and climbing a slick steep hill side. A good ol' hiking stick will
help. You can go in from the back side but your sure to die. Drop
anchor wher I tell ya and find the secret passage (the only) up the
bank to the hill. It's a might too dangerous to go in any other
way. Watch yer step coming back cause if ye take the wrong way, ya
could drop over a steep bank and smash up on the rocks! By the way,
look fer some of me pets (see above picture) amongst the rocks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ye will be lookin' fer a packed full, camo-painted ammo can.
Trade up or even or don't trade. 'member, we'll be watchin'. The
Margarita's guns will blast you off the rock. All cachers should
report what they took and what they left and above all LOG TBs if
they be in the cache! Re bury (hide) the treasure chest jest as ye
found it. Once you found the skeleton, (tin roof and rocks), of
Capt. Jack's shack, you're almost to the treasure site and it is
straight up from thar.&lt;/p&gt;

runners road to the sea. We call it the Road to Davy Jone's Locker

don't ketch ya maybe the Revenurers will and ya'll end up doin'
dance the hempen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll be goin' up the road for .14 mile to find the treasure.
It's a might grown up, so be prepared. Thars all kinds of haints

&lt;b&gt;Me Old Uncle Jack&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Durin' the old Captain's (Konnarock that is) many voyages
on the South Seas I often visited New Zealand. We plundered many of
the local native tribes and many a time we fled for our lives. We
captured a young Maori prince and took him aboard the Margarita.
Yep, he didn't like it at first but he learned to fear the
cat-o-nine-tails. Soon, he became one of me most trusted mates and
still sails with the Captain. Yes, I've offered to set him on shore
but he wants to continue a pirating.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Tawhiri, or did I mention his name, keeps telling us stories of
all of the Maori gods. One of the most important Maori gods is Tane
Mahuta and this is his story:&lt;/p&gt;
Rangi was the Sky Father and his wife was Mother Earth,
Papa. Rangi and Papa could never be separated and their children
could not escape their grasp.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The trapped gods tried in vain several times to separate their
parents until it was the turn of the God Of The Forest, Tane
(TAH-nay) Mahuta. Pushing away his father with his head and his
mother with his feet. Tane finally succeeded. He then set free the
Sun and Moon and decorated the heavens with stars. Tane was also
the one who created the first woman called Hine, whom he
married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their children were the first Polynesian people. One of Tane's
brothers who is the god of winds did not want his parents separated
and expressed his wrath by hurling storms and hurricanes against
Tane's forests&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our sailin' on the South Holston we discovered a monument
to Tane on an island that we named after the god. Here we buried a
fabulous treasure (ammo box). You land lubbers be ye very careful
here because the place is full of the souls of poor mortals who
have found themselves caught in between the battles of Tane and his
brother Tawhiri. None survived and ye might not either!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rebury&quot; the treasure as ye found it and log whatever ye took
and ye left! Don't forget the Margarita is about and will do ye
in!&lt;/p&gt;

were: William H. Blevins (Union) and Joseph C. Jones (CSA). These
two men were 18 and 20 years old when the war began. They were
neighbors, but found themselves on opposite sides of the conflict.
Did they grow up together? How well did these these two men know
each other? Did they meet during the war? Did they talk of the war
after it was over? We don't know the answers to these questions,
but we do know that, they together, rest in peace. 
&lt;p&gt;You must find the resting-places to determine the coordinates
for the cache. Try to find them without the hints (its easy).&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;First of all, we want to thank Great-Scott! from Virginia Beach
for his kind permission to copy his idea of a cache. Don't applaud
him too much for he copied the idea from kingsting's cache in
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;b&gt;O. T. I. C&lt;/b&gt; (opposite of C. I. T. O.) cache.
&lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;bviously &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;rashy &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;cky &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;aches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main question presented is: will cachers go after a cache
that is truly lame in all respects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is dedicated to those, &lt;b&gt;(not all),&lt;/b&gt; micros that
have been tossed out of a car window and stuck! We mean those
caches that were placed in trashy locations with nothing to see but
yuck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need to cross the fence or to go near the railroad
tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the &quot;highlights&quot; of our cache:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Crappy location...naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Good coordinates...not a chance, we didn't even stop the
truck. Besides, the old GPSr's batteries were failing, a
thunderstorm was happening and Marge wouldn't keep the antenna
glued to her head. Trees and a power line will drive your GPS nuts.
We will change the coordinates periodically just for the heck of
it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Scenic view....are you kidding, only if you like trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Log....too small and will probably get wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Camo job....very well done if you like cheap colored
tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. No pen....could have put one here but we don't like to spend
money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Nice container....not really although we did spend 3 cents
for it. It will probably fall apart before the next winter is over.
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Tradeables....let the little brats cry, no goodies here for
them. As a matter of fact, if you brings kids here they will
probably catch something and we don't mean the rats that live
here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Spoiler Hint &lt;b&gt;(STOP HERE!!!, read no further if you want to
do it the hard way)&lt;/b&gt;....don't you just hate these kind of hints?
Remember it is a dumb 35mm film cannister and it is behind the
little tree that is in front of and to the right of the concrete
foundations. Under three little rocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. Chances of getting arrested....on a scale of 1 to 10, about
12!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11. First-to-find prize....first choice of any of the garbage
that's lying near the cache..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12. Rating.....yes, it is very over rated. We almost gave it a
5/5 but that would be bragging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13. Attributes....they don't have any that pertains to
bio-hazards! If we post any, they are probably lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14. Health concerns.....too numerous to mention!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15. Parking....plenty room, if you are using a skateboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is not an original idea. There are many other
caches like this out there. They are just not described in the same
way! What are you going to get out of finding this cache? You will
get another smiley and the chance to trash the cache in front of
every other cacher and the chance of catching some scientifically
unidentifiable disease!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take out all of your frustrations with LAME micros on this
cache. It is the whipping post surrogate for all of them! As a
matter of fact, &lt;b&gt;if anything nice is said in the log about the
cache or the cache owner, it will be deleted after we give you a
chance to take the &quot;niceness&quot; out of your log. We don't want to see
anything like, &quot;nice cache&quot; or &quot;good hide&quot;!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's there! It's mocking you and daring you to find it. It
will keep coming up in your searches. If it had a tongue, it would
be sticking it out at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to post spoiler photos of the cache container or the
hiding location and please put everything back as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your shots up-to-date and have a nice caching day!
Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

      THE WACs OF WWII AND TO ALL OF THE DOUGHBOYS OF WWI. It is also dedicated to our son Robert who is currently deployed to Afghanistan. 
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;Over 150,000 American women served in the Women's Army Corps
(WAC) during World War II. Members of the WAC were the first women
other than nurses to serve within the ranks of the United States
Army. Sixteen women received the Purple Heart, awarded to soldiers
injured due to enemy action. A total of 657 WACs received medals
and citations at the end of the war. By an act of Congress, the
Women's Army Corps ended in 1978 and the Corp was brought into all
but the combat branches of the Army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

WACs Reporting For Duty 
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;There were 4,355,000 American men who were soldiers in World War
I. Of this number, 116,708 were killed. These soldiers were
affectionately known as &quot;Doughboys&quot;. In World War II they were
known as GIs. Everyone agrees that the soldier's nickname was
Doughboy but there are a lot of differing opinions as to where the
name came from. There are four theories as to the origin of
&quot;Doughboy&quot;. The &quot;baked goods&quot;, the &quot;button&quot;, the &quot;Pipe Clay&quot; and
the &quot;Adobe&quot; are all theories of the name. Due to space limitations
(or being lazy) I will not explain each theory but if you know or
find the answers and email them to me, you may claim an extra find
for this cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
 
The Doughboys 
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. At the flagpole take a bearing of NW 320 degrees and walk 60
feet to Ethel Wampler's (our honored WAC) grave. Write down her
birth year______.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Go back to the flagpole and take a bearing of SE 132 degrees
and walk 45 feet to Olinthus L. Grubb's (our honored Doughboy)
grave. Write down his birth year______.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final cache coordinates are: N 36. 35. 51____* W 082. 06.
5___**___**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* last number (digit) of Olinthus Grubb's birth year. ** last
two numbers (digits) of Ethel Wampler's birth year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a cammoed ammo box. Please trade even or up
and please put the cache back where you found it. Stealth is needed
because there are a lot of nearby eyes. Good

This cache isn't supposed to be difficult or challenging. I discovered this area while searching for rocks for my fish tank.  

About fifteen feet to your right (facing the hill) there is an spring which flows out of the side of the hill and then goes back underground to Big Moccasin Creek.  

One of the Locals has pointed this out to my attention: 
That spring you found? Hope that you did not drink any of that water. That's not a spring, It's a poop-ditch where the old Rail Road bed crossed over. You can see the other side. It is made from hand-cut stones, they must not have had any pipe back when they laid that track to Mendora and Bristol. It is mostly full of mud and the water runs under it.


Cache is starting out with the following items:

1 Log Book
1 McD Stuffed Toy 
1 McD Mushu (from Mulan) figure
4 REAL Sea Shells 
1 Rapella Spinner Lure
2 Copy Cat TB's
1 Cache Critter: Baa the Sheep

A rain garden is a planted depression that allows rainwater runoff from impervious urban areas like roofs, driveways, walkways, and compacted lawn areas the opportunity to be asorbed. This reduces rain runoff by allowing stormwater to soak into ground ( as opposed to flowing into storm drains and surface waters which causes erosion, water pollution, flooding, and diminished groundwater). Rain gardens can cut down on the amount of pollution reaching creeks and streams by up to 30%.
 Native plants are recommended for rain gardens because they generally don't require fertilizer and are more tolerant of one's local cilmate, soil, and water conditions. The plants, a selection of wetland edge vegetation, such as wildflowers, sedeges, rushes, ferns, shrubs and small trees take up excess water flowing into the rain garden. Water filters through soil layers before entering the groundwater system. Root systems enhance infiltration, moisture redistribution, and diverse microbial populations involved in biofiltration. Also, through the process of transpiration, rain garden plants return water vapor to the atmosphere.

All of the plants in the Rain Garden have markers with their names on them. Enter in the code phrase (all lower case) the name of which plant is not native to the United States.   </groundspeak:long_description>

It was easy to find, but unfortunately not very pretty.  I'll go back in the spring because I'm sure it looks a lot better.

As required, I'm posting a picture and email in the CO the answer to his question.

(Hopefully my name will be entered in a drawing for a pair of cross-country SKI's)

They also leave alot of AL cans here, likely why Beer Rabbit walked this road looking for AL cans to recycle. He was a strange critter, carryed a big ole' walking stick that he called a &quot;Beagle Club&quot; for knocking the Tar outta Beagles that had the misfortune of stumbling upon him. He moved away from this area a few years ago to the Bristol area near the Racetrack. AL cans are ripe for the pickings there, and if you strain them and pour the contents into a barrel you can almost fill it. Last time I saw him was back in June up on Boozy Creek at the Peace Makers MC Dirt drags. He looked alot older and his hair was grey, but he seemes to have the same walking stick that he called is &quot;Beagle Club&quot; many years ago. He got the Law called on himself so much they even named the road in his honor. They can't name roads after the living, so they just named it Beagle Club Road.

Carter's Fort, also known as Crissman's Fort, Rye Cove Fort, and Fort Lee, was built in 1774 by Isaac Crissman and ten years later was built as a permanent settelement by brothers Thomas, Joseph, and Norris Carter. After being built as part of the original Fort, this house was sometime moved to the Carter Town area of Rye Cove. In October of 1997, the cabin was moved and reconstructed to its currant location in Natural Tunnel State Park.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">During the 1700's the Virginia frontier was still &quot;Indian Country&quot; and life was perilous for the few Whites that settled here. To protect themselves during Indian attacks, frontiersmen often built specially designed fortications known as Blockhouses.

The Blockhouse here at Natural Tunnel State Park is a recreation of the one built by John Anderson near the Moccasin Gap. It was a starting point on the road through the wilderness of Kentucky, and the station where travelers used to wait until parties collected large enough to defend themselves against Indians on the journey.
http://www.danielboonetrail.com/photos.php?id=18

While all Blockhouses were not identical, most were designed with features that made them easier to defend than a standard cabin. Bullets often penetrated the chinked spaces between logs in a cabin, so the logs of a Blockhouse were squared up tightly and fit together without chinking.
Windows were replaced with small rectangular openings called firing ports, which enabled those inside to shoot out at attackers from any direction.

The second story of a Blockhouse usually extended beyond the first floor walls and had firing ports cut into the second story floor. This allowed those upstairs to fire down on anyone that managed to get close to the walls below.

The fireplace and chimney of a Blockhouse were built on the inside. This prevented the attackers from tearing the chimney down and enrering the building through the fireplace.

To log this listing as a find, enter in the code phrase the number of firing ports in the Blockhouse and the number of wrought iron hangers on the East wall. Wrought iron hangers were used to hang meat or other items out of reach of varmits as a means of storage.
Code phrase according to OC must match exact for the log to be entered, use numerals in the blanks and type in the words as follows.

___ Firing ports and ___ hangers.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Kilgore Fort House is the only fort still standing of the twelve structures that once extended from Castlewood to Cumberland Gap along the Wilderness Road. The buildings protected early settlers from roaming bands of Indians during the late 1700s, at which time may similarly fortified houses could be found dotting the frontier.

Around 1790, Reverend Robert &quot;Robin&quot; Kilgore built this fort on the shaded bank of Copper Creek to shield his wife and family from Indian attacks. He constructed the building from white oak log timbers, notched and joined at the ends, then chinked between with mud. Doors were made of heavy timbers that could be secured from the inside with a heavy bar. Although later inhabitants cut out windows, the original fort had only small gun ports in the walls.

The Kilgore Fort House was built with defense in mind, but was also a family's home. A stone fireplace and chimney were used for cooking and heating, and the building was divided up into two stories with two rooms on each floor. If occupants were attacked, they first retreated to the back room on the first floor, then could further retreat upstairs to make their final defensive stand in the northeast room.

The Kilgore Fort House was restored in 1973 to 1974 and is privately owned. Visitors are welcome to view the historic landmark from the road, two miles west of Nickelsville, on highway 71.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The cache name comes from the book and movie A Bridge Too Far.
Written by Cornelius Ryan, the World War II epic was a historic
telling of the failed attempt to capture several bridges to Germany
in WWII. The failed campaign was called Operation Market Garden.
Both the book and the movie were highly acclaimed by critics and
the viewing audiences for it's realism and grand scale. Marge and I
placed this cache after finding the Riverview Cemetery cache
(GCY7NC) which is a short drive down the road. Maybe this will help
draw more cachers to the area. After doing these two caches, you
have got to climb to the On Top Of Men-do-ta....(GC9718) cache.
It's grand!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a small magnetic key-holder. Please bring your own
pen. It shouldn't be hard to find but you may have to look a little
bit. If you want to make it easy see the hint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your camera and have a good caching day.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In 1831, James Culbertson built a grist mill on Amos Branch outside Nickelsville. The mill was a simple log structure, but it quickly became the bustling center of the community, providing residents with corn meal and flour for their tables, feed for their livestock, and a lively place to exchange information and gossip. Farmers traveled for miles on horseback with their sacks of grain, or in horse-drawn wagons with loads of Indian corn and wheat. The mill created a community and also relieved the farmers of the arduous task of grinding grain on hand “gritters”.

Later, the land and mill passed into the hands of Valentine Bush and his wife, Nancy Gose Bush, who moved to the area from Russell County. The Bush family added a water-powered sawmill upstream and a water-powered wool carding machine downstream. They also continued to operate the grist mill until April 1, 1895, wen a fire broke out in the structure. By the time help arrived, the mill was too far gone to save.But the community could not function without a mill. Over the next two years, Valentine Bush, now 88 years old, and his sons constructed the historic Bush Mill that now stands outside Nickelsville. The mill continued to operate until well into the 1950's.

This cache is the beautiful Garrett Creek Waterfalls. The falls are
about 40 foot high and 40 foot wide. Park at the wide spot in the
road on the left hand side at the given coordinates. Coordinates
are not super accurate due to being in a narrow valley. Best
accuracy obtained was 29 feet. Nothing real dangerous here but
don't pull you car too far off the road and when going to the top
of the falls (to find the cache), don't fall over the edge. After
finding the cache, you may want to walk down the road a bit to get
a better view of the falls. Many thanks to the owner of this
property for granting permission. Out of respect and thanks to Mr.
Mullins, please use CITO. Not reccomended for very small children.
Enjoy Nature's beauty and have a good caching day. Bring your
camera. Please put cache container back exactly as you found
it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;NOTE: On June 20, 2006 we replaced the muggled cache.
New container is a bit smaller and is a 6 inch diameter round
rubbermaid box. Room for small trade items. Kept same coordinates

John Blackmore settled on land at the mouth of Stoney Creek on the Clinch River in 1773. He purchased 518 acres from the Loyal Land Company, and his acreage was surveyed on March 25, 1774 by Captain Daniel Smith, deputy surveyor for Fincastle County. At about the same time, surveys were entered for Isaac Crisman, John Thomas, Dale Carter, and John Blackmore, Jr.  

At this time, Daniel Boone and his family had been living on land owned by David Gass, near Castle’s Woods, some dozen or more miles east; ever since Boone’s son James was killed by Indians as a party of settlers made its attempt to go to Kentucky in October, 1773. Young Boone, on that occasion, was traveling separate from the main party, in company with Henry Russell and others. Russell, son of Captain William Russell, &quot;a Gentleman of Some distinction.&quot; according to Royal Governor Lord Dunmore, was the organizer of that attempt, and Boone was the logician. After the murder, the immigration effort was aborted and some of the settlers returned to the Yadkin, and a few stayed on in the Clinch and Holston settlements.


In the aftermath of the murder of the boys, one of the survivors, one Isaac Crabtree killed an innocent Cherokee at a horse race near what is now Jonesborough, Tennessee. This event, and another brutal slaying by white frontiersmen of the nine members of the Mingo tribe on the Ohio in April of 1774 had stirred the tribes along the frontier into a war-like mood. Those few men taking up land on the Clinch were brave souls for many &quot;families on the river had moved back to safety&quot; according to surveyor Smith.


Much of the detail that is known of Fort Blackmore comes from the correspondence of officers of the militia during the following months, in what became known as &quot;Lord Dunmore’s War.&quot; The commanding officer of the Fincastle County Militia was Colonel William Preston, who resided near what is now Blacksburg, Virginia, on the New River. Officers reporting to him included Captain Russell on the Clinch; Major Arthur Campbell, Fort Shelby - at what is now Bristol; and Captain Daniel Smith, mentioned above. In a letter dated May 24, 1774, Colonel Andrew Lewis, of Augusta County, advised Preston that &quot;Hostilities are actually commenced on the Ohio below Pittsburg.&quot; In a War Council in June at the Lead Mines, near Fort Chiswell on the New River, it was decided to send militia under Colonel William Christian, Augusta County, to aid William Russell; and &quot;at Preston’s instigation, William Russell sent Daniel Boone and Michael Stoner to tell John Floyd and other surveyors to come in from Kentucky. These two left for Kentucky on June 27, 1774.&quot; This mission would first bring the previously obscure Boone’s name to widespread public attention.


It was a tense time among the scattered settlers along the Clinch River. On July 12, Colonel Christian wrote Preston that &quot;four forts [are] erecting in Capt. Russell’s Company; one at Moore’s, four miles below this, another at Blackmore’s 16 Miles above this Place [Castle’s Wood] I am about to station 10 Men at Blackmore’s.&quot; On the 13th, Captain Russell notified Preston &quot;there are four families at John Blackmore’s near the mouth of Stoney Creek, that will never be able to stand it, without a Commd. Of Men, therefore request you, if you think it can be done, to Order them a supply sufficient to enable them to continue the small fortification they have erected.&quot; Thus the fort took the name of the man on whose land it was built. Captain James Thompson was the first officer put in command of the little fort. 


Men in the community were quite eager to join Lord Dunmore’s expedition to stop the Indians on the Ohio before they could come into the frontier settlements. Col. Preston had stated, &quot;the plunder of the Country will be valluable. . . . it is said the Shawnese have a great Stock of Horses.&quot; Those in command along the Clinch and Holston had difficulty manning the local forts with many eligible men wishing to go. On August 27, Daniel Boone returned from his mission to Kentucky; and almost immediately begged of Major Campbell to be sent on to Point Pleasant on the Ohio. Lord Dunmore had agreed to meet the forces from back country counties there with men he brought along from Tidewater. Boone set out, but was called back by Captain Russell to help defend the little Clinch River community as officer in command at Moore’s Fort. On September 21, Captain Thompson went out with those Ohio-bound forces, and Captain David Looney was put in command at Blackmore’s Fort. 


On September 23 or 24, it was reported that &quot;2 negroes were taken prisoner at Blackmore’s Fort, on waters of Clinch River, and a great many horses and cattle were shot down.&quot; Captain Looney was absent, visiting his family on the Holston. Major Campbell wrote Col. Preston on the 29th that &quot;Mr Boon is very diligent at Castle Woods and keeps up good Order. I have reason to believe they have lately been remiss at Blackmores, and the Spys there did not do their duty.&quot; Two days later he wrote &quot;Mr. Boone also informs me that the Indians has been frequently about Blackmores, since the Negroes was taken; And Capt. Looney has so few Men that he cannot venture to go in pursuit of them, having only eleven men.&quot;


On the sixth of October Campbell wrote to say that Indians had attacked at Shelby’s Fort without success; and the day after that, he said, was the attack at Fort Blackmore. An alarm of their presence was given by Dale Carter, crying &quot;Murder, Murder!&quot; Ensign John Anderson and John Carter ran out of the fort to help, but Dale Carter was killed and scalped; and the slaves were taken. After this, the people of the area were feeling that they needed a commander who lived on the Clinch. October 13, Captain Smith wrote Col. Preston that he had been shown a paper signed by inhabitants requesting the appointment of Daniel Boone to be Captain and take charge of the Clinch forts. Smith endorsed this request and stated &quot;I do not know of any Objection that could be made to his character which would make you think him an improper person for that office.&quot; Preston immediately promoted him. Boone treasured his commission and carried it with him always until he was promoted again during the Revolution.

Meanwhile, information was beginning to be received in these frontier parts that a battle had been fought at Point Pleasant on the Ohio between the forces of Colonel Andrews and the Indian tribes on October 10. Those forces met up with the Indians before they could join up with Lord Dunmore’s men, and fought a very successful engagement. Shortly thereafter, Dunmore negotiated a peace agreement ending the hostilities at Camp Charlotte. Some portion of the Shawnee nation agreed to give up it hunting rights in Kentucky if settlers would remain below the Ohio River. Local militias were disbanded, and November 21, Daniel Boone was dismissed from his duties.


The Cherokee now were the only force with which to be reckoned for the settlement of Kentucky. Again, Daniel Boone would support a prominent man in a Kentucky settlement venture. Judge Richard Henderson of North Carolina, in late 1774, negotiated with Cherokee chiefs to purchase a large plot on land in Kentucky, irregardless that he could not do so legally; and that the Cherokee had no real claim to the land they sold to him either. He engaged Boone to go among the Cherokee during late 1774 to encourage them to meet at Sycamore Shoals on the Watauga in March, 1775, for the formal agreement and transfer of the goods that would pay for the purchase. Boone returned to the Clinch in early February and gathered some twenty men there to help him blaze the path through Cumberland Gap to the land Henderson wanted. Not all are known, they included Michael Stoner, David Gass, William Bush, and William Hays. It is not unlikely that this group included some of the men from the Fort Blackmore area. Squire Boone brought others from North Carolina and the combined band of trail blazers set out from John Anderson’s Blockhouse, on the North Fork of Holston, on March 10.


Boone left the new Kentucky settlement, named Boonesborough in his honor, on June 13, 1775, enroute once more for the Clinch. &quot;Boone set off for his family.&quot; Henderson wrote in his journal. When Daniel arrived there, he found Rebecca about to give birth. In late July, she gave birth to a son, William, who did not survive. In mid August, Boone and family, and a party of some 50 immigrants set off for Kentucky. Probably some of them were men from the Fort Blackmore area; and the party would certainly have passed the fort, perhaps stopping overnight, in their westward journey. This ends Boone’s association with Fort Blackmore. But the fort continued as a place of refuge for many more years. 


1775 was a relatively peaceful year east of Cumberland Gap, but hostilities with the Cherokee came again in 1776. Warriors who did not agree with the chiefs who treated with Richard Henderson, led by one Dragging Canoe, began attacks along the frontier. And there were many Indian attacks in Kentucky that caused large numbers of immigrants to flee back over the Cumberlands to the Clinch, Holston, and Watauga settlements. One such Kentuckian, William Hickman, arrived at Fort Blackmore on the Clinch, where he found other refugees &quot;sporting, dancing, and drinking whiskey in an attempt to forget their fears.&quot; &quot;Things could get pretty rancid.&quot; he said, &quot;after a long period of confinement in a row or two of smoky cabins, among dirty women and men with greased hunting shirts.&quot; In June, two men were killed at the fort. And in September one Jennings and his slave met death at the hands of Indians. Other forts had been erected along the Powell River, west towards Cumberland Gap, during 1775, including Priests, Mumps, and Martin’s. Col. Joseph Martin’s station was erected in January of that year, and he noted in his journal the stopover of the Henderson party of Kentucky settlers about the first of April. Col. Martin left in May to visit at his home in Virginia. Soon the people from Mump’s and Priest’s were driven out. When there were no more than ten left alive at Martin’s, those men fled to Fort Blackmore, where they found most of the people from the Mump’s and Priest’s forts.


In July, 1776, Cherokees in force attacked at the fort at Sycamore Shoals on the Watuaga, and battled local militia at the Battle of Long Island Flats, near present Kingsport, Tennessee. About the same time, one Ambrose Fletcher, living near Fort Blackmore, had his wife and children killed and scalped. Colonel William Christian was again called upon by Col. Preston, this time to put down the Cherokee uprising. Jonathan Jennings of Fort Blackmore, and father of the Jennings who was killed, mentioned above, accompanied that expedition to the Cherokee towns on the Middle Tennessee River.


After that, mention of Fort Blackmore in the known historical record becomes scanty. There is one famous story, dating from 1777, that may or may not be true. Men in the fort heard a turkey gobbling. They wanted to go out hunting, but were prevented by a knowledgeable backwoodsman, one Matthew Gray. He convinced them that they were hearing Indians. He directed the men to create a distraction on the bank of the river, while he snuck across the Clinch. He was able to get where he could see the Indian warrior perched in a tree, making the turkey noises. Mr. Gray dispatched the &quot;turkey&quot; and fled back into the fort with the others.


In 1779, John Blackmore and his family left the area to travel with the Donelson party, traveling by flatboat, to settle in middle Tennessee. Donelson mentions meeting up with the Blackmore group at the mouth of Clinch where it joins the Holston, so John Blackmore’s band must have gone down the Clinch by flatboat. Perhaps not all Blackmores left the Clinch - or possibly some came back - for they are mentioned again in April, 1790 in the journal of Methodist Bishop John Asbury. &quot;We rode down to Blackmore’s Station, here the people have been forted on the north side of Clinch. Poor Blackmore had had a son and daughter killed by the Indians. The are of the opinion here that the Chrokees were the authors of this mischief.&quot; Asbury goes on to say he had heard of two families being killed and of one woman being taken prisoner, but retaken by neighbors A few days later, the Bishop traveled on, noting that he &quot;Crossed the Clinch about two miles below the fort. In passing along I saw the precipice from which Blackmore’s unhappy son leaped into the river after receiving the stroke of the tomahawk in his head . . . this happened on the 6th of April 1789.&quot;


Indian attacks on settlers along the Clinch, Holston, and Watuaga Rivers did not cease until after 1794, when a half breed, Benge, who had led many of the forays, was killed near what is now Big Stone Gap. Benge committed his last crimes near what is now Mendota, Virginia, on the North Fork of the Holston. He fled, with two captive women, over the Clinch Mountain, Copper Ridge, and, finally, High Knob Mountain before being caught up with. This route probably took him very near Fort Blackmore. And so, it was right in the middle of Indian unrest from its beginning to its end. Just exactly when it was abandoned as a fort is not known. The land owner believes he is able to point out where the fort stood; but, for the most part, it has disappeared from sight. Its little cemetery is still findable, below the current highway bridge over the river, and to its right, near the bank of the river. Scott Countians who care for old cemeteries keep it cleaned and accessible. Many of it graves are unmarked.

The cemetery is not far from geocache listing GCH9T8. Through the efforts of a local historian a stone was erected for David C. Cocke (Cox) and one for his wife Jeminia Leach Cox in the old pioneer cemetery. David's stone reads that he was a Private in Daniel Boone's Milita during the Indian Wars of 1756. There now also stand 6 white marble markers placed by the Son's of Confederate Veterans in memory of some CSA soilders from Kentucky that were killed in Scott County, Virginia during the War of Northern Agression, also know as the American Civil War.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The Cabin Creek Waterfall is about 70 foot plus high. Now, there
is only a small amount of water falling but it is still worth
seeing because of the rock formations. Early this past spring when
we found the falls, the water was really flowing. The creek finally
empties into the North Fork of the Holston River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is too dangerous and also posted so do not attempt to go off
the road (to the left) to get closer to the falls. You can view and
photograph the falls very well from the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you will see, the road is narrow and goes down through a
valley which made it very difficllt to get good/accurate GPS
readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;If you are able to get a good reading at the cache site, please
post the coordinates.&lt;/b&gt; You may need to use the hints. Marge and
I want cachers to find our caches without too much difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The cache container is a small camo-taped box which is 1 by 2 by
6 inches. Room for small tradeables only i.e. pins, etc. Please put
the cache back the way you found it. Thanks and have a good caching
day.&lt;/p&gt;

This is another beautiful but &quot;unknown&quot; waterfall of Southwest
Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falls Hill Creek tumbles down the mountain to shortly join the
North Fork of the Holston River. Along the way, it forms two falls
(35 feet and 20 feet high respectively). Here you get two falls for
the price of one plus a narrow ravine which forms a pretty rock
flume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk back up the road for about 120 feet to get the best view of
the larger falls. There is no need to leave the road to view the
falls or to find the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

features some of Southwest Virginia's most beautiful waterfalls.
Take your camera and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fall Creek begins way up in the mountains and empties into
the Clinch River at Dungannon, Virginia. Before the Creek becomes
part of the Clinch it displays a beautiful waterfall. You may not
be able to get close to the falls because there is a very sharp
drop (maybe 150 feet) into the Creek valley. If you are real
careful, you can make your way down to the Falls. You must find the
cache and view the Falls from the road. Even though you will not be
close and there are a lot of trees, the view is still very
nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a short walk from the parking area. You are looking
for a magnetic key-holder. Please replace the cache exactly as you
found it. Thanks and have a good caching day.&lt;/p&gt;

Big Stone Gap is known as the &quot;Gateway to the Coalfields.&quot;   Coal and iron ore brought the early investors into the area and is still a main industry today.  The statue recognizes these hardy individuals.  Miner's Park is owned and maintained by the Big Stone Gap Parks &amp; Recreation Department.  The park was originally the site of Kelly Drug store and the elegant Monte Vista Hotel.   Portions of their mosaic tiled entrances can still be seen at this park.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our continuing Fallin' For Virginia cache series. The
series features some of the most beautiful water falls of Southwest
Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is placed very near the Upper Falls of the Little
Stony Creek. The trail follows the Little Stony Creek for 2.8 miles
through a 400 feet deep and 1700 feet wide gorge. You are not going
nearly that far but it is worth taking the hike the whole distance.
Many rapids, stone formations and small waterfalls can be seen
along the trail. There are three other caches along the trail
within a .5 mile hike from the parking area. They are: The
Troll...(GCMDGK), Fallin'...VIII (GCWW5M) and
Granny's...(GC57DF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special thank you goes to &lt;b&gt;mtmanva2&lt;/b&gt; for his help in
placing this cache. He is what caching is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a small Rubbermaid container that is
camo-taped. You may need to use the hints because GPS reception was
most difficult. &lt;b&gt;Please post your coordinates if your GPSr is
receiving with good accuracy.&lt;/b&gt; Take your camera, bathing suit
and picnic supplies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Please place the cache and everything else back as you found
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't forget &lt;b&gt;CITO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Have a good caching day.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKWW5C - Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 36° 52.167 W 082° 27.827&lt;br/&gt;Parking area for Upper falls</groundspeak:long_description>

2.Go about 45 feet ahead to the triangle (from top) rock in the middle of the trail.
3.Another 25 feet to the little rock cave with the log pointing the way.

I don't understand why someone would take the head and the rattles and leave the good eating part. After looking at the clue, we had to be close. At least the GPS was half-way working, but too much signal bounce. I lost signal at the 2nd bridge all the way to the 4th bridge, without good clues this place is very tough to cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the latest edition of our Fallin' For Virginia cache
series. We are attempting to bring you to the most beautiful
waterfalls of Southwest Virginia. This waterfall is just below the
Upper Water Falls of the Little Stony Creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the parking area you will pass the Upper Falls and it's
cache (GCWW5M) Continuing down the trail will bring you to the
Troll cache (GCMDGK) and then to this falls and cache. If you go an
another short distance you can find &quot;Granny's&quot; cache (GC57DF). The
entire trail is 2.8 miles in length through a 400 foot deep and
1700 foot wide gorge. Of course, you are not going that far but you
might want to. The trail is fairly gentle and there are many
wonders of nature to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPS reception was very difficult so you may need to use the
hints. &lt;b&gt;If you don't mind, post your coordinates at the cache if
your GPS is recieving with good accuracy.&lt;/b&gt; You are looking for a
camo-taped Rubbermaid container. Please put the cache and
everything else back the way you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By all means, take your camera. Take good walking shoes and your
bathing suit (warm weather only, ha!). Great place for a picnic.
Please practice CITO. The place is very clean but there are those
who respect nothing. When placing the cache, we saw some trash but
didn't have a bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to give a special thanks to &lt;b&gt;mtmanva2&lt;/b&gt; for acting as
the guide for the trip and help in placing the cache. He is what
caching is all about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKWW5M - Perking

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The small town of Appalachia, Virginia is surrounded by numerous coal camp communities. They include Andover, Arno, Derby, Roda, Imboden, Exeter, Dunbar, Pardee, Osaka, and Stonega. Many of these communities formed at the beginning of the century with the arrival of the mining and railroad industry. 

Each year, usually in the first week of August, the residents of Appalachia and the surrounding area celebrate their heritage in a week long celebration known as Coal/Railroad Days. The festival includes a 5K road race, music concerts at the town's amphitheater, amusement rides, street vendors, a parade, and numerous other festival type events. Twice, Coal/Railroad days has coincided with other celebrations in Appalachia. In 2000 the town took part in a mass high school reunion, known as Appy 2000. In 2006, the festival was part of the Appalachia 100 celebration that marked the 100th birthday of the Town of Appalachia.

The town of Appalachia holds two world records. Bee Rock Tunnel, the world's second-shortest railroad tunnel, and the Peake Building. An apartment house with street-level access on all four floors. It is listed as a virtual geocache &quot;Happy at Appy&quot; - GCB9B8 http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=c131ed45-d6fa-4328-bdac-2b1d690610ef

Here along Main street is a veterans memorial wall that honors veterans that have lived in Wise County. One is Sgt. Edward R. Talley. He was a United States Army Soldier who received the Medal of Honor for his actions near Ponchaux, France during World War I. He was a Sergeant in Company L, 117th Infantry, 30th Division when he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions on October 7, 1918.

Undeterred by seeing several comrades killed in attempting to put a hostile machine gun nest out of action, Sgt. Talley attacked the position single-handed. Armed only with a rifle, he rushed the nest in the face of intense enemy fire, killed or wounded at least 6 of the crew, and silenced the gun. When the enemy attempted to bring forward another gun and ammunition he drove them back by effective fire from his rifle.

To log this listing as a find, enter in the code phrase (all caps) the middle name of the persons name on the memorial brick to the left of Sgt. Tally's memorial block on the wall.      </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
FTF Honors to
drmageek24!
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;With black ravens scavenging the grounds, Draygo scouted this
location on a dark dark storm cloudy day. While exploring the area
he came across what had to be a giant's footprints in the snow that
were nearly melted away by the constant drizzle of rain. Each
stride was a full yard apart and the length of each footprint was
16+ inches! Be on the look out.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enjoy the view, take photos, and tell about your experience
finding the cache. Just don't be shy to share a story. Please
assure that the cache is hidden from view when placing it
back.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cache is a small 'lockit' container with several
tradable items and can only be accessed during the day since it is
law to stay out of cemeteries at night and out of respect pass this
one up during a funeral service. There's only one way in and one
way out with one place to park at the top.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache should be a quick find so parking in the road
shouldn't be a problem. But if using the pull off, be advised not
to park there when wet for the possibility of getting bogged down
in the muck.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please log all trades and try to trade up if possible. What I
place in a cache is based on the conduct of the geocachers. So far
it seems like I'm going to have to set out 35mm canisters.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Challenge yourself to a 2 star terrain and an overall rating
of 2 by walking up the hill to this cache from the Norton
Presbyterian Church parking lot. Do so if you geocache for the
exercise or feel uncomfortable driving up. A sponge animal capsule
has been placed in the cache to signal a leak.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I've enjoyed the first few (of many) caches I've found in the state so far, and wanted to give back.  Cache is a 50 cal ammo can with various swag, including an unactivated geocoin key-chain for the FTF.  Cache is placed on private property with the owner's permission.  From where the cache is, you can see the bird-feeder in back, and may be able to catch a glimpse of the variety of birds that hang out here.  The area also gets frequent visits from squirrels, raccoons, and deer.  Also, take a good look around.  Depending on the time of day and the weather, you may see one or two travel bugs parked next to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to illinitrekker and StarWarsFan98 on FTF!

Here you will find the latest count of caches in the series&lt;br/&gt;and find out how you can add your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it looks like downtown, Athens doesn't have a&lt;br/&gt;downtown! Instead, we have &quot;uptown&quot;. Court Street is a place where&lt;br/&gt;you can get the full feel of this town. In the summer, it's true&lt;br/&gt;small town, with the street made from local brick and a nice, slow&lt;br/&gt;pace. In the fall, however, it becomes a busy college town with&lt;br/&gt;lots of activity going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that, because this is in Uptown, you will have to feed a&lt;br/&gt;parking meter if you come during the day on Monday-Saturday. Cache&lt;br/&gt;is a micro container attached with velcro. The business at this&lt;br/&gt;location has given permission to hide the cache here and will be&lt;br/&gt;keeping an eye on it. If they're open, you can poke your head in&lt;br/&gt;and say hi to Allen. I stop in and see him every couple of&lt;br/&gt;weeks!&lt;/p&gt;

Had to use 4wd on this road to get back to the cemetery.  If it is icy/snowy, beware because you can get down the hills but may not get back up without 4wd [;)]

Found the cache with little trouble, very nice hide!  Glad to see this cemetery with an active cache, it is such a neat spot to visit.

There is a specific parking area to access this cache. It borders on a wildlife area that is not open to the public. The cache is   NOT  in the wildlife area. There are signs and fences so it will be easy to distinguish which area is off limits. 

Please Respect rules of  this area .Caching is  dawn to dusk only. Not hidden around any grave markers. Bring your own pen,.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache Will require you to follow a story and the clues in the story to find the (final resting spot). 

We were passing through Glouster 
We decided to visit some older residents of the town. 

The coords above take you to the first Couple we met. 
They have almost identical resting spots
There names are Wiliam and Hannah

After visiting them we took 20 paces to the east
We then turned left and went up the stairs 
continuing in that direction.

The next couple we met were surrounded by and invisible fence.
There names  were also William and Hannah.

Again we headed East but watch out for the wolfe
You will pass by a Brown Hall on your right 
from there look left and you will
find Geo Mussle

From there head left toward the Barnes 
Until you find Icel  
Follow with Grace and look for the Ray
Past by Wallace and Watkins to the Stone Cross to your slight left.

20 paces to your left to the stairs
Cross the lane
to your left you will find a stone flower above a man with two first names.

Take 25 paces west to Wyatt 
Facing Wyatt 
cross the lane to your right
take 23 paces bearing right (not direct right)

If you look up Independence Day on Wikipedia it states that 

During the American Revolution, the legal separation of the American colonies from Great Britain occurred on July 2, 1776, when the Second Continental Congress voted to approve a resolution of independence that had been proposed in June by Richard Henry Lee of Virginia.

On July 3rd 1776 John Adams wrote this to his wife.

“ The second day of July, 1776, will be the most memorable epoch in the history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival. It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward forever more. ” 

Adams' prediction was off by two days. From the outset, Americans celebrated independence on July 4, the date shown on the much-publicized Declaration of Independence, rather than on July 2, the date the resolution of independence was approved in a closed session of Congress

One of the most enduring myths about Independence Day is that Congress signed the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. The myth had become so firmly established that, decades after the event and nearing the end of their lives, even the elderly Thomas Jefferson and John Adams had come to believe that they and the other delegates had signed the Declaration on the fourth.

In a remarkable series of coincidences, both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, two founding fathers of the United States and the only two men who signed the Declaration of Independence to become president, died on the same day: July 4, 1826, which was the United States' 50th anniversary


All of the above information was taken from Wikipedia.

Some very interesting facts we did not know about our independence. We should be thankful every day for our independence.  A lot of men and women have paid heavy prices for us to have it.</groundspeak:long_description>

It's a fairly easy walk up recently added steps which take visitors easily to the cave. Not wheelchair friendly, dawn to dusk

The Mississippian Period began around 359 million years ago and ended around 318 million years ago. Mississippian-age rocks crop out in a north-south band in east-central Ohio from the Ohio River to near the Lake Erie shore and then eastward in northeastern Ohio. They are well exposed in much of this area because they consist primarily of erosion-resistant sandstones and sandy shales that form prominent cliffs.

As the Early Mississippian progressed, coarser sands representing the offshore portions of delta lobes formed by many west-flowing streams built up thick deposits of sand and sandy shale. 

One of the more interesting units of the Lower Mississippian is the Black Hand Sandstone. The nearly pure quartz sandstone reaches about 200 feet in thickness in the Hocking Valley and crops out to the north into Licking and Richland Counties.

Mississippian rocks have been important to the economic development of the state, although it is less today than in the past. The Black Hand Sandstone and Buena Vista Sandstone of the Cuyahoga Formation have been important building stones. The Buena Vista of southern Ohio is still quarried. Oil and gas have been produced in modest quantities from Mississippian rocks, particularly the Black 
Hand in the subsurface of southern Ohio. The Bedford Shale was once an important source of clay for bricks and tile.

Perhaps the most spectacular scenery in Ohio is due to thick, erosion-resistant sandstones of Mississippian age. The Black Hand Sandstone, in particular, forms high cliffs, large rock-shelter caves, and waterfalls in its areas of outcrop from Hocking County northward to Richland County.  Robinson's cave is one of those rockshelters.

On a forested hillside south of New Straitsville, this cave offered a secluded location with great acoustics where large groups of Hocking Valley coal miners could meet in secret. Beginning in about 1870, labor-organizing meetings were held at the cave by various emerging unions including the Knights of Labor. New Straitsville resident Christopher Evans, a well-known union organizer, used Robinson's Cave to lead miners throughout the long Hocking Valley Coal Strike of 1884-1885. These meetings gave the miners a voice in the formation of a national organization called the National Federation of Miners and Mine Laborers, later renamed the National Progressive Union. The cave was also where non-union miners met to plan to set the Columbus &amp; Hocking Coal &amp; Iron Company mines on fire in a desperate attempt to end the Hocking Valley Strike. In 1886, the Knights of Labor founded the National District Assembly #135, a rival for the National Federation of Miners and Mine Laborers. Oddly, both headquarters were located in New Straitsville. Dissension between the two groups hurt labor negotiations, but Christopher Evans continued to hold meetings to settle differences. In response to a miner's death in 1889, the feuding miners used Robinson's Cave to reconcile once and for all. Evans called miners together again in 1890 for the first organizational meeting of the United Mine Workers of America, the name formally adopted at their next meeting in Columbus. This series of historic meetings is why Robinson's Cave is referred to as the secret birthplace of the United Mine Workers.  

To log this Earthcache, you must identify the darkest colored layer in the exposed strata of the cave walls.  You must then read the posted history in the area, and tell us the local &quot;slang term&quot; for what is contained in that layer. Please post of photo of yourself at the cave.

The twelfth lock on the Hocking Canal, the Sheep Pen lock, underscores Southeast Ohioans' efforts to open their region to the world during the mid-nineteenth century. Built as a guard lock, it was intended to permit slackwater navigation of the Hocking River by regulating water depths where river and canal met. Those plans were later abandoned and the mechanism was converted to a lift lock, which raised and lowered boats as required by changes in the canal's elevation.

Congrats to Pork Queen and scoobypatterson for FTF :)

May 24th 2008 S&amp;BGeo were wed at the little church on the Fairfield County Fairgrounds. We became not only Caching partners but partners for life. 
We decided while eating dinner in Logan, we should place a cache on the way home as a celebration of not only caching, but our anniversary too.

This Hike is very steep on the way to cache until you reach the Ridge top but WORTH the effort.

YOU MUST STAY ON TRAILS IN THIS PARK AS PER PARK RULES

It is located in Clear Creek Metro Park just south of Lancaster. You will want to park at the Creek Side Meadows Picnic/Parking area and take the Cemetery Ridge Trail to the cache. 

Parking Coordinates 
N 39° 35.336 W 082° 34.653




The Creekside Meadows trail will take you to the Cemetery Ridge Trail. You will want to go North from parking lot. Please always practice CITO in all Parks or Cache sites.


This Cache was placed not only for fun and swag but has a history lesson to it as well. Don’t worry no grading or testing will be done. The walk to the cache is all the way up to a ridge top that will lead to the cache. Again it is a bit of an uphill trek on the way in. When you reach the cache you will find something near that you don’t have the privilege of seeing often and maybe for some never. Anyway it is a very interesting area and we hope you enjoy it as much as we have. There is much more to see and many more trails to hike in the park as well. On your way into the park you will go by a large rock sitting beside the road (It has been called Leena, or Leaning rock) and sometimes will have sticks appearing to hold it up that people stop and leave. 

Container is a camo gallon size container

It was a cold and blustery day and we decided to take the Fern Trail up to the Cemetery Ridge Trail.  We figure we hiked about 5 miles total and getting the cache was the perfect thing to do in this awesome park!

THE END OF AN ERA...........................

******DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT LOOK FOR THIS CACHE IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO LEAVES, HAVE ABNORMAL FEARS OF CONCRETE, WOOD OR DIRT, LACK A SENSE OF HUMOR, ARE NOT SMART ENOUGH TO LOOK BEFORE YOU SIT, HAVE NO ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT OR HAVE A SERIOUS AVERSION TO FAILURE. YOU WILL NOT HAVE AN ENJOYABLE TIME.

The cache you seek
Is very small.
It lays within
These four brick walls.

It's made of nature
And formed by me.
It's not inside water
And is not a tree.

If bridge drove you crazy
And ruined your day.
Don't look for this one
Cause you'll surely pay.

Muggles abundant
And nosey ones too.
The hours you spend here
Will be more than a few.

Prize will be awarded to the First To Find!

LATITO FAQ's
1.This is a NANO, with only room for initials.
2.It is inside the building, not inside the walls.  Stop picking plaster.
3.If it is or ever has been alive, it's not the cache or the hiding place.  Many living things reside here, please be respectful to their house.
4.This cache was never intended to be easy.  It's not a dirty trick, it's just plain hard.
5.The cache is in plain sight.
6.It's not under anything, so flipping, moving, deconstructing, removing, or disassembling ANYTHING is not only not required, but is also severely frowned upon by the owners of the cache and the site itself.
7.There is very little in the garden that isn't intended to be there.  Do not step on ANY plantlife while visiting the garden.  The plants may look like weeds to you, but they are not.  Some of the beds were planted with seeds, and the plants are still growing.  Please be respectful to the hard efforts of your local Geocachers by practicing CITO, and treading lightly.
8.The code on the back of the log must be verified for your prize, but signing the log will get you a smiley.

Entrance located within 25 feet of on-street parking. Enter the store that sells air and sunshine.  On community property that is available only during day light hours. Feel free to CITO the place as you look.  Probably not handicap accessible due to a couple steps.  IF YOU FIND THE CACHE, IT UNSCREWS.  IF YOU TRY TO PULL IT APART, YOU WILL BREAK IT.  Be sure to screw it all the way back down, the last turn seems like too much, but it needs to be closed.  The only hints for this one are in the poem above.
  There are a few local characters you will no doubt either run into, or at least see on your visit here.  They are harmless for the most part.  They are good for a story or 30 about days gone by in this lonely little place.  I have talked to a couple of them, but only about history.  If any of the Sunday Creek people stop in to say hello, they like hearing about how far you traveled to see their garden.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Here for the CITO with a great group of people. I kept hearing the whispers of &quot;he found it&quot;, and &quot;she found it&quot;. Sure enough, I think 5 or 6 people found it before I did. It was hard not to ask for hints, or to try to persuade with bullying, but I finally managed to spot it. What an epic day... TeamG awarded the golden ammo can, and several real finds at Latito. 
Thanks for the cache! Be back next year!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">OMG!!! Wow, what can we say about this cache that hasnt already been said. We cannot believe we finally found it, and what better time to find it than at the recent C.I.T.O. and 1K milestone celebration. We have looked for this little bugger for so long, its nice to be able to take a smilie for it but we are sad to see it go. This little cache has brought us so much in the past two years, we appreciate everything that the cache owners have put into this little bugger that has brought us so much. We have spent so much time here, lost so many hours of sleep ever this one, driven many hours just to pull a slew of DNFs - this had to be on of the best caches we have ever done :) But to find it during the C.I.T.O. was the best - and we were glad it didnt turn out to be the group find we thought it might. Everyone made the find their way and got to experience that moment of jubilation when then got their hands on the cache, and then figure out a way to sneak it back into place so the next finder could experience the thrill of the adventure. We were probably the 5th group to find it during the event, but no one spoiled it for us, and we have to thank them for that :) We are sure it was difficult to hold in the excitement of finally making the find on this one. So ... thanks to TeamGuisinger on the really nice and creative cache and giving us the hours of frustration in looking for it. Also, thank you for the friendship and the opportunity to meet and make so many friends here - THIS IS WHAT THIS CACHE INSPIRES !!! Took: a sigh of relief after finding the cache, Left: a feeling of accomplishment on finally finding this cache, SL. TFTC!!!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We spent hours of time over the last two years looking for this cache. Many hours of frustration and cussing TeamG out .  Last year at the CITO@LATITO we had a lot of people looking for it and everyone touched it but no one found it. 
Well this year it was different :)

Latito was found!  We were 4th to find today.  Great,  great hiding spot and I cannot believe we did not see this before.  Very clever. 
Thanks so much to TeamG and TeamDotOne for  the effort put into the event  and  for bringing a lot of friendly wonderful people together with two common goals :
Clean up  the garden…and FIND THAT DARN CACHE!     Now we can take this one off the list but we will still stop and visit the garden.
Now let’s talk about that  confounded  Bridge.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a nocturnal cache that will require a flash light, a short hike on an unpaved trail and a short hike off-trail.  Park at Stone Church Trail Head and follow the trail with boulders on each side.

When you reach the stream go down stream to cross, there are stepping stones. Follow the trail to the posted coordinates. We took several readings at this location and have posted the average. When you reach the coords shine your flash light to your right. You should see the reflector. Follow the reflectors to the cache site. When you see the smiley face,please be very careful and watch where you are stepping. We don't want anyone hurting themselves in the dark. 

While the cache location should not be hard to find, getting to it may be. You will most likely get dirty and possibly wet depending on how careful you are. Without giving away too much, I will tell you that you cannot just WALK up to it. But it isn't anything so strenuous that our kids didn't get to it by themselves easily during our hide.

Cache is in a large ammo box that is packed full!  Original items are all nocturnal theme that should light up your return hike. There is also a CIAB in this cache. What's a CIAB? You're gonna have to hunt it to find out. Please follow the rules of the CIAB if you wish to take it. 

We marked the return path to the trail with reflectors for those of you that do not have track logs on your GPS.

Don't crack your skull!

The cache was perfect, especially the final.   It was so cool to open the log book, and see the names of countless others that had been here before me and imagining their joy at reaching this place.  I then imagined  Native Americans treasuring this spot for all that it has to offer, surely this was once a dwelling place.

Thanks for the cache.

They weren't responding via phones, so we just hoped they were there...pulled up and flashed our brights at all of the headlamps and scared them a bit by announcing they shouldn't be out there!  They finally realized who it was and daddy joined them on the walk as the lil ruts were sleeping already!  daddy enjoyed strategically replacing rocks across the stream so richie wouldn't get his toesies cold and then he enjoyed the final location!  well worth the hike.

Must follow park rules at all times 

This cache is placed at Hargus Lake near the Dam area and is filled with things for kids. Please leave a toy if your taking one

Your looking for an Ammo Can and it is NOT camoed for a reason as it had to be special for a little girl. You will know what I mean when you see the container.

I usually stomp, and paddle the creeks, and rivers, but this was a nice change. I even managed to nab a little largemouth on my float back to the dock. 

Thanks for the cache!

We saw the whole park series pop up on the Blackberry late Saturday night.  Loaded up the kayaks and headed out at the crack of dawn.  We KNEW we had to get there early, because with the likes of GeoServidor, illinitrekker, Team G and CTeam who could possibly beat us to the location (we drove only a few miles for this one [;)]), we would have to get there REAL early.  

We are paddling up to the island, mist still rising off the water, and with all the boats around we got worried.  Not another STF for creekstompers (would have been one of dozens).  When we pulled out the blank white paper, I think the whole lake heard us cheering!  We could NOT pass up this water cache, as we are avid kayakers.  We were just thrilled to get the FTF on this one.  Stuck around and did some fishing, JB creekstomper caught a 9&quot; crappie, but no bass today.

GeoServidor, we took the FTF prize and it paid for some gas in the creekstompers truck.  We know it's hard to beat you to the FTF in your neck of the woods, so we hope you take that as a compliment!  Sorry we didn't get to meet you out on the water.

And after another 30 minute search, or so, we were able to have the cache in hand and do the HAPPY DANCE on the bridge.

Some stealth required. 

There is also a letter box at the same location as the cache. The letter box is a black envelope looking container wrapped in black tape approx. 4 inches by 6 inches. If you find this it is not the cache and you will not get credit for the cache by logging the letterbox. See Attached Picture to see what these look like.
THEY ARE NOT OUR CACHE

Small park right off 33.   Log only,  you will need to bring a pen. 
Some information on the history of the park from the Fairfield County Parks web site:

 Flight of the Hawk Sculpture Park ~ Berne Township
Features a steel sculpture of a red-tailed hawk made up of more than 3,000 pieces, weighing more than 2,500 pounds and having a wingspan of more than 14 ft. The hawk appears to be landing on a &quot;nest&quot; 40 ft. in the air. Plans call for other life-sized Ohio woodland animals to be sculpted and installed as commissions become available.

Placed with Permission from the Director of Fairfield County Parks.

Here's another old cemetery and church. We love these places. Especially to take pics of the old churches. This should be an easy find. It is not on any of the headstones. As with any cemetery cache, please respect the rules of the cemetery and help keep the surroundings peaceful. Cemetery closes at dusk so please do this one early. Sundays would not be a good day to look for this one. BYOP </groundspeak:long_description>

This cemetery has a steep hill but if you walk to the top there is a beautiful view. This is a typical cemetery cache, so please observe all rules and regulations of Crawfis-Emery Cemetery. Do not search after dark. This is a micro, so BYOP.

This is a very old but still open cemetery. Of all the cemeteries I have visited the old headstones in this one are in really good shape. It always saddens us when we see headstones that cannot be read or are destroyed, either by weather or vandals.

STONEWALL CEMETERY HAS PRESIDENTIAL HISTORY 

Sunday, October 26, 2003 
By Carolyn Tilley 


Did you know that the President of the United States held in trust a small cemetery in Fairfield County? At least, several of our presidents did. Located just west of Lancaster, south of US 22 lies a most unusual walled cemetery. It is a (12-sided figure), constructed of hand-dressed native sandstone. The stones are placed without mortar and the corners are shaped from mitered stone. 
The Stonewall Cemetery, on the road of the same name, is the burying place of the Wilson family, early pioneers of Fairfield County. Nathaniel Wilson II, a Scotsman, brought his family to this area, probably over the nearby Zane's Trace. He settled in Hocking Township in 1798. 

The background of this pioneer shows that his father, the first Nathaniel Wilson, was born in 1660. He and a Richard Cameron were taken prisoner by Charles I of England at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge in Lanarkshire, Scotland in 1679. Cameron's hands were cut off, but Nathaniel, then 19, managed to escape with Cameron's now useless sword. He made his way home and eventually reached Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. He reared his family there and died in 1753, at age 93, leaving the Cameron sword and old Scotch Bible to his eldest son, Nathaniel II. 

This Nathaniel Wilson II immigrated to the Ohio wilderness and built a humble log cabin in a clearing, and hung the old Cameron sword over its doorway in the living room. Beneath the sword were inscribed the words: &quot;The sword of the Lord and Gideon.&quot; Mr. Wilson embraced the ideas and peculiarities of the Old Scoth Covenanters, among which was a great reverance and respect for the dead. 

Others on this frontier did not seem to share his same ideals; therefore, he envisioned something special for his family. 

Wilson II died on March 21, 1814, and was buried in the old city graveyard at High and Chestnut in Lancaster. His son, Nathaniel Wilson III, inherited his father's reverence for the dead. He finished the paperwork, and before deeding it to the president, had neighboring settlers Samuel and Emanuel Carpenter lay out a plan for enclosing it with a stone wall in 1816. There were nine marked graves in the little cemetery. The remains of Nathaniel Wilson II and his wife Elizabeth were moved to Stonewall Cemetery and placed in unmarked graves when the old city cemetery was moved in 1907. 

Wilson III deeded the cemetery to President James Monroe on Oct. 24, 1817, to be held by &quot;his successors in office forever, in fee simple forever in trust for the said Nathaniel Wilson and his heirs.&quot; The deed was legal and was witnessed by two Lancaster men. Thomas Ewing, who later served as Secretary of the Interior and Treasury, and William I. Thomas. No evidence has been found that President Monroe accepted the deed. Although started as early as 1812, it was not officially granted until 1940, under the signature of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. 

On July 5, 1961, James M. Hengst, Nathaniel Wilson II's great-great grandson, purchased 1.046 acres surrounding and including the cemetery. In 1966, the cemetery was transferred to the Fairfield Heritage Association. In 1978 Heritage had it restored with a public preview on Oct. 8. However, vandals hit several times in the 1980s and destroyed many of the stones. It was cared for by the Hocking Township Trustees for a time and is now preserved as a Fairfield County Historical Park. 

The wall wasn't started until 1838. The sandstone probably came from a quarry on nearby Allen's Knob in Shallenberger State Nature Preserve. The stones, about 18 inches thick, were shaped at the quarry to fit each into the other. At the corners, the stones were shaped with angles, thus avoiding mortar. Each of the 12 sides is 29.5 feet in length. The wall stands today without a crack and with no settling. It is considered to be the finest example of dry masonry in the state of Ohio. 

At the quarry and the cemetery, Nathaniel III read to the workman from his Bible. According to I Kings 6:7, Solomon's temple was &quot;built of stone made ready before it was brought thither so that there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building.&quot; Stonewall Cemetery was built in the same manner. 

Pockets in the tops of the wall indicate that an iron fence was planned, but never constructed. The stone work of the wall included an arch over an iron gate forming the cemetery entrance. Over the gate a semicircle of smooth stone, different from that in the wall, is fitted into the arch, and bears the following inscription: 

&quot;This wall which encloses the family burying ground of Nathaniel Wilson (one of the early pioneers of the west who departed Cumberland County, Pennsylvania and settled near this place A.D. 1797 when all around was one continued and uninhabited wilderness) was commenced by him A.D. 1838 and finished the following year by his son Gustin, the former having suddenly died May 12, 1839.&quot; 

In the center of this plot Nathaniel planted a Cedar of Lebanon tree which he obtained from Mt. Lebanon in the Middle East. The founder's plan for the graves is outlined in his will. His wife was to be north and his own south of the Cedar. Over each grave is a sandstone slab, and at either end is an upright stone, slightly higher at the head supporting the inscribed marble slab at a slight angle. The inscribed stones are all about 20 inches above ground level. 

The little cemetery has seen much in its many years and the passage of time has not been kind. Lightning struck the Cedar, and it has been replaced by a new Cedar of Lebanon. 

Nathaniel Wilson III's will, executed in 1838, set aside a tract of land of the perpetual growing of locust posts to keep the cemetery fenced. This tract of land, willed to President Martin Van Buren, was bounded on the north by the road leading from Lancaster to Amanda. With changes in the route of this road, once known as the Zanesville-Maysville Turnpike, it is difficult to locate this tract of land known as the &quot;President's Acre.&quot; &quot;The President's Cemetery&quot; and &quot;The President's Acre&quot; are different plots of ground within Section 15 of Hocking Township. Nearby on US 22 is the original Wilson homestead. It has a beautiful tree-lined lane reminding one of a southern plantation. What stories our ancestors had to tell.

Parking within 100 feet of cache with pavement all the way! Really easy, quick find for those of you we have already worn out. Bring your own pen.

Lots of muggles in the area, be very aware. 

Two other noteworthy things in the area:
1-Restaurant within view was also featured in a movie that happens to have a tribute cache called the Secret of Brubaker. 
2-Small monument across the street is what I would consider odd and uncommon, take a look.

We live very close, if we happen to see cachers poking around while we're outside we may come say hello.</groundspeak:long_description>

I told her she needs to come to the big city and hold minivan driving lessons [:)]

So we are walking up to GZ - and a house full of people across the street are yelling &quot;You looking for that treasure hunt thing?&quot; &quot;We know where it's at - we'll show ya&quot; .....
Mr. G finally had to tell them that HE OWNED the cache and he KNEW where it was ..... tooooo funny.

Added Note:  Don't make this too hard, it isn't anything strange or unusual. It is NOT in the wall, please do not damange the wall trying to find the cache. You've probably found at least one similar hide. It is extremely hard to spot, but it is there. We have up'd the difficulty rating a bit.</groundspeak:long_description>

Very fun cache, made all the more enjoyable with this eclectic group of cachers that I am proud to be a part of.
The muck was deep, and sounded like what falls out of a can of spam... are we the first to nab this one by paddling? 
 Either way, a great cache, thanks!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What can I say?  This cache was a microcosm of a geocacher’s life.  It has puzzles, physical challenges, special equipment required (for most of us mortals – more later).  It involved persistence, cleverness, physical endurance and my favorite – begging for hints.  Many, many thanks to our cache owner hosts for joining us today.  They provided some on the spot cache maintenance, hints and encouragement on stage 3, and cold water after it was all done!

Stage 1:  I made my second biggest contribution of the day here – I found the decoy.  It took a little awhile to spring stage 2 coords free.   I believe it was Alfamonkey who figured it out.  The gals were probably quite happy as they were up there trying all the other wrong guesses we were all tossing out. 

Stage 2: Since the stage needed a little maintenance it took us a little longer. The CO came over wondering why we weren’t getting it and fixed the issue.

Stage 3: (AKA the back breaker).  My personal biggest contribution was at this stage.  Landondena and I decided to do our own re-enactment of “Titanic” (the non-musical version) – it was great entertainment value.  Undaunted, us two soaked binge rats paddle over to the spot (OK you COULD walk I guess, but we had the boats….) with no GPS (and no clue) and start searching.  To make a l-o-n-g story shorter – the whole team proceeds to spend the next few hours here.  We all spent a bit of time looking in the wrong direction and then probably used the wrong initial approach when we did get on the right track.  This stage was my personal longest time looking for 1 stage - ever.  At one point I figured the cache should be renamed “6-6-6”.  Our hosts were very patient and did throw us some hints as the cross-lake begging ensued.  But I was sure the little sucker was GONE!  I felt less embarrassed when the CO paddled over couldn’t find it for right away.  One of the gals found it before him and we heard the holler from across the lake (I was in bratt mode at the time and smoozing with the park ranger that stopped by.)

Stage 4: Just like some caches, this one was uneventful.  Quick paddle, fast hike, and only a short hunt.  Assisting Landondena into almost a face plant was my highlight of the stage.  Signed the log even though we were going for the final.  My signing fingers were getting itchy – never done just 1 cache in a day before.

Stage 5:  Probably everyone’s favorite.  Bushwacked in (why did they plant those pines trees SO close together???)  Got to the GZ.  I tried to scrabble straight up – no good.  Tried circling to the right – no good.  Meanwhile half the team successfully went up to the left.  But that was only after one of the gals (not to mention any names, but her new caching name will be Crazyspidermonkey) went right up a crevice to the top.  After making up the top up the face of the cliff, she later proceeds down to the cache.  And while the climbers were setting up ropes so she could repel down from her perch, she comes back up again.  Not to waste lugging her harness along, I guess, she does repel down from the top.  This stage is a “5” terrain for most, as there are probably very few people as crazy-brave, skilled, and double jointed as CSM.

My personal highlight was repelling for the first time! (OK, I’m hooked - where do I buy some gear?)  Took the horse trail back (learned about the anti-poison ivy plant) and bid our farewells.
Many thanks to the rest of the team for the quick training and use of their gear – especially to whoever belayed me the one time!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">First off, HIGH FIVE to brtruitt, ExtheFlow, djstitan5, and JNLE4!

The 5 of us set off with high hopes of conquering this beast. These hopes were not to be thwarted by falling rocks, poison ivy, seemingly impenetrable thorns, miscommunication, mr. mucky muck, nor ghastly flattulence. 

Stage 1 stoked my fires for adventure, and assured me that this was going to be &quot;my kind&quot; of cache.
 (no equipment necessary).
 We found the key much quicker than we knew. Each of us had to take several spins around the maypole before the gates fell open. Yes I tried the correct key a few times to no avail since I was the first one in the hidey hole. Br made matters much easier by bringing the gates to us after his knock on the wooden door to stage 1.  This proved to be very helpful, and JNLE4 spun it the right way to make the find before Br had a chance to chew through the blasted thing.

Stage 2 took a couple of minutes to walk to, as we parked about .1 away, and only seconds to locate, and retrieve the coords. This was still a great stage, and I loved the idea.

Stage 3 is where we were led astray, and much time was lost trying to use the suggested coords. Br and I eventually left the rest of our group paddling around the lake suggested for stage 3, and headed out by van for a litlle recon. We found the correct approach. The paddle to stage 3 was deliberate, and uneventful, as we were on a mission, and djstitan5 was supplying the natural jet boost to the canoe. The cache could have taken much longer to locate under different conditions, but we found the mark after a short search high and low. 
Excellent hide on this stage as well. 

Stage 4 - during the paddle, and hike, I think all of us were itching to scale new heights. We were geared up for something serious, something dangerous... The hike up the hillside built this anxious excitement up more and more with each step. Watching the arrow twitch, and the feet drop down to below 10'.
&quot;found it&quot; burps out from above ExtheFlow's beard... What? &quot;Yeah, it is right there&quot;.  We considered severely upping the terrain on the rehiding of this stage, you know,  to keep the little bit of verse accurate.  
&quot;... pack your ropes inside your boat&quot;
However, we did not engage in any unethical rehiding of caches on this journey, but it was VERY tempting!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is hidden in the Perry State Forest.  It will involve a short hike that includes one rather steep slope.  One way in, one way out.

If you're still up to it after finding the cache, make your way to the opposite side of the water and up. It is a beautiful view! The rocks change color as you work your way down the valley. Be careful!

Please be sure to Cache In and Trash Out.  This area could use some clean up. We took all we could carry but hardly made a dent.

Park at:
N39 46.052
W082 13.099

A lot of effort was put in to the hiding of this cache. Please re-hide well and erase any evidence of being in the area.

All of this area used to be rolling hills, now the scarred landscape is all that is left after the coal boom.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to our first “BoC” cache. BoC stands for Best of Columbus
and these caches will be placed throughout the city in areas that
we frequent and adore. This particular location first caught our
attention late in 2006 and we have been coming back ever
since.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This building once housed the Third Street School from the late
1800’s to early 1900’s. Construction began on the building in 1864
and it is currently the oldest Columbus City School still standing
(although students stopped attending in 1925). If you venture
inside, you can almost imagine desks in rows and the patter of
little feet running across the hardwood floors. Close to the cache
location is an old stone marker identifying its public school
number and is worthy of a look. It is currently managed by the
Columbus Recreation and Parks Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need to enter the premises to claim a find. You are
looking for a magnetic micro as this site will not accommodate a
regular container. Please be mindful of sidewalk traffic as you
attempt to find, although you should be well concealed from any
onlookers. This cache is in the heart of German Village and there
are many notable places to see and visit after finding the cache.
Please replace the container exactly as found. BYOP. Happy
Hunting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While several readings were taken and the average of those was
used for the final coordinates, there are buildings nearby and
signal bounce may occur. Therefore the hint is a spoiler.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A properly themed cache in Gahanna's Veterans Memorial Park.  The inspiration for the hiding spot came after a recent Spykids find.  Bring your own writing utensil.  You may want to print this out and bring it with you so you have something to write on!

This cache is replacing “A Patriotic Cache” (GCQT8X) that we previously had in this park.  We were hoping not to have to do a micro, but there are limited hiding spaces in the immediate area.  We hope to add to its appeal by having you complete a scavenger hunt and puzzle before claiming your find.  Don’t worry though, the answers are all readily available at the memorial and within 10 feet of the epicenter.  The posted coordinates will take you to the middle of the memorial where your search will begin.

Take a quick walk around the pillar housing the eternal flame.  Pay particular attention to the year the following branches of the military were founded: Air Force, Army, and Coast Guard.  You will need to rely on Roman numerals to compute one year.  

Next, take a walk around the base of the monument and locate the memorial brick for Bobby B Wright.  Your search should be concentrated within the immediate three feet of bricks surrounding the base, otherwise your search could take some time.  Pay attention to the years Bobby served in the USAF.

The actual cache will be at the following coordinates.  All you have to do is solve some problems to get the numbers you need.

N  - A0*0B.0CD
W -  EF*GF.EFG

A:   Add the last two digits of the year the Army was founded.  From your answer, subtract the total of the first two digits of the year the Army was founded.  Your answer is A.

B:  How many years did Bobby serve during his second tour of duty?  Your answer is B.

C &amp; D:  Take the two-digit year (from the plaque) in which Bobby completed his first tour of duty and add to it the last two digits of the year in which he began his second tour of duty.  Your answer is CD.

E &amp; F: Take the four-digit year the Air Force was founded and subtract the four-digit year the Army was founded.  From this number, subtract the last two numbers of the year the Coast Guard was founded.  Your answer is EF.  

G:  The number that corresponds with the month the memorial was opened.

Happy Hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a micro in the Woodside Green neighborhood containing only a log.  Easy access and parking, but the cache itself is slightly more difficult to get to (but easy to find).

Don't forget to bring your own writing instrument.  The cache might contain a coin or two from time to time, but not much else will fit in there.

If you come at the right time, you will probaly see plenty of ducks and geese and maybe someone fishing.  My niece named the cache. (Sorry, not much space for kids to run &amp; play.)

Carya ovata&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinctive, shaggy bark,
conspicuous on tall straight trees, gives this species its name. It
grows well in both wet and dry areas, but prefers well-drained
soils. In Ohio it is widely distributed, and probably can be found
in every county. It commonly is found in association with oak
trees. The wood is hard, strong, tough and elastic, and is used in
handles for tools and in athletic equipment. The wood also makes
excellent firewood, and often is used in smoking meat. As with
other edible nuts, squirrels compete with humans for this
fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Geocaching brought me to Alum Creek
today, in search of a messy hike, and a terrain challenge worthy of
4 stars.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unable
to find what I was looking for, I decided to make one for myself,
and the rest of you who may come here looking for the same sort of
adventure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You will be able to pull-off
the side of the road for stage one, and make the quick grab. Pay
attention to your surroundings...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please park at the parking
coordinates for stage 2, to keep the terrain rating accurate, and
truly find&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redemption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring your own
Pen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congrats to Team_JNLE4 &amp; Lttledude9 on the
Co-FTF!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations to 5BizzyBs on his monumental

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located at the Chambers Road covered bridge. There is parking very
close to the cache, and the terrain is a short walk on a grassy
surface, and a little bit of roadway. The cache is located just
inside the bridge. Not under, and no climbing is needed at
all.

&lt;p&gt;Built in 1883, this bridge spans 73 feet across the Big Walnut.
It is a Childs type truss, which was developed in 1843 by Horace
Childs, and used exclusively after 1883 by Ohio bridge builder
Everett Sherman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not necessarily the most impressive covered bridge in
Ohio, but it's all that Delaware County has to offer. I know that
there are folks out there who are interested in seeing all the
covered bridges out there. It appears that this one could use a
little more attention than it gets. It's on backroad in the
northeast corner of Delaware County. Because it's in the middle of
nowhere, it seems that the local kids have targeted it for a little
late night grafitti. Because of that I have to give this one an &quot;R&quot;
Rating for language. Hopefully though if it does get a little more
attention, people won't be so apt to deface this piece of
history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a little pull off on the eastern side of the bridge, on
the south side of the road. I've tucked this cache away to make it
difficult for non-cachers to find, but I don't want it to be
difficult for those who are looking for it. If you don't want help,
stop reading and have at it. Otherwise....The cache is in the south
eastern corner of the bridge. When you walk up to the bridge, if
you look down near the road surface, you will see a metal plate
that holds a timber in place vertically. About a foot up from the
road surface you will see the end of a timber laid horizontally.
The container is a rectangular Altoids tin that is magnetized to
the metal plate, and tucked up behind the horizontal beam. It's
hard to explain, and may make more sense when you get there. I have
included a pic below if you want to look at it. Like I said I've
given this away because it's a tough hide, but I want Geocachers to
find it easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of that said, the road doesn't seem to be often used,
but you may want to keep your eyes and ears open. Be careful out
there. I don't suggest doing this one at night, because not only
would it be more difficult for traffic to see you, but there are a
couple of houses nearby, and I wouldn't want them to think that
you're up to no good.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Ohio DeLorme Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Map located at: http://www.userfriendly.net/delorme/mapdefs/ohdc_s.jpg
&lt;br/&gt;
The map above is based on the base map for the
DeLorme Ohio Atlas. While you do not need to have a DeLorme Atlas
to use these map pages, they may be easier to use if you do have
one.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What is the DeLorme Challenge?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In 2004, Haicoole unveiled the 
California DeLorme Challenge cache. This popular challenge
cache has since been repeated in many other states. TeamDotOne
thought that we should join in the fun!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The DeLorme Atlas &amp; Gazetteer is published for all 50 states.
These maps are a favorite among travelers and outdoors enthusiasts,
and are available at many locations, including online directly from
DeLorme. The goal of this cache is simple: to find a cache on each
and every page of the Ohio State DeLorme Atlas &amp;
Gazetteer.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The image above shows the geographical extents of each of the pages
of the Ohio DeLorme Atlas &amp; Gazetteer. The final cache
coordinates can be obtained by successfully finding a cache on each
page of the Atlas.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In order to claim this cache, you must first let us know which
caches you found to meet the requirements for each Atlas page. See
details below.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Here are some specific guidelines for this Challenge:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As mentioned above, the posted coordinates are not the actual
coordinates for the cache. The physical cache may actually be quite
some distance from these coordinates! The terrain rating and
attributes apply to the final cache location, and more details will
be provided when you become eligible to seek the final cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally accepted rules, guidelines and conditions for logging
a cache find apply. These must be bona fide caches listed on
Geocaching.com that you have personally (physically) found and
logged.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have debated long and hard about allowing you to count finds
prior to the issuing of this challenge vs. starting everyone with a
clean slate, allowing only finds after the date the cache is
published. We suspect counting prior finds means several people are
very near to meeting or completing the challenge. Completing a
DeLorme Challenge is a mark of a home state caching honor rather
than a competition to do it first. To make the challenge
&lt;b&gt;fair&lt;/b&gt; to all, caches found prior to the creation of the Ohio
DeLorme Challenge will &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; be counted, even if they meet all
other Challenge requirements. 

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On pages that you can verify that you have previously found all
caches, you may fulfill the requirement by setting a cache.
Remember that all caches must meet Groundspeak guidelines,
including not setting vacation caches that cannot be maintained.
This is the only case where hides will be allowed to fulfill the
challenge requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All cache types count as finds for the DeLorme Challenge with
the exception of events (CITO included) and locationless
caches.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Ohio DeLorme Atlas pages that include space not located in
Ohio, only caches in the Ohio portion count. We will go off of the
posted coordinates for a cache (including multicaches and puzzles)
when determining in which state or page a given cache falls.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atlas page 29 is all over Lake Erie. You do not need to find
caches on this page. Thanks to KEWAH for posting a correction for
page 29 &quot;Technically, there IS a cache on page 29. It's KIH2O
(GCVKBK), out near Kelley Island,&quot; and we received another
correction from HercJerk stating that &quot;I did notice there are now
three other caches on the Lake Erie page 29. They are GC1JGD2,
GC1JC1G, and GC8A3A,&quot; however we are still not requiring this page
to be completed but feel free to grab that cache if you would
like.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever there is a cache shown on two different pages, these
caches may be counted for only ONE of the pages. Pages 73 and 87
have two separate maps to cover little sections of Ohio. You must
log a cache in each of these pages (e.g. 73A and 73B).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the various editions and versions of the DeLorme Atlas do
not seem to have changed much in terms of page boundaries, the
image above derived from the information in the cache owner's copy
(Seventh Edition, © 2004) will be considered definitive.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While you may have others with you when you find the final
cache, only those who have fulfilled ALL criteria for this cache
will be allowed to log it as a find. Find logs by other cachers
will be deleted.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When in doubt, ask. We can discuss it or even seek guidance
from others, but the final decision rests with the cache
owners.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that this is a game and is supposed to be fun!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Many thanks go out to Haicoole for the original idea for this cache
and to the owners of other 
DeLorme Challenge caches, especially PA Reviewer's 
Pennsylvania and Moun10Bike's 
Washington version, from which we have borrowed
liberally.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How can I play?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It's easy! The preferred method is to create a shared bookmark list
of the caches claimed as eligible finds. Simply send us an e-mail
at teamdotone@gmail.com to alert us
that you've completed all the pages. Include a link to your
bookmark list. This is the best way to share cache information in a
manner that's consistent with Groundspeak's terms of use for pocket
queries. If you don't create a bookmark list, send us a file
containing your claimed eligible finds. (.GPX or .LOC format is
highly preferred, but &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; GPX files using the proprietary
Groundspeak extensions to the GPX namespace). This alternative is
offered for geocachers who are not premium members, or for anyone
having difficulty with managing a bookmark list. We will review
your list of finds in order to verify compliance with the cache
requirements. Please allow up to one week for the verification
process -- we are expecting many Ohio cachers to join in the fun,
that means a bit of data 'crunching' will have to be performed.
Once everything checks out, we will send you an e-mail with
instructions, including the correct coordinates to take you to the
final cache, and some background information about the cache
location. The find cannot be logged until the physical container is
found and the logbook inside is signed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To help you figure out which caches are on which map pages, we have
the following files available.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
* Google Earth KMZ or
KML&lt;br/&gt;

* Garmin Mapsource&lt;br/&gt;

* Magellan GS or
SD&lt;br/&gt;

* GPX or
LOC&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Many thanks go out to Mount10Bike for graciously
creating and supplying these files for use by the
challengers.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The files have lines showing the borders of the Atlas pages. If you
develop a similar file for a different mapping software format,
send it to us and we will host that for everyone else's benefit as
well.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tracking the Progress of Geocachers Taking on the
DeLorme Challenge:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We encourage everyone to make their DeLorme Challenge 
bookmark lists &quot;public&quot; and &quot;shared,&quot; so that everyone can see
how other geocachers are coming along. &lt;b&gt;Tip: Include a bookmark
to this cache page on your list, and then everyone's lists can be
accessed from right here.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We also ask that you think of the *best* cache that you found on
each page of the Atlas, for inclusion on your DeLorme Challenge
bookmark list. That way, everyone will see how hard you worked to
complete the challenge, and we will have a very nice compiled list
of Ohio's best caches. This is just a suggestion, not a
requirement. If the only cache you found on an Atlas page is a
micro at a highway rest stop, it's still eligible.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Those accepting the DeLorme Challenge are encouraged to post notes
here on the cache page to let everyone know they are working on it,
and to keep us informed of their progress. GOOD LUCK, AND HAVE
FUN!&lt;/li&gt;

Having had fun caching in the Columbus region, and meeting the great cachers that way, wanted to provide a cache for people to find.
Cache is located in a small city park with a pool, and I expect the park may be busy at times.  There aren't too many places to hide a film canister here, but there is one hidden.  Please re-camouflage the container well when you are done.  Cache contains only a log-book -- BYOP
Cache well and see you around the bend.

Both times I went by I thought &quot;I need to replace that logbook soon.&quot;  Obviously I failed. I will get it replaced hopefully this week.  It may take me into next weekend to get it done though sorry for the inconvenience.</groundspeak:text>

so there is no need to search on or near any headstones.
&lt;p&gt;As with any cemetery cache, please be respectful of your
surroundings. Area is closed from dusk until dawn.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This one is not close to home in the literal sense, but more in a
historical sense. The nearby church was attended by my
Great-Great-Grandfather Levi, though he was not buried at this
cemetery.
&lt;p&gt;Levi operated a granary in nearby Edison. Sadly one of his
children fell and suffocated in that granary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one of his children grew up to be a semi-pro basketball
player in his youth, then went on to open a pottery company, and
Hupmobile dealership in Edison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container you're looking for is an &quot;Eclipse&quot; mint tin. It's
rectangular in shape, painted to match its surroundings, and
magnetic. It is too small for anything but very small trade items.
As such you will find only a logbook in there, unless someone adds
something later.&lt;/p&gt;

can be challenging at times. Not recommended for younger kids.
Older kids can handle.

This is a regular sized ammo box. Location should be fairly obvious
once you locate the general area. After heavy rains, you might have
to cross standing water, so come prepared. There are trade items,
both kid and older related items. Hoping to see TB's and Geocoins
making their rounds through this area. &lt;br/&gt;

My family was &quot;creeking&quot; near the location for this cache, and coincidentally was planning to do some geocaching when we were done.  I happened to find this cache just laying next to the creek, but we were about 3/10 of a mile away from where the cache should have been.  I don't think there is any way that it could have washed to this location, so I think it was certainly moved by a muggle or something.

We tried to replace the cache to it's proper location, and I'm pretty sure that we got it to the right place.  </groundspeak:text>

of the bridge, and NOT in the gravel parking lot. You are looking
for a magnetic Altoids can. Please return cache as found. BYOP!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard the story of the Three Little Pigs? The
billboard at the end of this road will explain why I named this
cache :)&lt;/p&gt;

This is a great park to take a stroll through, watch wildlife,

whenever possible. This is a great way to payback for these great
cache hunts. You are looking for a small round Lock n Lock. Started
off with a couple of trinkets. Please BYOP, and return the cache as

&lt;p&gt;When you arrive at this cache, take yourself back
to November 2, 1865. What event took place here? Well, that is for
you to figure out when you arrive. The purpose of this cache is to
take you to a place you likely would not have stopped before. A
brief history lesson if you will. After finding this cache, be sure
to visit &lt;i&gt;Iberian Badger&lt;/i&gt; (GCRYQW) to learn more to this
story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a multi-cache. The coordinates will take
you to stage 1. At this stage, you will see a historical marker.
You need to find 2 numbers off of this sign. The numbers will be
hyphenated. You need to multiply the number to the left of the
hyphen by 3 and subtract that number from the last 3 digits of the
North Coordinate. Take the number to the right of the hyphen and
add it to the last 3 digits of the West Coordinate. The coordinates
to work with are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;N 40 42.496&lt;br/&gt;
 W 082 39.904&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, punch in your numbers, hop in your car, and
take the short drive to the location of the final cache. This is a
short drive, around 2 miles. Be sure to BYOP, as the cache will not
hold one. Please make sure to use pulloff at stage 1, and ONLY hunt
this cache during daylight hours!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
NOTE: Please ignore the title name I put in the logbook of the
final. I decided to change the name when I listed it. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

For those that have hunted Courtney's Hike (GC14KXY), or are going
to in the future, and want a more satisfying hike through the
woods, this is the hunt for you. I recommend finding Courtney's
Hike first, then going to this one. This cache was entitled
&quot;Straight Line Winds&quot; due to the fierce storms and straight line
winds that took place here a few years back. Winds topped 100MPH
just to the NNE of this location, and you can still see some of the
damage if you drive Orweiler Rd. just off of Bowers Rd. near the
Boy Scout Camp. Some of the trees in the cache area were toppled
from lesser winds in this storm, but still nothing to laugh about.
I highly recommend turning tracking ON on your GPS for return to
your vehicle after this one. It is very easy to get turned around
in here. Well stuffed ammo can, hidden in a usual way. Please
return the way you found it, or better if not hidden well when you
find it. &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another cache in the park system of Galion, Ohio.
This cache was named for the location it is near. During the warmer
months, there will be quite a few kids on the soccer fields, so
extreme caution is needed during these periods. Cache is a camo
lock n lock. Should be an easy find. Please do NOT go on the South
side of this tree line. You can access from the North side very
easily. The South side is private property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache was placed in coordination with the CITO
Amicks CITO event, April 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

This cache was named for the ease of carrying my 14 mo old daughter
back to place it. Should be an easy find for those in a hurry. Some
poison, but not terribly bad. Bring a fishing pole, especially in
the spring when the crappie are in pre-spawn. This area is older
kid friendly. Youngsters can easily be carried back into the area
w/o much problem. Look for parking area and proceed from there.

&lt;p&gt;Take some time while looking for this cache and
enjoy nature. Some of these areas have been designated Pheasant
lands, and Pheasants can be seen year round. Nothing like the
calling of Pheasants on a warm summers evening. Also, deer are
normal in this area, so be sure to bring a camera. This cache is
available year round, and will be a little tougher in the warmer
months as the undergrowth will hamper your caching ability. There
are trails back through this area, so no bushwacking is necessary.
You will be looking for an ammo can. Please access this cache from
the &quot;rock&quot; side (east) rather than the wood side (west), as this is
how it is intended to stay hidden. Thanks! Please return this cache
as you find it to prevent muggles from locating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 This is the second cache in the series Take Me To Something
Patriotic. In this series, you will travel to locations that are
patriotic in nature. I have given this multicache this name as an
event that would happen yearly near this site. Being a local
trumpeter, I would be asked to play &lt;i&gt;Taps&lt;/i&gt; during a wreath
laying ceremony on various patriotic and rememberance days through
the year. This was at the old location, which was about 150' to the
West of the current location of this memorial. Since the move,
there have been no wreath laying ceremony, and no &lt;i&gt;Taps&lt;/i&gt;,
hence The Silent Trumpeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you arrive at this location, you will need 2 different sets
of year numbers. The first year number will be on the left side of
the main memorial plaque. You need to add the 4 digits of this date
together, and subtract that number from the last 3 digits of the N
coordinate. Take the 2nd year, on the right side of the plaque, and
add those 4 digits together. Subtract that number from the final 3
digits of the W coordinate. The coordinates to use are listed
below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;N 40 42.551&lt;br/&gt;
 W 082 49.092&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please spend some time at the 1st stage and pay respects for
those who have served our country. Also, please post your photos,
but be careful not to disclose the dates needed to complete this
multi! At the final, please rehide as found. There is a good amount
of kid activity in this location, and if hidden properly, they
should not find it. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Just a quick note...as of Veterans Day 2007, there has been a
wreath laying ceremony at the memorial, complete with Taps.&lt;br/&gt;

 This is the first cache in the series Take Me To Something
Patriotic. In this series, you will travel to locations that are
patriotic in nature. The brick pictured&lt;br/&gt;
 is to honor the service of my wife's father, whom passed away a
few years ago. At this multi-cache, Where Eagles Soar, you will
need to do a little&lt;br/&gt;
 math to find the coordinates to the final. In the picture above,
you will see a brick.You need to find this brick in the area at the
above&lt;br/&gt;
 coordinates. There will be a series of dates after the word
&quot;NAVY&quot;, which have been edited out of this photo. To get the
coorinates to the final stage,&lt;br/&gt;
 you must add the digits of the 1st year together, and subtract
that number from the last 3 digits of the North Coordinate. 2nd,
you must add the digits of the&lt;br/&gt;
 2nd year together, and subtract that number from the last 3 digits
of the West Coordinate. The Coordinates to work with are:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;N 40 42.256&lt;br/&gt;
 W 082 49.179&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you do your math, hop in your car and drive a couple of
miles to the final location. You will find a small loc-n-loc
container with room for small trades.&lt;br/&gt;
 Please rehide as found, and BYOP. Take some time to pay tribute to
those who have served our nation at the 1st stage, and please post
your pictures near this &quot;patriotic&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
 location.&lt;/p&gt;

THIS CACHE IS NOT AT THE LISTED COORDINATES. INSTEAD, SOLVE THE
PUZZLE BELOW TO FIND THE COORDINATES OF THE CACHE!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not your typical puzzle. I
wanted people to understand a little bit about the history of
Galion, so what better way than with a Crossword Puzzle! Instead of
solving some hard problems, you have a few simple tasks. The tasks
will be below each of the Puzzles headers. Have fun, and learn
something about Galion's History! The final is a camo'd ammo can,
stuffed full of goodies. Please re-hide as found as this is a high
muggle area! Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MAIN PUZZLE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer the questions below, and fill
in the Main Puzzle with those answers. I have provided links at the
bottom of this puzzle for you to find your answers. Take some time
to study the webpages, as you might learn a thing or two about the
area you are going to visit. &lt;b&gt;*NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; This puzzle will NOT
print, so you must write down your answers on a sheet of paper and
transfer to Puzzle 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In keeping with tradition of last year, I have
placed this cache for my 30th birthday. I have grown up in Galion
all 30 years, so Zero to Thirty seemed fitting. The other part is a
no brainer :) Anyways, easy find. A 2 difficulty because for
vertically challenged people this one might be a little more
difficult. Quick P&amp;G for most. BYOP as there is not room. See
you along the caching trail!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Please do not park in front of Education Open Area gates, instead
use the parking coordinates listed. Park at Main Parking area N40
48.656 \ W082 01.410. Wooster Memorial Park has very nice walking
trails of several levels of difficulty. You are looking for the red
trail loop that traverses the upper portion of the park. There are
two ways to use in order to get to the cache off the loop. Our
recommendation is to take the red trail to the right, or East
through the park. This trail will take you up and around the best
and most scenic views of the area. However, if you are looking for
a reasonably fast find, then go the opposite direction on the red
trail. Be prepared to cross the creek in several locations and
steep inclines as well. There are a few walk over bridges but most
of the creek crossing is by way of makeshift crossings. It is a
very relaxing area after a hike of this type. Signal strength in
the final cache area should not be a problem as there is a full
view of the sky. Please help keep this area as clean and pristine
as possible, and carry any trash out that you see. Be certain to
completely close the container as well. Thanks.</groundspeak:long_description>

I chose this particular site for our first geocache for several reasons. I've had a special interest in trains all my life. My dad was employed with the former Nickel Plate Railroad and Norfolk and Western Railroad for 41 years, retiring in May 1983 as a Chief Clerk. My brother has been with the Railroad 35 years (since 1972) presently as a Yard Master. Even I was employed as a clerk in my twenties for nearly eight years.

As for the Mad River and NKP Railroad Society/Museum I have been an active volunteer member for 34 years-since 1973 and most of the years as a Board Member/Officer; as a Golden Life Member since 1984.

The cache contains a log sheet, pencil and several small trinkets.

The day started off nice enough, weather looked like it was going to hold up, so off we go heading west. We managed to make pretty quick work of this one and then get back on our way for the next cache. Nice to see all the trains nearby and nice area for a cache. TNLNSL. TFTC!!!</groundspeak:text>

We most of these caches in our sights when we came out a few months back to do the LoCo CITO event, but due to time constraints we never made it as far out as we wanted, so we decided today was the day :) Man we made this really harder than it had to be - found a shorter way back in to the cache location once we were AT the cache location but we enjoyed the nice walk back to the spot  and managed to make pretty quick work of this one, and get back in the car and head off for the next cache.

&lt;br/&gt;
Located in a small park on the shores of Lake Erie. There is a
small playground for me and an observation deck for my dad. Terrain
is rated a 2 because area can be slippery when
wet. Small container with log and room for small trades.
Sorry BYOP.&lt;br/&gt;

Original contents:&lt;br/&gt;
Barbie super ball&lt;br/&gt;
Alligator&lt;br/&gt;
Deck of cards&lt;br/&gt;
Blue glass rock&lt;br/&gt;
Fishing lure (left by dad)&lt;br/&gt;

Would have put in more but no more room. Hope you have fun!&lt;br/&gt;

I searched anyway and I knew I was close (my GPS said I was 2 feet away!) Searched a bunch of spots and found nothing, I was about to claim it as a DNF and move on then I stepped back a little and saw it! The owner should know where I was standing when I saw 2 feet on my GPS, kind of funny!

Princess_K and I were out placing a cache for her troop and hunting
down a few new ones in the area. When we were walking back to the
truck we both spied this spot at the same time. We raced to the
truck to grab a container to make this spur of the moment hide. I
asked princess_k what we should call the cache and without
hesitation she said &quot;woodpecker.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
Container is a small PB jar. Enjoy the hunt!</groundspeak:long_description>
