This cache will require a bit of a climb in one of the best anchorages on the island.

Getting to this cache will take you near a brackish well built by fisherman 50 or so years ago.

There's great snorkeling, diving, and kayaking along the walls of the cove. Lots of Sally Lightfoot crabs, and various fish and bird species.

Cache is seeded with a heart figurine, and three neck keychains - BMW/Oracle, FJ Cruiser, and OpenSolaris.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache will require a 1/3 mile hike up the canyon in one of the best anchorages on the island.

Getting to this cache will take you past a brackish well built by fisherman 50 or so years ago as you hike up the canyon over large rocks and boulders. There's a couple of rocks which are extra physical in terms of climbing up. Once you find the cache, continue your hike up the canyon.

There's great snorkeling, diving, and kayaking along the walls of the cove. Lots of Sally Lightfoot crabs, and various fish and bird species.

Cache is seeded with polished rocks, bungee cord, thermometer, hear figurines, screwdriver, golf tee, army men, hotwheels, and a few other 'treasures'.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a neat little cove on Isla Partida. In addition to the cache, there's some decent exploring to be had here, like the old fish camp in a cave along the Northern cove of the bight. And there's good snorkling and diving along the Southern cove's wall.

Cache is a small tin and is seeded with a safety whistle and eyeglass cleaner cloth, not much room for much else. While there's a pencil end in the cache to sign the log, please bring our own pen in standard caching fashion.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
You will start this journey by entering the portal to be found at
N31 31.820 and W110 15.728. If you stand in just the right place,
the magic gates will allow you to pass. Finding yourself in a large
cavern filled with many wonders, you should find the answer
&quot;under&quot; Solutions. Is that not appropriate? As with all
solutions, not all the information is relevant. So please disregard
any zeros and anything that follows. Zeros never amount to
anything, anyway. EXCEPT Longitude degrees. &lt;br/&gt;
You will need to mix up two batches of cookies to enable you to
endure the challenge ahead of you of finding the cache.
 &lt;br/&gt;
The recipes for these cookies are as follows:  &lt;br/&gt;
A cup of Peach Butter, creamed until smooth, sift in one cup of
Corn Silk, add 1/8 tsp of Sugared Lime and then mix in 2 cups of
Candied Yam. Let this rest while you mix up the next batch of
cookie dough.  &lt;br/&gt;
The second cookie recipe is: Make a mixture of 2/3 cup Belgian
Cream and 1/3 cup Buttercup and set aside to infuse their flavors,
After the first two items have been ADDED TOGETHER, stir in 2 cups
of Raspberry Lemonade, a sprinkle of Sugared Lime and 1 crushed
Spearmint Stick. Mix these together in the order given.
 &lt;br/&gt;
With nourishment in hand, you are off to find the actual cache. Bon
Appetite?

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since moving to SE Arizona, I have been
missing my Nordic Goddesses caching team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;While none of us
actually have any Nordic blood ancestors, on a fun filled caching
day and in a moment of silliness, we named ourselves the Nordic
Goddesses. That was when we were all blondes (only our hairdressers
know for sure). This cache is for Charm and Snosrfpolo; cache on
ladies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We
have had many fun times hunting caches around the Pacific
Northwest. One of the highlights was the Mission 9: Tunnel of Light
by Project APE (maintained by Moun10Bike)
(GC1169)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We
are always on the hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gives a whole new meaning to the term fanny
pack.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hope you enjoy
the hunt and please remember to bring tweezers and a pen with you.
Oh, yes, you don't have to be blonde to look for this cache.
Always put back from whence it came.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I've moved the cache to the entrance on W Titan Drive, for free access to all.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an added bonus there are Bench Marks at the site, and several on W Titan Drive on the bridges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not State Trust Land, and you do need not a permit!  If you cross the cattle grate you may be trespassing or on AZ State Land.  To retrieve this you do not have to cross the grate!  If the neighbors are close do not show them where the cache is, since they have removed previous caches to cut down on the traffic.  They seem to like to patrol  their area frequently (or at least when other cachers visit)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congradulations to soulofall for FTF, and sorry you had to face the wrath of Brandy!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is just outside the retired Titan II (571-1) site.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please park on Sibyl road at the locked gate. Just a short walk south.  Cache is just along the road.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ed, a fellow cacher, and owner has cleaned up the area nicely, but still has some local partiers.  For access we can practice our CITO to help keep the area nice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is no longer on State Trust Land, and so you do not need a permit, unless you want to &quot;site see&quot;out side the inner fenced area.  The road and inner fenced area is private property,  Ed says you may walk down the road, but please don't go in the inner fenced area.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is not a particularly pretty area, but it's a convenient place to stop and rest on your quest for more difficult caches.  It's got a water fountain (STILL not hooked up yet), a waterfall, some grass, a bench and some silly trees nearby.  Being a lazy cacher, I placed this thing as close to my little house as possible, so I can keep an eye on it while Poo-Poo and I take our semi-daily walk on the nearby trail.  It's a busy, busy intersection, so stealth and safety are the watch words.  As of 16 Jun 09, the new container is a cammo'd match container. Be sure to check the updated coords: N32 23.706, W110 59.722.  I hope you all enjoy the Oro Valley trails as much as we do!

We had a wonderful time around Tucson and Phoenix. Found several well crafted hides, some challenging finds and others that were nothing more than a LPC. Kudos to those that actually put a little more work into your hides as we really enjoyed those with a little extra touch. TFTH</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Why do you cache?  Is it the thrill of the hunt, the excitement of finding the most hides in a day?  Is it the challenge of deciphering a puzzle or discovering a clever hiding place?  Well this isn't the cache for you!  This one is easy, and it reflects my primary reason for geocaching.

I love to discover new and beautiful sights wherever I travel.  That little-used park in Grand Rapids or that hidden pond in Greensboro gives me a thrill when I'm taken there by my GPS hound dog searching for a cache.  Oro Valley is no different from any other city in the country when it comes to little known gems hidden amongst the trappings of civilization.  

If you take wonder in the small beauties along the way, this cache is for you.  After the 30 seconds it takes you to find this cache, take a moment and appreciate the man-made beauty it is hidden next to.  If you have a couple of minutes, go 50 feet east and sit down on the bench and enjoy the natural beauty of our beloved OV.

My wife Poo-Poo and I love to use this bikeway to go to and from the nearby park.  Yeah, the traffic can be busy and stinky and noisy, but there are times early in the morning or late in the evening that this little trail can be inspirational.  Get out and try it sometime.

The container is a small plastic Tupperware jar suitable for small trade items.  It is sloppily wrapped in cammo tape and initially contains a whistle, dog tags, a Manitoba pin, log book and mini log pen.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The idea for this cache came to me after Poo-Poo and I visited Kitty Hawk, NC in October 2006. The Wright brothers were the first guys to have the &quot;right stuff!&quot; The monument there is a must-see for everyone who loves flying. Aerocache II is a small water-proof container in cammo tape.  Initial contents include a log and log pen and flying-related swag.The cache is located near a wash next to West Lambert Park.  You may park there and bag some other caches, then taxi on over to the Aerocache area.  For you earthbound travelers, please be careful of the nearby wash that has a steep four foot drop.  Oh yeah, one more thing--please return the cache to it's nest just like you found it (this bird needs to fly!)The &quot;aerocache&quot; idea may directly contradict the spirit of &quot;geo&quot; caching, but I think you will enjoy the change in perspective. Our romance with the sky is reflected in my favorite poem, by John Gillespie McGee, Jr.High FlightOh, I have slipped the surly bonds of earthAnd danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings.Sunward I’ve climbed and joined the tumbling mirthOf sun-split clouds—and done a hundred thingsYou have not dreamed of—wheeled and soared and swungHigh in the sunlit silence. Hov’ring there,I’ve chased the shouting wind along and flungMy eager craft through footless halls of air,Up, up the long, delirious, burning blueI’ve topped the windswept heights with easy graceWhere never lark or even eagle flew.And, while with silent, lifting mind I’ve trodThe high, untrespassed sanctity of space,Put out my hand and touched the face of God.John Gillespie McGee, Jr. was an 18-year-old American when he went to Britain in October 1940, during World War II, and joined the Royal Canadian Air Force. He flew in a Spitfire squadron and was killed at age 19, on December 11, 1941, during a training flight from the airfield near Scopwick, Lincolnshire.The poem was written on the back of a letter to his parents which stated, “I am enclosing a verse I wrote the other day. It started at 30,000 feet, and was finished soon after I landed.”

14 July 09:  Whew, is it hot out there! Do you know airplanes can't fly when it's hotter than about 120 degrees?  It's not because they will fall out of the sky, it's because the take off and landing data only goes up to 50 degrees C, or 120 degrees F.  Anyway, coords reflect an updated location, 150' north, since the original place was &quot;grounded.&quot;

24 Aug 10:  This jet has been high maintenance.  For now, it will have a more standard configuration to keep it in service.

This cache brought us to a very quiet spot where we took time to have lunch [8D].
The cache itself was rapidly located ... on the ground at the base of a tree. Not sure it was supposed to be installed this way.

This one is located in a small forest of LP's in a semi-developed Oro Valley strip mall.  It is log only, and bring your own pen please.  If you add this one to your hunt, you should be guaranteed of at least one find for the day.

Long live the LPC! (and replace it EXACTLY how you found it)

But this is a family oriented activity, and as you approach the cache area, it looks more like it's current title.  The closest place to park is located at N32 24.034 W 110 58.072.  I'm surprised more caches haven't been placed along this road, since it's a really nice place to walk, run, bike, and even drive.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I literally stumbled across this location while biking around town one day.  It's one of those places in Oro Valley that is very close and accessible to all the necessities of life, yet lifts you above all the hustle and bustle associated with civilization.  It takes you to a place where you can soar above the noise and complications of life and see all the wonderful views our town has to offer.  

It reminds me of why I fly airplanes.  I'm not intrigued by loops and rolls, or by the thrill of speed and power.  I just enjoy the view.  I love the perspective that only 30 thousand feet can give you.

You won't be that high when you reach the cache, of course, but the area still captures the same feeling of being &quot;above it all.&quot;

The container is a cammo'd plastic peanut butter jar.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Steam Pump Ranch has been operating in the heart of Oro Valley since 1874. George Pusch, a German immigrant whose name was given to the nearby ridge, settled in the area and established a cattle ranch. To provide a consistent source of water for his herd, Pusch dug a well and powered it with a steam pump imported from Germany. This pump was unique because it was one of only two in the Arizona Territory. 

The Ranch soon became a popular watering hole and stagecoach stopping point and soon took on the name we know today.  In 1933, the Ranch was sold to Jack Procter, owner of the Pioneer Hotel in Tucson. He used it as a family retreat from the city. His grandson, John Leiber, lived there for many years until the 15 acre property was acquired by the Town of Oro Valley in 2007.

This area is quickly being developed with extensive retail and dining facilities.  The city had the foresight to install this quaint little park before too much of the acreage became overgrown with buildings and parking lots.

I wonder what the old cattle rancher would think of his land going the way of tar, brick and mortar.  I would venture to say that he would not be too happy!  Perhaps he still haunts the wash, eternally in search of a lost calf!

I am sure there are many of you who know a lot more about this ranch.  Feel free to add your stories about it in your log.

Now on to the cache.  Yup, it's a multi, but an easy, two-stage one.  

13 Apr 09:  The ghosts muggled the 1st stage twice so far.  It's either that or curious kids.  I vote for the ghosts.  Anyway, when you get to the first stage, answer these questions to get the coords for the second.  Yeah, I hate the arithmetic too, so I hid the coords somewhere on the object at the first stage.  But if you can't find them, or the ghosts took off with them again, here's how to find the 2nd stage coords.  Find a year on the object at the first stage.  The year is on 2 places, doubling your chances! The new north coords are 32 24.(year minus 1472).  For the new west coords, count the number of flour sacks in the object = X.  The new west coords are 110 57.0X0.  See, not too difficult!  The point of this multi is to take you from one pretty place to another one that's not too far away.  

The second and final stage  is a regular-sized plastic waterproof container.  Enjoy the area and watch out for ghosts!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We can't decide if this beautiful beast is a coyote or a wolf.  The artist gives us no clue with a plaque or description.  I'm sure if we went across the street and did a little research, we could quickly find the answer.  But I know there are a LOT of smart people here in Oro Valley.  I'm sure many of you can discern the difference between the two species and enlighten us all!  Please give us your opinion when you log the find.

As of 8/6/08, here's the tally:

             Coyote: 36
               Wolf: 19
No/Wise Alec answer: too many to care about

We had a wonderful time around Tucson and Phoenix. Found several well crafted hides, some challenging finds and others that were nothing more than a LPC. Kudos to those that actually put a little more work into your hides as we really enjoyed those with a little extra touch. TFTH</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">My wife Pooh-Pooh and I were checking out the progress of the new mall the other day.  We were specifically interested in how far the developer has laid asphalt for a walking/running/geocaching path adjacent to the mall.  To our dismay, the southern portion stopped just about where the cache is.  Right now there is no connection between this path and the one that runs behind steampump village to the south.  Perhaps there are plans to cross the wash some time in the future.  For now, this is a great place for a cache.  There are no muggles, and the cache area is a great place to catch some shade. 

As I was looking around the area, I flushed a hawk from its spot in the tree.  It's always a beautiful sight to see these things flying!

The cache is a medium gatorade jar painted black.  the rest is up to you!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As residents of Oro Valley, Pooh-Pooh and I have been closely watching construction of a section of La Canada road between Naranja and Tangerine.  It's quite an improvement over the old road.  It now includes four lanes for traffic, as well as a multiuse path on each side.   After two years or so, it's finally finished!  We were happy to see our taxpayer dollars going toward construction of a beautiful wall with metal sculpture inserts.  I believe the purpose of this wall is to prevent nearby golfers from using the Oro Valley Post Office as the fourth hole.

Here's what an article in the 9 Jan 08 AZ Daily Star said about the wall:

&quot;La Canada wall a thing of beauty.  A new wall along a stretch of North La Canada Road served as a canvas for local artist Matthew Moutafis.  For him, the wall wasn't just about keeping errant golf balls inside the Hilton Tucson El Conquistador Golf &amp; Tennis Resort.  It was about creating a wall that residents wouldn't mind having in their neighborhood.  &quot;People who live here have to look at it every day,&quot; he said of the 8-foot-high, 1,200-foot-long wall between West Naranja and West Tangerine roads.  The wall, made of masonry slump block, is divided into three segments and encrusted with 176 steel yuccas, saguaros, prickly pear cacti, and other art pieces reflective of the southwest...&quot;

The cache is a micro container 1 inch long and 1/4 inch in diameter.  Accuracy was 5.7 feet with a Garmin GPSMap 60.  I will change it to a larger container when all the construction and landscaping is completed. I just wanted to bring you to another pretty place in Oro Valley, and recognize the fine efforts of a local artist.  It's a cryin' shame that it has already been &quot;tagged&quot; by hoodlums.   Park on Crystal Vision Road, N32 24.778, W110 59.756, and the cache is a short distance away.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">If you have lived in the &quot;OV&quot; for a while, you may have noticed beautiful sculptures and artwork scattered amongst the newly developed commercial areas around town.  The strip mall on the Southwest corner of Naranja and 1st has some great examples.  Oro Valley Marketplace has some too (hint, hint).  Do you think the developers of these sites put them there because of their generous appreciation of the arts?  Maybe, but I don't think so.  One person is primarily responsible for making your next visit to Walgreen's a more pleasant experience, Mr Dick Eggerding.  I learned about Mr Eggerding and his work from an article in Oro Valley Magazine, November 2009.  Here is the text from that article:

DICK EGGERDING By Dave Califano  Photography By Jennifer Polixenni Brankin

At 76, Dick Eggerding has been a lot of things to a lot of people; high school sweetheart and husband, father of two, grandfather, military serviceman, Washington University graduate, professional opera singer, president and chair of a major southeastern insurance company, cancer survivor, arts activist and lover. 

Born in 1933, Eggerding was reared by a single mother — his father died when he was just 2 years old — during the Great Depression and World War II, at which time he collected scrap iron and sold savings stamps for the war effort. By age 14, his love affair of the arts was fully rooted when he started performing in school plays and local productions. By 21, he had graduated from university and married.
 
In 1988, after a career in insurance, Eggerding and his wife, Marjorie, retired in Oro Valley. “We were living in Scottsdale and wanted to retire there,” he explains. “Then we came down Highway 79 and we got to that first panoramic view and were like ‘Wow, look at that!’ We’ve been in love with Oro Valley ever since.” 
 
At this point in the story, you would expect Eggerding to have settled into a life of golf, dinner parties and reading, but you would be severely mistaken. Since landing in Oro Valley Eggerding has co-founded the Greater Oro Valley Arts Council, established the Oro Valley Public Art Code and the 1% for Public Art funding and the Oro Valley Community Foundation. He’s also served on numerous boards, task forces and the like. I sat down with Eggerding over some pasta, or as the waitress playfully joked “some ravioli with your cheese again,” to talk about the state of arts in the region.

OVM: How did you get involved in the Oro Valley arts community?
 
DE: Back in 1994, I was chair of the so-called Arts Advisory Board. My partner, Bob Weede, and I contracted with the Arizona Commission on the Arts to do a cultural assessment for the town. In that they made several recommendations of what the community can and should do and one was to create a non-profit arts organization. The other was to have a Percent for Art ordinance. So if there is construction by commercial or the town there should be a percentage for art. 
That same year was the beginning of the general plan for the town. There was nobody on the board but me who represented the arts. So I wrote up the entire section of the general plan on arts and culture and as part of it I threw in all of the stuff from the assessment. 

OVM: Did you meet with any opposition?

DE: I used politics for the arts; I never used arts to be a politician. And people accused me of that. I had to live that down for about two years. Everybody thought I was doing all of this because I was going to run for office. That’s not why I did it. I did it because of my passion. 

OVM:There is no denying that you have passion.

DE: I am not a joiner. I am a volunteer entrepreneur. I like to start things, like the arts council (GOVAC), the 1% for Public Arts, the Historical Society, the [Oro Valley] Community Foundation. I enjoy the challenge.

OVM: You co-founded GOVAC. How did that come about?

DE: In 1996, Bob Weede and I formed a 501(c)(3) called the Greater Oro Valley Arts Council. It took us a year to get the thing through the IRS. In December 1997 the Arts Advisory Board, en masse, all resigned and became the board of GOVAC. We took a risk and I got the board to designate GOVAC as the designated arts organization and it was put in the general plan and is in the general plan today.

OVM: You created the 1% for Public Art ordinance too. How did that happen?

DE: In 1995, I wrote a letter to the mayor and council saying that the general plan indicated that we should have a 1% for Public Art ordinance. The mayor appointed me to work on it. The developers were up in arms. I finally convinced them, “You can write it off and you will be leaving something behind for the town and you’ll be revered for it. The very first project was the ballroom revision at the [Hilton] El Conquistador. If you go over there you will see a huge ram. That was the very first project under the ordinance. It cost $35,000.

OVM: GOVAC recently changed its name to Southern Arizona Arts &amp; Cultural Alliance, and also its mission. What are your thoughts about that?

DE: Times change and organizations have to adjust to those changes. I think the organization, under the circumstances of the economy is doing what ever they can do to survive. 
The actual constituency for the arts hasn’t changed and that is the important part. I do believe that the Alliance is on the right track in today’s conditions. They’ve diversified and that’s good. The real problem is everything local is suffering. If I could make an appeal, my appeal to Oro Valley is to get out and support the Alliance. 

OVM: You’ve done so much for the community, you must be very proud? 

DE: I revel in the success. I get up in the morning and I drive down Rancho Vistoso and I see the public art. I go to the hospital and see the art there. I have a beautiful day every time I get up because the arts are there. I am extraordinarily proud of the public art. 

OVM: What do you see for the future?

DE: The country is in the throes of something huge and nobody knows where it’s going. Art will survive. The infrastructure of the city is like the heart but arts are the soul.
For information about local arts and cultural events, visit SAACA.org.

Now, on to the cache!  It's a 1.5 inch long tube, bring your own pen and tweezers.  It is an easy find, with a real spoiler of a hint.  My point is to make this cache as easy as possible to find. The goal is to take you to a place where you can appreciate the effort of Mr Dick Eggerding.  The area is very seldom used, so you will probably have the walkway to yourself.  Parking is very near and the cache is wheelchair accessible. Thank you Dick Eggerding!

We were camping in the area again and had to place another cache for future generations. This is near the Goblin Valley Utah State Park and is a great area to camp, hike and explore. There are many roads that with the right vehicle can really be fun.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
We spent three days here and hiked over 15 miles in different areas. We hiked Crack Canyon, Window with a View!, Ding and Dang Canyon, and of course, Goblin Valley itself and surrounding areas.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This is BLM land, but please be respectful to the environment so that we can enjoy this area for years to come. Stay on the defined roads and don't chase the lizards. Their tails fall off.

We took the family down to Goblin Valley over UEA. I have no idea what UEA stands for except the fact that my kids get out of school for two days. So, we headed down to Goblin Valley. This is probably our favorite family spot. At least it has been this year.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The geocache that you are looking for can be found within a clump of bushes.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
If you are feeling adventurous, you can get within 100 feet from this cache by driving down the wash which you can enter from the main dirt road.  Kinda a fun drive.  It keeps going and going and going.</groundspeak:long_description>

We were out camping. This was our second time at this spot this year. As we were exploring the first time, we came across this container and opened it up. IT WAS A GEOCACHE!!! That was way back in April of 2010. Wait a minute. I know I loaded all the geocaches into my GPS for this area but couldn't find the information to log that I have found it. So I waited and waited. I came back here six months later and the cache was still there. And still, I can't mark it as found. It was a good hiding spot, so I am publishing it.

I hope you enjoy the area. We sure did.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This is a pretty easy find, me and my 9 year old hiked up here. The view was pretty cool too.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
We took UEA weekend and spent a few days in the Goblin Valley area. We had a great time. We were able to come in on a Thursday and pretty much pick any campsite we wanted. This is one of the better ones.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
While we were here, we went to the Valley of the Goblins and hiked around to a cave that you can only get to from the outside. And then we spent a day in Wild Horse Canyon. We call them the Narrows. There was to many people for my taste. This weekend was probably the busiest I have seen it. Overall, it was a good weekend.

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
We were camping on the outskirts of Goblin Valley and wanted to share part of our hikes. You still have to pay the $7 to park, but instead of going into the valley itself, hike around towards the east on the outside. It is about 2 miles round trip. You have been warned that this is on the outside and cannot be found from the inside of the valley.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
You may want to bring a flashlight. It may add to the fun.

UPDATED: 10/18/2010&lt;br/&gt;
I went back out again last weekend to make sure the cache was OK. I got some updated coordinates. The following coordinates are the original that I got. Use them as a reference.

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The cache is outside the cave. If you were standing at the entrance looking in you are about 5-10 feet away. There will be a big rock on your left.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache was placed near our campsite on Easter weekend 2010. It is on BLM land. Please be respectful of the environment so that we can enjoy this area for many years to come. Only drive on designated roads. The cache is a peanut butter jar. It is big enough for trade items. The terrain is pretty level until you get within 10 feet of the cache. If a fat guy like me can get up there so can pretty much everybody else.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is located near Goblin Valley where you can find restrooms and drinking water. It took us about 4 hours travel time from Salt Lake City, Utah pulling a trailer. Goblin Valley is a stake park and has a $7.00 entrance fee for the each car per day. There is a campground that is usually full. We camp of the dirt road outside of the park to the west. There are plenty of roads to explore for the off-road enthusiast.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I noticed in the bathroom at the Goblin Valley visitors center that the lizards should not be chased because their tails fall off. It seems there tail is needed to store body fat used for foot and helps them escape from predators. So don't chase or catch the lizards.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
There are a couple of 'Narrows' or 'Slots' to explore nearby that are free and easily accessible with a car.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Inside the park, there is a cave that is pretty cool. From inside Goblin Valley, you have to repel into the cave. If you want to get into the cave by walking, you have to walk around on the east side to get into it. We couldn't find it this trip from the inside, but have been to it multiple times.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a small cold water geyser. It's powered by CO2 trapped in the rocks deep under ground. Water from the nearby San Rafel river seeps down into the rocks and dissolves the gas until there is enough pressure to push the water out.  It erupts about every two hours for about 20 minutes, so it is fairly easy to catch.

It is a long dirt road to get here from Green River and may not be passenger car friendly depending on weather. Cell service is spotty.

This is the site of the old Chaffin Ranch, I believe the geyser resulted from an attempt to drill a water well. </groundspeak:long_description>

--Not for the Weak At Heart--&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Seven tree spirits will light the way,&lt;br/&gt;
but only after the end of day.&lt;br/&gt;
They will guide you to what you seek,&lt;br/&gt;
but be warned the journey is not for the meek.&lt;br/&gt;
When the seventh spirit has been found,&lt;br/&gt;
then the treasure is close around.&lt;br/&gt;
Beware the eight spirit who guards the chest,&lt;br/&gt;
for he is not friendly like the rest.&lt;br/&gt;
His eyes glow a ghastly red,&lt;br/&gt;
and those who see them soon fall dead.&lt;br/&gt;
To claim the treasure, make no sound,&lt;br/&gt;
for this is his hallowed ground.&lt;br/&gt;
Be warned again to stay away,&lt;br/&gt;
that you may live to see another day! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
No flashlight is needed for this journey, however, its a good idea to have one so you can safely light your way as you walk.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Stand at the start point and look for a light coming from a tree. Go to that tree and walk around it until you see another light. The end is where the seventh spirit is.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I was hiking up here a while back and noticed this ridge had lots of pinyon on it, so I scurried up to see if there were any nuts.  Sure enough, there were.  I was lucky that I had a cache container in my pack as I found a good spot for one.  Enjoy!  BP

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">One of my favorite websites is the Utah Department of Transportation road conditions site.  It is extremely useful when I am trying to decide if I want to go after a new cache somewhere because I can look at the webcam and see the actual road conditions.  There is one of the UDOT webcams located very near this cache and it points at the Freedom Bridge over a leg of Starvation Lake.  Of all the webcams I look at, this one always seems to be sunny - except at night.  Too bad that UDOT doesn't show the wind speed, because that little propeller on the weather station is always turning quite fast when I drive by here.

There is good parking just east of the cache on the south side of Highway 40.  There is no need to walk along the highway, you can stay behind the guard rail all the way to the cache.  Enjoy and smile, I might be looking at the webcam when you are there!  BP

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Three billy goats live on one side of a stream. They look at the grass on the other side of the stream and decide that it is greener. The only way to cross the stream is over a bridge, under which lives a troll. The three goats cross the bridge one at a time, from the smallest to the largest. The first two goats are confronted by the troll, but persuade him to let them go by telling him that they are smaller than the next goat and will make an inferior meal. When the third goat crosses the bridge, the troll attempts to capture it. The troll is powerless against the strength of the Big Billy Goat Gruff, who easily butts the troll high into the air and into the deep, fast-flowing river, where it drowns. The three goats are then free to eat the delicious grass on the other side of the river, and to cross the bridge any time.

In our clan, there are many answers for that debate, however, we all know that you must have at least two olives.  This cache will not help answer the question, but it should vex you for a short while.  By the way, it is not in a sprinkler so leave 'em alone.

The terrain is a pretty rugged walking path .03 Miles up from the Provo River Falls viewing area. The path follows the provo river with great views and swimming holes. The cache can be found about 150 feet off the path to provide some cover from the muggles. 

 The cache is an ammo can filled with a few coosh balls, a woopie cushion, silly puddy, 10 glow sticks, and some plastic firemen.

This is one of our families favorite places and wanted to put a fun cache near our favorite swimming hole. Hopefully the hint make the find less difficult.</groundspeak:long_description>

Lone Star geyser is located along the Firehole River in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.

The Lone Star Geyser erupts from a 12 foot cone to heights of 35 feet. Several small eruptions occur before the main eruption, 15 to 20 minutes later. There is a three-hour interval between eruptions. In a box near the geyser is a logbook to record what you see and to check when the last eruption occurred and what type it was.

&lt;b&gt;Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;
Level and flat, partially paved trail with some hard-packed dirt. It is one of the few trails within Yellowstone National Park which allows bicycles.

&lt;b&gt;Logging Requirements --&lt;/b&gt;
To log this Virtual, keep track of the mileage from the trailhead to the geyser. At the geyser, find the date on the information plaque and divide that number by the distance you have travelled from the trailhead (round to the nearest .10 of a mile). The sum will give you the answer needed to enter as the Code Phrase. 

&lt;b&gt;Other Information --&lt;/b&gt;
- This is a Virtual lisiting, there is no container hidden at the posted coordinates. 
- This location is on property managed by the US National Park Service.
- This is an opencaching.com only listing.

Old Faithful geyser is an icon of the US National Park System, and is located in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.

&quot;Old Faithful&quot; was the first geyser to be named within Yellowstone National Park. Given such name on September 18, 1870 by the members of the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition, whose purpose was to make detailed maps and observations of the Yellowstone region, explore its numerous lakes, climb the summits of its mountains and observe the wildlife.

This cone geyser shoots 3,700 to 8,400 US gallons (14,000 to 32,000 l) of boiling water to a height of 106 to 185 feet (32 to 56 m), lasting from 1.5 to 5 minutes. And, while not the largest geyser in the park, it draws more crowds than any other; due in part to its ease of access, but also because of its small eruption window and high frequency. The reliability of Old Faithful can be attributed to the fact that it is not connected to any other thermal features of the Upper Geyser Basin.

While there is no definitive way to determine exactly when Old Faithful will erupt, the most commonly used method for prediction, with a margin of error of 10 minutes, is that the geyser will erupt 65 minutes after an eruption lasting less than 2.5 minutes or 91 minutes after an eruption lasting more than 2.5 minutes.

&lt;b&gt;Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;
Paved sidewalks and wooden boardwalks. Stay on either to be safe. 

&lt;b&gt;Logging Requirements --&lt;/b&gt;
To log this Virtual, count the number of benches along the boardwalk which serves as the viewing platform for Old Faithful geyser. From this total, subtract the number of those benches which are reserved and designated for people with mobility disabilities. Enter the difference as the Code Phrase.

We counted every single bench, but it was a bit confusing because the grouping of benches with 2 immediately adjacent could almost lead on to believe that it was just one bench.  We were shocked to see that NOT EVEN ONE of the benches was designated for handicap.  We looked for signs around the area and on the benches themselves.  Nothing!  Anyway, the pass phrase number does not work so I guess I can't log the FTF.</groundspeak:text>

The GPS was set up for IHT Stagging area, and off we went. No mojo, so it seemed like a good idea to quickly grab an Ammo Can in Town and get our errends done. No mojo, so time is ticking and the decision was made to grab &quot;Grumpy&quot;, considering that was the prevelent mood compounded by the fact the cache was near where we started, and the road was all tore up...

We were all a little &quot;Grumpy&quot; before finding this one to continue the streak.

We didn't have a lot time to cache today between work and teaching courses but we did stop by for this one on our way home from the 1st International Geocaching Day Meet &amp; Greet. Had a small bushwack and a bit of ground moisture but the bugs were not that bad.

Interesting hide. TNLNSL, thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

About the Lancaster The Avro Lancaster Mk X was the Canadian built
version of the British built Avro Lancaster B III, a later variant
of the RAF Bomber Command's original Avro Lancaster B1, the main
difference between the UK and Canadian aircraft was the use of
Canadian and American instrumentation and electrical components. A
total of 430 Avro Lancaster Mk X's were built by Victory Aircraft
in Malton, Ontario in the last three years of WW2, they were flown
to Britain unarmed across the Atlantic where they were armed before
becoming operational. It is note that the Royal Canadian Air-Force
(RCAF) continued to operate the Avro Lancaster in a variety of
roles until mid 1963.

How wrong can you be? The friend asked why Kung Foo Panda Poo, so we had to show him...in detail...

Ready to Find!
I checked last night and thought I had misplaced a Way-Point Marker.
As it turns out, I mistyped the coordinate into my GPS and found another Marker quite by chance.
Went out this morning and All Way-Point markers are in their proper places.
When if there is any doubt that you are finding these way-points in order, I've placed a number from 1 - 11 on the bottom of each marker, but after this morning I'm confident they are all in place.
Happy hunting and Please leave Markers hanging where you find them. :)</groundspeak:text>

raven cousins. Magpies flourished with, and then declined with the
great bison herds of earlier days. But these adaptable birds have
returned in numbers with cattle and people. Like all corvids the
Black-billed Magpie is an opportunistic omnivore hunting or
foraging for seeds, fruit, insects, carrion, eggs and occasionally
the nestlings of other birds. They enjoy suet, peanuts and other
treats at feeders, and are quick to exploit any pet food left
outdoors. The nest is a fortress-like domed structure of sticks
with one or two entrances, usually in a small tree or within
shrubbery. The nest cup is fortified with mud and soft materials.
As few as two, or as many as nine eggs are incubated for 14 to 23
days. Young are fledged in three or four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This uncommon woodpecker is a year round resident of the boreal
forest and mountain regions of Alberta. Dense, mature conifer
forests with burnt tree stands are essential to this woodpecker's
success. Like its cousin the American Three-toed Woodpecker, this
woodpecker forages by scaling bark from dead trees to find insects.
Seeds and fruit supplement their diet. It is unwary but may be hard
to spot since its dark back is well camouflaged against the burnt
trees on which it prefers to forage. A live tree with rotten
heartwood is the nesting site of choice. Black-backed Woodpecker
nests are excavated five to 15 feet high in the tree. Two to six
white eggs are laid. Both parents incubate the eggs for 14 days.
Young are fledged 15 days later.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

94 of 99.  Saw this one come up mid morning but did not have time to get out befor lunch time, fully expecting the other avid cachers to have found it already.  Nice little P&amp;G and another nice container.

And there was nothing left behind, wait a minute, yes there was, a TB for the STF (or others) to move along!

This largest of passerine birds can be found all year in the
mountains, foothills and boreal regions of Alberta. In the last few
decades they are becoming increasingly common in the parkland
region, especially in winter. Common Ravens are typically denizens
of the forests, but are becoming more common in urban areas,
especially around landfills in winter. Also look for them in the
parking lots of suburban malls at the edges of cities where edible
litter might be found. Like many omnivores, ravens are
opportunistic feeders taking seeds, fruit, eggs, nestlings of other
birds and any insects or small animals that they are skillful
enough to catch. Congregations of ravens are often seen scavenging
roadkills. Bulky nests are usually constructed on cliff edges, but
occasionally in trees or on buildings as well. These sturdy
constructions are made of branches and twigs, supplemented with
earth and lined with moss, bark shreds and other soft materials.
Three to five or more eggs may be laid and are incubated by the
female for 18 or 19 days. The young are fledged about six weeks
after hatching. </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">79 of 99. We stumbled on this cache &quot;GC2BV7F 99-day challenge - Calgary, Alberta&quot; and on a whim we decided to take up the challenge. Our start date was 30-Jul-11 and continues still. The downside is it is late in the year and as hockey spools up, the light gets shorter and the winter weather starts this will only increase in difficulty.

Glad to see this cache up and running. Up early and needed a cache to continue the streak and went out for the FTF. Apparently RJDJ reads their email and can see in the dark.... a clever hide and definitely not like the rest, great job.

American Crows can be found anywhere in the province, but are not
common in northern boreal forests where their niche is occupied by
ravens. In fall, crows form large aggregations called 'murders'.
These groups migrate out of the province and remain in large groups
for the winter. The crows return in smaller groups very early in
spring. Some crows in southern Alberta do not migrate. These
widespread black birds are common along forest edges, grasslands
and parklands as well as cities. As long as there are suitable
nest-building trees, it seems that crows can make a livelihood.
Like all corvids, American Crows are omnivores and will eat such
items as carrion, food scraps, seeds, fruit, insects, eggs and
other birds' nestlings. They will come to feeders, especially those
supplying whole peanuts. A mated pair builds their nest together
very high in a treetop. This bulky construction of branches and
twigs is supplemented with bark shreds and lined with soft
materials such as grass, moss or man-made materials. Four or five
eggs are laid and incubated for 18 days. The young are fledged
about five weeks after hatching.  </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;It is a very large and plump bird; its overall length is about
50–67 inches (130–170 cm), courtesy of the huge beak
which measures 13–14.4 inches (330–370 mm) in males and
10.4–13 in (260–330 mm) in females. It has a wingspan
of about 95–120 in (240–300 cm). Body weight can range
between 10 and 30 lb (4.5 and 14 kg), although typically these
birds average between 11 and 20 lb (5.0 and 9.1 kg). The plumage is
almost entirely bright white, except the black primary and
secondary remiges, which are hardly visible except in flight. From
early spring until after breeding has finished in mid-late summer,
the breast feathers have a yellowish hue. After moulting into the
eclipse plumage, the upper head often has a grey hue, as blackish
feathers grow between the small wispy white crest. The bill is long
and flat, with a large throat sac, and in the breeding season vivid
orange like the iris, the bare skin around the eye, and the feet.
In the breeding season, there is a laterally flattened &quot;horn&quot; on
the upper bill, about one-third the bill's length behind the tip.
This is shed off after the birds have mated and laid their eggs,
and outside the breeding season the bare parts become duller in
color, with the naked facial skin yellow and the bill, pouch and
feet an orangy-flesh color. Apart from the difference in size,
males and females look exactly alike. Immature birds have light
grey plumage with darker brownish nape and remiges. Their bare
parts are dull grey. Hatchlings are naked at first, then grow white
down feathers all over, before moulting to the immature
plumage.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Canada’s four CC-177 Globemaster III strategic airlifters
were delivered in 2007-2008. The CC-177 in Canada helps provide
everything from the rapid delivery of troops and cargo transport to
oversized combat equipment from coast to coast to coast and to
anywhere else worldwide. Rapid, reliable and flexible, the
strategic and tactical CC-177 is equipped with advanced digital
avionics, has a maximum range of approximately 5,500 nautical miles
and can carry a payload of up to 160,000 pounds (72, 727 kilograms)
due to its four engines (Pratt &amp; Whitney 2040 series) that
produce 40,440 pounds (18, 343 kilograms) of thrust. To illustrate
the power of these aircraft, one CC-177 can haul three CH-146
Griffon helicopters with refuelling tanks, or one Leopard 2 tank,
or as many as 102 paratroopers. But perhaps most useful of all, the
CC-177's ability to fly long distances and land in remote airfields
makes it a premier transporter for military, humanitarian and
peacekeeping missions. Only 12 days after entering service with the
Canadian Forces, Canada’s first CC-177 carried out its first
operational mission: the delivery of 30 metric tonnes (30,000
kilograms) of emergency relief supplies, collected by the Red Cross
and the Canadian International Development Agency, to the people of
Jamaica in the wake of Hurricane Dean. The CC-177 Globemaster III
is used for a wide range of strategic and tactical missions for
Canada’s Air Force and only requires a crew of three: pilot,
co-pilot and loadmaster. Pilots can fly the CC-177 wearing
night-vision goggles, which provides a significant tactical
advantage when flying into hostile territory. It can also take off
and land on unpaved runways as short as 1,067 metres (3,500 feet)
and as narrow as 27.4 metres (90 feet) by day or by night. The
CC-177 have been supporting Joint Task Force Afghanistan on
Operation Athena in Afghanistan. Since 2007, they have been
conducting regular sustainment flights from Canada with the
semi-annual rotation of troops in and out of Afghanistan operating
on the air bridge between Canada and Afghanistan. (See related web

The Osprey is a cosmopolitan species, occurring on all
continents except Antarctica. Endangered by DDT, Ospreys have made
a remarkable recovery since that pesticide was banned in the 1970s.
It is now, once again, a fairly common bird of the boreal forest
and foothills region of Alberta, probably absent only from the arid
southeastern part of the province, except during migration. Since
Ospreys catch fish, their only prey, they are always associated
with lakes or streams. At least two dozen pairs nest along the Bow
River, from Banff to Calgary. If not disturbed, they readily nest
within urban areas. In Calgary, at least seven pairs were resident
in 2004. The first birds arrive in mid-April. Most depart for more
tropical areas by the end of September, some going well into South
America. Osprey, usually flying about 30 m (100 feet) up, scan the
water for fish, their only food. They often hover in one spot for a
prolonged period before making a spectacular plunge dive, wings
raised, feet extended out front, to capture their prey. Sharp
talons and spiny soles ensure a good grip. Rising to the surface,
with a few flaps they again become airborne, then shaking to rid
themselves of excess water, continue flying. Shortly after, they
re-position the fish headfirst, to streamline their flight. Bald
Eagles often try to steal their prey. Sometimes they capture a fish
too large to carry. Unable to let go, they flap and drag the prey
to the shore. If it is a really large specimen, it may pull the
Osprey underwater, drowning it. Most of their prey fish are species
of little interest to man. Their nest, re-used year after year, is
a bulky structure. In the past, it usually was sited on a strong
branch or on the top of a broken tree, a cliff pinnacle or even on
the ground. In recent years, Ospreys have taken to using man-made
structures - utility poles, electrical or communication towers,
church steeples and nesting platforms especially erected for them.
The female does most of the incubating of the usually three eggs,
for 32 to 33 days; the male bringing her food at the nest site. She
broods and tends to the young for a further 30 days. They begin to
fly at 51 to 59 days of age, becoming independent within one week,
but remain near the nest for up to eight weeks.</groundspeak:long_description>

The magnificent Bald Eagle, the national symbol of the USA, was
almost exterminated by DDT in the 1950s and '60s. Since the use of
that pesticide was banned in 1972, Bald Eagles are once again being
seen where they have been absent for 40 years or more. These birds
are primarily associated with water; oceans, large lakes and
rivers. In Alberta, during the summer, they are most common in the
north and in the western foothills and mountains. At the onset of
winter, when waterways freeze-up, they move southward. During
migration, and sometimes in winter, they may be seen almost
anywhere in the province, particularly where waterfowl
concentrations occur. While primarily associated with pristine
wilderness areas, Bald Eagles are tolerant of the presence of man
if an assured food supply is available. As a result, in winter,
they mainly frequent open water such as at power generating
stations and major rivers in urban environments kept open by warm
water from sewage treatment plants. In December-January, it is
possible to see up to a dozen individuals along the Bow River
within Calgary. One pair has taken up year-round residency, now
nesting within the city. In 2002 and 2003, the nest was on the
Inglewood Golf Course. In 2004, presumably the same birds nested on
the west side of the Bow River, opposite Beaverdam Flats Park,
adjacent to the very busy Deerfoot Trail highway. This is the first
time in recorded history, perhaps the first time ever, that this
has happened. Previously the river would have frozen in winter and
fewer nest trees might have been available. Fish, alive or dead,
form the bulk of the eagle's food. The eagles often harass a
successful Osprey until it drops its catch. In migration and in
winter, they also feed on sick or injured ducks and geese and
carrion such as deer which escape from hunters but later die from
their wounds. Bald Eagles mate for life. They build a bulky stick
nest, usually near a waterway, in a large isolated tree or rarely
on a rocky outcrop, using it year after year. It is added to
annually, making it the largest nest of any North American bird.
This structure sometimes measures four metres deep and three metres
wide. Usually two white eggs are laid. Incubation is by both sexes
for 35 to 46 days. The young are tended by both parents and are
able to leave the nest at 10 to 11 weeks of age, returning to feed
and rest for several weeks afterwards. </groundspeak:long_description>

Ferruginous Hawks, the largest of Alberta's buteos, now
comparatively rare, is listed as an endangered species in Alberta,
primarily because of habitat loss. It occurs only in the
southeastern part of the province, in the grassland region. This
pale-coloured hawk is strictly a bird of the open grasslands,
almost never found near urban environments. The closest it comes to
humans is when it nest in the only available trees of a farm
shelterbelt. It winters from southern USA to central Mexico,
returning to Alberta by late March, and usually departing again
before September ends. Ferruginous Hawks prey mainly on ground
squirrels, jackrabbits and woodrats. It is a powerful bird with a
large gape (mouth). This hawk will make long flights in pursuit of
its prey, and is often observed on the ground awaiting the
re-appearance of a ground squirrel from its den. They are also
capable of catching birds, other mammals and snakes, all part of
their diet. The nest site most often is in the crotch of a small to
medium-sized tree, often the only one for kms around, usually 3-10
m (10-33 ft.) above the ground. They will also use a rock
outcropping, a steep slope, a man-made nest platform or nest on the
ground when no other site is available. If successful, the same
nest will be used year after year, becoming massive with the annual
addition of sticks, old bones and other material and lined with
vegetation, bark and livestock dung. They are aggressive, attacking
anything that nears the nest site. The three to five bluish white
eggs are laid, usually in April. Incubation is for about 28 days,
with the young fledging at about two months of age.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

The Peregrine Falcon is a cosmopolitan species, found on all
continents except Antarctica. The eastern North American population
was almost extirpated in the 1950s and '60s due to bio-accumulation
of the pesticide DDT, which caused thinning of eggshells, resulting
in egg breakage when brooding. With re-introductions, after DDT was
banned in USA and Canada in 1972, this noble falcon is again being
seen in most of its former range. Although still rare, chance
encounters may take place anywhere in Alberta during migration,
particularly along wetlands such as at Beaverhill Lake where
shorebirds and waterfowl offer an assured food supply. Nesting is
again taking place in Alberta, along the Red Deer River and in the
Lake Athabasca area. They also now nest within Calgary and Edmonton
on tall buildings which serve as pseudo-cliffs, their natural nest
sites. In Calgary, they nest downtown on the Telus building, and on
Craigie Hall at the University (not in 2004). Another nest is on
the tower of the gas plant at Balzac. A pair nested at Raven Rocks
in Fish Creek Prov. Park in 1996-97. By 2002, 23 pairs were known
to be nesting in Alberta, from Edmonton southward. Migrants begin
arriving in early April and depart by October. A few are
occasionally observed during the winter months. Birds make up most
of the Peregrine's diet. Many species are taken, with a high
percentage being shorebirds and waterfowl, particularly during
migration. Rock Pigeons are a mainstay in cities. On the prairies,
Franklin's Gulls are a frequent prey. Birds are captured in the air
in spectacular breath-taking stoops of up to 360 kph (200 mph).
Also consumed are some mice and insects. The natural nest site is a
ledge on a cliff or rocky outcrop, or occasionally on the top of a
hollow stump. In cities, a ledge on a tall-building is chosen. The
actual nest is merely a hollow scrape with nothing added. An
average of three to four eggs are laid, incubated by both sexes,
but mainly by the female, for about 28-30 days. She broods and
feeds them for the first two weeks, leaving them alone more after
that time to join in hunting. She still does most of the feeding,
but the male will do so when she is absent. The young begin to
exercise at 21 days, when they also begin to tear up their own
food. They fledge at 35-45 days after they hatch. The smaller males
are normally the first to fly. They remain near the nest site,
taking another six weeks to become fully independent, in time to
begin their autumn migration, going as far as northern South
America. </groundspeak:long_description>

We made a little detour and discoved a Brass Cap. Although it is not part of OFTH's famous Alberta Virtual Brass Cap Cache it is nice to discover them.

Out on the Iron Horse Trail the day before we saw a bird of prey like some of these sitting casually on the fence post as we drove by. I could have been the falcon or the hawk but the colouring was slightly different. Very impressive none the less.</groundspeak:text>

The large Great Gray Owl is resident all year across northern
Alberta south to Edmonton and along the mountains and foothills to
Calgary. It migrates sporadically in winter in response to prey
availability, along with northern hawk and boreal owls. This icon
of the deep woods is found in all types of forest where there are
brushy clearings and openings. Although large, the Great Gray is
quiet and discreet, it is usually concealed part way up a tree on a
horizontal branch where they are very well camouflaged against the
bark of the tree. It is a real treat to spot one of these
magnificent owls perched on a post or on top of a tree. The
formidable looking Great Gray Owl often hunts at dawn and dusk, and
lives almost exclusively on mice and voles. Snow cover does not
necessarily protect the furtive rodent. The Great Gray can locate a
vole by sound under eighteen inches of snow where it plunges
through to pluck out the hapless prey. The Great Gray Owl does not
build its own nest. Like other large owls, it uses old hawk, raven
or crow nests that are high above the ground. Three to five white
eggs are incubated for a month. Young are fledged in another
month.</groundspeak:long_description>
