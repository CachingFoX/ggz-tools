And there's good snorkling and diving along the Southern cove's wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a small tin and is seeded with a safety whistle and eyeglass cleaner cloth, not much room for much else. While there's a pencil end in the cache to sign the log, please bring our own pen in standard caching fashion.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
You will start this journey by entering the portal to be found at
N31 31.820 and W110 15.728. If you stand in just the right place,
the magic gates will allow you to pass. Finding yourself in a large
cavern filled with many wonders, you should find the answer
&quot;under&quot; Solutions. Is that not appropriate? As with all
solutions, not all the information is relevant. So please disregard
any zeros and anything that follows. Zeros never amount to
anything, anyway. EXCEPT Longitude degrees. &lt;br /&gt;
You will need to mix up two batches of cookies to enable you to
endure the challenge ahead of you of finding the cache.
 &lt;br /&gt;
The recipes for these cookies are as follows:  &lt;br /&gt;
A cup of Peach Butter, creamed until smooth, sift in one cup of
Corn Silk, add 1/8 tsp of Sugared Lime and then mix in 2 cups of
Candied Yam. Let this rest while you mix up the next batch of
cookie dough.  &lt;br /&gt;
The second cookie recipe is: Make a mixture of 2/3 cup Belgian
Cream and 1/3 cup Buttercup and set aside to infuse their flavors,
After the first two items have been ADDED TOGETHER, stir in 2 cups
of Raspberry Lemonade, a sprinkle of Sugared Lime and 1 crushed
Spearmint Stick. Mix these together in the order given.
 &lt;br /&gt;
With nourishment in hand, you are off to find the actual cache. Bon
Appetite?

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on by and earn a smiley. Just another quick cache in the
neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be gentle with the container so it will last and don't forget to
bring a writing instrument to sign the log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember one of the slogans from Rowan &amp; Martin's
Laugh-In? That's were I got the cache name. Laugh In is an American
sketch comedy television program which ran for 140 episodes from
January 22, 1968, to May 14, 1973. It was hosted by comedians Dan
Rowan and Dick Martin and was broadcast over NBC. It originally
aired as a one-time special on September 9, 1967 and was such a
success that it was brought back as a series, replacing The Man
from U.N.C.L.E. on Mondays at 8 pm (EST). The title of the show was
a play on the &quot;love-ins&quot; or &quot;be-ins&quot; of the 1960s hippie culture,
terms that were, in turn, derived from &quot;sit-ins&quot;, common in
protests associated with civil rights and anti-war demonstrations
of the time. In 2002, Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In was ranked #42
on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.[2] Info from
Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;

*I am sort of new to this, didn't look at the size rating. Going to go back tomorrow to put something a bit smaller in the cache, on account of the item I left being a bit too big for it.

**UPDATE - 6-2-12
Went to the cache this morning and replaced my left item with something smaller that would fit the size of the cache. TFTC World Traveler!</groundspeak:text>

We put some items in, and took nothing out, in hopes to keep the cache alive. We attempted to re-hide it in another spot, right next to its original hiding place, in hopes that it doesn't get trashed again. Cheers!</groundspeak:text>

We saw this spot while caching just down the street and thought WOW
we can plant one right here amongst the candy canes! We love those
candy canes with the red and white stripes and the peppermint
centers. We think you will love this easy find.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bring your own pen. This is another of our caches to feed the urge
of the local cachers and as a way of saying thanks for all the
great caches we've enjoyed. Cache on!&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
FTF honors go to Catdog3 for troubleshooting and testing my first
Chirp cache. Thanks for all the help!&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is named for Jeri (Snosrfpolo) because she made me do
it. Do not look for or open the chirp transmitter at the published
coordinates; it is not the cache; nor are the final coordinates
listed there. You will need a Chirp compatible device to hunt the
cache or request a hint from the cache owner for the final
coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No flora or fauna was hurt in the hiding of this cache. Please
approach from the river. Take the side trail at #5 towards the
river and follow the path south along the river until you get
nearer to the Chirp. Then you can go off trail, but there is no
bushwacking needed when using this approach. Let's not create a
geotrail from the west okay?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We think you will love this area. There is much to see and hear.
The Friends of the San Pedro have put together an excellent
educational outdoor experience. You can take a lunch and use the
provided covered picnic areas or just walk along the river and
enjoy the sites and sounds. We always see people here with cameras
with huge lenses to catch the birds in their natural habitat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bring your own pen and tweezers to retrieve the final container. Be
aware of muggles and PLEASE PLACE BACK AS FOUND. Cache on!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Origin of Slapstick from Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase comes from the batacchio or bataccio; called the
&quot;slap stick&quot; in English — a club-like&lt;br /&gt;
object composed of two wooden slats used in Commedia dell'arte.
When struck, the battacchio produces a loud smacking noise, though
little force is transferred from the object to the person being
struck. Actors may thus hit one another repeatedly with great
audible effect while causing very little actual physical damage. It
was among the earliest special effects. Don't forget to bring a
writing instrument to sign the log. Please use initials to save
room. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synesthesia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; from the
ancient Greek syn, &quot;together,&quot; and
aisthesis, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sensation&quot;&gt;sensation&lt;/a&gt;,&quot;
is a neurologically based condition in which stimulation of one
sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary
experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.   People who report such experiences
are known as synesthetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one common form of synesthesia,
known as color-graphemic synesthesia, letters or numbers are perceived as
inherently colored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this puzzle you will have to temporarily experience
synesthesia and convert some colors to
coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N  A° B.H&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = (C7 15 85) + (66 CD
AA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = (B8 86 0B) + (00 FA 9A) + (FF
00 00)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = (64 95 ED) + (7B 68 EE) + (DA
70 D6) + (F0 E6 8C) + (FA F0 E6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H = C * (FF FF
00)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D = (48 D1 CC) + (FD F5

This is a cache to honor those who have found 20 caches or more in cemeteries in Arizona. Hopefully, it will be the first of a series.
&lt;p&gt;The cache is at the location listed. The difficulty rating is for the amount of ground work that has to be done before you can search for the cache&lt;br /&gt;
I copied this idea from the cemetery challenges in Oregon and like the idea of challenge caches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The challenge:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) You must find 20 caches in cemeteries.&lt;br /&gt;
2) They must all be within the state of Arizona.&lt;br /&gt;
3) The geocaches in question could have been found at any time (i.e. they do not have to be found after the date this cache was activated).&lt;br /&gt;
4) Multi's, puzzles and virtuals count as long as at least one leg is a visit to a cemetery- just list which cemetery on your bookmark.&lt;br /&gt;
5) Lone graves also count for this challenge, ie. GC28QC5 Arizona Pioneer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The completion:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Create a bookmark with 20 caches on it This cache can be counted as one of the 20. Include the date the cache was found and what cemetery it is located in.&lt;br /&gt;
2) You must retain this bookmark for at least 90 days after finding the final.&lt;br /&gt;
3) Once you finish the challenge, you are free to seek the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like me to review your caches feel free to send me a note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not complete the challenge correctly your log maybe deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to think it goes without saying, but please remember to always act respectfully while in a cemetery looking for a cache. Cache placed with the kind permission of Cochise Memory Gardens.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since moving to SE Arizona, I have been
missing my Nordic Goddesses caching team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;While none of us
actually have any Nordic blood ancestors, on a fun filled caching
day and in a moment of silliness, we named ourselves the Nordic
Goddesses. That was when we were all blondes (only our hairdressers
know for sure). This cache is for Charm and Snosrfpolo; cache on
ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We
have had many fun times hunting caches around the Pacific
Northwest. One of the highlights was the Mission 9: Tunnel of Light
by Project APE (maintained by Moun10Bike)
(GC1169)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We
are always on the hunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gives a whole new meaning to the term fanny
pack.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hope you enjoy
the hunt and please remember to bring tweezers and a pen with you.
Oh, yes, you don't have to be blonde to look for this cache.
Always put back from whence it came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I've moved the cache to the entrance on W Titan Drive, for free access to all.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus there are Bench Marks at the site, and several on W Titan Drive on the bridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not State Trust Land, and you do need not a permit!  If you cross the cattle grate you may be trespassing or on AZ State Land.  To retrieve this you do not have to cross the grate!  If the neighbors are close do not show them where the cache is, since they have removed previous caches to cut down on the traffic.  They seem to like to patrol  their area frequently (or at least when other cachers visit)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congradulations to soulofall for FTF, and sorry you had to face the wrath of Brandy!

FTF logs before theirs are not guaranteed to survive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A State Land Trust permit is required. Passenger cars might make it if you can get through some sand patches.

I did not pass any locked gates or No Tresspassing signs to get here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Land is AZ State Trust, so you will need a permit, and is accessable thru AZ State Trust Land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Views are awsome from this hill, GOOD LUCK!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located at the top of Pusch Ridge off Linda Vista (Off Oracle road Rt77 tucson/oro valley) A standard blue topped tupperware container with a mix of odd items ranging from pens, a glow stick, Arizona magazines, to packaged camping food items. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hike to the top is normally around 1.5 - 2.5 hours depending on your conditioning and hiking abilities. The trail begins fairly normal but increases in difficulty as you progress. Best started in the early morning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During winter months bring long sleeve shirt and or small jacket plus snacks and 2-3 bottles of water. During summer months bring at least 5 bottles of water per person and salted snacks. There is at least one USGS marker at the top. From there head to the GPS geo cache coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is rattlesnake country so beware from spring to November. Although rattlesnakes do not 'attack' hikers they will defend themselves out of fear. Listen for the rattle(snake talk for 'back off I'm within 5-10ft of you') then slowly back away. Baby rattle snakes are more dangerous than adults supposedly. Owls come out at night. Bring flashlight if you start late. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do not take this trail if it is raining because of the steepness of some areas, but it doesn't rain that much in Arizona anyway. Head to the top first then search for the Geo Cache. Please note that the GPS coordinates are not down to the inch and If someone wants to register this on another sight feel free. (I put it on 'open cache' instead of 'geo cache' although its marked geo cache but if anyone wants to register it there feel free)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trail begins at Linda Vista (off of Oracle Road(rt 77)) at end of pavement in parking area and about a mile in at the rusty sign you head towards the peak. Very scenic at the top. And lots of cactus and desert wildlife to see along the way like Jack Rabbits, Rattle snakes (during summer evenings especially), Peregrine, (rare bobcats), rare Skunk, rare deer, Havalina, Saguaro cactus, Cholla cactus(bring tweezers!), Prickly pair cactus, Barrel Cactus, birds, and Owls at night and maybe once in a rare blue moon Big Horn Sheep.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GPS coordinates on this site list MT Lemmon but that peak is further off in the range about 20 miles in. This cache is Pusch Ridge Peak. Elevation about 5360ft. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is not a particularly pretty area, but it's a convenient place to stop and rest on your quest for more difficult caches.  It's got a water fountain (STILL not hooked up yet), a waterfall, some grass, a bench and some silly trees nearby.  Being a lazy cacher, I placed this thing as close to my little house as possible, so I can keep an eye on it while Poo-Poo and I take our semi-daily walk on the nearby trail.  It's a busy, busy intersection, so stealth and safety are the watch words.  As of 16 Jun 09, the new container is a cammo'd match container. Be sure to check the updated coords: N32 23.706, W110 59.722.  I hope you all enjoy the Oro Valley trails as much as we do! &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We had a wonderful time around Tucson and Phoenix. Found several well crafted hides, some challenging finds and others that were nothing more than a LPC. Kudos to those that actually put a little more work into your hides as we really enjoyed those with a little extra touch. TFTH</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Why do you cache?  Is it the thrill of the hunt, the excitement of finding the most hides in a day?  Is it the challenge of deciphering a puzzle or discovering a clever hiding place?  Well this isn't the cache for you!  This one is easy, and it reflects my primary reason for geocaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I love to discover new and beautiful sights wherever I travel.  That little-used park in Grand Rapids or that hidden pond in Greensboro gives me a thrill when I'm taken there by my GPS hound dog searching for a cache.  Oro Valley is no different from any other city in the country when it comes to little known gems hidden amongst the trappings of civilization.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you take wonder in the small beauties along the way, this cache is for you.  After the 30 seconds it takes you to find this cache, take a moment and appreciate the man-made beauty it is hidden next to.  If you have a couple of minutes, go 50 feet east and sit down on the bench and enjoy the natural beauty of our beloved OV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My wife Poo-Poo and I love to use this bikeway to go to and from the nearby park.  Yeah, the traffic can be busy and stinky and noisy, but there are times early in the morning or late in the evening that this little trail can be inspirational.  Get out and try it sometime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container is a small plastic Tupperware jar suitable for small trade items.  It is sloppily wrapped in cammo tape and initially contains a whistle, dog tags, a Manitoba pin, log book and mini log pen. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The idea for this cache came to me after Poo-Poo and I visited Kitty Hawk, NC in October 2006. The Wright brothers were the first guys to have the &quot;right stuff!&quot; The monument there is a must-see for everyone who loves flying. Aerocache II is a small water-proof container in cammo tape.  Initial contents include a log and log pen and flying-related swag.The cache is located near a wash next to West Lambert Park.  You may park there and bag some other caches, then taxi on over to the Aerocache area.  For you earthbound travelers, please be careful of the nearby wash that has a steep four foot drop.  Oh yeah, one more thing--please return the cache to it's nest just like you found it (this bird needs to fly!)The &quot;aerocache&quot; idea may directly contradict the spirit of &quot;geo&quot; caching, but I think you will enjoy the change in perspective. Our romance with the sky is reflected in my favorite poem, by John Gillespie McGee, Jr.High FlightOh, I have slipped the surly bonds of earthAnd danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings.Sunward I’ve climbed and joined the tumbling mirthOf sun-split clouds—and done a hundred thingsYou have not dreamed of—wheeled and soared and swungHigh in the sunlit silence. Hov’ring there,I’ve chased the shouting wind along and flungMy eager craft through footless halls of air,Up, up the long, delirious, burning blueI’ve topped the windswept heights with easy graceWhere never lark or even eagle flew.And, while with silent, lifting mind I’ve trodThe high, untrespassed sanctity of space,Put out my hand and touched the face of God.John Gillespie McGee, Jr. was an 18-year-old American when he went to Britain in October 1940, during World War II, and joined the Royal Canadian Air Force. He flew in a Spitfire squadron and was killed at age 19, on December 11, 1941, during a training flight from the airfield near Scopwick, Lincolnshire.The poem was written on the back of a letter to his parents which stated, “I am enclosing a verse I wrote the other day. It started at 30,000 feet, and was finished soon after I landed.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;14 July 09:  Whew, is it hot out there! Do you know airplanes can't fly when it's hotter than about 120 degrees?  It's not because they will fall out of the sky, it's because the take off and landing data only goes up to 50 degrees C, or 120 degrees F.  Anyway, coords reflect an updated location, 150' north, since the original place was &quot;grounded.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;24 Aug 10:  This jet has been high maintenance.  For now, it will have a more standard configuration to keep it in service. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache brought us to a very quiet spot where we took time to have lunch [8D].
The cache itself was rapidly located ... on the ground at the base of a tree. Not sure it was supposed to be installed this way.

We had a wonderful time around Tucson and Phoenix. Found several well crafted hides, some challenging finds and others that were nothing more than a LPC. Kudos to those that actually put a little more work into your hides as we really enjoyed those with a little extra touch. TFTH</groundspeak:text>

It's one of those places in Oro Valley that is very close and accessible to all the necessities of life, yet lifts you above all the hustle and bustle associated with civilization.  It takes you to a place where you can soar above the noise and complications of life and see all the wonderful views our town has to offer.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It reminds me of why I fly airplanes.  I'm not intrigued by loops and rolls, or by the thrill of speed and power.  I just enjoy the view.  I love the perspective that only 30 thousand feet can give you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You won't be that high when you reach the cache, of course, but the area still captures the same feeling of being &quot;above it all.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container is a cammo'd plastic peanut butter jar. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Steam Pump Ranch has been operating in the heart of Oro Valley since 1874. George Pusch, a German immigrant whose name was given to the nearby ridge, settled in the area and established a cattle ranch. To provide a consistent source of water for his herd, Pusch dug a well and powered it with a steam pump imported from Germany. This pump was unique because it was one of only two in the Arizona Territory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ranch soon became a popular watering hole and stagecoach stopping point and soon took on the name we know today.  In 1933, the Ranch was sold to Jack Procter, owner of the Pioneer Hotel in Tucson. He used it as a family retreat from the city. His grandson, John Leiber, lived there for many years until the 15 acre property was acquired by the Town of Oro Valley in 2007.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area is quickly being developed with extensive retail and dining facilities.  The city had the foresight to install this quaint little park before too much of the acreage became overgrown with buildings and parking lots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wonder what the old cattle rancher would think of his land going the way of tar, brick and mortar.  I would venture to say that he would not be too happy!  Perhaps he still haunts the wash, eternally in search of a lost calf!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am sure there are many of you who know a lot more about this ranch.  Feel free to add your stories about it in your log.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now on to the cache.  Yup, it's a multi, but an easy, two-stage one.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;13 Apr 09:  The ghosts muggled the 1st stage twice so far.  It's either that or curious kids.  I vote for the ghosts.  Anyway, when you get to the first stage, answer these questions to get the coords for the second.  Yeah, I hate the arithmetic too, so I hid the coords somewhere on the object at the first stage.  But if you can't find them, or the ghosts took off with them again, here's how to find the 2nd stage coords.  Find a year on the object at the first stage.  The year is on 2 places, doubling your chances! The new north coords are 32 24.(year minus 1472).  For the new west coords, count the number of flour sacks in the object = X.  The new west coords are 110 57.0X0.  See, not too difficult!  The point of this multi is to take you from one pretty place to another one that's not too far away.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second and final stage  is a regular-sized plastic waterproof container.  Enjoy the area and watch out for ghosts!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FS199W4 - Final Stage&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We were specifically interested in how far the developer has laid asphalt for a walking/running/geocaching path adjacent to the mall.  To our dismay, the southern portion stopped just about where the cache is.  Right now there is no connection between this path and the one that runs behind steampump village to the south.  Perhaps there are plans to cross the wash some time in the future.  For now, this is a great place for a cache.  There are no muggles, and the cache area is a great place to catch some shade. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As I was looking around the area, I flushed a hawk from its spot in the tree.  It's always a beautiful sight to see these things flying!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a medium gatorade jar painted black.  the rest is up to you! &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As residents of Oro Valley, Pooh-Pooh and I have been closely watching construction of a section of La Canada road between Naranja and Tangerine.  It's quite an improvement over the old road.  It now includes four lanes for traffic, as well as a multiuse path on each side.   After two years or so, it's finally finished!  We were happy to see our taxpayer dollars going toward construction of a beautiful wall with metal sculpture inserts.  I believe the purpose of this wall is to prevent nearby golfers from using the Oro Valley Post Office as the fourth hole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's what an article in the 9 Jan 08 AZ Daily Star said about the wall:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;La Canada wall a thing of beauty.  A new wall along a stretch of North La Canada Road served as a canvas for local artist Matthew Moutafis.  For him, the wall wasn't just about keeping errant golf balls inside the Hilton Tucson El Conquistador Golf &amp; Tennis Resort.  It was about creating a wall that residents wouldn't mind having in their neighborhood.  &quot;People who live here have to look at it every day,&quot; he said of the 8-foot-high, 1,200-foot-long wall between West Naranja and West Tangerine roads.  The wall, made of masonry slump block, is divided into three segments and encrusted with 176 steel yuccas, saguaros, prickly pear cacti, and other art pieces reflective of the southwest...&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a micro container 1 inch long and 1/4 inch in diameter.  Accuracy was 5.7 feet with a Garmin GPSMap 60.  I will change it to a larger container when all the construction and landscaping is completed. I just wanted to bring you to another pretty place in Oro Valley, and recognize the fine efforts of a local artist.  It's a cryin' shame that it has already been &quot;tagged&quot; by hoodlums.   Park on Crystal Vision Road, N32 24.778, W110 59.756, and the cache is a short distance away. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">If you have lived in the &quot;OV&quot; for a while, you may have noticed beautiful sculptures and artwork scattered amongst the newly developed commercial areas around town.  The strip mall on the Southwest corner of Naranja and 1st has some great examples.  Oro Valley Marketplace has some too (hint, hint).  Do you think the developers of these sites put them there because of their generous appreciation of the arts?  Maybe, but I don't think so.  One person is primarily responsible for making your next visit to Walgreen's a more pleasant experience, Mr Dick Eggerding.  I learned about Mr Eggerding and his work from an article in Oro Valley Magazine, November 2009.  Here is the text from that article:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DICK EGGERDING By Dave Califano  Photography By Jennifer Polixenni Brankin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At 76, Dick Eggerding has been a lot of things to a lot of people; high school sweetheart and husband, father of two, grandfather, military serviceman, Washington University graduate, professional opera singer, president and chair of a major southeastern insurance company, cancer survivor, arts activist and lover. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Born in 1933, Eggerding was reared by a single mother — his father died when he was just 2 years old — during the Great Depression and World War II, at which time he collected scrap iron and sold savings stamps for the war effort. By age 14, his love affair of the arts was fully rooted when he started performing in school plays and local productions. By 21, he had graduated from university and married.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In 1988, after a career in insurance, Eggerding and his wife, Marjorie, retired in Oro Valley. “We were living in Scottsdale and wanted to retire there,” he explains. “Then we came down Highway 79 and we got to that first panoramic view and were like ‘Wow, look at that!’ We’ve been in love with Oro Valley ever since.” &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;At this point in the story, you would expect Eggerding to have settled into a life of golf, dinner parties and reading, but you would be severely mistaken. Since landing in Oro Valley Eggerding has co-founded the Greater Oro Valley Arts Council, established the Oro Valley Public Art Code and the 1% for Public Art funding and the Oro Valley Community Foundation. He’s also served on numerous boards, task forces and the like. I sat down with Eggerding over some pasta, or as the waitress playfully joked “some ravioli with your cheese again,” to talk about the state of arts in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OVM: How did you get involved in the Oro Valley arts community?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;DE: Back in 1994, I was chair of the so-called Arts Advisory Board. My partner, Bob Weede, and I contracted with the Arizona Commission on the Arts to do a cultural assessment for the town. In that they made several recommendations of what the community can and should do and one was to create a non-profit arts organization. The other was to have a Percent for Art ordinance. So if there is construction by commercial or the town there should be a percentage for art. &lt;br/&gt;That same year was the beginning of the general plan for the town. There was nobody on the board but me who represented the arts. So I wrote up the entire section of the general plan on arts and culture and as part of it I threw in all of the stuff from the assessment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OVM: Did you meet with any opposition?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DE: I used politics for the arts; I never used arts to be a politician. And people accused me of that. I had to live that down for about two years. Everybody thought I was doing all of this because I was going to run for office. That’s not why I did it. I did it because of my passion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OVM:There is no denying that you have passion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DE: I am not a joiner. I am a volunteer entrepreneur. I like to start things, like the arts council (GOVAC), the 1% for Public Arts, the Historical Society, the [Oro Valley] Community Foundation. I enjoy the challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OVM: You co-founded GOVAC. How did that come about?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DE: In 1996, Bob Weede and I formed a 501(c)(3) called the Greater Oro Valley Arts Council. It took us a year to get the thing through the IRS. In December 1997 the Arts Advisory Board, en masse, all resigned and became the board of GOVAC. We took a risk and I got the board to designate GOVAC as the designated arts organization and it was put in the general plan and is in the general plan today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OVM: You created the 1% for Public Art ordinance too. How did that happen?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DE: In 1995, I wrote a letter to the mayor and council saying that the general plan indicated that we should have a 1% for Public Art ordinance. The mayor appointed me to work on it. The developers were up in arms. I finally convinced them, “You can write it off and you will be leaving something behind for the town and you’ll be revered for it. The very first project was the ballroom revision at the [Hilton] El Conquistador. If you go over there you will see a huge ram. That was the very first project under the ordinance. It cost $35,000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OVM: GOVAC recently changed its name to Southern Arizona Arts &amp; Cultural Alliance, and also its mission. What are your thoughts about that?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DE: Times change and organizations have to adjust to those changes. I think the organization, under the circumstances of the economy is doing what ever they can do to survive. &lt;br/&gt;The actual constituency for the arts hasn’t changed and that is the important part. I do believe that the Alliance is on the right track in today’s conditions. They’ve diversified and that’s good. The real problem is everything local is suffering. If I could make an appeal, my appeal to Oro Valley is to get out and support the Alliance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OVM: You’ve done so much for the community, you must be very proud? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DE: I revel in the success. I get up in the morning and I drive down Rancho Vistoso and I see the public art. I go to the hospital and see the art there. I have a beautiful day every time I get up because the arts are there. I am extraordinarily proud of the public art. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OVM: What do you see for the future?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DE: The country is in the throes of something huge and nobody knows where it’s going. Art will survive. The infrastructure of the city is like the heart but arts are the soul.&lt;br/&gt;For information about local arts and cultural events, visit SAACA.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, on to the cache!  It's a 1.5 inch long tube, bring your own pen and tweezers.  It is an easy find, with a real spoiler of a hint.  My point is to make this cache as easy as possible to find. The goal is to take you to a place where you can appreciate the effort of Mr Dick Eggerding.  The area is very seldom used, so you will probably have the walkway to yourself.  Parking is very near and the cache is wheelchair accessible. Thank you Dick Eggerding! &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A 10 yr old plant might only be 1.5 inches tall. Saguaro can grow as tall as 40 to 60 feet high and weigh 3200-4800 pounds.&lt;br/&gt; The holes- or &quot;saguaro boots&quot; - that birds nested in can be found among the dead saguaros. Native Americans used these as water containers long before the canteen was available.&lt;br/&gt; With the right growing conditions, it is estimated that saguaros can live to be as much as 150-200 years old.&lt;br/&gt; There are many Native American story and legends of the Saguaro cactus. Some Native Americans believed that when one of their people died, they would turn into a Saguaro. This way they could take care of their people by bearing fruit for them every summer.&lt;br/&gt; Like people, each one is different in its own way, but this one is just plain crazy!</groundspeak:long_description>

A few too many!:) Whiskey Vista is out in the aftermath of the rodeo Chetta sky fire. During the day the Vista has a beautiful panoramic view you could see a full 360° view of the White Mountains. You can also see the new growth of oak trees that are making a new forest that once was a forest full of Juniper's and pine trees. Whiskey Vista also allows you to see how close the fire got to the town nearby. My friends and I really enjoy this spot even before the fire came. We wanted to share it with others to see how it looks now and to imagine how it could've looked before when the Pines and junipers once grew in this area. So we placed this cache  for you future geo-catchers. Remember! Be Safe! Have Fun and Drink Responsibly;)</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I wanted to place a cache for my dog Clover, who has been on many of a caching trip, ironically because of difficulties associated with this particular Evilfishing event, was not present for the placement of this cache, but will return to visit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From her first caching trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot; then followed the animal trail to the left of the stone arrow. Once in the area, Clover the Wonder dog laid down to watch as the rest of us stummbled around the rocks and trees, right after getting ready to call the hunt looked at Clover and there was the Cache two feet below her nose..&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She may have never sniffed out or exactly pointed out a cache but has no problem helping find one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clover was first discovered in August 1998 near a ranch house near Pima, AZ. She was put in the back of a truck which once the driver was finished with some electrical work on a house that was being built she would have left this realm. I could not let that happen as she was such a cute small thing all of maybe no more than 6 weeks old. When I got her back home to Mesa I gave her a tick dip/bath as the fleas weighed more than she did. Over that time Clover has stayed pretty much at her present home, where she has over the years protected the property from any and all birds that attempt to land in the back. In Clover's formative years she was taught the fine art of Cat play by Monster Kitty, rules are simple walk or stay still you are fine Move faster or run, its on!! Would never harm them if and when they were caught but kept the felines honest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past few months her vision and to a degree her hearing have diminished, but still enjoys the ride in the car and sniffin the wind. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Included in Opencaching May 4 2012</groundspeak:long_description>

Once before the close parking was no more I took Alex to this spot then we made the long walk a year later, it wasn't until today that we both made the walk as geocachers placing a cache..&lt;br/&gt;When I found this tree back in the spring 97, ha ha, I marked the waypoint with my Magellan Trailblazer XL GPS, I have held onto those coordinates through various means, then when we followed the coords in the Magellan 315, the actual spot was only 42 feet different... We did take a very long averaging reading for this cache placement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was included in Opencaching May 2 2012</groundspeak:long_description>

It also has a beautiful view overlooking the White Mountains. Some of the mountains you can see from this view are Sunrise, Mount Baldy, Sugarloaf, and greens peak just to name a few. This is our first catch so let us know how it goes so we can improve our future geo caches. Remember be safe have fun and don't overlook the obvious...;)</groundspeak:long_description>

On the Sitgreaves, the major attractions for visitors from the hot valleys of Phoenix or Tucson are the Mogollon Rim and the string of man-made lakes. From the Rim's 7600-foot elevation, vista points provide inspiring views of the low country to the south and west. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was included in Opencaching May 4 2012</groundspeak:long_description>

The batteries in my GPS were giving indications that they as well as I were running low so Mtime was going assist in the obtaining of cache coordinates. After finding a suitable location I hung my Garmin 60CS GPS on the upturned trunk and began clearing room for the ammo can, I wanted to move a rock to make a neat fit I gave the rock a push to move it away and was greeted by &quot;You broke my GPS...You REALLY broke the GPS&quot;.. The Garmin eTrex Legend HCx had broken the momentum of the rock with its life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original contents are some remnants of the EvilFishing activity fishing line and fishes, along with a deck of cards from Bugles and some assorted swag donated by Mtime. I could no longer call this cache anything but what Mtime called it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was a somber walk back along the Dam to the spillway and a shorter climb, where I decided to fish for a few minutes before needing to get something to drink.... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was included in Opencaching May 2 2012</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a small cold water geyser. It's powered by CO2 trapped in the rocks deep under ground. Water from the nearby San Rafel river seeps down into the rocks and dissolves the gas until there is enough pressure to push the water out.  It erupts about every two hours for about 20 minutes, so it is fairly easy to catch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a long dirt road to get here from Green River and may not be passenger car friendly depending on weather. Cell service is spotty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the site of the old Chaffin Ranch, I believe the geyser resulted from an attempt to drill a water well. </groundspeak:long_description>

--Not for the Weak At Heart--&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Seven tree spirits will light the way,&lt;br /&gt;
but only after the end of day.&lt;br /&gt;
They will guide you to what you seek,&lt;br /&gt;
but be warned the journey is not for the meek.&lt;br /&gt;
When the seventh spirit has been found,&lt;br /&gt;
then the treasure is close around.&lt;br /&gt;
Beware the eight spirit who guards the chest,&lt;br /&gt;
for he is not friendly like the rest.&lt;br /&gt;
His eyes glow a ghastly red,&lt;br /&gt;
and those who see them soon fall dead.&lt;br /&gt;
To claim the treasure, make no sound,&lt;br /&gt;
for this is his hallowed ground.&lt;br /&gt;
Be warned again to stay away,&lt;br /&gt;
that you may live to see another day! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No flashlight is needed for this journey, however, its a good idea to have one so you can safely light your way as you walk.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Stand at the start point and look for a light coming from a tree. Go to that tree and walk around it until you see another light. The end is where the seventh spirit is.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">One of my favorite websites is the Utah Department of Transportation road conditions site.  It is extremely useful when I am trying to decide if I want to go after a new cache somewhere because I can look at the webcam and see the actual road conditions.  There is one of the UDOT webcams located very near this cache and it points at the Freedom Bridge over a leg of Starvation Lake.  Of all the webcams I look at, this one always seems to be sunny - except at night.  Too bad that UDOT doesn't show the wind speed, because that little propeller on the weather station is always turning quite fast when I drive by here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is good parking just east of the cache on the south side of Highway 40.  There is no need to walk along the highway, you can stay behind the guard rail all the way to the cache.  Enjoy and smile, I might be looking at the webcam when you are there!

The only way to cross the stream is over a bridge, under which lives a troll. The three goats cross the bridge one at a time, from the smallest to the largest. The first two goats are confronted by the troll, but persuade him to let them go by telling him that they are smaller than the next goat and will make an inferior meal. When the third goat crosses the bridge, the troll attempts to capture it. The troll is powerless against the strength of the Big Billy Goat Gruff, who easily butts the troll high into the air and into the deep, fast-flowing river, where it drowns. The three goats are then free to eat the delicious grass on the other side of the river, and to cross the bridge any time. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Given such name on September 18, 1870 by the members of the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition, whose purpose was to make detailed maps and observations of the Yellowstone region, explore its numerous lakes, climb the summits of its mountains and observe the wildlife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cone geyser shoots 3,700 to 8,400 US gallons (14,000 to 32,000 l) of boiling water to a height of 106 to 185 feet (32 to 56 m), lasting from 1.5 to 5 minutes. And, while not the largest geyser in the park, it draws more crowds than any other; due in part to its ease of access, but also because of its small eruption window and high frequency. The reliability of Old Faithful can be attributed to the fact that it is not connected to any other thermal features of the Upper Geyser Basin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there is no definitive way to determine exactly when Old Faithful will erupt, the most commonly used method for prediction, with a margin of error of 10 minutes, is that the geyser will erupt 65 minutes after an eruption lasting less than 2.5 minutes or 91 minutes after an eruption lasting more than 2.5 minutes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/features/yell/live/oflive.htm&quot;&gt;Old Fatihful Live Webcam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paved sidewalks and wooden boardwalks. Stay on either to be safe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Logging Requirements --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this Virtual, count the number of benches along the boardwalk which serves as the viewing platform for Old Faithful geyser. From this total, subtract the number of those benches which are reserved and designated for people with mobility disabilities. Enter the difference as the Code Phrase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Information --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- This is a Virtual lisiting, there is no container hidden at the posted coordinates. &lt;br/&gt;- This location is on property managed by the US National Park Service.&lt;br/&gt;- This is an opencaching.com only listing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Old Faithful is the best!!  We counted every single bench, but it was a bit confusing because the grouping of benches with 2 immediately adjacent could almost lead on to believe that it was just one bench.  We were shocked to see that NOT EVEN ONE of the benches was designated for handicap.  We looked for signs around the area and on the benches themselves.  Nothing!  Anyway, the pass phrase number does not work so I guess I can't log the FTF.</groundspeak:text>

But its a beautiful view once you get to the top.&lt;br/&gt;What you'll want to do is once you get into Monarch, take the first dirt road to the left called Hughesville Rd(We didn't see a sign for the road, buts its a well traveled dirt road). Once your on the road drive 4 miles in and on the right hand side you'll see a wooden fence blocking the road(Cord's is N 47-05.292 / W 110-45.496). What we did was park there, walked up the road to another wooden fence and went up from there. It was a long steep walk up and down so make sure you have nice hiking boots or shoes on and some water.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please take your time and take care on this Power trail. Ditches can have critters lurking, so keep one eye open.&lt;br /&gt;
The Power Saw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PLEASE put the caps back on the containers as well as the log into the plastic bags. If there are any problems, write it in the log. None of these caches are near the bluebird houses, stay away from these birdhouses.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The Power Saw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

This Cache is based on Medicine Hat’s most visible landmark, the Saamis Teepee. The World’s Largest Teepee. Work through the puzzles, find the caches and turn your teepee from blue ?'s to yellow Smilies!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World’s tallest teepee, the Saamis Teepee (build for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics), stands more than 20 stories high and has a base diameter of 50 meters.  Native art work depicting a colorful native history of Southern Alberta has been incorporated on 12-foot diameters storyboards.  The teepee had more engineering challenges in its construction than did the Eiffel Tower, and is built to withstand extreme temperatures and 150mph winds.  Its colors are white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun and blue for flowing waters.  If you have not had a chance to visit the teepee I would recommend a visit to see the sheer AWE of the site.  While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe and most of all, have fun!!!  Oh and watch out for the normal critters, snakes and such. May not be to winter friendly or to muddy when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

The Power Saw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

This Cache is based on Medicine Hat’s most visible landmark, the Saamis Teepee. The World’s Largest Teepee. Work through the puzzles, find the caches and turn your teepee from blue ?'s to yellow Smilies!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World’s tallest teepee, the Saamis Teepee (build for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics), stands more than 20 stories high and has a base diameter of 50 meters.  Native art work depicting a colorful native history of Southern Alberta has been incorporated on 12-foot diameters storyboards.  The teepee had more engineering challenges in its construction than did the Eiffel Tower, and is built to withstand extreme temperatures and 150mph winds.  Its colors are white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun and blue for flowing waters.  If you have not had a chance to visit the teepee I would recommend a visit to see the sheer AWE of the site.  While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe and most of all, have fun!!!  Oh and watch out for the normal critters, snakes and such. May not be to winter friendly or to muddy when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;

work, on this cache. Also a thank you goes out to Jobok &amp;&lt;br /&gt;
Deester for most of the supplies and great ideas. I also want to&lt;br /&gt;
thank Thor and the rest of the members of the observatory for&lt;br /&gt;
allowing us to place it there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Paintings on the outside of the cache box were done by a local&lt;br /&gt;
artist Ray Senft. The inside was done by Jobok &amp;&lt;br /&gt;
Deedster..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;This is one of Medicine Hats largest cache containers. It is a&lt;br /&gt;
travel bug hotel. A place where you can trade your travel bugs and&lt;br /&gt;
geocoins. There is also a cache box for trading swag items as well.&lt;br /&gt;
Inside you will find a large trackable travel bug, write the&lt;br /&gt;
numbers down to discover it. It can not and should not be removed&lt;br /&gt;
or taken. Please place everything back just as you found it so&lt;br /&gt;
others can enjoy it the same way you did. The FTF prize is and&lt;br /&gt;
unactivated travel bug.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; I have found to many people are having problems with the lock, so I made a few changes. I replaced the lock with a simple combination lock and will give you the combination to it so there will be no puzzle to solve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The combination to the lock is A2010. Enjoy the cache.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This Cache is based on Medicine Hat’s most visible landmark, the Saamis Teepee. The World’s Largest Teepee. Work through the puzzles, find the caches and turn your teepee from blue ?'s to yellow Smilies!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World’s tallest teepee, the Saamis Teepee (build for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics), stands more than 20 stories high and has a base diameter of 50 meters.  Native art work depicting a colorful native history of Southern Alberta has been incorporated on 12-foot diameters storyboards.  The teepee had more engineering challenges in its construction than did the Eiffel Tower, and is built to withstand extreme temperatures and 150mph winds.  Its colors are white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun and blue for flowing waters.  If you have not had a chance to visit the teepee I would recommend a visit to see the sheer AWE of the site.  While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe and most of all, have fun!!!  Oh and watch out for the normal critters, snakes and such. May not be to winter friendly or to muddy when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;

The Power Saw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

This Cache is based on Medicine Hat’s most visible landmark, the Saamis Teepee. The World’s Largest Teepee. Work through the puzzles, find the caches and turn your teepee from blue ?'s to yellow Smilies!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World’s tallest teepee, the Saamis Teepee (build for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics), stands more than 20 stories high and has a base diameter of 50 meters.  Native art work depicting a colorful native history of Southern Alberta has been incorporated on 12-foot diameters storyboards.  The teepee had more engineering challenges in its construction than did the Eiffel Tower, and is built to withstand extreme temperatures and 150mph winds.  Its colors are white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun and blue for flowing waters.  If you have not had a chance to visit the teepee I would recommend a visit to see the sheer AWE of the site.  While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe and most of all, have fun!!!  Oh and watch out for the normal critters, snakes and such. May not be to winter friendly or to muddy when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;

The Power Saw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Power Saw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

This Cache is based on Medicine Hat’s most visible landmark, the Saamis Teepee. The World’s Largest Teepee. Work through the puzzles, find the caches and turn your teepee from blue ?'s to yellow Smilies!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World’s tallest teepee, the Saamis Teepee (build for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics), stands more than 20 stories high and has a base diameter of 50 meters.  Native art work depicting a colorful native history of Southern Alberta has been incorporated on 12-foot diameters storyboards.  The teepee had more engineering challenges in its construction than did the Eiffel Tower, and is built to withstand extreme temperatures and 150mph winds.  Its colors are white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun and blue for flowing waters.  If you have not had a chance to visit the teepee I would recommend a visit to see the sheer AWE of the site.  While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe and most of all, have fun!!!  Oh and watch out for the normal critters, snakes and such. May not be to winter friendly or to muddy when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;

This Cache is based on Medicine Hat’s most visible landmark, the Saamis Teepee. The World’s Largest Teepee. Work through the puzzles, find the caches and turn your teepee from blue ?'s to yellow Smilies!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World’s tallest teepee, the Saamis Teepee (build for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics), stands more than 20 stories high and has a base diameter of 50 meters.  Native art work depicting a colorful native history of Southern Alberta has been incorporated on 12-foot diameters storyboards.  The teepee had more engineering challenges in its construction than did the Eiffel Tower, and is built to withstand extreme temperatures and 150mph winds.  Its colors are white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun and blue for flowing waters.  If you have not had a chance to visit the teepee I would recommend a visit to see the sheer AWE of the site.  While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe and most of all, have fun!!!  Oh and watch out for the normal critters, snakes and such. May not be to winter friendly or to muddy when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;

The Power Saw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Power Saw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

This Cache is based on Medicine Hat’s most visible landmark, the Saamis Teepee. The World’s Largest Teepee. Work through the puzzles, find the caches and turn your teepee from blue ?'s to yellow Smilies!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World’s tallest teepee, the Saamis Teepee (build for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics), stands more than 20 stories high and has a base diameter of 50 meters.  Native art work depicting a colorful native history of Southern Alberta has been incorporated on 12-foot diameters storyboards.  The teepee had more engineering challenges in its construction than did the Eiffel Tower, and is built to withstand extreme temperatures and 150mph winds.  Its colors are white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun and blue for flowing waters.  If you have not had a chance to visit the teepee I would recommend a visit to see the sheer AWE of the site.  While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe and most of all, have fun!!!  Oh and watch out for the normal critters, snakes and such. May not be to winter friendly or to muddy when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;

The Power Saw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

This Cache is based on Medicine Hat’s most visible landmark, the Saamis Teepee. The World’s Largest Teepee. Work through the puzzles, find the caches and turn your teepee from blue ?'s to yellow Smilies!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World’s tallest teepee, the Saamis Teepee (build for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics), stands more than 20 stories high and has a base diameter of 50 meters.  Native art work depicting a colorful native history of Southern Alberta has been incorporated on 12-foot diameters storyboards.  The teepee had more engineering challenges in its construction than did the Eiffel Tower, and is built to withstand extreme temperatures and 150mph winds.  Its colors are white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun and blue for flowing waters.  If you have not had a chance to visit the teepee I would recommend a visit to see the sheer AWE of the site.  While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe and most of all, have fun!!!  Oh and watch out for the normal critters, snakes and such. May not be to winter friendly or to muddy when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;

The Power Saw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

This Cache is based on Medicine Hat’s most visible landmark, the Saamis Teepee. The World’s Largest Teepee. Work through the puzzles, find the caches and turn your teepee from blue ?'s to yellow Smilies!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World’s tallest teepee, the Saamis Teepee (build for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics), stands more than 20 stories high and has a base diameter of 50 meters.  Native art work depicting a colorful native history of Southern Alberta has been incorporated on 12-foot diameters storyboards.  The teepee had more engineering challenges in its construction than did the Eiffel Tower, and is built to withstand extreme temperatures and 150mph winds.  Its colors are white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun and blue for flowing waters.  If you have not had a chance to visit the teepee I would recommend a visit to see the sheer AWE of the site.  While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe and most of all, have fun!!!  Oh and watch out for the normal critters, snakes and such. May not be to winter friendly or to muddy when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The World’s tallest teepee, the Saamis Teepee (build for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics), stands more than 20 stories high and has a base diameter of 50 meters.  Native art work depicting a colorful native history of Southern Alberta has been incorporated on 12-foot diameters storyboards.  The teepee had more engineering challenges in its construction than did the Eiffel Tower, and is built to withstand extreme temperatures and 150mph winds.  Its colors are white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun and blue for flowing waters.  If you have not had a chance to visit the teepee I would recommend a visit to see the sheer AWE of the site.  While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe and most of all, have fun!!!  Oh and watch out for the normal critters, snakes and such. May not be to winter friendly or to muddy when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;

Please take your time and take care on this Power trail. Ditches can have critters lurking, so keep one eye open.&lt;br /&gt;
The Jigsawaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PLEASE put the caps back on the containers correctly. If there are any problems, write it in the log. None of these caches are near the bluebird houses, stay away from these birdhouses.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The saguaro can store about a ton of water in the spines. Like this
can store water and is able to bloom although it doesn't rain. The
saguaro blooms always in June. The flowers, nearly waxiry white.
They blossom only for a night. Bats, bees, moths, white winged
doves are who normally pollinated them.The seeds are used to make
especial wine and it is known too, the saguaro’s bier. The
Native Americans used the seeds and fruits of saguaro as rich
source of food. To have a saguaro cactus at home is easy. With some
special care it is possible to enjoy these cacti.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This Cache is based on Medicine Hat’s most visible landmark, the Saamis Teepee. The World’s Largest Teepee. Work through the puzzles, find the caches and turn your teepee from blue ?'s to yellow Smilies!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World’s tallest teepee, the Saamis Teepee (build for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics), stands more than 20 stories high and has a base diameter of 50 meters.  Native art work depicting a colorful native history of Southern Alberta has been incorporated on 12-foot diameters storyboards.  The teepee had more engineering challenges in its construction than did the Eiffel Tower, and is built to withstand extreme temperatures and 150mph winds.  Its colors are white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun and blue for flowing waters.  If you have not had a chance to visit the teepee I would recommend a visit to see the sheer AWE of the site.  While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe and most of all, have fun!!!  Oh and watch out for the normal critters, snakes and such. May not be to winter friendly or to muddy when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;

This Cache is based on Medicine Hat’s most visible landmark, the Saamis Teepee. The World’s Largest Teepee. Work through the puzzles, find the caches and turn your teepee from blue ?'s to yellow Smilies!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World’s tallest teepee, the Saamis Teepee (build for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics), stands more than 20 stories high and has a base diameter of 50 meters.  Native art work depicting a colorful native history of Southern Alberta has been incorporated on 12-foot diameters storyboards.  The teepee had more engineering challenges in its construction than did the Eiffel Tower, and is built to withstand extreme temperatures and 150mph winds.  Its colors are white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun and blue for flowing waters.  If you have not had a chance to visit the teepee I would recommend a visit to see the sheer AWE of the site.  While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe and most of all, have fun!!!  Oh and watch out for the normal critters, snakes and such. May not be to winter friendly or to muddy when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;

Please take your time and take care on this Power trail. Ditches can have critters lurking, so keep one eye open.&lt;br /&gt;
The Jigsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

This Cache is based on Medicine Hat’s most visible landmark, the Saamis Teepee. The World’s Largest Teepee. Work through the puzzles, find the caches and turn your teepee from blue ?'s to yellow Smilies!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World’s tallest teepee, the Saamis Teepee (build for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics), stands more than 20 stories high and has a base diameter of 50 meters.  Native art work depicting a colorful native history of Southern Alberta has been incorporated on 12-foot diameters storyboards.  The teepee had more engineering challenges in its construction than did the Eiffel Tower, and is built to withstand extreme temperatures and 150mph winds.  Its colors are white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun and blue for flowing waters.  If you have not had a chance to visit the teepee I would recommend a visit to see the sheer AWE of the site.  While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe and most of all, have fun!!!  Oh and watch out for the normal critters, snakes and such. May not be to winter friendly or to muddy when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;

The World’s tallest teepee, the Saamis Teepee (build for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics), stands more than 20 stories high and has a base diameter of 50 meters.  Native art work depicting a colorful native history of Southern Alberta has been incorporated on 12-foot diameters storyboards.  The teepee had more engineering challenges in its construction than did the Eiffel Tower, and is built to withstand extreme temperatures and 150mph winds.  Its colors are white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun and blue for flowing waters.  If you have not had a chance to visit the teepee I would recommend a visit to see the sheer AWE of the site.  While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe and most of all, have fun!!!  Oh and watch out for the normal critters, snakes and such. May not be to winter friendly or to muddy when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;

The Power Saw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please take your time and take care on this Power trail. Ditches can have critters lurking, so keep one eye open.&lt;br /&gt;
The Jigsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

This Cache is based on Medicine Hat’s most visible landmark, the Saamis Teepee. The World’s Largest Teepee. Work through the puzzles, find the caches and turn your teepee from blue ?'s to yellow Smilies!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World’s tallest teepee, the Saamis Teepee (build for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics), stands more than 20 stories high and has a base diameter of 50 meters.  Native art work depicting a colorful native history of Southern Alberta has been incorporated on 12-foot diameters storyboards.  The teepee had more engineering challenges in its construction than did the Eiffel Tower, and is built to withstand extreme temperatures and 150mph winds.  Its colors are white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun and blue for flowing waters.  If you have not had a chance to visit the teepee I would recommend a visit to see the sheer AWE of the site.  While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe and most of all, have fun!!!  Oh and watch out for the normal critters, snakes and such. May not be to winter friendly or to muddy when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This Cache is based on Medicine Hat’s most visible landmark, the Saamis Teepee. The World’s Largest Teepee. Work through the puzzles, find the caches and turn your teepee from blue ?'s to yellow Smilies!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The World’s tallest teepee, the Saamis Teepee (build for the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics), stands more than 20 stories high and has a base diameter of 50 meters.  Native art work depicting a colorful native history of Southern Alberta has been incorporated on 12-foot diameters storyboards.  The teepee had more engineering challenges in its construction than did the Eiffel Tower, and is built to withstand extreme temperatures and 150mph winds.  Its colors are white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun and blue for flowing waters.  If you have not had a chance to visit the teepee I would recommend a visit to see the sheer AWE of the site.  While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe and most of all, have fun!!!  Oh and watch out for the normal critters, snakes and such. May not be to winter friendly or to muddy when it rains.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Please take your time and take care on this Power trail. Ditches can have critters lurking, so keep one eye open.&lt;br /&gt;
The Jigsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

When you arrive at the Cache site you'll be overlooking Ross Creek

others can enjoy it as we hope you have.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;JIGSAW #88&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please take your time and take care on this Power trail. Ditches can have critters lurking, so keep one eye open.&lt;br /&gt;
The Jigsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Power Saw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Power Saw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Power Saw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Power Saw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Power Saw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Do you wanna play a game?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You're looking for a micro that is camo-ed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Unfortunately I can not leave this cache out year round, so, I have put it on moth balls for awhile. I have replaced it with a micro that will be easy to find. Sorry it had to come down for now, but I can't risk it being vandalized, or worse, go missing. But Jigsaw's games are never done. Thanks for the great response, I'm blown away!

Please take your time and take care on this Power trail. Ditches can have critters lurking, so keep one eye open.&lt;br /&gt;
The Jigsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

not be offended if your log is deleted. I must be fair to all

&lt;b&gt;The cache is not at the posted coordinates. Using the posted coordinates will put you out to pasture.... literally!!&lt;/b&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is a test of your powers of observation, While doing Power Saw power trail, there are clues hidden within. These clues come together to form the co-ordinates to this cache. The first clue is in the area of Power Saw 1. The Parking Co-ordinates will get you in the right spot to start. There are 15 clues in all, Be sure to write them down. While doing this cache be mindful of traffic,terrain and the usual prairie critters. Be Safe and Happy Caching!

Please take your time and take care on this Power trail. Ditches can have critters lurking, so keep one eye open.&lt;br /&gt;
The Jigsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please take your time and take care on this Power trail. Ditches can have critters lurking, so keep one eye open.&lt;br /&gt;
The Jigsawaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;

Please take your time and take care on this Power trail. Ditches can have critters lurking, so keep one eye open.&lt;br /&gt;
The Jigsawaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;On May 3, 2000, Dave Ulmer proposed a way to celebrate the
demise of Selective Availability. He hid a bucket of trinkets in
the woods outside Portland, Oregon and announced its location in a
posting made to the USENET newsgroup sci.geo.satellite-nav. This
announcement is remarkable for laying out the essence of the hobby
that is still in place today. It's all there. The container. The
trinkets. The log book. The rule of take something, leave
something, sign the logbook. Dave Ulmer invented geocaching in one
fell swoop in that newsgroup posting.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excerpt borrowed from The History of Geocaching&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;You are looking for a very unique cache. When you do
find it, you will need to read the instructions attached to the
container. These instructions will explain how to retrieve the key
to open the log side of the cache. Please take care with the cache.
If you are successful in opening the cache, you must put the key
back in the proper area of the cache so the next geocacher can
&quot;Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll&quot; their way to fun!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;You will want to bring a writing stick.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Here's the catch for the FTF! The first child under the
age of 12 to open the cache will be awarded the unactivated Travel
Bug prize.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Happy caching and be safe.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Please take your time and take care on this Power trail. Ditches can have critters lurking, so keep one eye open.&lt;br /&gt;
The Jigsawaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please take your time and take care on this Power trail. Ditches can have critters lurking, so keep one eye open.&lt;br /&gt;
The Jigsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please take your time and take care on this Power trail. Ditches can have critters lurking, so keep one eye open.&lt;br /&gt;
The Jigsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please take your time and take care on this Power trail. Ditches can have critters lurking, so keep one eye open.&lt;br /&gt;
The Jigsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;

The Jigsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

It was 1887, when the local merchants and ranchers decided to hold
an Agricultural Fair to bring the urban and rural residents
together for a few days of celebration. It was almost like a
&quot;Thanksgiving&quot; for the growth of the new community. They formed the
Medicine Hat Agricultural Society, receiving a charter (which cost
seventy dollars) from the Lieutenant Governor of the North West
Territories.&lt;br /&gt;
The first Medicine Hat Exhibition was held on Friday and Saturday,
October 14 and 15, 1887. Livestock exhibits were displayed at the
CPR stockyard and the other exhibits, including poultry, grains,
garden vegetables, roots, field crops, fruit, baking, preserves and
ladies' fancy work were displayed at Government Hall.&lt;br /&gt;

loves to walk. The cache is located in yet another SE hill
coulée and can be accessed from several different paths. It
is up to you how easy or hard you want the trek to be depending on
your athletic ability. In the &quot;ammo can&quot; is numerous &quot;dog&quot; toys and
essentials. If you take something, please leave something in its
place and try to stick to the &quot;dog&quot; theme. The FTF is a &quot;dog tag&quot;

Be sure to look for the FTF card which can be redeemed for one Chess Themed Geocoin at the event, Please only one card per team.  If you get several FTF's, please leave the card for the second to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Knights are the horse shaped pieces, and there are two of each color. These are very versatile and like real horses, can jump over pieces that would otherwise be a hurdle for less versatile pieces. The manner in which they move is quite exciting because they can be pulled into the game at a moment's notice and because of their versatility can often threaten two or more of the opponent's pieces. They move in an L shape, one square forward and two sideways or two squares forward and one sideways, but the crowning glory of these beasts is that they can be used in any direction on the board and can take any of the opponent's pieces except the King, though can indeed threaten the King and make the opponent move to another square. Each player has 2 knights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be searching for a regular sized custom painted Chess Themed LnL.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hycroft China was originally founded by Harry Yuill as Medicine Hat
Potteries Ltd. in 1937. Built down the road from Medalta, Medicine
Hat Potteries soon emerged as the older company’s main
competitor. Its 100 workers were almost all former Medalta
employees, attracted away by the modern working conditions and
higher pay. The factory complex built for the new company was
equipped with the latest in modern technology and equipment. It
featured what was then the largest tunnel kiln in Canada, measuring
70 feet in diameter. Many of the factory’s features were
designed to improve the working environment such as: abundant
windows and skylights providing maximum natural light; modern
safety devices were included in the building’s design;
loudspeakers placed throughout the plant broadcast radio programs
and records at intervals during the day; and a soft drink cooler
and water fountain were installed on the factory floor. This cache
is a Buffalo Tube so bring your own writing stick...Be sure to
replace exactly as you found it so the next cacher can enjoy the
cache as you did&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Be Safe and Happy Caching&lt;br /&gt;

Congratulations King Tut on the FTF!&lt;br /&gt;

No one likes to get stitch's but the coordinates will take you in
the vicinity of this clinic. This cache is not on the property but
it is a very busy area, so stealth is highly advised. Remember that

&lt;b&gt;LIGHTING THE WAY FOR 100 YEARS!&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Medicine Hat is a city rich with
history which stems from the discovery of one of the largest
natural gas fields in North America. In 1903, City Council embarked
on a program to supply all residents with gas which led to the
beginning of a City-owned utility. In 1906, Medicine Hat was
incorporated as a city and soon became one of the largest
communities in south-eastern Alberta where residents used natural
gas as an inexpensive source of energy. Adding to the success of
running a City-owned Gas Utility, the Electric Utility officially
went into operation on September 6, 1910.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Our History&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1910: Electric Utility Bylaw was ratified, authorizing the
construction of an electric light and power system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1910-1912: Two 300 kilowatt diesel engine generators, two 750
kilowatt and a 1,500 kilowatt turbo-generator resulted in some of
Canada’s lowest power rates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1920: A transmission line was built to send power to
Redcliff.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1924: Residents were asked to turn on their porch lights every
evening to light the area because of a lack of street lights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1929: A 3,000 kilowatt turbo-generator was installed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1930: The Electric Utility experienced little change throughout the
1930’s due to the economic depression which led to a lack of
development and population growth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1942-1944: A 3,000 kilowatt turbo-generator was installed to meet
the demand of the area’s flying training school and PoW
camp.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1947: A 5,000 kilowatt unit was added to handle the demand of the
Post War boom years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1953: The City &amp; Calgary Power purchased a generator and
connected Medicine Hat to the Provincial grid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1956: The City began installing underground power lines to protect
the lines from lightening and other hazards. It also kept the
citizens safe from the risk of electric shock.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1963: Medicine Hat buys out Calgary Power’s share of the
generator and its production.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1969: Conversion begins in the downtown area to an underground
network system, making Medicine Hat the second city in Alberta to
convert.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1975-1978: Several generators were sold to make room for two new
combustion turbines adding 67,000 kilowatts of energy to the
system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1979: The electricity demand more than doubled during this decade,
largely due to the introduction of air conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1984: The large 69 kilovolt transmission “ring around the
City” was completed; increasing accessibility and reliability
for customers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1987: The Electric Utility developed their own computer system to
enable the remote operation of devices.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1992: Geographical Information Systems gave crews better access to
electric infrastructure data.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1993: Two new heat recovery steam generators increased
efficiencies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1996-1998: New turbo-generators were added.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2000: The system peak demand reached 150 megawatts for the first
time during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2003: A new gas combustion turbine and a heat recovery steam
generator were installed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2009: A 40,000 kilowatt generator was added.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2010: Plans are underway to introduce an automatic meter reading
system which will pave the road for future smart grid technology
and to install a packaged boiler at the power plant to increase
operating efficiencies.&lt;/b&gt;

the path on the left... the path will take you east to the cache
site. Hope you enjoy this short hike as we did placing the cache.
As always, this is a wild area. Please use respect and watch for
the usual prairie critters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Be safe and happy caching!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Another cache in the &quot;Birds&quot; series of caches. This cache is
located on a very scenic path in Riverside. These magnificent birds
can be seen from March to September soaring over the city. They
also can be seen roosting in the tall trees a short distance from
this cache.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Bird caches are usually small caches, never ammo cans, and are
placed in hides. This design feature gives the cache container
longer life in our harsh Canadian climate. Every Bird cache will be
contained in some type of protective hide. With a face only a
mother could love, these birds are 25 to 32 inches long, with a
wingspan around 6 feet and weigh in at 6 pounds. Turkey Vultures,
like most other vultures, have very few vocalization capabilities.
They can only utter hisses and grunts. They usually hiss when they
feel threatened. Grunts are commonly heard from hungry young, and
adults in courtship. Diet/Feeding: The turkey vulture feeds
entirely on carrion. This bird soars above the ground for most of
the day, searching for food with its excellent eyesight and highly
developed sense of smell. The beak and talons of the turkey vulture
are the weakest of all the other species. For this reason, the bird
will not even catch small prey like his cousin the black vulture.
Turkey vultures can often be seen along roadsides, cleaning up
roadkill, or near rivers, feasting on washed-up fish, another of
their favorite foods. Flight: The turkey vulture is one of the only
birds that fly with their wings in a dihedral (V-shape). They are
the most graceful in flight, and can soar for hours at high
altitudes without flapping their wings. Their occasional necessary
flaps and takeoffs are quite laborious, however, and the birds
often fall victim to predators and cars as a result. Range/Habitat:
By far the most widespread of the New World vultures, the turkey
vulture can be found throughout the entire United States, north
into canada along the east and west coasts, and south into central
South America. They prefer open areas, but can be found anywhere
from coastlines and deserts to plains and inland forests. Behavior:
The Turkey vulture is well known for its defense tactic of
vomiting. When disturbed, this bird will regurgitate its last meal,
both surprising its assailant and leaving a smell so putrid that
the animal loses interest in pursuing the vulture. Life Cycle:
Young fledge 70 to 80 days after hatching. Sexes appear identical.
Immatures have darker heads, and can be confused with the black
vulture, from a distance. Breeding: Turkey vultures do not actually
build nests. They choose caves, rock piles, hollow tree stumps, and
even cliff ledges. Turkey vultures have also been found laying
their eggs in deserted sheds. Turkey vultures can raise only one
brood a year, consisting of 1 to 3 blotchy-looking eggs. Both
parents share the responsibilities of incubating and caring for the
brood. The eggs incubate for 38 to 41 days.</groundspeak:long_description>

Be sure to look for the FTF card which can be redeemed for one Chess Themed Geocoin at the event, Please only one card per team.  If you get several FTF's, please leave the card for the second to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are commonly known as castles because they look like little towers with castle fortifications at the top. They are valuable pieces and need protecting. Each of them moves horizontally or vertically, though never diagonally, and they can move as far as the board layout lets them, in that they cannot jump over other pieces. These are great tools for catching the opponent unaware, and one move that they can make as a bonus is to Castle, which means changing places with the King though this can only be performed if the King and the Castle have not moved from their original positions. It really is worth keeping the rook in it's original square so that it can Castle if the King is threatened. This is not a common move for beginners and as they learn the function of all the pieces on the board will learn how to use this effectively. Each player has two Rooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be searching for a regular sized custom painted Chess Themed LnL.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Queen is a wonderfully flexible piece. It can move in any direction, backwards or forwards, diagonally or horizontally on any clear squares. The Queen is a really handy piece because distance across the board is not restricted. The only restriction is that the queen cannot jump over other pieces.

If you get several FTF's, please leave the card for the second to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the foot soldiers of chess. They can move in a forward direction only and in straight lines, one square at a time, although on their initial move, they can move two squares. The only time that a pawn moves diagonally is when presented with a chance to capture a piece immediately diagonal to it's position. Pawns cannot jump over other pieces nor move to squares that are occupied by other pieces when going in the straight move forward positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What pawns are useful for is that they defend the more important pieces. They can also be used to attack and put in threat the opponent's pieces and as such are quite important to the game, and more important than many players give them credit for, since wise opening moves with pawns can determine the strength or weakness of a game. Imagine sending soldiers forward on the battlefield and not protecting the fortress, or sending them on suicide missions as a distraction to the enemy. Often, pawns are sacrificed to advantage during a game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be searching for a regular sized custom painted Chess Themed LnL</groundspeak:long_description>

You will be looking for a cammo'd container that is located on the
side of a hill overlooking the very scenic river valley. The cache
is crammed full of some really great swag to start so remember, if
you take something, please put something back. As always, be
cautious of snakes and other prairie critters especially during the
summer months. Also, there is some barbed wire in the area so be
very careful.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;It was in 1906 that a second coal mine was begun in
Redcliff along with a brick factory. This was the Redcliff Brick
&amp; Coal Company. It was situated on the south side of the town
and supplied the whole of the southern part of the province with
coal and clay bricks. The coal mine operated until the early 1950s
and the brick factory was in operation until the early 1960s. It
was here that Rudyard Kipling made his famous statement about the
community having &quot;all hell for a basement&quot; and being &quot;the town that
was born lucky&quot;. The old-timers in town still maintain that Kipling
was referring to Redcliff and not Medicine Hat when he made these
statements. The Brick and Coal Company welcomed him when he visited
there by igniting one of its gas wells that was situated at about
2nd street and 10th avenue southwest.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Today most of the original industrial sites are no more, being replaced by parks and residential subdivisions. It is the wish of the Redcliff Museum to identify these sites as it was the industrial invasion of the early 1900s that made Redcliff what it is today. With this in mind, the Museum has placed rock monuments near where these industries were situated, enabling those visiting Redcliff to realize what an industrial, thriving community Redcliff was in the early years of the last century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;St. Ambrose has been designated a Provincial Historic Resource. The church is special both for its architectural style and its historical significance within the town of Redcliff. It was constructed in 1914 is almost as old as the town itself. Patterned on the village churches typical of rural England, it is one of the few remaining examples of Gothic Revival architecture in Alberta. During the Victorian era, Gothic Revival emerged as the style of choice for church architecture and although it is particularly linked with the Anglican Church, the style is not commonly seen in the province. In one study conducted by an engineer in the early 90’s he reported that “St. Ambrose did not belong on the corner of 5th and 5th but rather should be sitting in the middle of a meadow in southern England.”&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps more important is the memorial it represents to the town’s prosperous industrial past. Built out of discarded clinker bricks, the church incorporates the booming brick industry that was once an integral part of Redcliff. There were three brick companies in the town but it was the Redcliff Brick and Coal Co. one of the largest producers of brick in the area prior to 1914 that provided all of the clinker bricks for St. Ambrose.&lt;br/&gt;Made from clay drawn from the South Saskatchewan River, they were improperly burnt in the kiln because the brick maker had little control of the heat that was applied to the bricks to burn them. Because they had been over fired, clinker bricks were often considered undesirable. By using these “unusable” bricks the bricklayer was able to create this special architectural style and look at a fraction of the cost of the local “Redcliff” bricks. Cost to construct the church in 1914 was $5000. The work was begun in April and the first service was held in the church in November the same year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will Be Looking for a Camo'd Micro&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;                              Be Safe and Happy Caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

In 1883 a man by the name of Bayliss established a coal mine just to the west of the present town. At about the same time one of the Stair Ranches was established in the immediate area. Both concerns lasted only a few years. Finding it too costly to pack up and leave, the Bayliss interests disposed of the mine equipment by shoving it down the mine shaft, later to catch fire and smolder for many years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Up until the early 1970s the smoke from the mine could be seen to the west of town where the mine office and buildings were located. This coal pile was visible up until the late 1970s until erosion from wind and rain reduced it to a patch of black coal dust. The only visible sign of anything being in operation there is a few rocks that show where the mine office was located and the disturbance of the coulees where the rail line went to the mine entrance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be looking for a camo'ed Micro.....

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The cache is not at the published location. That will take you directly in the middle of highway #1.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;You must perform a magic trick to find the final location of the cache.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This cache was placed as a chain reaction resulting from the CHAINSAW power trail. Your first reaction to a little magic trick.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You as the magician get to perform the magic trick. First you will need a deck of playing cards. Next remove the King of Heart, King of Clubs and King of spades. These are the only cards you will need for this trick. Place the King of Clubs face down on a table. Place the King of Hearts on top of that, and finally the King of Spades face down on top. From this point on please do not look at the faces of the cards, keep them down at all times. Pick the cards up and hold them in your hands. Now the fun part. I want you to spell your name. Take the top card and slide it face down under the pack. Continue doing this for each letter in your name. To mix the cards even further, spell your name once more, placing the top card under the pack for each letter in your name. A little more mixing by spelling my name KINGTUT. Now to get the cards completely mixed I would like you to spell your name one last time.&lt;br /&gt;
Now take the top card and place it face down on the table. Take the next top card and place it face down on the table. Now before you turn over the last card, just remember I don't know your name so I don't know how many letters you started with. Hopefully if you as the magician did the trick correctly you will have the correct card left in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;
Now turn over the card. This is your first reaction. &lt;b&gt;WOW a KING!!!.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Take this information out to CHAINSAW power trail and look for this KING. Any other KINGS you find will have false coordinates on them. This is why it's import for you as the magician to do the trick correctly. Finding the correct KING along the trail will be your second reaction. Finally the KING will tell you where the final cache is placed. And once found will be your third reaction to the puzzle cache. Therefore a chain reaction.&lt;br /&gt;
As usual while geocaching in this type of area please watch out for the usual critters, snakes and such, and please be safe, have fun and enjoy the adventure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The swag has a general magic theme. PLEASE don't just take swag without trading something. Better yet bring something magical, mind bending, puzzles and the like to add to the swag to be traded.&lt;/b&gt;

The Chainsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Kindly take your time in putting caches back. put lids on properly. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PLEASE put the caps back on the containers properly. If there are any problems with the caches, write it in the log. Please do not go near the bluebird houses along the fences.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The Chainsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Kindly take your time in putting caches back. put lids on properly. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;

The Chainsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Kindly take your time in putting caches back. put lids on properly. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Chainsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Kindly take your time in putting caches back. put lids on properly. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Chainsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Kindly take your time in putting caches back. put lids on properly.

The Chainsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Kindly take your time in putting caches back. put lids on properly. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;

The Chainsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Kindly take your time in putting caches back. put lids on properly. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Chainsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Kindly take your time in putting caches back. put lids on properly. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Chainsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Kindly take your time in putting caches back. put lids on properly. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;

The Chainsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Kindly take your time in putting caches back. put lids on properly. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Chainsaw Trail can be done any time, day or night. Because of the bright reflective coating on the containers, the power trail is most fun done at night. While doing the power trail please watch for traffic, be safe, and most of all have fun. Kindly take your time in putting caches back. put lids on properly. Oh and watch out for the normal critters. snakes and such.&lt;br /&gt;
Please come and enjoy the SAW (South Alberta Weekend) Many events such as the Welcome to Medicine Hat event, flash mob and poker run events, the CARMH (Cache And Relax Medicine Hat) event, and the CITO event, held each year.</groundspeak:long_description>

However to find it, you will first need to locate 13 other caches and LOOK UNDER THE CAP (LUTC) to get the Coordinates to the hiding place of this cache. I'm giving this cache a difficulty rating of 4 due to the amount of travel you will need to do in order locate all 13 caches.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There is no requirement to find these other caches in order, however, to get the proper coordinates to this cache, you must place your findings in the numeric order of the other 13 caches. ie: 01 LUTC; 02 LUTC; 03 LUTC; 04 LUTC; 05 LUTC; 06 LUTC; 07 LUTC; 08 LUTC; 09 LUTC; 10 LUTC; 11 LUTC; 12 LUTC; 13 LUTC. =

The GPS was set up for IHT Stagging area, and off we went. No mojo, so it seemed like a good idea to quickly grab an Ammo Can in Town and get our errends done. No mojo, so time is ticking and the decision was made to grab &quot;Grumpy&quot;, considering that was the prevelent mood compounded by the fact the cache was near where we started, and the road was all tore up...

We were all a little &quot;Grumpy&quot; before finding this one to continue the streak.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 Airfield Engineering Squadron&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Response&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 Airfield Engineer Squadron (4AES) was formed on June 1, 1993 as a unit of 4 Wing.&lt;br /&gt;
The mission of 4 AES is to provide engineer support to deployed air operations, enabling friendly forces to live, fly and fight anywhere in the world.&lt;br /&gt;
The unit has a secondary role to act as the centre of excellence and training for all airfield engineers within the Air Force.&lt;br /&gt;
The organization of 4 AES is capable of providing a wide spectrum of support to deployed operations that revolve around three phases: force bed down, sustainment, and recovery after attack.&lt;br /&gt;
The unit is established with a headquarter cadre of 23 personnel located in Cold Lake, while the remainder of the 400 personnel that make up the unit are located within Airfield Engineer Flights (AEFs) found in each of the Wing Construction Engineer Sections within Air Command.&lt;br /&gt;
The AEFs will normally work in support of their home wings. However, when tasked they will be brought together to form 4 AES as required.&lt;br /&gt;
There are a total of 10 Airfield Engineering Flights within the Air Force and these sub-units also form the basic unit for the conduct of the various training courses carried out at 4 AES.&lt;br /&gt;
When deployed, the unit will provide crash fire rescue, explosive ordnance disposal, horizontal construction, and vertical construction and utilities capabilities to the deployed wing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Be sure to come prepared, meaning bring something to sign the log with.  :)
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Dangerous If Provoked refers mainly to the area and inhabitants in which this cache has been placed. &lt;br /&gt;
I mainly selected this location for your safety, even though, IF you decide to go for this cache, you will be brushing limbs with characters responsible for all of the worlds forest fires.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The villains I speak of, are none other than TREES!!!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right, those cute green things we bring into our homes during X-Mas.  We allow them to provide shade on hot summer days, and we even allow them to provide the sap that is refined into delicious syrup for our pancakes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, TREES had a SHADY side.... They give us paper cuts, splinters, and of course, without Trees, we would never have Forest Fires!&lt;br /&gt;
These seeming-less monsters usually choose to grow in gangs, or large groups, sometimes know as Forests. &lt;br /&gt;
  So, be very careful when approaching TREES, and please, Bring a pen, not a pencil, you don't want to trigger a stampede.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you see a fire-hydrant, then you are within an arms reach, (or two) of the cache.  This could be your saving grace.  Unfortunately, the Cache is hanging, But not on the hydrant... &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
  Good luck, and please log back here if you successfully grab this cache, or for understandable reasons, choose not to.  We would love to hear your story, no matter how far out there it may sound.  Photos too, provided you are able to take any while fending off this fiend.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Happy Geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

About the Lancaster The Avro Lancaster Mk X was the Canadian built
version of the British built Avro Lancaster B III, a later variant
of the RAF Bomber Command's original Avro Lancaster B1, the main
difference between the UK and Canadian aircraft was the use of
Canadian and American instrumentation and electrical components. A
total of 430 Avro Lancaster Mk X's were built by Victory Aircraft
in Malton, Ontario in the last three years of WW2, they were flown
to Britain unarmed across the Atlantic where they were armed before
becoming operational. It is note that the Royal Canadian Air-Force
(RCAF) continued to operate the Avro Lancaster in a variety of
roles until mid 1963.

Felt a little &quot;Dopey&quot; for not finding this one sooner but we had a nice look around, in an abundence of nice caching hiding spots.

I've certainly not run into anything engineered in this way before, and Kid-K had a hoot during the elimination process.  A lot of fun for all. Just came back to add this note and add a favorite point since I couldn't figure out how while trying to submit my initial log vi mobile device.

You'll have to play Internet detective for this cache, and search for the Cache Title, selecting the first GeoCache Related result (but not one linking back to this cache Page)&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have discovered a very informative and entertaining website that delivers World Wide Geocaching News via a Pod Cast, (basically an online radio show), weekly. Though, in keeping with guidelines, I will not list it here, but encourage you to discover it for yourself. To find the Final Location of this Geocache, you will need to listen to their the show referred to in this caches namesake, and write down the very last spoken word. Take each letter in that word and assign it a number based on: A=1; B=2; C=3..... Y=25; Z=26 (you get the Idea). Once you have the Sum of those Numbers, add the number you came up with to the last three of the North Coordinates listed for this cache, and also subtract your number from the last three of the West Coordinates. This will give you the location of the Hidden Cache.
&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=0613c1e9a40ab2697febe5fcacff1b0d&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=47433357394e44&amp;amp;name=203338372e303a204e657074756e65277320436173746c6520&quot;&gt;GeoChecker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Though I logged the cache later, because my iPad was on the other side of the water with Kid-K and Drag-Along, (See Photo), I just checked the photo info at home, and it was taken at 1655 Hrs, an hour and twenty minutes after Shaughn was there.
Having said that, I feel a little better knowing that I tempted faith, by crossing the very thin pile of &quot;Beaver Sticks&quot;, which challenged my balance on more than a few occasions, especially when an overly friendly dog came across from the other side and tried to lick my face.
I'd have thought The Gun Nuts, would have considered my efforts Childs Play, and just bolted across the mini dam in quick order. LOL
I was wearing my good runners too, which are by the door still drying out.
After that, I continued up the hill to another cache, the kind of which I had only heard about before, while kid-K, and Drag-Along, with my iPad2, dove around to meet me.

Good to see some new caches going up around here.   Great Trails system too.

I saw these come on on my email radar during lunch, but only had a short time to get back to work as I was taking a software course, and didn't want to take a chance of walking in late.
  Course completed by 15:30 Hrs, I rushed home and tried in vain to get Drag-Along and Kid-K to come with me. So out the door I went.
  While walking down a snow covered but plowed dirt road, on the way to the cache, I saw a large bloodhound round the curve up ahead.  It stopped briefly, looked back, then began running toward me.  Two more dogs, each larger than the last, or so it seemed, rounded the corner, and also started running toward me, now baring as they came.
  With walking stick in hand, I planted one end into the snow, stopped, leaning on the stick and yelled to the dogs over their barking, &quot;Sorry boys, no time to play today!&quot;.  They kind of all looked at each-other, one turned and ran back, another past me, and the third right up to me, sniffed me and the stick then headed back from where it came.
  Their owners now rounded the bend and called the dogs back.  I was assured the dogs were friendly.
  Well, this got me thinking that maybe my walking stick wouldn't be much good against several more aggressive pack animals, should I be out caching alone.
LOL, now that's food for thought.
  Off to the cache again, I only saw dog tracks heading into the woods, so I thought I might just get a FTF on this one.  Well, had I been carrying tweezers, I'd have extracted the log from this very unique and creative cache container, and on checking the log, I noticed that Team G&amp;V had beat me to the find... Again.  LOL

&lt;p&gt;This squadron was
originally formed as No. 10 Army Co-Operation Squadron at Toronto
on October 5, 1932. They were later renumbered to be No. 110 &quot;City
of Toronto&quot; Army Co-Operation Squadron on November 15, 1937. The
squadron was deployed to England in February 1940 and was
redesignated as 400 Army Co-Operation Squadron on March 1 1941. At
the end of the war, 400 Squadron was disbanded on August 7, 1945,
at a captured airfield in Germany. 400 Squadron reformed at RCAF
Station Downsview (Toronto) on April 15, 1946 as an Auxiliary
Fighter-Bomber Squadron. Integration into the Canadian Armed Forces
brought about another name change, this time to 400 &quot;City of
Toronto&quot; Air Reserve Squadron. The Squadron's final name change
occurred in the eighties, becoming 400 Tactical Helicopter and
Training Squadron. The squadron moved to CFB Borden in 1996 and is
now equipped with the CH-146 Griffon.&lt;/p&gt;

  After spending almost an hour searching for the previous cache on my route &quot; RCAF 417 Squadron&quot;, and with not much luck, I was pleased to find this one in a relatively short time.  I really like the container and how it blends in so well in the open.
  The trail leading to this portion of the series was covered in compressed but melting snow.  The sun was high and i was warm enough for just a light jacket.

Thanks for putting these caches out here.  It's refreshing to find some caches so close to home.</groundspeak:text>

  We thought we had discovered the cache almost immediately, but found the container we were examining wasn't really what we were looking for and threw it back in search of bigger fish.  LOL.
  The Sun actually helped me locate the actual cache, as I stood looking around, my eye was zapped with a shiny reflective glare from the sun.  
   Kid-K who was searching nearby came over and I had her walk left and right until the glaring hiding spot caught her eye too.  We both had a laugh, this was no Red Herring for sure.

&lt;p&gt;History:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;409 Night Fighter
Squadron was created in England on 17 June 1941, and remained in
England until 24 August 1944 when the unit moved to France. July
1945 saw the squadron disbanded in the Netherlands.&lt;br /&gt;
In November 1954, 409 All Weather Fighter Squadron was re-formed at
RCAF Station Comox where they flew aircraft on North American Air
Defence Duty, later NORAD, on the west coast. In February 1968, 409
was integrated into the Canadian Armed Forces as an air defence
squadron and in 1984 the unit then moved to Cold lake Alberta.
Designated as 409 Tactical Fighter Squadron and re-equipped with
CF-18 Hornet aircraft, the Squadron was the first operational CF-18
Squadron.&lt;br /&gt;
June 1985 saw the Squadron move to Baden, Germany as part of NATO.
In October 1990 the Nighthawks deployed to the Persian Gulf as part
of Operation Friction, the Canadian contribution to Operation
Desert Shield/Storm. The squadron was disbanded at Baden, Germany
in 1991 and reformed back at Comox as 409 Combat Support Squadron
in 1993, and subsequently disbanded in July 1994. 409 TFS was
re-formed from the consolidation of 416 and 441 Squadrons on Jul 6
2006 at Cold Lake.&lt;/p&gt;

  Well, after a day of hit and miss Geocaching, the sun was sinking low in the sky, and I remembered I still had to get back to THIS cache of which  had invested so much time (see my DNF Entry Below).
  Kid-K and I were out earlier today, starting before noon. and hitting some caches outside of the Cold Lake City limits.  We searched for 6 and found 4.  LOL, 
  She asked me why I would log my DNF's, and I told her the reason was two fold.  Firstly, if we make an attempt, put in the effort, and cannot find it, that means one of two things.  
 1. The Cache owner has been very clever at hiding the cache, and we just haven't been as clever at discovering it.  So a DNF in that case, pays tribute to the person who hid the cache, and it also gives us a reason to return and look again.
  2. An Animal, Muggle, or something else has caused the Cache to no longer be there.  In that case, several DNFs will alert the cache owner that something may be wrong, and they may visit to confirm the condition of their cache.  But in most cases, my DNFs are a result of just not searching as well as others.  LOL
  After this cache, I had another DNF over behind the the Base Gym, which I'll  log shortly. I know it's there, but just can't find it yet. LOL.
  Okay, so  went back and ground Zero on my GPS still brought me to the place it did the other day, but I failed in my expanded search, to check an obvious spot, but with a little help, I knew where my shortfall lay, and immediately say the cache as I approached.
  I had a pretty good accuracy reading on my GPS again today, and just checked as I stood over the cache to see I was 8 meters out from my ground zero.  Not very much as far as caching n the woods goes, but just for the heck of it, I dad a way-point averaging with a reported 3 meter accuracy and am including the coordinates with this post, just in case anyone else would like to use them should they zero out where I did. :)
  Thanks again for checking and the helpful tip Chris. :)

  I see this cache was found only a couple of days ago, but I searched for nearly 50 minutes the first time, with an reported GPS accuracy ranging between 3 to 4 meters.
   I thought perhaps it might have fallen on the ground so considered that as I expanded my search for up to 30 meters around my ground zero reading.
   I may have just missed he obvious, though I was pretty detailed in my coverage.
   After finding my next cache in this series &quot;GC3AD15&quot; at 14:43 Hrs, I returned and spent another half hour approaching ground zero from different directions, and checking the ground some more.
  No luck, but I'll place this cache in my Watch list to see i someone else discovers it, or if it's been confirmed as not being muggled.
   
  Thanks for the Hunt just the same. :)</groundspeak:text>

kid-K and myself ended our afternoon of caching on a high note with this cache.  No DNF's today, but that's likely because we decided not to attempt any of the EVIL Series.
  This one took a little bit of looking, but find it we did.  Kid-K spotted it, but allowed me to sign first while she took in the scenery of Spring waking the woods.

She actually discovered this one, and I broke it while attempting to remove the log from it's tight container.
  With a bit of creative bending and crimping, I managed to affix the cache to it's unique camouflage and replace as found after signing the log with Kid-K.
  All looks well now.

  This cache took me a bit more looking as ground zero brought me within the wood-line about 12 meters, thought the GPS was reporting a 3 to 4 meter accuracy.  
  When I did find the cache, I re-calibrated, just to be sure, and decided to do a Way-point Averaging for 5 minutes at the actual Cache Location.  I've added the coordinates returned to this log.
  The cache is in good condition and well cammed.

Both Kid-K and I were up for some caching along the trails behind the gold Course on Base today and enjoyed getting this cache in the series, as the container is one we're not accustomed to seeing.  We took a quick stroll out onto the nearby golf course and took in the scenery.  Lot's of animal tracks and droppings in the melting snow, and some of the plants were starting to rise up from the ground sprouting little leaves in preparation for spring and summer to come.
  Nice hide and great hiding spot.

&lt;p&gt;History:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;421 Fighter Squadron formed at Digby, England on 9 April
1942. In war, they flew from bases in England, France Belgium, The
Netherlands and Germany. They were disbanded at Utersen, Germany,
on 10 July 1945. Re-formed at Chatham, N.B., on 15 September 1949.
The squadron was transferred to RAF Stn Odiham in England flying
RAF Vampire and Meteor aircraft for most of 1951. The squadron then
returned to Canada and reformed with the Sabre and participated in
&quot;Leapfrog 2', flying its F-86 Sabres across the Atlantic to
Grostenquin, France, on 28 September 1952. Later the squadron was
transferred to Zweibrucken, Germany, and equipped with CF-104
Starfighters as a component of No. 1 Canadian Air Group based in
Baden-Soellingen, West Germany. No. 421 Squadron flew the CF-104
until re-equipped with the CF-18 Hornet in the early 80's. With the
close of the European Air Wing the squadron was disbanded and its
aircraft placed in storage/rotation.&lt;/p&gt;

  This was literally the turning point in our caching day.  By this I mean we were heading back towards where we parked the car near the golf course.  We too the cut-line from the AETE cache to a point where the fence gave way to a path and shortly there after, PMQs came into view.  Using our Stealth caching skills, we nonchalantly discovered the cache, avoiding any would be prying eyes, and retreated a little deeper into the brush to sign the log, promptly but with great stealth, returning the cache to it's original hiding spot when done.
  Might want to keep an eye on this one as there appears to be a work project of sorts going on, where cables, or maybe natural gas lines are being laid very near by.  Lot's of trees have been marked (possibly for removal), in the area.

  It was a nice sunny day, and I'm on vacation for the week, so I decided to go after a few caches I hadn't taken the time to go for sooner.
  I followed a ATV trail to this one, and found it to be a bit muddy in places, with some pretty large puddles in places.  Easily navigable, but I'd recommend boots to keep from getting a soaker at this time of year.
  The cache was high and dry in good condition.

As the afternoon sky started to darken (Only in Cold Lake at 4PM), I grabbed this, my first cache of the day.
For the last find around the 11th of this month, I thought there were quite a few fresh tracks around the cache area. Perhaps someone had followed their dog in, or another cacher had been there recently but was not able to locate the cache.
I've always wondered why folks don't report their DNF's, unless maybe they don't know it's an option, or maybe are too self absorbed to admit they couldn't find one. LOL.
Well, further down the road / trail, I saw a bunch of ATV'ers gathered before I found the cache, and a few dogs yapping like coyotes. Maybe they were coyotes?
The path was all clear when when I reentered the trail system after finding the well placed cache and signing the log.
A great but short three cache run. Wish I had started sooner.

This is is my 1074th find so far.
Kid-K and I went out today in search of some newly published caches and these were just around the corner from where we live.
Apart from a dog walker, no muggles in site.  We make extra tracks in the snow to help prevent someone from accidentally finding the cache.
cache was empty apart from log and geo-note so we dropped off a Yen coin and a small hot-wheel like army jeep.
Took a photo for the cache Gallery, and SL.

&lt;p&gt;History:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;414 Army Co-operation
Squadron formed at Croydon, England, on 13 August 1941. Changing
names to 414 Fighter Reconnaissance Squadron on 28 June 1943, the
squadron was based at a number of airfields in England and on the
continent. They were disbanded at Luneberg, Germany, on 7 August
1945. Absorbing elements of 14 Photographic Squadron, 414
Photographic Squadron formed at RCAF Station Rockliffe on 1 April
1947 and disbanded on 1 November 1950.&lt;br /&gt;
414 Fighter Squadron formed at RCAF Station Bagotville on 1
November 1952 and went to 4 Wing Baden-Soellingen on 24 August
1953. They deactivated on 14 July 1957 and reformed at RCAF Station
North Bay on 5 August as 414 All-Weather Fighter Squadron. The
squadron disbanded on 30 June 1964, reforming at RCAF Station St
Hubert on 15 September 1967 as 414 Electronic Warfare Squadron. In
August 1972, 414 moved to CFB North Bay and stayed there until
1992, when they were split in two with one part going to Comox as
414 Composite Squadron and the other part going to Greenwood as 434
Composite Squadron. 414 changed its name to Combat Support Squadron
in 1993 where it was equipped with the CT-133 Silver Star.&lt;br /&gt;
In 2002, 414 Squadron was disbanded and its remaining two aircraft
retired. On 7 December 2007, the Minister of National Defence
authorized the reactivation of 414 Electronic Warfare Squadron to
provide electronic warfare support to the combat training of the
Canadian Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

  I had just come from the previous cache, &quot;Bent Tree in the Making&quot;, and had mentioned in that log about the ATV'ers gathered ahead.  Well, the road adjacent this cache is where they had all been hanging out.
  Glad they were gone when I started looking for this one.
Also, really great photos in this caches Gallery added by Mkfmly in a previous post.
  Took some looking in the dimming light, but Geo-Skills prevailed again!

  Though a short day caching and with a late start, I had to use my flashlight to sign the log on this one.  Dropped a Path Tag (can't remember where I picked it up), and a geocachers mini trackable Geocoin here.
  It was a nice day for caching and the little snow that covered the ground was not a hindrance at all.

LOL, when I originally attempted to log this, I brought up another cache with a similar name that I had already found.  Fond my mistake when I got home and went to check thos caches log to find my post missing.  Okay, well the TB that I reported not at the cache, is likely at the cache I logged by mistake.
Here's my original log for this cache. :)
Went to work while sick as a dog today. Got home and saw this cache. Figured I could be miserable anywhere, so off I went. Took some guess work, but I finally solved the puzzle.
Took and hid &quot;ready to hide cache&quot;, left roll of hunter orange trail tape and a two pack of fuses.

BYOP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Okay, there's a Parking Location, then a very short distance away is the starting point.  &lt;br/&gt;  When you reach these coordinates, hold your flashlight about shoulder lever and slowly scan the trees until you locate 3 reflective markers.  &lt;br/&gt;  Follow the consecutive single markers until you locate another set of multiple markers.&lt;br/&gt;  Standing close to these multiple markers on one tree, slowly turn scanning with your Light until you see a reflective &quot;X&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;  Head in that direction, and locate the Cache.&lt;br/&gt;  Once located, you will need to solve a FIELD PUZZLE before you can access the Cache Log.&lt;br/&gt;  Everything you need to solve this PUZZLE is located on the Cache Container.&lt;br/&gt;Happy Caching.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN3GZNX - OX3GZNX Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;The Final and Physical Location of the Cache.&lt;br/&gt;PK3GZNX - OX3GZNX Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 54° 25.887 W 110° 17.241&lt;br/&gt;Good Place to Park, just meters away from your Starting Point.&lt;br/&gt;S13GZNX - OX3GZNX Stage 1&lt;br/&gt;N 54° 25.892 W 110° 17.275&lt;br/&gt;This is where you should be to start scanning for Reflective Trail Markers.  </groundspeak:long_description>

How wrong can you be? The friend asked why Kung Foo Panda Poo, so we had to show him...in detail...

Ready to Find!
I checked last night and thought I had misplaced a Way-Point Marker.
As it turns out, I mistyped the coordinate into my GPS and found another Marker quite by chance.
Went out this morning and All Way-Point markers are in their proper places.
When if there is any doubt that you are finding these way-points in order, I've placed a number from 1 - 11 on the bottom of each marker, but after this morning I'm confident they are all in place.
Happy hunting and Please leave Markers hanging where you find them. :)</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;This unmistakable and beautiful corvid can be found year-round
anywhere in the province except in the northeastern Canadian
Shield. They are most common in grass and parkland. Magpies thrive
in wide-open spaces, leaving the deep forests to their crow and
raven cousins. Magpies flourished with, and then declined with the
great bison herds of earlier days. But these adaptable birds have
returned in numbers with cattle and people. Like all corvids the
Black-billed Magpie is an opportunistic omnivore hunting or
foraging for seeds, fruit, insects, carrion, eggs and occasionally
the nestlings of other birds. They enjoy suet, peanuts and other
treats at feeders, and are quick to exploit any pet food left
outdoors. The nest is a fortress-like domed structure of sticks
with one or two entrances, usually in a small tree or within
shrubbery. The nest cup is fortified with mud and soft materials.
As few as two, or as many as nine eggs are incubated for 14 to 23
days. Young are fledged in three or four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;I suggest approaching this geocache from the Cadet Survival Camp as the other road in/out of the area is known to suck vehicles into black holes. If people are training in the area, please respect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This uncommon woodpecker is a year round resident of the boreal
forest and mountain regions of Alberta. Dense, mature conifer
forests with burnt tree stands are essential to this woodpecker's
success. Like its cousin the American Three-toed Woodpecker, this
woodpecker forages by scaling bark from dead trees to find insects.
Seeds and fruit supplement their diet. It is unwary but may be hard
to spot since its dark back is well camouflaged against the burnt
trees on which it prefers to forage. A live tree with rotten
heartwood is the nesting site of choice. Black-backed Woodpecker
nests are excavated five to 15 feet high in the tree. Two to six
white eggs are laid. Both parents incubate the eggs for 14 days.
Young are fledged 15 days later.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Please be sure to pull completely off&lt;br/&gt;the highway on the obvious parking available nearest the cache.&lt;br/&gt;Cache contains Log Book and Small Swag, though you will need to&lt;br/&gt;bring your own writing utensil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This largest of passerine birds can be found all year in the&lt;br/&gt;mountains, foothills and boreal regions of Alberta. In the last few&lt;br/&gt;decades they are becoming increasingly common in the parkland&lt;br/&gt;region, especially in winter. Common Ravens are typically denizens&lt;br/&gt;of the forests, but are becoming more common in urban areas,&lt;br/&gt;especially around landfills in winter. Also look for them in the&lt;br/&gt;parking lots of suburban malls at the edges of cities where edible&lt;br/&gt;litter might be found. Like many omnivores, ravens are&lt;br/&gt;opportunistic feeders taking seeds, fruit, eggs, nestlings of other&lt;br/&gt;birds and any insects or small animals that they are skillful&lt;br/&gt;enough to catch. Congregations of ravens are often seen scavenging&lt;br/&gt;roadkills. Bulky nests are usually constructed on cliff edges, but&lt;br/&gt;occasionally in trees or on buildings as well. These sturdy&lt;br/&gt;constructions are made of branches and twigs, supplemented with&lt;br/&gt;earth and lined with moss, bark shreds and other soft materials.&lt;br/&gt;Three to five or more eggs may be laid and are incubated by the&lt;br/&gt;female for 18 or 19 days. The young are fledged about six weeks&lt;br/&gt;after hatching. </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">79 of 99. We stumbled on this cache &quot;GC2BV7F 99-day challenge - Calgary, Alberta&quot; and on a whim we decided to take up the challenge. Our start date was 30-Jul-11 and continues still. The downside is it is late in the year and as hockey spools up, the light gets shorter and the winter weather starts this will only increase in difficulty.

Glad to see this cache up and running. Up early and needed a cache to continue the streak and went out for the FTF. Apparently RJDJ reads their email and can see in the dark.... a clever hide and definitely not like the rest, great job.

TNLNSL. TFTH. Thanks, Cache Slinger</groundspeak:text>

In fall, crows form large aggregations called 'murders'.&lt;br/&gt;These groups migrate out of the province and remain in large groups&lt;br/&gt;for the winter. The crows return in smaller groups very early in&lt;br/&gt;spring. Some crows in southern Alberta do not migrate. These&lt;br/&gt;widespread black birds are common along forest edges, grasslands&lt;br/&gt;and parklands as well as cities. As long as there are suitable&lt;br/&gt;nest-building trees, it seems that crows can make a livelihood.&lt;br/&gt;Like all corvids, American Crows are omnivores and will eat such&lt;br/&gt;items as carrion, food scraps, seeds, fruit, insects, eggs and&lt;br/&gt;other birds' nestlings. They will come to feeders, especially those&lt;br/&gt;supplying whole peanuts. A mated pair builds their nest together&lt;br/&gt;very high in a treetop. This bulky construction of branches and&lt;br/&gt;twigs is supplemented with bark shreds and lined with soft&lt;br/&gt;materials such as grass, moss or man-made materials. Four or five&lt;br/&gt;eggs are laid and incubated for 18 days. The young are fledged&lt;br/&gt;about five weeks after hatching.  </groundspeak:long_description>

We were chatting with Team G&amp;V about Jiggs smells a ... and decided to go out for more than our daily minimum and some FTFs.

A coFTF with Team G&amp;V and a nice quick find as expected. We don't know why we drove past this one as I must have not downloaded it to the GPS (Used the phone to check) TNLNSL, Thanks Cache Slinger.

&lt;p&gt;It is a very large and plump bird; its overall length is about
50–67 inches (130–170 cm), courtesy of the huge beak
which measures 13–14.4 inches (330–370 mm) in males and
10.4–13 in (260–330 mm) in females. It has a wingspan
of about 95–120 in (240–300 cm). Body weight can range
between 10 and 30 lb (4.5 and 14 kg), although typically these
birds average between 11 and 20 lb (5.0 and 9.1 kg). The plumage is
almost entirely bright white, except the black primary and
secondary remiges, which are hardly visible except in flight. From
early spring until after breeding has finished in mid-late summer,
the breast feathers have a yellowish hue. After moulting into the
eclipse plumage, the upper head often has a grey hue, as blackish
feathers grow between the small wispy white crest. The bill is long
and flat, with a large throat sac, and in the breeding season vivid
orange like the iris, the bare skin around the eye, and the feet.
In the breeding season, there is a laterally flattened &quot;horn&quot; on
the upper bill, about one-third the bill's length behind the tip.
This is shed off after the birds have mated and laid their eggs,
and outside the breeding season the bare parts become duller in
color, with the naked facial skin yellow and the bill, pouch and
feet an orangy-flesh color. Apart from the difference in size,
males and females look exactly alike. Immature birds have light
grey plumage with darker brownish nape and remiges. Their bare
parts are dull grey. Hatchlings are naked at first, then grow white
down feathers all over, before moulting to the immature
plumage.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Canada’s four CC-177 Globemaster III strategic airlifters
were delivered in 2007-2008. The CC-177 in Canada helps provide
everything from the rapid delivery of troops and cargo transport to
oversized combat equipment from coast to coast to coast and to
anywhere else worldwide. Rapid, reliable and flexible, the
strategic and tactical CC-177 is equipped with advanced digital
avionics, has a maximum range of approximately 5,500 nautical miles
and can carry a payload of up to 160,000 pounds (72, 727 kilograms)
due to its four engines (Pratt &amp; Whitney 2040 series) that
produce 40,440 pounds (18, 343 kilograms) of thrust. To illustrate
the power of these aircraft, one CC-177 can haul three CH-146
Griffon helicopters with refuelling tanks, or one Leopard 2 tank,
or as many as 102 paratroopers. But perhaps most useful of all, the
CC-177's ability to fly long distances and land in remote airfields
makes it a premier transporter for military, humanitarian and
peacekeeping missions. Only 12 days after entering service with the
Canadian Forces, Canada’s first CC-177 carried out its first
operational mission: the delivery of 30 metric tonnes (30,000
kilograms) of emergency relief supplies, collected by the Red Cross
and the Canadian International Development Agency, to the people of
Jamaica in the wake of Hurricane Dean. The CC-177 Globemaster III
is used for a wide range of strategic and tactical missions for
Canada’s Air Force and only requires a crew of three: pilot,
co-pilot and loadmaster. Pilots can fly the CC-177 wearing
night-vision goggles, which provides a significant tactical
advantage when flying into hostile territory. It can also take off
and land on unpaved runways as short as 1,067 metres (3,500 feet)
and as narrow as 27.4 metres (90 feet) by day or by night. The
CC-177 have been supporting Joint Task Force Afghanistan on
Operation Athena in Afghanistan. Since 2007, they have been
conducting regular sustainment flights from Canada with the
semi-annual rotation of troops in and out of Afghanistan operating
on the air bridge between Canada and Afghanistan. (See related web

Endangered by DDT, Ospreys have made&lt;br/&gt;a remarkable recovery since that pesticide was banned in the 1970s.&lt;br/&gt;It is now, once again, a fairly common bird of the boreal forest&lt;br/&gt;and foothills region of Alberta, probably absent only from the arid&lt;br/&gt;southeastern part of the province, except during migration. Since&lt;br/&gt;Ospreys catch fish, their only prey, they are always associated&lt;br/&gt;with lakes or streams. At least two dozen pairs nest along the Bow&lt;br/&gt;River, from Banff to Calgary. If not disturbed, they readily nest&lt;br/&gt;within urban areas. In Calgary, at least seven pairs were resident&lt;br/&gt;in 2004. The first birds arrive in mid-April. Most depart for more&lt;br/&gt;tropical areas by the end of September, some going well into South&lt;br/&gt;America. Osprey, usually flying about 30 m (100 feet) up, scan the&lt;br/&gt;water for fish, their only food. They often hover in one spot for a&lt;br/&gt;prolonged period before making a spectacular plunge dive, wings&lt;br/&gt;raised, feet extended out front, to capture their prey. Sharp&lt;br/&gt;talons and spiny soles ensure a good grip. Rising to the surface,&lt;br/&gt;with a few flaps they again become airborne, then shaking to rid&lt;br/&gt;themselves of excess water, continue flying. Shortly after, they&lt;br/&gt;re-position the fish headfirst, to streamline their flight. Bald&lt;br/&gt;Eagles often try to steal their prey. Sometimes they capture a fish&lt;br/&gt;too large to carry. Unable to let go, they flap and drag the prey&lt;br/&gt;to the shore. If it is a really large specimen, it may pull the&lt;br/&gt;Osprey underwater, drowning it. Most of their prey fish are species&lt;br/&gt;of little interest to man. Their nest, re-used year after year, is&lt;br/&gt;a bulky structure. In the past, it usually was sited on a strong&lt;br/&gt;branch or on the top of a broken tree, a cliff pinnacle or even on&lt;br/&gt;the ground. In recent years, Ospreys have taken to using man-made&lt;br/&gt;structures - utility poles, electrical or communication towers,&lt;br/&gt;church steeples and nesting platforms especially erected for them.&lt;br/&gt;The female does most of the incubating of the usually three eggs,&lt;br/&gt;for 32 to 33 days; the male bringing her food at the nest site. She&lt;br/&gt;broods and tends to the young for a further 30 days. They begin to&lt;br/&gt;fly at 51 to 59 days of age, becoming independent within one week,&lt;br/&gt;but remain near the nest for up to eight weeks.</groundspeak:long_description>

Since the use of&lt;br/&gt;that pesticide was banned in 1972, Bald Eagles are once again being&lt;br/&gt;seen where they have been absent for 40 years or more. These birds&lt;br/&gt;are primarily associated with water; oceans, large lakes and&lt;br/&gt;rivers. In Alberta, during the summer, they are most common in the&lt;br/&gt;north and in the western foothills and mountains. At the onset of&lt;br/&gt;winter, when waterways freeze-up, they move southward. During&lt;br/&gt;migration, and sometimes in winter, they may be seen almost&lt;br/&gt;anywhere in the province, particularly where waterfowl&lt;br/&gt;concentrations occur. While primarily associated with pristine&lt;br/&gt;wilderness areas, Bald Eagles are tolerant of the presence of man&lt;br/&gt;if an assured food supply is available. As a result, in winter,&lt;br/&gt;they mainly frequent open water such as at power generating&lt;br/&gt;stations and major rivers in urban environments kept open by warm&lt;br/&gt;water from sewage treatment plants. In December-January, it is&lt;br/&gt;possible to see up to a dozen individuals along the Bow River&lt;br/&gt;within Calgary. One pair has taken up year-round residency, now&lt;br/&gt;nesting within the city. In 2002 and 2003, the nest was on the&lt;br/&gt;Inglewood Golf Course. In 2004, presumably the same birds nested on&lt;br/&gt;the west side of the Bow River, opposite Beaverdam Flats Park,&lt;br/&gt;adjacent to the very busy Deerfoot Trail highway. This is the first&lt;br/&gt;time in recorded history, perhaps the first time ever, that this&lt;br/&gt;has happened. Previously the river would have frozen in winter and&lt;br/&gt;fewer nest trees might have been available. Fish, alive or dead,&lt;br/&gt;form the bulk of the eagle's food. The eagles often harass a&lt;br/&gt;successful Osprey until it drops its catch. In migration and in&lt;br/&gt;winter, they also feed on sick or injured ducks and geese and&lt;br/&gt;carrion such as deer which escape from hunters but later die from&lt;br/&gt;their wounds. Bald Eagles mate for life. They build a bulky stick&lt;br/&gt;nest, usually near a waterway, in a large isolated tree or rarely&lt;br/&gt;on a rocky outcrop, using it year after year. It is added to&lt;br/&gt;annually, making it the largest nest of any North American bird.&lt;br/&gt;This structure sometimes measures four metres deep and three metres&lt;br/&gt;wide. Usually two white eggs are laid. Incubation is by both sexes&lt;br/&gt;for 35 to 46 days. The young are tended by both parents and are&lt;br/&gt;able to leave the nest at 10 to 11 weeks of age, returning to feed&lt;br/&gt;and rest for several weeks afterwards. </groundspeak:long_description>

It occurs only in the&lt;br/&gt;southeastern part of the province, in the grassland region. This&lt;br/&gt;pale-coloured hawk is strictly a bird of the open grasslands,&lt;br/&gt;almost never found near urban environments. The closest it comes to&lt;br/&gt;humans is when it nest in the only available trees of a farm&lt;br/&gt;shelterbelt. It winters from southern USA to central Mexico,&lt;br/&gt;returning to Alberta by late March, and usually departing again&lt;br/&gt;before September ends. Ferruginous Hawks prey mainly on ground&lt;br/&gt;squirrels, jackrabbits and woodrats. It is a powerful bird with a&lt;br/&gt;large gape (mouth). This hawk will make long flights in pursuit of&lt;br/&gt;its prey, and is often observed on the ground awaiting the&lt;br/&gt;re-appearance of a ground squirrel from its den. They are also&lt;br/&gt;capable of catching birds, other mammals and snakes, all part of&lt;br/&gt;their diet. The nest site most often is in the crotch of a small to&lt;br/&gt;medium-sized tree, often the only one for kms around, usually 3-10&lt;br/&gt;m (10-33 ft.) above the ground. They will also use a rock&lt;br/&gt;outcropping, a steep slope, a man-made nest platform or nest on the&lt;br/&gt;ground when no other site is available. If successful, the same&lt;br/&gt;nest will be used year after year, becoming massive with the annual&lt;br/&gt;addition of sticks, old bones and other material and lined with&lt;br/&gt;vegetation, bark and livestock dung. They are aggressive, attacking&lt;br/&gt;anything that nears the nest site. The three to five bluish white&lt;br/&gt;eggs are laid, usually in April. Incubation is for about 28 days,&lt;br/&gt;with the young fledging at about two months of age.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Please be sure to pull completely off&lt;br/&gt;the highway on the obvious parking available nearest the cache.&lt;br/&gt;Cache contains Log Book and Small Swag, though you will need to&lt;br/&gt;bring your own writing utensil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Peregrine Falcon is a cosmopolitan species, found on all&lt;br/&gt;continents except Antarctica. The eastern North American population&lt;br/&gt;was almost extirpated in the 1950s and '60s due to bio-accumulation&lt;br/&gt;of the pesticide DDT, which caused thinning of eggshells, resulting&lt;br/&gt;in egg breakage when brooding. With re-introductions, after DDT was&lt;br/&gt;banned in USA and Canada in 1972, this noble falcon is again being&lt;br/&gt;seen in most of its former range. Although still rare, chance&lt;br/&gt;encounters may take place anywhere in Alberta during migration,&lt;br/&gt;particularly along wetlands such as at Beaverhill Lake where&lt;br/&gt;shorebirds and waterfowl offer an assured food supply. Nesting is&lt;br/&gt;again taking place in Alberta, along the Red Deer River and in the&lt;br/&gt;Lake Athabasca area. They also now nest within Calgary and Edmonton&lt;br/&gt;on tall buildings which serve as pseudo-cliffs, their natural nest&lt;br/&gt;sites. In Calgary, they nest downtown on the Telus building, and on&lt;br/&gt;Craigie Hall at the University (not in 2004). Another nest is on&lt;br/&gt;the tower of the gas plant at Balzac. A pair nested at Raven Rocks&lt;br/&gt;in Fish Creek Prov. Park in 1996-97. By 2002, 23 pairs were known&lt;br/&gt;to be nesting in Alberta, from Edmonton southward. Migrants begin&lt;br/&gt;arriving in early April and depart by October. A few are&lt;br/&gt;occasionally observed during the winter months. Birds make up most&lt;br/&gt;of the Peregrine's diet. Many species are taken, with a high&lt;br/&gt;percentage being shorebirds and waterfowl, particularly during&lt;br/&gt;migration. Rock Pigeons are a mainstay in cities. On the prairies,&lt;br/&gt;Franklin's Gulls are a frequent prey. Birds are captured in the air&lt;br/&gt;in spectacular breath-taking stoops of up to 360 kph (200 mph).&lt;br/&gt;Also consumed are some mice and insects. The natural nest site is a&lt;br/&gt;ledge on a cliff or rocky outcrop, or occasionally on the top of a&lt;br/&gt;hollow stump. In cities, a ledge on a tall-building is chosen. The&lt;br/&gt;actual nest is merely a hollow scrape with nothing added. An&lt;br/&gt;average of three to four eggs are laid, incubated by both sexes,&lt;br/&gt;but mainly by the female, for about 28-30 days. She broods and&lt;br/&gt;feeds them for the first two weeks, leaving them alone more after&lt;br/&gt;that time to join in hunting. She still does most of the feeding,&lt;br/&gt;but the male will do so when she is absent. The young begin to&lt;br/&gt;exercise at 21 days, when they also begin to tear up their own&lt;br/&gt;food. They fledge at 35-45 days after they hatch. The smaller males&lt;br/&gt;are normally the first to fly. They remain near the nest site,&lt;br/&gt;taking another six weeks to become fully independent, in time to&lt;br/&gt;begin their autumn migration, going as far as northern South&lt;br/&gt;America. </groundspeak:long_description>

We made a little detour and discoved a Brass Cap. Although it is not part of OFTH's famous Alberta Virtual Brass Cap Cache it is nice to discover them.

Out on the Iron Horse Trail the day before we saw a bird of prey like some of these sitting casually on the fence post as we drove by. I could have been the falcon or the hawk but the colouring was slightly different. Very impressive none the less.</groundspeak:text>

It migrates sporadically in winter in response to prey&lt;br/&gt;availability, along with northern hawk and boreal owls. This icon&lt;br/&gt;of the deep woods is found in all types of forest where there are&lt;br/&gt;brushy clearings and openings. Although large, the Great Gray is&lt;br/&gt;quiet and discreet, it is usually concealed part way up a tree on a&lt;br/&gt;horizontal branch where they are very well camouflaged against the&lt;br/&gt;bark of the tree. It is a real treat to spot one of these&lt;br/&gt;magnificent owls perched on a post or on top of a tree. The&lt;br/&gt;formidable looking Great Gray Owl often hunts at dawn and dusk, and&lt;br/&gt;lives almost exclusively on mice and voles. Snow cover does not&lt;br/&gt;necessarily protect the furtive rodent. The Great Gray can locate a&lt;br/&gt;vole by sound under eighteen inches of snow where it plunges&lt;br/&gt;through to pluck out the hapless prey. The Great Gray Owl does not&lt;br/&gt;build its own nest. Like other large owls, it uses old hawk, raven&lt;br/&gt;or crow nests that are high above the ground. Three to five white&lt;br/&gt;eggs are incubated for a month. Young are fledged in another&lt;br/&gt;month.</groundspeak:long_description>
