Got to speak to seachwise015 who was very relieved that I was only there for caching purposes as my appearance alarmed him.  

First time letterbox hybrid for me so he walked me through the process.

Geocaching Convoy. There needs to be a cache here.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This ideal location is along one of the small back roads that lead
into the Tallangatta State Forest.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bridge crosses the King Parrot Creek which is home to some
of Victoria's threatened species of fish, especially the Maquarie
Perch (Macquaria australasica).&lt;/p&gt;

excellent coords, convenient nearby parking and usually be around
the end of the guard rail if possible.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
They are usually micros but might be a little bigger. Oh yeah, and
they are all on or in a guard rail.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Permission to list this cache has been given by the original
&lt;b&gt;GRF&lt;/b&gt; creater: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=db21706f-5d88-47fa-874f-d4ed4ed81e76&quot;&gt;Lostnspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Guard Rail Fun! A nice quick park and grab a micro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
Looking for a really challenging cache? This isn't it!&lt;br /&gt;
Looking for a magnificent location with a beautiful view? This
isn't it!&lt;br /&gt;
Looking for a cache where you can drop off some travel bugs? This
isn't it!&lt;br /&gt;
Looking for a nice, easy cache that doesn't invovle a walk in the
woods? You won't get any ticks, your shoes won't get dirty, and
unless you are really, really directionally challenged, you won't
spend very long looking for this cache.&lt;br /&gt;
If you hate micros, please don't stop! Otherwise, I hope you have
fun, and happy caching!&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes we just need an easy find in order to reach a particular
milestone, or maybe the weather isn't conducive to a walk in the
forest. Sometimes we just need to feel a little accomplishment for
finding a cache, even if it is an easy one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache will put you very close to a very popular muggle area
where the geokiddies will be nagging you if the weather is right.
&lt;p&gt;Please enjoy this fast, quick easy find&lt;/p&gt;

If I hadn't seen their car last Saturday afternoon, I would have thought that the solomonfamily drive around in a specially kitted out cache-detector van complete with FTF cache detecting radar equipment and huge aerials [;)].  I make that 27 minutes from the moment the cache was posted until it was found [:O].  That has got to be some sort of record [:D].  (I wonder what the record actually [i]is[/i] for someone putting pen to logbook after the actual publishing of the cache when they [i]don't have prior knowledge[/i] that it is coming on line).

Anyway, with the FTF well and truly smashed, it meant that I could take my time heading home (and I sincerely thank solomonfamily for doing their in-field iPhone logs [:D]) so I headed to GZ where a short search soon had me with the cache in hand at 18:25 – our 36th STF [:)].  Another beautiful area for a cache and I even spotted a small mob of 'roos basking in the late afternoon sun near the bike path home [:D].

After finding the nearby Datruk hide I took a nice short stroll up here. Grass is long so was wary of the snake warning, although the weather said I shouldn't be. Until a rabbit rustled the grass ahead of me as it sped away and scared me half to death! Wandered over to GZ and spotted the cache straight away (it's been a good day for spotting!). Retrieved cautiously to avoid spider risk and then signed, took geocoin, and returned.

Thanks again Datruk. This park is clear of caches at last!!</groundspeak:text>

There were myriad potential hidey-holes in this grand old dame and sure enough, 15 minutes had elapsed before I was finally logging the find at 13:45 (and that was more by good fortune than good management [:O]) just as I was about to give up the ghost.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The road the cache sits in forms a beautiful green cathedral and it is essential to take a few photos. The cache is a 1 litre container containing the usual swaps. Please post any photos you take.  From 1838 the area formed part of an extensive grazing grant that was developed further by a succession of owners up until the 1920s. The original sub-division of Chirnside Park was, at that time, known as Mooroolbark Park. Around 1000 acres (4 km²) of mainly rich black basaltic soil was grazed and cultivated, watered from two perpetual springs&lt;br/&gt;In 1921 George Chirnside sold Werribee Park, moving the family's stud herds and the contents of Werribee Mansion to Mooroolbark Park. After George Chirnside's death in 1941, permission to sell the estate was given in 1950 and finalised some years later. Subdivision was approved by the then Shire of Lillydale in 1956 with the residential area, centred on the two storey stone homestead, country club and golf course, named Chirnside Park in 1962 in honour of Thomas Chirnside, who founded the Chirnside empire in 1839.Amadeo DeVincentiis, an Italian from Abruzzo, also owned great swathes of what is now known as Chirnside Park. However, he sold it for a paltry amount in the 1960s, and within years the fortunate purchasers stood to make thousands. Amadeo attempted to rescind the sale, spending thousands, but failed.Formally West Lilydale, the surrounding region became known as Chirnside Park in the 1970s, the Post Office opening on 25 September 1979.  Nominally a suburb, Chirnside Park is a satellite community of Lilydale. Thus the services that cannot be met in the nearby shopping complex are found elsewhere. The residential area is set around the large 18-hole golf course, though its future is in doubt. Further residential development exists to the west and north. In area, however, most of the 'suburb' still retains a rural flavour, extending well into the Yarra Valley to the north, with commercial wineries, orchards and livestock farming, as well as large area residential estates. The Heritage Golf and Country Club, designed by Jack Nicklaus, also nestles in the northwest corner of the suburb directly on the Yarra River.&lt;br/&gt;Geocaching is about sharing the little gems you find packaged as an adventure for the next person. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I was reading about OpenCaching and thought I would come out to this one. My youngest geoprince also wanted to be in &quot;Daddies Carrrrrrr&quot;.

On route I discovered this was a dual listing with GC.com which is always a problem for me as while I want to record the find on both sites I dont really .want to distort my count - I seem to treat each time I come across this in a different way... Today I will do both...

The cache itself was an easy drive by find, no sooner than I was out of the car, I had the cache in hand - I was also helped by the fact that the external cammo gave it away.

Our thanks for the cache and an opportunity to log our first OX cache - as for the first to fiind - nope many have logged the GC before us.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;This will be a series with a picnic theme.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Take-a-Break caches will be in places that give the weary
cache seeker a chance to relax between caches, eat lunch at a
table, with a toilet block nearby, and playground equipment where
possible for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a lovely little park in the middle of bustling suburbia.
There is car parking available, also children's play equipment,
bar-b-que's and a toilet block. A nice place to take a break during
a busy day of caching.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is hidden in the attached bushland flora reserve area,
out of the casual view of any muggles in the park and is pretty
easy to find, though you might want a stick or a protective
glove.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This container is larger than a film canister but smaller than a
200ml systema, PLeasae bring your own pen and replace the layer of
leaf litter that hides the cache when you return it.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;*WARNING - CAUTION
REQUIRED*&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please use extreme caution if your GPSr has you heading into a
garden bed. As there have been quite a few needles found in this
area. The cache is not located in this garden bed&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The name &quot;Staley's: recalls Andrew Gray Staley (1890 - 1981), a
flamboyant super salesman, an innovator in the textile industry,
and in 1930 a founder of the famous Australian clothing
manufacturer &quot;Holeproof, (Australia)&quot;
&lt;p&gt;In 1942 Holeproof established a factory near this site, with a
frontage on what is now known as Maroondah Highway. Holeproof
donated parts of this reserve to the City of Ringwood in 1969.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache will have in an area that is undergoing a very
drastic and major change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area has a Skate park, Rotunda, Picnic tables and free

We've been so close to this park on so many occasions, being rather big fans of the sports shop across the road - But today turned right instead of left and visited here. Some muggle hoodlums in hoodies at the nearby skate park,  but that didn't affect us as we fumbled around (glad for the warning about the garden bed), before logic took hold and the cache was cleverly found.

Wonder what they'll do with that big slab of land next door?

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the sixth cache in this series to show just how many scouts
we have in Australia.
&lt;p&gt;My kids are part of this great movement and I am a leader as
well. Some of these kids have shown an interest in geocaching so
why not help them participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is at another little Scout Hall&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Scouting in Australia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The visits made to Australia by Baden-Powell in 1912 and in later
years (1931-34) encouraged the extension of the Movement in
Australia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although each State Branch in Australia was directly and
individually responsible to Imperial Headquarters in London, there
grew a desire to achieve co-operation at a higher level so a
Federal Council of nominees from each State Council was formed in
1922. This body later appointed an Australian Commissioner. For
more than 30 years, Scouting was co-ordinated by the Australian
Federal Scout Council which functioned as a Branch of the British
Boys Scout Association.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1958 the adjuration of the Australian Boys Scout
Association took place and in 1967 the National Organisation was
incorporated by Royal Charter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The name of the Association was changed to the Scout Association of
Australia in 1971.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Australia was made a member of the World Organisation of the Scout
Movement (WOSM) in 1953 and is a Founder Member of the Asia-Pacific
Region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the field of support and co-operation with other member
countries of the Asia Pacific Region, the organisation has
contributed to a number of international friendship and community
development projects. Over the years, Australian Scouts have
supported emerging Scout Associations in the South Pacific and
around the world. A twinning project with the Bangladesh Scouts,
known as the &quot;Bangladesh-Australia Child Health&quot; (BACH) project,
made a dramatic impact on child health in project villages during
its operation from 1986–1992.</groundspeak:long_description>

eastern suburb
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The original Ringwood village emerged in the mid to late 19th
century, following the initial sale of land in the 1850s and the
local proliferation of grazing, fruit growing and brick making
activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction of the railway from Hawthorn to Lilydale
(through Ringwood) in 1882 resulted in a consolidation of township
facilities, including the provision of local churches, banks and
schools to accommodate for a growing village and regional
population. In 1889, Ringwood Station was erected as a symbol of
the increasing importance of the township along the railway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proclamation in 1924 of the Borough of Ringwood coincided
with the electrification of the railway line, providing a stimulus
for Major Township development and subdivision. Considerable
suburban expansion during the post-war period gave rise to the
declaration in 1960 of the City of Ringwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point Ringwood gained formal recognition as part of the
broader metropolitan region, emphasised by the erection of Eastland
in 1967 as a major 'new format' retail Centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is located near one of Victoria's oldest hotels that was
built in 1840.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a micro cache that will take some small swaps.&lt;/p&gt;

Having the perk of birthday leave, I arrived home after an outing (in which my one plan to treat myself today got cancelled on me :( ) to see this one pop up, so decided to try and see if a FTF would cheer me up.

Arrived there soon enough, and had a little problem with elevations, but soon had the cache in hand. And scored a lovely FTF.... Thanks Datruk - ever since this opened I've been wondering when a cache would appear here!

we have in Australia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My kids are part of this great movement and I am a leader as well.
Some of these kids have shown an interest in geocaching so why not
help them participate.
&lt;p&gt;This cache is near 2nd Blackburn Hall&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;World Chief Scout&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Lord Baden-Powell was proclaimed World Chief Scout at the first
Jamboree at Olympia in the UK in 1920; he was raised to the peerage
(given the title of Lord) in 1929 and was awarded the order of
Merit in the Coronation Orders in 1937. He travelled widely,
encouraging Scouting in every country he visited. He came to
Australia three times, in 1912, 1931 and to the first Australian
Jamboree in 1934-35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile Scouting had become established as a most
successful scheme for the training of boys, and it spread rapidly
worldwide because it was what boys wanted to do. Soon a
headquarters was set up and leadership provided by recognised
leaders in the community. Honours were showered upon the Founder by
many countries but his last acclaim was the World Jamboree in
Holland in 1937. He retired to Kenya, where he spent several happy
years with his family. He died there on 8 January 1941.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was described as 'The Piper of Pax' because of his tremendous
contribution to boyhood and world peace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The world's largest youth
organisation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
From its English origins Scouting struck an enthusiastic chord
among boys in so many countries that it is now coordinated globally
by the World Organisation of the Scout Movement (WOSM). From its
headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, the WOSM provides unity
amongst the 155 national Scouting organisations (representing a
Scout membership of over 28 million).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is large than a film canister but smaller than a 200ml
Sistema&lt;/p&gt;

Got to love these finds - Stopped the bike and turned on the GPSr in what seemed like a likely area. On turning on it read '11 metres'. Yay. Then wandered over and parked the bike nearby to see it say '2 metres'. Reached down, moved something, there it was [:)]. All just came together!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the fourth cache in this series to show just how many
scouts we have in Australia&lt;br /&gt;
My kids are part of this great movement and I am a leader as well.
Some of these kids have shown an interest in geocaching so why not
help them participate.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;The Movement is born.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It was suggested that boys form themselves into
Patrols within other organisations but boys didn't want to be
school-Scouts, cadet-Scouts or brigade-Scouts, they simply wanted
to be Scouts. Long before the last instalment of Scouting for Boys
had hit the book stands, Scout Patrols and Troops had magically
appeared all over Britain. Baden-Powell finally bowed to the
inevitable and accepted that Scouting would have to become a
Movement in its own right. Two years later Baden-Powell retired
from the army as a General to devote his life to this new Movement
called Scouting. A rally at the Crystal Palace, London, drew
together 10,000 boys. Scouting expands and grows&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The Girl Guides were formed in 1910 by
Baden-Powell's sister, Agnes. In quick succession came the Sea
Scout Branch in the same year, Wolf Cubs in 1916, Rover Scouts in
1918 and the Special Test (now &quot;Extension&quot;) Department in 1926. The
Group system of Cub Scouts, Scouts and Rovers under the leadership
of the Group Scoutmaster was established in 1927, Deep Sea Scouts
in 1928, Air Scouts in 1941 and Senior Scouts in 1946 (now known as
Venturer Scouts).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Meanwhile Scouting spread to Australia, New Zealand and India in
1908 and other countries followed shortly after. In 1909 Chile was
the first country outside the British Empire to take up Scouting,
followed closely by France, the Scandinavian countries and the
United States in 1910. By 1937 over two and a half million Scouts
from nearly fifty countries were affiliated with the International
Bureau which was set up to safeguard Scouting and to prevent
control drifting into the hands of the purely religious, political
or military bodies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Scouting came to Australia in 1908, the year the
first Boy Scout training handbook &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; was published
in England.&lt;br /&gt;
Baden-Powell visited Australia in 1912 and in later years (1927,
1931 and 1934) to encourage the extension of the movement in
Australia. Initially each Australian state branch was directly and
individually responsible to scout headquarters in London.&lt;br /&gt;
A federal council of state branch nominees was formed in 1922 to
achieve co-operation and coordinated at a national level. The
national body later appointed an Australian Commissioner. The
Federal Scout Council functioned as a branch of the British Boys
Scout Association. Australia became a member of the World Scout
Organisation of Scout Movements (WOSM) in 1953 in its own right,
and not as a branch of the British Scout Association.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1958, the adjuration of the Australian Boys Scout Association
took place. In 1967, the national organisation was incorporated by
Royal Charter. In 1971, the association changed its name to the
Scout Association of Australia, although the official name was not
changed until 2001, when the Royal Charter was amended through an
Act of Parliament. The organisation is unofficially known as Scouts
Australia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The lefthand handshake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
WHEN COLONEL BADEN-POWELL entered the capital city of the Ashanti
people in 1890 he was met by one of the Chiefs who came to him
holding out his left hand. B.-P. held out his right in return but
the Chief said: &quot;No, in my country the bravest of the brave shake
with the left hand.&quot; So began the &quot;left handshake&quot; of the
world-wide brotherhood of Scouts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This hall is now used by the Gilbert and Sullivan society of
Victoria as a home base.&lt;br /&gt;

cache with the many others along this trail.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Bushy Park Wetlands is a 30 hectare conservation park nestled at
the north eastern edge of Glen Waverley. The Park is bounded at the
north by a remnant orchard accessed from the eastern end of
Highbury Road. The southern boundary, near the pony club at
Drummies Bridge Reserve, is accessed from High Street Road. The
Park's eastern boundary is Dandenong Creek and its western boundary
is formed by residential properties in King Arthur Drive and
Knights Drive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A section of the Dandenong Creek Trail provides vantage points
overlooking the scenic wetlands.&lt;br /&gt;
Originally, the land was timbered with Yarra Gum (Eucalyptus
yarraensis) and about 65 other species of native trees, shrubs and
grasses. The Woiworung Aboriginal tribe roamed through the area in
search of food for thousands of years before European
settlement.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1839, Thomas Napier obtained a lease to run cattle, but just a
year later he transferred the lease to Alexander Scott, whose wife
Madeline named her home on the east of Dandenong Creek &quot;Bushy
Park&quot;. A succession of owners cleared the timber. Acacia bark was
used in the production of tannin to tan hides. The land was used to
run cattle, as a market garden, for cut flowers and as an orchard.
By 1981, the land was acquired by the former Melbourne Metropolitan
Board of Works for use as a park and wetland. Today Parks Victoria
designates most of the area as a conservation zone, although some
of the area is agisted for equestrian needs.&lt;br /&gt;
An amazing 90 bird species have been recorded in the area, ranging
from water birds to bushland and farmland birds. You are likely to
see pelicans and ducks on the northern and southern lakes.
Spoonbills and herons may be observed searching for food at the
water's edge. Use the bird hide and interpretive signage to help
see and identify as many birds as you can (also accessible for
wheelchairs). On the grasslands, insects, perhaps stirred up by the
cattle, attract Willy Wagtails, Magpies and Cattle Egrets. White
Cockatoos, Galahs and White Ibis are often seen perched on tree
branches. Overhead can be spotted the Black-shouldered Kite
featured on the brand image for Bushy Park and other birds of prey
like Brown Falcons and Australian Kestrels.</groundspeak:long_description>

The starting location is just west of an amazing playground for the youngins'. Shady trees and running water to cool your feet in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To find the cache you can take a leisurely bike ride over a reasonably flat terrain. This cache should take approx 90 minutes to complete.&lt;br /&gt;
You can also access all waypoints and the final location by car.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A recent bike ride discovered these amazing Trolls who reside in structures that we humans just walk all over. If we rattle their roof too hard you can hear them call out in a gruff voice, &quot;On ya bike!&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I also noticed that rabbits (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://geocaching.com.au/cache/gchnx8&quot;&gt;GCHNX8&lt;/a&gt;) have been along this track before...and may have seen the Trolls. Oh, and if you have bounded along here before... read the Hint.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Start at BOOKWORM TROLL S37' 53.364 E145'17.380&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, you will have to drop in and pay the ROWVILLE GUARD TROLL a visit to collect the Cash!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Glenfern Valley Bushlands&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This area comprises 40 hectares or 100 acres, 35 km east of Melbourne. It is bounded on the south by Glenfern Road, on the west by New Road, the north boundary is Ferny Creek and the eastern boundary is 'Depot Track'. The land has a Grassy Forest and Herb Rich Foothill Forest on high ground to Riparian Forest at the creek line. It is in the Southern Fall Bioregion, and contains a large area of remnant vegetation.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;No tools required to get this cache. Please DO NOT disassemble anything at GZ&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Glenfern Valley Bushlands is continually evolving in both nature and facilities. It has important conservation values and opportunities to provide for a range of recreation activities in pleasant natural settings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 In 1873 John Buckley was granted 73 acres of land, which is part of the current 'Glenfern Valley Bushlands'. It was owned briefly from 1898 to 1901 by William Ward whose property totalled 117 acres, encompassing the current Bushlands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 In 1901, 97 acres was sold to Alfred McFarlane who still owned this land in 1958. The land was cleared and used as a dairy farm. There was a farmhouse on the corner of New Road and Glenfern Road, the only remaining evidence of this are some fruit trees (Prunus spp), roses (Rosaceae) and Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), which are naturalised over the property.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Investigation is continuing to find out who owned the land after the McFarlane Family passed away. The only information available is that the last remaining family member left his money to the Angliss Hospital, but it is difficult to find out who became the owner of the land at that time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 From around 1977 to 1987, the land was owned by Albion (Boral) Quarries. Rock was quarried on site for only a short time due to complaints from neighboring properties, about noise and house damage from blasting. The land was then handed to the Victorian Government in a land swap, to eliminate quarrying from the Dandenongs. The result was to bring about a land swap with another site in Lysterfield (Wellington Road).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the time that this land was untended, it was used by 4 wheel drives and trail bikes for recreation and consequently the area was badly eroded with deep culverts from these vehicles. Local people had also used the area as a convenient rubbish dump for several years, and many tons of rubbish and car bodies have been removed from the site over the past 5 years. The area was in extremely poor condition in 2000 when a group of interested people got together to have this land preserved and rehabilitated. Many hundreds of hours of both volunteer and council contractor time has gone into the works to date, which have seen spraying of Chrysanthemoides monolifera (Boneseed) and Rubus fruitcosus (Blackberry) that are prolific on the site.</groundspeak:long_description>

(Though, I've been to this location many times - including when I placed cache - and there was no-one in sight. If you get there and they are there one benefit is that they'll likely be concentrating on something else so, if you don't make too much fuss about locating and replacing cache there shouldn't be any problems). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be invisible by being confident. Look like you're supposed to be there. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dendy Park Tennis Club is one of the leading tennis clubs in Victoria and Australia. The Club has a great history and traditionally used for competition, junior development and sense of community. Many of the greats of Davis Cup, Federation Cup and Grand Slam tennis have graced our courts including Wimbledon champions Frank Sedgeman, Neale Fraser, Pat Cash and Evonne Goolagong-Cawley. It's one of the state’s strongest Tennis Victoria Pennant clubs, providing tremendous opportunities for adult and junior players to develop their game, or simply enjoy the game. The Club currently waives the Joining Fee for new members in all categories except Playing, offering significant financial savings. The Senior mixed social group on Friday mornings are currently looking for new players. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a small waterproof plastic sandwich container. It's at eye level and easily retrievable without the need to ferret around in any bushes. Container holds only pencil, sharpener and log-book right now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also - there are other geo-challenges nearby - one of which requires a night visit, so you could spend a bit of time in this area. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Looks like there has been some flooding, searched for about an hour but really long grass and fallen branches made it impossible to see some likely spots safely. Pls update to say if it's still here id love to come back and look again if it's definitely still there :-) really pretty location!</groundspeak:text>

The hide, which is two stories high, is manned by volunteers and contains all sorts of interesting displays and information including a range of nests and eggs. If the bird hide is closed you can also get a good look at the wetlands from a platform situated in the car park next to the hide.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is another one of those little parks that the locals go to but
no one else knows about.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a small container painted black that is placed
in an area where the locals like to walk their dogs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is placed here as a place to swap and see coins from
other countries. When the cache was activated it contained coins
from Fiji, Ireland, Hong Kong and other places.&lt;br /&gt;
All these coins were collected from other caches that we have
visited.

scouts we have in Australia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My kids are part of this great movement and I am a leader as well.
Some of these kids have shown an interest in geocaching so why not
help them participate.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Scouts Australia.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Association is a Founder Member of the Asia-Pacific Region. In
the field of support and co-operation with other member countries
of the Asia Pacific Region, the organisation has contributed to a
number of international friendship and community development
oriented projects. Over the years, Australian Scouts have supported
emerging Scout Associations in the South Pacific. A twinning
project with the Bangladesh Scouts, known as the
&quot;Bangladesh-Australia Child Health&quot; (BACH) project made a dramatic
impact on child health in project villages during its operation
from 1986 to 1992. The Scout Association has a twinning project
with the Nepal Scouts known as NATURE Project and involves the
reforestation of the Kristi Landslide.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Australia hosted the successful 16th World Scout Jamboree and the
31st World Scout Conference in 1988. Some 15,000 Scouts from 94
countries attended the Jamboree at Cataract Scout Park near Sydney.
An Australian Scout Jamboree has been held every three years since
1934 except for the years of the Second World War. The scout
jamboree is the largest national scout event but there is also an
Australian Rover Moot and an Australian Venture are also held every
three years.&lt;br /&gt;
In response to World and Regional Scout Conferences held prior to
2000, Scouts Australia established a National Youth Council to
engage youth members in national operations and to provide
opportunities for these representatives:&lt;br /&gt;
• to advise on the relevance of Youth Program to young
people;&lt;br /&gt;
• to advise Scouts Australia and external agencies of internal
and external issues it should address;&lt;br /&gt;
• to provide further youth input into all strategies including
membership and marketing;&lt;br /&gt;
• to be a sounding board for new initiatives;&lt;br /&gt;
• to make recommendations to national committees; and&lt;br /&gt;
• to continue to develop members' own skills, experience and
knowledge in line with the movement's aims.&lt;br /&gt;

Small Black 35mm Film Cannister.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fenton Hall at Merricks North began as a school for the local children when the owner of the farm house being leased as a school, Percy Huntley, indicated in&lt;br/&gt;1938 that he no longer wished to lease the farm house. The Education Department offered £60, the equivalent of five years' rent, towards the erection of a new school building and a local committee decided on 11/2 acres owned by the Country Roads Board as the site for a school, at the junction of Merricks Road and Bittern-Dromana Road. Local committee members sought pledges of&lt;br/&gt;financial support from the local community and working bees erected the hall, under the supervision of a builder. It was officially opened on 22 October, 1938.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fenton Hall served as the Merricks North School between 1938 and 1951, when the Area School was opened at Red Hill. It also served many other concurrent purposes for the local community, being used for church services, social occasions, a baby health centre, a branch library, youth club, etc. A tennis court was added to the grounds in 1951 and an additional front room in 1958. A bus shelter was added in 1958.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fenton Hall became the focal point for the community at Merricks North. The Merricks North Coolstore was opened on the opposite side of the Bittern- Dromana Road in 1948. The hall was also located opposite the Merricks North Post Office which was built by local working bees in 1931.</groundspeak:long_description>

At the 2006 census, Point Leo had a population of 328.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History. &lt;br/&gt;The area was known as Bobbanaring to the local Bunurong people prior to European settlement. The area was first surveyed in 1841, and a town was proposed here in 1869, but the area did not develop until after World War II, when the Woods family built a house and store. Facilities were developed in the 1960s, including hot showers at Point Leo foreshore. Point Leo Post Office finally opened on 8 December 1969, but closed in 1974. By the 1980s the area was still dominated by holiday homes and weekend travellers with few permanent residents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy your visit and watch out for muggles during peak season.</groundspeak:long_description>
