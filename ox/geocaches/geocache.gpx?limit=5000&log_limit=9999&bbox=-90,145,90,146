I went to the fridge to get a cold beer, I opened the door and guess what I saw. My beer, oh deer.

My beer jumped out onto the floor, it looked at me then ran out the door. My beer, oh deer.

Out through the door my beer made a bolt, down my front path my beer made a holt. My beer, oh deer.

Out in my yard my beer stopped to graze, to play and to stand for all of it's days. My beer, oh deer.

Work out the answer to each question. Use this number to replace the corresponding capital letter in the cache coordinate.  

Busy location so stealth will be required to retrieve this small cache (no swaps, just logbook please). Take a pen to write down your answers. Parking may be a bit tricky during business hours, but there is free parking after 5pm.

The cache is a 1 litre container containing the usual swaps. Please post any photos you take.  From 1838 the area formed part of an extensive grazing grant that was developed further by a succession of owners up until the 1920s. The original sub-division of Chirnside Park was, at that time, known as Mooroolbark Park. Around 1000 acres (4 km²) of mainly rich black basaltic soil was grazed and cultivated, watered from two perpetual springs
In 1921 George Chirnside sold Werribee Park, moving the family's stud herds and the contents of Werribee Mansion to Mooroolbark Park. After George Chirnside's death in 1941, permission to sell the estate was given in 1950 and finalised some years later. Subdivision was approved by the then Shire of Lillydale in 1956 with the residential area, centred on the two storey stone homestead, country club and golf course, named Chirnside Park in 1962 in honour of Thomas Chirnside, who founded the Chirnside empire in 1839.Amadeo DeVincentiis, an Italian from Abruzzo, also owned great swathes of what is now known as Chirnside Park. However, he sold it for a paltry amount in the 1960s, and within years the fortunate purchasers stood to make thousands. Amadeo attempted to rescind the sale, spending thousands, but failed.Formally West Lilydale, the surrounding region became known as Chirnside Park in the 1970s, the Post Office opening on 25 September 1979.  Nominally a suburb, Chirnside Park is a satellite community of Lilydale. Thus the services that cannot be met in the nearby shopping complex are found elsewhere. The residential area is set around the large 18-hole golf course, though its future is in doubt. Further residential development exists to the west and north. In area, however, most of the 'suburb' still retains a rural flavour, extending well into the Yarra Valley to the north, with commercial wineries, orchards and livestock farming, as well as large area residential estates. The Heritage Golf and Country Club, designed by Jack Nicklaus, also nestles in the northwest corner of the suburb directly on the Yarra River.
Geocaching is about sharing the little gems you find packaged as an adventure for the next person.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">~17:00 King jr and Geoprince#2  FTF?

I was reading about OpenCaching and thought I would come out to this one. My youngest geoprince also wanted to be in &quot;Daddies Carrrrrrr&quot;.

On route I discovered this was a dual listing with GC.com which is always a problem for me as while I want to record the find on both sites I dont really .want to distort my count - I seem to treat each time I come across this in a different way... Today I will do both...

The cache itself was an easy drive by find, no sooner than I was out of the car, I had the cache in hand - I was also helped by the fact that the external cammo gave it away.

Our thanks for the cache and an opportunity to log our first OX cache - as for the first to fiind - nope many have logged the GC before us.</groundspeak:text>

Depending on the time of day, you may come across local walkers/joggers/horse riders and possibly even dirt bikes on this trail, so please keep this in mind.

A suitable parking waypoint has been added for your convenience.

This cache is a 400ml Sistema container with blue clips.</groundspeak:long_description>

Looks like there has been some flooding, searched for about an hour but really long grass and fallen branches made it impossible to see some likely spots safely. Pls update to say if it's still here id love to come back and look again if it's definitely still there :-) really pretty location!</groundspeak:text>

This is another one of those little parks that the locals go to but
no one else knows about.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You are looking for a small container painted black that is placed
in an area where the locals like to walk their dogs.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is placed here as a place to swap and see coins from
other countries. When the cache was activated it contained coins
from Fiji, Ireland, Hong Kong and other places.&lt;br/&gt;
All these coins were collected from other caches that we have
visited.

The cache listings you find when you're trawling other sites.I've already claimed this as a find on geocaching.com, but as you're taken the trouble to cross list it, then I'll take the additional time to cross log it :-)Thanks Echo for hiding this cache and it is nice to be able to make my first find log at opencaching.com</groundspeak:text>
