            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Posted coordinates are to the first stage of a 2 leg multi-cache.
Actual cache container is in a different location. You will need a
car to get from Leg 1 to Leg 2. 1. leg one is INSIDE BBNP. 2. leg
two is OUTSIDE BBNP (via the N. Study Butte entrance) Plan
accordingly.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Big Bend National Park is one of the most beautiful places in
Texas. To complete this cache you must drive to the first leg of
the cache and find the historic gravesite of Juan De Leon from
Boquillas del Carmen, COAH, Mexico. Use his birth and death dates
to solve the coordinates to the final leg and cache container.
(final leg is back OUTSIDE the park through the study butte
entrance) It's a beautiful drive (in a high clearance vehicle)
through the desert surrounded by beautiful natural purple sage and
candelia. Please respect the gravesite and Big Bend National Park
lands leaving the area exactly as found or better. After visiting
this site continue down the road to either Ernst Tinaja or Carlotta
Tinaja for more caching adventures! One of my favorite places in
Big Bend National Park, Ernst Tinaja (watering hole)is very near
this cache. You can park your car in the lot and walk about 1/2 a
mile to see the main Tinajas. Ernst Tinaja is a gorgeous walk into
a natural watering hole area. Please remember to follow desert
hiking guidelines and bring plenty of drinking water. The second
half of the hike is for experienced hikers, you may need climbing
ropes and equipment to traverse the rocks and ledges. I will tell
you that I have crossed (on 2 separate occasions) without any ropes
or special equipment as have my 2 daughters (teens) but many people
have had difficulty getting IN and OUT of this area without said
equipment, so come prepared. You are not in any danger of getting
lost as there is only one way through the canyon from each end. You
will need a high clearance vehicle (truck or SUV) to drive down to
the parking area!!!! This is a must!!! The roads are NOT well
maintained and wash out regularly. Please avoid contact with any
animals/reptiles you may come across and do not collect any plants
or rocks as this is a National Park, behave respectfully. Take lots
of pictures, this is a gorgeous place! Have fun!!! See some of my
pics from the area! love, Tanya Puzzle: If Juan's birth year = ABCD
and Juan's death year = ABEF, then solve the coords: N 29 A (D+F).A

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>[The point of finding this cache is to visit the tinaja's!
If you are JUST caching, you are missing the point!  haha]</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Cache Description --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bent's Fort was constructed in 1833 by the Bent brothers, Charles and William, along with their business partner Ceran St. Vrain. Unlike many of the other forts constructed on the Western frontier, which were military posts used by the US Army, Bent's Fort was primarily a trading post; built to promote trade and commerce with Native American tribes, American trappers, and Mexican merchants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Situated along the northern banks of the Arkansas River, the political boundary between the United States and Mexico, Bent's Fort made a natural stopping point for people traveling the Santa Fe Trail. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But more than being just a trading post or a stop along the Santa Fe trail, Bent's Fort was a cheerful and lively place. In the placita, or plaza, there was often dancing, singing, and gambling -- upstairs, there was even a drinking bar with billiard table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1849, a cholera epidemic struck the southern Plains, and Bent's Fort was abandoned and burned. Today, Bent's Fort has been reconstructed and continues to stand as a reminder of a time when the permanent forts of the frontier were but mere specks in the vast loneliness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bent's Fort is a National Historic Site and National Historic Landmark. It is managed by the US National Park Service and is open to the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/beol/index.htm&quot;&gt;National Park Service Website - Bent's Old Fort&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is parking and paved sidewalks. This listing is wheelchair accessible. A 1 mile hiking trail is available to those interested; it is hard-packed dirt with some soft sand along the Arkansas River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Logging Requirements --&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To log this Virtual, go to the wooden arbor adjacent to the parking lot. Here there are a handful of interpretive signs; locate the one entitled &quot;A Cast of Colorful Characters.&quot; Count the number of people this sign describes (disregard the 'Kid's Corner'), and enter the number as the Code Phrase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Information --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- This is a Virtual lisiting, there is no container hidden at the posted coordinates. &lt;br/&gt;- This location is on property managed by the US National Park Service.&lt;br/&gt;- There are no fees required to gain access to the information needed to log this Virtual listing, although there is a fee to enter Bent's Fort.&lt;br/&gt;- This is an opencaching.com only listed cache.   </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Old East Entrance Station, a CCC-built structure. The station fell into disuse when I-94 was built and the South Unit's park entrance road was relocated. It is a short walk through a prairie dog town to the historic structure.&lt;br/&gt;An objective of the CCC program, which put upwards of 600 men to work in the North Dakota badlands, was to provide a maximum opportunity for labor at a minimum cost for construction materials and equipment. With little more than strong backs, shovels, and picks, the CCC built roads, trails, and structures. In building structures they utilized native materials, such as the local sandstone, which they quarried themselves with star drills, sledgehammers, and sweat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here in the badlands, the CCC accomplished a variety of projects including road and trail construction, development of picnic areas, construction of comfort stations, and restoration of the Chateau de Mores and the de Mores packing plant site. Their work, along with the work of the Emergency Relief Administration (E.R.A.) and the Works Progress Administration (W.P.A.), can still be seen in the park and in the area, including the picnic area shelter in the North Unit, the River Bend Overlook shelter, the Old East Entrance Station in the South Unit, portions of the park’s road and trail systems, road culverts, and buildings at the de Mores State Historic Site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three CCC Companies, #2767, #2771, and #2772, operated in the badlands from 1934 to 1941. Their camps were established along the Little Missouri River in the North and South Units of present-day Theodore Roosevelt National Park, and along Jones Creek in the South Unit. About 200 men, each earning $30 a month, worked at each of the camps. Most of the money they earned was sent home to the men’s families, and most men lived on $5-8 a month for toiletries, postage, haircuts, and occasional entertainment. CCC enrollees received lodging, meals, clothing, and medical and dental care. Although they lived and worked on a regimented schedule, the men had time to continue their education through evening classes and had Saturdays and Sundays for leisure. Many of the men formed lifelong friendships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The park entrance fee is $10 per car. You will need a park map (get it at the entrance station when you pay your fee) to find the trail head. The trail head does not have a sign so pay attention to your map. The trail head does have a good size parking area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log the cache you will need to find the Old East Entrance Station building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once at the Station you will need to open the screen door of the station and count the number of Maltese Crosses on the stations door. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The number of Maltese Crosses on the door is your Code Phrase (it will be a two digit number). </groundspeak:long_description>
