&lt;br /&gt;
Darwin Fire Station is four kilometres from the Central Business
District in the suburb of Stuart Park and is the Headquarters of
the Northern Territory Fire and Rescue Service (NTFRS).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The three-storey building houses the Fire Service Administration,
Development and Strategy, Special and Technical Operations,
Procurement and Breathing Apparatus/HAZMAT sections and is equipped
with a hot fire training facility and a burn house, a gymnasium and
sauna.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Darwin Emergency Response Area (ERA) extends over 93 square
kilometres and takes in the wharf precinct and harbour, the fuel
depots, nursing homes and multi-level commercial and residential
buildings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fire crews respond mainly to structure and grass fires and
emergencies such as motor vehicle crashes, rescues and hazardous
materials incidents, such as chemical and fuel spills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A series of public awareness and fire education programs are
presented by Darwin Station personnel throughout the community and
the enforcement of fire safety requirements in buildings and a
hazard abatement program to identify areas of concern and potential
risks to public safety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The station is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week by a
minimum of 8 firefighters. There are four Watch Commanders who are
responsible for the manning of all three stations in the Darwin,
Casuarina and Palmerston Districts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The station provides a secure storage area for the fleet of five
operational vehicles which includes a command vehicle, a Tele Squrt
(a main turnout appliance), a skylift and observation platform for
high-rise fire fighting, a rescue tender for motor vehicle
accidents, fire structure salvage and hazardous material
incidents.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The four-wheel drive unit is equipped to fight grass and bush
fires. Darwin station also houses a flat bed truck with a hydraulic
tilt tray to transport equipment to and from the fire ground and
between the stations&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fire vessel ‘Mataranka’ is equipped with fire
fighting pumps, water canon and hoses and is berthed at Darwin Port
where it also doubles as a tug boat.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Today, this obelisk overlooks the Darwin Harbour Wharf area, from
where all men from the Territory left during the First World War.
The high cliffs would have been one of the last familiar sights
those men would have seen as they sailed off to war. It overlooks
the harbour where so many died in the Japanese air attack on 19
February 1942.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most significant of all, it is sited on the spot from which guns of
the 14th Anti-Aircraft Battery went into action, firing, arguably,
the first shots ever in defence of Australia on Australian
soil.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This memorial was the first official monument of any kind erected
in the Northern Territory and funds were subscribed by various
organisations and committees throughout the Territory during 1920.
The initial chosen site for the memorial was Liberty Square, the
area in front of the Administrator’s residence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located outside the War Memorial Fence and is best
accessed by the gate at the southern end of the plaques. Be mindful
that there are cliffs nearby so be careful with small children and
at night time. Stealth may be required as it is a busy spot. You
are looking for a small systema.&lt;br /&gt;
