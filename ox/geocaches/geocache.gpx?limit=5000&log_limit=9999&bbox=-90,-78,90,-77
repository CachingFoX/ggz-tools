You don't have to go under the bridge or down to the water unless the water is high. I am hidden by fossles so look very close because a fossle covers the entrance to my home. You can pull off at the end of the bridge then follow the vhicle path that goes down beside the bridge. The cache is between the top of the bridge and the river below, not on the bridge or bridge rail. remember your clues you will need them to locate Jodies little hide.</groundspeak:long_description>

I watched him catch many pike fish from these waters as a young boy. I remember telling him on one occasion that I would never again pike fish because he was pulling them in left and right and I couldn’t even get a bite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache I guess you could say is sort of a Guard Rail cache but probably not like any you have ever seen. It blends very well with its environment and you will be lucky to find it. Come see if you can. Happy Caching </groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;A small micro cache (log only) hidden on this
   small Chesterfield County property which held major significance
   during two different historical periods :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bermuda Hundred was started in 1613, after the
English settlers made peace with the Virginia natives. It was named
after the traumatic shipwreck of the &quot;Third Supply&quot; bringing
reinforcements to Virginia in 1609. The leaders of that expedition
were shipwrecked in Bermuda and had to take their wrecked ship
apart and build two smaller ships to finally get to Virginia.
Bermuda Hundred was initially intended to include several
&quot;hundreds&quot; upstream and downstream of the Appomattox River. The
Bermuda settlements were attacked severely in 1622, when the
natives abandoned their efforts at peaceful coexistence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bermuda Hundred never gained prominence again
until 1864 when a Union Army occupied it. The Federal troops under
Major General Benjamin F. Butler landed here, between Richmond and
Petersburg, in early May 1864. His Army of the James threatened
both cities in his drive west from landings between the James and
Appomattox Rivers. Confederates under Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard
blocked him via the construction of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=fa4d1f16-5719-4ba3-ab6f-f887b1c94287&quot;&gt;
Howlett's Line&lt;/a&gt;. Within weeks, Butler was trapped between the
two rivers and remained there until Petersburg was evacuated in
April 1865.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parking is available
at several nearby parking areas.  Parking fees apply in all
areas of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;PLEASE NOTE THAT AT THE REQUEST OF THE
   NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, THE CACHES AT PARKERS BATTERY AND
   DREWRY'S BLUFF HAVE BEEN REMOVED!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a confederate battery built in 1864. It's
named for Col. Olin Dantzler, who was killed trying to take Fort
Dutton. It played a major role in keeping the Union Navy from
approaching Richmond.!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have placed a cache in each
of the four Civil War Era Batteries / Forts in owned by
Chesterfield County. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.co.chesterfield.va.us/Tourism/civilwarsites.asp&quot;&gt;http://www.co.chesterfield.va.us/Tourism/civilwarsites.asp&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

taken to not disturb important archeological areas, so please do
not enter any area that has been marked off-limits to the

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Follow the trail to the overlook. At the base of the steps, a trail leads to the left over a hill. Follow this trail until you reach a small ravine that leads right to the edge of a bluff. At the edge, there is a large hollow log surrounded by laurels. The cache is in the log.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;p&gt;This is a camo'd  micro
cache (a round tin) hidden in Pocahontas State Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***** NOTE : The tree has finally fallen - but the cache is
intact *****&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Parking is available at the
   Horse Trailer parking or at the Moseley Fire road entrance.
   REMEMBER - there is a fee for parking anywhere in the park. The
   cache site is visible from a fire road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache contains a small log
&amp; pen and a Geocaching key chain as a first finders prize.
There is very little room for anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache was a gift
from my son for Father's Day. I am very fortunate to have a great
son, who introduced me to Geocaching in 2001. This cache is placed
in honor of all the father / son geocachers who spend time together
going to out of the way places to find a cache or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is an Ammo
Can,  with a very special gift to the first finder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cache is well
hidden, just off a trail. It's a
log only cache, so bring something to write with.&lt;/p&gt;

   placed in honor of the 3rd Annual Richmond Rally at Pocahontas
   State Park. If you are visiting from outside the Richmond area,
   you may not know that we have one of the best Burger restaurants

   - just look across the parking lot for good food, good fun and

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to tell you
that a lot of planning went into this cache, but the reality is
that I found a bison tube with a log ready to go in my car while at
a vendor site. I looked around and thought &quot;Why not place it here?&quot;
So that is how this cache came to be. It should be a relatively
easy park and grab with minimal muggle issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Created by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tarzan first appeared in the novel Tarzan of the Apes (magazine publication 1912, book publication 1914), and then in twenty-three sequels and innumerable works in other media, authorized or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As caches go, this one IS a bit tricky.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">It is claimed by some that the nursery rhyme is actually about Little Jack Horner, steward to Richard Whiting, the last abbot of Glastonbury Abbey before the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII of England. Legend has it that, prior to the abbey's destruction, the abbot sent Horner to London with a huge Christmas pie which had the deeds to a dozen manors hidden within it. During the journey Horner opened the pie and extracted the deeds of the manor of Mells in Somerset. The manor properties included lead mines in the Mendip Hills, hence &quot;He pulled out a plum&quot; - from the Latin plumbum, for lead. While records do indicate that Thomas Horner became the owner of the manor, both his descendants and subsequent owners of Mells Manor have claimed that the legend is untrue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 16th-century rhyme noted:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &quot;Hopton, Horner, Smyth and Thynne:&lt;br/&gt;    When Abbotts went out, they came in.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first publication date for &quot;Little Jack Horner&quot; is 1725, but all the common English nursery rhymes were long in circulation before they appeared in print.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is hidden in Chesterfield's &quot;Horner Park,&quot; thus the name.  As caches go, there is nothing tricky about this one.  You've probably seen this hide techniques a hundreds of times before.</groundspeak:long_description>

across the street from one of Richmond's long time employers, known
to it's employees as &quot;Uncle Phil&quot;. There is ample parking available
and other than shift change (07:00, 15:00, 23:00) muggles should be
managable. Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

The cause or object of such a feeling.  Lamp post caches are&lt;br/&gt;repugnant.&lt;br/&gt;3. The avoidance of a thing, situation, or behavior because it has been&lt;br/&gt;associated with an unpleasant or painful stimulus. I will not seek to find any more lamp post caches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I HATE LAMP POST CACHES !!!&lt;br/&gt;An Evil Frog Prince Cache - Originally placed 1/7/2007&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Lamp post caches require minimal skill or intelligence to find and even less&lt;br/&gt;to hide. The only thing they are good for is to increase your “numbers”. Some caches are hidden under the cover and require only a primitive&lt;br/&gt;mono-synaptic reflex response to locate the container. The more&lt;br/&gt;creative caches are magnetic nano-containers placed 20 feet or more&lt;br/&gt;up the pole. To successfully retrieve this type of cache, I started&lt;br/&gt;carrying a cane fishing pole in my car when geocaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the Princess found out what the fishing pole was for, she sent me to a therapist. My therapist suggested behavior modification therapy to assist in overcoming my intense dislike for lamp post caches. After weeks of graded exposure where I was required to visualize and eventually touch a&lt;br/&gt;picture of a lamp post cache, she said I was ready to use positive&lt;br/&gt;reinforcement to win victory over my aversion. Her assignment was&lt;br/&gt;for me to hide a lamp post cache and experience the joy of watching&lt;br/&gt;hordes of geocachers rush to the cache. Each email notification&lt;br/&gt;that the cache has been found serves to reinforce my joy and&lt;br/&gt;eventually aid in overcoming my hatred for lamp post&lt;br/&gt;caches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you for aiding in my recovery. Please replace the cache exactly as&lt;br/&gt;found so others can share in the JOY! Be sure to bring a pen to sign the log. Posting a find without signing the log will result in a less than joyous deletion of the entry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you leave to hunt for the cache ... don't forget your fishing pole !!!&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is located at the Kroger Grocery Store.  I was originally placed on September 4, 2004.  The cache IS NOT hidden under any lumber, in or under trash cans, or anywhere that would require moving or disrupting any of the fixtures in the area.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is in a small metal Whitman's Sampler tin.  The container is not large enough to support many items.  Muggles can be a problem so please be discreet when retrieving the container and be sure to replace it as found.  If visitors are present, just purchase a soft drink from one of the machines, take a seat at the picnic table, and wait for them to leave.  This can be an easy night time find as the area is lighted.  The area is easily accessible even by wheel chair.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Front door. If so, maybe a hint as it should have been easy once you see there is only one area near by worth investigating. Please check.

I was expecting to have found a slightly filled log when I opened this one up but was one happy cacher once that lid came off! Great case of coordinate accuracy today. Funny how some times that happens and other times I'm ready to ask Santa for a new model. Now I see why a super-nearby cache was archived. Heh, one that I spent 20 minutes looking for about a month and a half ago before giving up and discovering it didn't live there anymore. Nifty container you got there. SL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

&lt;b&gt;It should be a cache and dash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Be sure to inspect within a 10' radius in any direction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Introducing this cache that is near the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park, but not on park land, called &lt;b&gt;Deep Run&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A micro in a wood, it's located very near the easternmost tributary of Deep Run Creek, the site of Confederate encampments in 1862. The cache is next to a county road which is subject to many muggles and parking is now of a temporary nature.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please replace precisely as found or the value of the cache may be
diminished.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you walk about 25' or so to the West from the cache, you should see what I felt was a fine view of Deep Run, especially when the water levels are higher as they were on the date this cache was place here. &lt;br /&gt;

The idea was born in 1920 but died the following year when too few investors bought stock to support it. Nevertheless, the railroad was eventually built, albeit in HO scale, and can be seen at the end of the Northern Neck at the Reedville Fishermen's Museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here at the gateway of the Northern Neck rail fans and friends of the Dahlgren Railroad Heritage Trail have also gotten into the spirit. You will see how when you visit, and it is just there that you will find the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

Introducing this cache that is near the Fredericksburg and
Spotsylvania National Military Park, but not on park land, called
The Circle.&lt;br /&gt;

This cache is in a residential area adjacent to the circle (visible on satellite views) that is nearby (across the fencing) in the National Military Park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The 2.0 terrain was selected due to the potential for rather wet conditions at
various times of the year.&lt;br /&gt;

Wish we'd read the 06/30/2011 CO comment before starting which might have made this easier!

Actually though, I found it on my first time there but managed to disable the thing and due to a unexpected development, had to zip home for a few hours before I could return on a repair mission. I hope nobody stopped by during the breach. I'm certain you would have been able to see it... But I got it back in service within 20 seconds. Watch out for the PI in the area!

Hmmm, got a different gz... walked over a bit and found the cache laying out in the open about a foot away from where I'd bet the farm it was supposed to be.

Shortly after its establishment the naval base and surrounding area were both named in honor of the Civil War era admiral John Dahlgren, known as the father of naval ordnance. This area was very rural and gave the navy plenty of room for its activities, but the remoteness and lack of development of the area also made it difficult to move men and material back and forth During the run up to World War II this problem became critical and so the US government began construction of the Dahlgren Railroad, a branch line from the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac line near Fredericksburg to the naval proving grounds at Dahlgren. Land was acquired in 1938, construction began in 1941 and operations commenced in 1942.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 1960s, no longer making use of the railroad, the US government sold the road to the RF&amp;P which began operating it for the benefit of industrial and other commercial interests established along the branch line. Today, CSX which acquired the RF&amp;P operates the line with its only significant traffic being coal delivered to a power plant and refuse delivered to a landfill, both in Sealston. Since the the portion of the line east of Sealston was no longer in use, CSX offered to sell that portion, and it was purchased by a local resident who has worked to open the trail as a public greenway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of some local opposition, the trail is not yet freely open to the public and explicit permission is needed to use the trail Permits are freely given, though, and information about how to apply is at www.friendsdrht.org/DRHT_PermitApp.htm. For more information about the trail and the history of the Dahlgren Railroad, please go to the website for the Friends of the Dahlgren Railroad Heritage Trail at www.FriendsDRHT.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are just a few trailheads along this 16 mile trail; the one most convenient for finding the cache is on Indiantown Road. It is a hike of about 2.8 miles from there eastward to where the trail passes under Caledon Road and where you will find the cache. Please, don't try to access the cache directly from Caledon Road since there is no legal parking there and the trail embankment is dangerously high and steep. Trust us, the exercise will do you good and this is a beautiful trail through wetlands teeming with interesting flora and fauna.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is part of the Railroad Knutz series by the Cachew Knutz For information about the series and the fabulous golden spike for the first to find the whole series, please check out the ultimate cache in the series, RR Knutz: The Golden Spike, at http://coord.info/GC2PP3K.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several other caches hidden on this middle section of the Dahlgren Railroad Heritage Trail, including Dahlgren Heritage Rails to Trails Cache (http://coord.info/GCWPCW), which is right at the Indiantown Road trailhead.  Also, there are over a dozen other caches hidden on the western section of the trail.  </groundspeak:long_description>

Sung to the tune of &quot;Santa Claus is Coming To Town&quot;&lt;br /&gt;

Zombie Claus is coming to town!&lt;br /&gt;

He chews if you've been bad or good,&lt;br /&gt;
So just hide for goodness' sake!&lt;br /&gt;

This is part of the Charles County &quot;evil&quot; hide series/competition&lt;br /&gt;
Rules:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Hides must be diabolical!&lt;br /&gt;
2. If you want to participate, your cache must be hidden within a 10 mile radius of Waldorf, MD. (intersection of RT 301/5/228)&lt;br /&gt;
3. Give no hints until the cache is found.&lt;br /&gt;
You are under no obligation to participate in this hide off.&lt;br /&gt;
This is just a fun competition to see who can come up with the most evil hide!&lt;br /&gt;
We would like to make this a fun series showcasing the creative cachers in the area!&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is third part of the Evil Hide Competition in Charles County.&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I finally found Steve!  Oh he's a few legs short and a bit cold and wet but otherwise he's okay.  I spotted him hanging out in the woods and borrowed the wet logsheet from him.  I was able to sign it but it's pretty damp.  On the hike back I concluded there have been some carbecues back here recently.  Lots of melted bits and charred spots on the gravel road. Great to finally put a found log on this OX cache.</groundspeak:text>

I searched several more likely spots nearby, based on the name and ratings, just in case the coordinates were entered amiss.  Perhaps the owner intended to return to this listing, to update the description and place the cache.  

*note:  This log applied to the original listing coordinates.  Hoping to give this another try with the new coords. Thanks, NC 11/14/11</groundspeak:text>

The Zombie Horde enjoys walking around the National Harbor so we
decided to place a new cache for those out enjoying the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache was placed by the little Zombies so it should be easy
to find but stealth is needed because of all the muggles who walk
the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is on the walking/bike path, NOT on the road.&lt;br /&gt;

The unusual Bull Run Mountain stone storehouse faces east in the northeast corner of a triangular-shaped 1.44-acre lot formed by the intersection of Blantyre Road &amp; Route 628. An open field with Broad Run's Trap Branch running through it is just to the east of the dirt Blantye Road opposite the storefront. Charles and Abraham Stover's mill race once flowed along this area. The mill's remains are nearby. Bordered by a stone wall, the Carpenter Gothic-style Church of our Savior and Little Georgetown Cemetery are just northeast of the storehouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located just as you pull off the road. Enjoy the history and adjacent cemetery grounds that are open to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats goes to braubach for the FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Micro cache located in a small neighborhood park in Falls Church&lt;br/&gt;VA. Safe during the day but I would advise against visiting after&lt;br/&gt;dark. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My sister and I, along with our cousins, used to play in this park&lt;br/&gt;while visiting our grandmother, Rhoda Hooper. She owned a home down&lt;br/&gt;the street from it for 47 years. Her daughters Stevie, Karen and&lt;br/&gt;Leslie, used to play in the park as well. When my Grandmother&lt;br/&gt;recently passed, we visited the old neighborhood. Seeing the&lt;br/&gt;children playing on Tyler Ave and in the park brought back fond&lt;br/&gt;memories for everyone. My mother writes, &quot;The houses on Tyler Ave&lt;br/&gt;were built post-WW2 and the children who grew up there in the 50s&lt;br/&gt;and 60s will never forget that area. We played together in the&lt;br/&gt;park, played softball on the fields and skated in the pavilion long&lt;br/&gt;before it was officially a Fairfax County park. While we generally&lt;br/&gt;only see each other now at funerals, all one has to do is say Tyler&lt;br/&gt;Ave and we all remember the same things.&quot; My uncle Joe passed last&lt;br/&gt;weekend and we again found ourselves in Falls Church. While&lt;br/&gt;listening to everyone who grew up in the neighborhood and spent&lt;br/&gt;time in the park, the idea to place a geocache here was born. At a&lt;br/&gt;later date this micro will be replaced with a proper full size&lt;br/&gt;container.</groundspeak:long_description>

But even if you can't find your way out of a paper bag, this hide shouldn't drive you up a wall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember what goes around comes around, so don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today as a good cache is hard to find and if you are between a rock and a hard place and find that your dog won't hunt, take the bull by the horns for seek and ye shall find!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As this is my first cache I aimed to make it child's play, easy as pie, KISS, a no brainer, easy as ABC, a piece of cake, like shooting fish in a barrel, a slam dunk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't take the path less travelled as this cache conforms to FCPA requirements and therefore requires very little off the path exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is initially stocked with several kid friendly items. Please rehide so cache is not visible. I believe this to be wheelchair accessible, but if you disagree please let me know and I'll adjust the listing accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to wetfit, demonstrating that early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and first to find!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optional Additional Logging Requirement (ALR): Use a cliché in your log, bonus points for using one not already spoken for. This is optional and your log will not be rubbed out if there is no cliché in sight. But it is more fun than a barrel of monkeys!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTICE: This park is open during daylight hours only. Please be respectful of park hours. If you enter the park after hours you are trespassing. If you are stopped you can be ticketed or arrested and will put the future of geocaching in the parks in jeopardy. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The park where you are standing was once a a dumping area for refuse from the now-extinct neighborhood over-the-fence. That neighborhood has been bulldozed over and another has risen to replace it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache area is lit 24/7 (not a hint).  You can pretty much ignore trespassing signs - just like the hundreds of people who walk through daily on their way to the metro.  Parking is another matter... either park at the Metro and walk over, or keep a sharp eye out for the tow truck. Public-non-permit parking is on Regent's Tower Street. It is a two mile walk to retrieve a towed vehicle. I'm just saying...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*** If you are using an older map, Fairlee Dr. and Maple Dr. no longer exist. Instead, Vaden Dr. has been extended south of Saintsbury Dr. ***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2/21/2011 - Downsized the cache to the dreaded film canister after property survey markers appeared nearby. The cache is still hidden in the exact same spot as it was when it was a small. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8/20/2011 - returned from vacation to see that a large building has gone up within yards of the cache! This may make GPSr's act funky. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6/27/2012 - Just updating that the cache is still in place. There is now sod adjacent to the cache and the new townhomes are occupied - so be stealthy.  More and more houses every day. There will be businesses and possibly a supermarket in here before they are through.</groundspeak:long_description>

I had put in my dues with a Pirate Rat hide like this before, so the find was a snap.  In fact, the &quot;camo&quot; was out of whack, so it made it even easier.  (I put it back as it should be).  Unfortunately the log got wet.  Still took some ink though.  Thanks PR!

Oh--I saw some pretty big structures going up over the fence.</groundspeak:text>

No room for any trade items, so keep your cargo stowed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nation's manifest destiny is echoed in the dreams and visions that are juxtaposed between the nearby Air &amp; Space Museum and the Museum of the American Indian. The cache is on public property and adheres to all caching guidelines. It is not on museum grounds or federal park land.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is respectful to its surroundings, and no extreme efforts are needed to retrieve it. No pole climbing, finger pokes, or periscopes required. Nothing needs to be dismantled or disassembled, so play nice. Stealth is a plus, though, since there are many times of day where tourists abound.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I was a little nervous wondering just how devious this hide would be...   But we had logged this type before and had the container in hand after a brief search.  Logged as team initials to save log space and replaced as found.  TFTC! (#955)</groundspeak:text>

In addition, the Confederate partisan John Singleton Mosby was active in the village, and several small skirmishes between Union cavalry and his band of rangers took place in and around Aldie.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aldie sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places include the Aldie Mill (1807) and the Aldie Mill Historic District on US 50, the Loudoun Agricultural and Mechanical Institute on Route 650, and the Mount Zion Old School Baptist Church (1851) on US 50.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 4 historic markers near the cache where you can read about Aldie and its place during the Civil War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a pull-off just before the bridge on the Rt. 50 side. BYOP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My GPS was acting a little eratic while recording the cords.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&quot;Over the river and through the woods&quot; is just that.  Enjoy a short hike aross the Rock Creek and into a less traveled part of the woods.  This cache is located just outside the boundary line of the Rock Creek Park. I checked the GPS coordinates and placed it just outside the park services area.  It can be accessed either by parking at the main parking lot on Beach Drive, or through a neighborhood on the back side of the park.  I have not tried the neighborhood trail head.  It is about a .3 mile walk into the trail. This is a local hot spot for hiking and walking the dogs.  Some dogs even swim and play fetch in the creek!  You will be in a wooded area with foliage and moving water.  The terrain is mostly flat with some hills.  There is one small hill to walk up (and down) so please be careful when you get to that waypoint.   </groundspeak:long_description>

I left the crowd behind at the Down by the River &quot;NoVAGO's Spring Event&quot; and took a nice walk on familiar trails.  Turned off into the woods just past the site of a much older cache that use to be in this park.

There is no &quot;trail&quot; here, well not one cut by the land managers.  The trail is really a deer trail that meanders across the side of the hill.  Near the crest is an area where the deer have been rooting in the leaves and bedding down.  The spring tree cover is already pretty thick so I wasn't surprised to have somewhat poor GPS reception.  Consequently GZ drifted widely up and down the hill.  My search started with some obvious nooks and then spiraled out, ultimately to about 100'.  I thought the clue would help narrow down the likely spots, and it did for a few minutes.  But as the cache continued to elude me I put it out of mind.

Perhaps the owner could confirm this one is still in place and hidden as intended.  This is always a pretty park to visit given the river vistas and its ever changing moods.  Looking forward to coming back for the find.</groundspeak:text>

I just knew I had to plant a geocache here. This cache is appropriately named. As I was hiding it, I got a nasty evil bruise on my head, and like the doofus I am, I go, 'Wow, the name of this cache should have something to do with bruises.' Not only did I bonk my head when I hid this cache, but I scraped up my knee. Long story short, be careful when you find this cache and keep your doctor on speed dial. This cache is pretty well concealed, so rehide it exactly how you found it. Cache contents are geared towards the kiddies. No FTF prize. Enjoy the cache! Happy Hunting!! </groundspeak:long_description>

Less than 100' off the path. Up around this area there used to be a campsite. The place where the cache is hidden probably used to be a way to get water, something like a well. We asked the people at the Nature Center, but not even they knew exactly what it is. This should be a simple find. The coords seemed okay but post better ones if you find them. There is a colored pencil in the cache for use of signing the log. Happy Hunting! </groundspeak:long_description>

Visit the Nature Center after you find this cache. It's a nice complex and even more fun for the kids. There are plenty of nice hiking trails that start around where the cache is. This wouldn't be considered a cache-and-dash, but its a pretty easy cache that you don't have to walk far to get to. &lt;br/&gt;I have been walking up at this park for years and it has always been one of my favorites. It includes LOTS of nice hiking paths, nature center, botonical gardens, ice-skating rink, dog park, and much, much more. Also, in the summer they have a butterfly show. Great opportunity for photo freaks. Stop off at the show after you grab the cache. You won't be disappointed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is my first cache hide and I hope you like it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area where the cache is hidden can have high muggle density sometimes. Stealth may be required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a micro bison tube. No trades and BYOP. The cache is green.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some people have reported problems finding the cache, so I added a better hint which should be used if you can't find the cache using the coords. It is very much an offset.  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Decided to plant the 1st cache in Meadowood Park. Meadowood Park is right by my neighborhood and I was surprised to find that there were no caches in this small park. So I decided to hide one. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is in a hidden part of Meadowood that backs up to residential area, so most people don't know about it. There is a pond down near where the cache is planted. The pond is beautiful and has some HUGE fish inside. At the moment, you may not see them though because the pond is covered in gallons of pond scum. The park is really nice and includes: basketball court, tennis court, baseball diamond, soccer field, 2 playgrounds, and some short hiking trails. If you go behind the baseball diamond, you will see a little path. Follow that, and if you start to see a pond, you are in the right place. Don't let your pointer make you go buschwacking. If you go around to the bottom right side of the pond near the black fence, there is a trail. That trail will lead you to the cache. The cache itself is an empty pill bottle (got the idea from another cacher) with Chesapeake Bay Foundation stickers on it. For some reason, I felt like putting nothing but marbles (and the log) in the cache. If you can, leave a marble and takeone. A writing utensil couldn't fit into the cache, so BYOP. Happy Hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>If you are having a hard time, the cache is near the creek.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

This trail has lots of history within, very cool. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is the first cache hidden in the woods of the Underground Railroad Trail. This hike I discovered a little while ago, and you barely ever see anyone on the trail. When I first saw there were geocaches at the park, &quot;Green Hell&quot; and &quot;Sandy Spring Cache&quot;, I was so excited. But I saw that they were at the beginning and the end of the hike that I usually walk. So, I decided that we needed one in the middle. Find all three of the caches when you go looking for this one or the others. The cache is right by the stream crossing part of the hike. This cache is not a hard terrain, but be careful, there can be snakes in this area. The cache is well camoflauged, so please put it back EXACTLY how you found it. There is some pertty elaborate swag in the cache, so take whatever you want as a FTF prize. Enjoy the hide! Happy Hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Poolesville received its name from the U.S. Post Office Department when the area’s first post office was established in Poole’s Store in 1805. John Poole had opened his small store in 1793 in his residence, a small one-room-and-kitchen log house that still stands today. His primary customers were the farming families who had been settling in the area since about 1760. These are the ancestors of many families who live in the area today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Agricultural development was the primary cause of prosperity in Poolesville. Town residents supplied services and goods to the local farmers. Blacksmiths, wheelwrights, shoemakers, tailors, carpenters, barbers, coopers, tavern-keepers, and an hotelier were thriving in Poolesville in the early 1800s. Another factor in Poolesville’s development was its proximity to the Potomac River ferries and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which started partial operation in 1833.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poolesville, whose population had reached about 200 by 1861, was the second largest town in Montgomery County and was of major importance during the Civil War due to its strategic location between the Nation’s Capital in Washington, D.C., and nearby Virginia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, Poolesville retains its small-town, rural character with a population of about 4,200. Historic preservation is a matter of importance to the residents and an integral part of the town’s planning process. Many 19th-century homes have been carefully preserved. But residents agree that Poolesville’s most valuable asset is its combination of small town character and rural setting. The John Poole House, built in 1793, is a historic landmark in downtown Poolesville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This geocache is hidden on the grounds of our new town hall. If you visit during business hours, come on in and say hello. Parking is available near the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Town of Poolesville Thanks you for visiting!&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

My wife and I really like the idea of bringing the whole family along so we thought our first cache should be family friendly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is located in the Black Hills regional park system.&lt;br/&gt;There are plenty of parking spots and entry points to the trail. Trail is nice paved blacktop, easy walking. You could even bring your bikes along for this one. Trail follows along little Seneca lake so if you're at all into fishing bring your gear as the fishing is great! Area is also dog friendly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're up for some real fun take the canoe out and go after this one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

will be picking a general cache hiding style and adding my own
twist to try and change it up a bit. When you arrive at ground zero
you should soon discover what classic hide this one is based
on.&lt;br /&gt;
This particular style is one of my&lt;br /&gt;
personal favorites. I have found many cool caches in great
locations hidden in the classic style. This cache is my attempt to
make this type of hide a bit more interesting.&lt;br /&gt;
Bring a pen to this one the container is small and only contains a
log book.&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to this one being the latest variant cache I'm also
placing it to commemorate the first birthday of Crash's
wondertwins! for the record they found their first cache with mom
and dad before their 1st bday :) This cache is an easy walk and kid
friendly but could be a challenging hide depending on your
experience etc.&lt;br /&gt;
As with all my recent caches it's important that you take the time
to re-hide this one&lt;br /&gt;
carefully and back the way you found it. This will preserve the
experience for the next&lt;br /&gt;
cacher.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">After a lengthy geo-retirement I'm back. The last cache I had hidden was in 2003. My recent purchase of a smartphone capable of geocaching rekindled my interest in the sport. Once I got out and found a cache or two I remembered what I loved about the game. Now that I have little ones I'm looking forward to getting them out and caching as a family. I wanted to get some family friendly caches out there for like minded folks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon my return to the game I found the trend of the micros / nanos has continued. I'm a fan of more traditional caches so I wanted to do my part to start getting some more traditional caches out in some of my favorite parks close to home. This one is family friendly as noted although there are some sticker bushes in and around ground zero. It wouldn't be caching if there weren't at least some stickers and or poison ivy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The park itself has become my favorite launching point for local road cycling routes. You can do anywhere from 20 - 50+ rides leaving from this parking lot over some wonderful scenic and mellow back roads. The Frederick Peddlers do Wed night bike rides out of this park every week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a good size rubbermade container. I started the cache with a number of cool trinkets I had laying around as well as some of my newly created custom lanyards and bike chain keychains I plan to use as my new signature items. I am also launching my first TB since coming out of geo retirement from this cache. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Devil's Den is the nickname for a terrain feature south of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, that was the site of fierce fighting at the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Devil's Den is a rocky expanse of shrubs and scrub trees, the southernmost part of Houck's Ridge, directly west of Little Round Top across the Plum Run Valley (also known to the soldiers as the &quot;Valley of Death&quot;). The central feature of Devil's Den is an outcropping of massive boulders. This igneous rock, similar in appearance to granite, is an outcrop of diabase sill, known to geologists as &quot;Gettysburg Sill&quot;, that is about a mile (1,600 m) wide, 1,800 feet (550 m) thick, and runs for almost 40 miles (64 km), directly through the Gettysburg Battlefield. It was formed over 180 million years ago under and within the beds of sandstone and shale that covered the area and over time was forced upward between existing strata. Where the sheet has been exposed to the seasonal freezing of water in the crevices and cracks, it has broken into smaller pieces that have been weathered over the years into separate boulders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This landmark gained importance in the second day of the fighting near Gettysburg, July 2, 1863, with a Confederate assault by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's First Corps through this terrain. Conducted by the division of Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood, and including both the Texas Brigade and 3rd Arkansas, the charge was directed towards the left flank of the Union Army of the Potomac and hit Devil's Den as well as the high ground at Little Round Top. Devil's Den was defended by the Union III Corps division of Maj. Gen. David B. Birney, later reinforced by the V Corps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONFIRMATION CODE PHRASE:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Locate the Devils den and Slaughter pen sign.&lt;br/&gt;  What are the first and second words on the 5th line of the first paragraph.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONFIRMATION ( two 5 letter words)&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Gouverneur Kemble Warren was a civil engineer and prominent general in the Union Army during the American Civil War.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the start of the Gettysburg Campaign, as Confederate General Robert E. Lee began his invasion of Pennsylvania, Warren is best remembered for arranging the last-minute defense of Little Round Top, and is often referred to as the &quot;Hero of Little Round Top.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 2, 1863, Warrren climbed the smaller of two rocky hills south of Gettysburg, known as Little Round Top, Warren found only a small Signal Corps station there. He saw the glint of bayonets in the sun to the southwest and realized that a Confederate assault into the Union flank was imminent. He hurriedly sent staff officers to find help from any available units in the vicinity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warren had initiated the defense of Little Round Top, recognizing the importance of the undefended position on the left flank of the Union Army. He directed on his own initiative, the brigade of Colonel Strong Vincent to occupy it just minutes before it was attacked. Warren suffered a minor neck wound during the Confederate assault.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of Vincent's regiments, the 20th Maine, led by Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, has received most of the fame for the defense of Little Round Top, but there is little doubt that the efforts and bravery of Vincent were instrumental in the eventual Union victory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thirty years later, Chamberlain received a Medal of Honor for his conduct in the defense of Little Round Top. The citation read that it was awarded for &quot;daring heroism and great tenacity in holding his position on the Little Round Top against repeated assaults, and carrying the advance position on the Great Round Top.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Statue: &lt;br/&gt;Warren standing in uniform, with field binoculars on a granite pedestal, made of stone quarried at Little Round Top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Confirmation Code Phrase:&lt;br/&gt;In front the statue is a plaque dedicated to Warren. What is the dedication date? &lt;br/&gt;Use all numbers, month/day/year (6 digits). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This Monument commenorates Lincoln's Getttysburg Address, November, 19 1863.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &quot;few appropriate remarks&quot; of Lincoln at Gettysburg came to be accepted with the passing of years not only as a fine expression of the purposes for which the war was fought, but as a masterpiece of literature. An effort to have the words of the martyr President commemorated on this battlefield culminated with the inclusion in the act approved February 12, 1895, which established Gettysburg National Military Park, of a provision for the erection of such a memorial. Pursuant to this authority, the Park Commission erected the Lincoln Address Memorial, in January 1912, near the west gate of the national cemetery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four score and 7 years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. &lt;br/&gt;Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are met on a great battlefield of that war. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The brave men, living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is rather for us to be dedicated to the great task remaining before us…amp;quot;that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion…amp;quot;that we highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONFIRMATION CODE PHRASE:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Locate the bronze plaque in the rear of the monument for the Congressional establishment of a Militery Park at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and answer the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Erected in compliance with Act of (XX) Congress, (X)sesson.

He was in construction all his life and after he retired he, and his wife Peggy started making crafts. In his woodworking shop he would cut out the pieces and put them together then they would set at the kitchen table and paint them. They would give them to friends and family as gifts.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are remodeling his shop into a computer repair business and although there will always be memories there we decided to place this cache using one of the things he created. Feel free to pull up to the garage doors or park in the grass to the right of GZ. If you see a lady looking out the window giver her a wave, that's Peggy aka Nena.</groundspeak:long_description>

It could be 100 degreesoutside but this water is fed from the mountain and is very cold all the time.It is also a great place to camp, nice trails in wooded ares. Sandy beach area, pinic areas, etc. So come and enjoy yourself.</groundspeak:long_description>

Take a break, and investigate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a bison nano non magnetic cache. You'll need to bring your writing instrument of choice, and some tweezers or any other device that will remove the log sheet. enjoy, and please, if the log is full... let me know.

Sometimes, the state offers free coffee here just to break up the drive and keep you aware. Walk north to a small patch of trees and ignore the roaring noise of the interstate. You'll want to wander north west of the shed...  after you find the cache, stroll along the path just further north of it to stretch out your legs and enjoy the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a blue nano bison tube that is non magnetic. its at the base of a tree. I'm sure the snow in the winter will hide it even better.  You'll need to bring your own writing instrument of choice, and tweezers or something similar to remove the cache. Let me know when the log is full. If you should have a spare log, please let me know that you changed it or added it. - Logs are about an inch wide and as long as a sheet of paper. Enjoy your brake... Snow Shoe is bad in the winter... so, this will help you forget that you're stuck on a mountain top. I hope you stay safe headed west, there are more mountain tops further west without rest areas. </groundspeak:long_description>

He loved skipping rocks at Canadice Lake and this place has the best skipping stones in New England. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Born to John and Paula Ewers, Todd touched the lives of everyone who knew him.  He loved his toys dearly, especially his red ball. He was a kind hearted, gentle man who lived a full but shortened life.  We loved him dearly and keep him with us on our hearts always.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; So grab some smooth stones, enjoy the lake and try it for yourself.  See if you can do my uncle proud!&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I either looked for or found another cache nearby here a few years ago. No one in the park today, I parked by the tower and made a quick walk in the gorgeous sunshine &amp; found the cache with no trouble. Poison ivy, if it's there, was easily avoided. 

Didn't notice any TBs, was hoping to pick at least one up to move on. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

All Geritol Follies caches are on level ground or easily walkable paths with the exception of the last few feet to the cache site. There is never a need to bushwhack. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container is a black polyurethane ammo box with a green geocache.com sticker on the outside. Please be respectful of the area. &lt;br/&gt;Waypoint #1:&lt;br/&gt;N43 00.083&lt;br/&gt;W077 38.899&lt;br/&gt;Notice the items nearby. Using these items, count the number of screws on the plaque and the year of dedication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These numbers will help you find the final cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;______= # of screws&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;______ = year of dedication&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find Waypoint #2:&lt;br/&gt;Add the number of screws to N43.00.131. This is your new latitude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subtract the year of dedication from W077.40.982. This is your new longitude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enter these coordinates and proceed to Waypoint #2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint #2:&lt;br/&gt;Locate the Stull Family.&lt;br/&gt;Add the total of Jacob and Susannah’s ages to N43.00.069.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subtract Abigail’s birth year from W077.40.777.&lt;br/&gt;The result of your calculation is the resting spot of the final cache. You now have the final cache coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final Cache: Remember to trade even and fair. Please hide as well or better than found! The final cache is located in a wooded area. The ground may be uneven. Be watchful of the terrain for any unexpected hazards. This is an easy walk if you are careful!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We encourage CITO – please bring a bag with you and help keep the area free of trash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope you enjoyed your visit to another cache in the Geritol Follies series, Geritol Rush&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The coordinates on the cache page will take you to one of the&lt;br /&gt;
entrances of the Ridge Road Cemetery in Greece.&lt;br /&gt;

In order to find the cache, you will need to locate the&lt;br /&gt;
area and find out what is missing from the picture below.&lt;br /&gt;

Once you figure out what is missing, you need to use the&lt;br /&gt;
information there to figure out the corrdinates to the cache, as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
cache location: N43 12.ABC W077 40.XYZ&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;thevidas&lt;/b&gt; made our &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; into New York official, with our first hide since relocating.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With keeping a career field but making a job change, we moved from Lansing, MI&lt;br /&gt;
to Rochester, NY the first week of February 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided on our way to a Leap Day 2012 event, that this would be a perfect day&lt;br /&gt;
to hide our first NY cache. A day that only comes once every 4 years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should be a fairly easy find. Cache is a small lock-n-lock, hidden in a typical fashion.&lt;br /&gt;
Parking is available during the day... park closes at dusk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is near a couple of pavilions, which will present muggle activity throughout the year,&lt;br /&gt;
and heavier during the &quot;non-winter&quot; months... stealth will be necessary at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First to find gets a shiny gold dollar!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Here is another in our Geritol Follies series of caches, These caches are designed for the mature geocacher who enjoys the sport and doesn’t want to break into a sweat, play swamp thing or mountain goat, and are suitable for all ages and levels of geo-cache expertise. All Geritol Follies caches are on level ground or easily walkable paths with the exception of the last few feet to the cache site. There is never a need to bushwhack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geritol Sam brings you to a place that you may have driven by and not even noticed. Many people have ‘passed’ this way that were instrumental in settling our area. Names of note: William and Mehitable Hincher, first white settlers west of the Genesee River and Sam Patch, Lake Captain and famous daredevil (there is also a packet boat bearing his name). This is also the final resting place for many Revolutionary, War of 1812 and Civil War Veterans. The first lighthouse keeper also resides here. Take time to look around. Maps are available. If you are from the area, you will notice other names that are familiar to you. &lt;br/&gt;The final cache container is small, (not quite a micro but almost) with no room for trade items unless similar in size to hat pins, small TB’s/geo coins, geo-george dollars, etc. The log is small too, with only room for the date and a small stamp or signature. BYOP (Bring your own pencil/pen.) There are FTF items should you choose to take them. Please be sure to secure the container lid tightly and replace as good or better than found and report any maintenance issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring the kids, let them learn a little about Sam Patch and the area, give them the GPS and let them do the math!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Locate the final resting place of Sam Patch’s remains, which were found the spring after he leaped to his death over Upper Falls and into the Genesee River. Friday the 13th was indeed his unlucky day!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N43 16.435&lt;br/&gt;_________ Subtract the year of his birth&lt;br/&gt;_________ This is your new setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;W077 35.947&lt;br/&gt;__________ Add the date of his final leap&lt;br/&gt;___________ This is your new setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The above coordinates will take you to the final cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We hope you have enjoyed this walk through time. Please be respectful of the area. Muggles are out and about so be discreet and stealthy. We encourage CITO, so please do your share.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>There is nothing wrong with the directions...if you can't find it using the above information, you need to go back to the beginning and do the math correctly! :)</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Be sure to replace its protective cover/camouflage (if removed). Please be VERY careful to leave it exactly as you found it! We wouldn't want the cache to go missing in action.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you.&lt;br/&gt;The fun of this cache is in the hunt and with that, PLEASE RESPECT THE CACHERS CODE BY NOT ADDING ANY SPOILER INFO OR PHOTOS TO YOUR LOGS. Any spoilers will be deleted by cache owner. &lt;br/&gt;The hike begins near Lake Consecon on County Road #1 and traverses along the abandoned railroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The posted coordinates above (N43° 59.263 W077° 29.350) will lead you to a redirect written in black marker (now changed to a plasic label).&lt;br/&gt;This will give you the coordinates to the second waypoint where you will find the cache. The cache is hidden completely out of sight. Please be very careful to leave it exactly as you found it.&lt;br/&gt;If You must know the cache names meaning, then you will have to scientifically research the terminology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTES:&lt;br/&gt;1. Geocache is a small peanut butter type container, so don't bring anything too big to put into it.&lt;br/&gt;2. Family friendly and an excellent place to let your pet off the leash for a run.&lt;br/&gt;3. This trail is often shared by hikers, mountain bikers, snowmobilers, and ATVers. Please keep an eye out for others and step aside if necessary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Caching 2010 style!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN2FQA2 - GC2FQA2 Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PK2FQA2 - GC2FQA2 Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 59.385 W 077° 29.307</groundspeak:long_description>

I found some trees that had been placed across them and walked across them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a small camo'd Lock N Lock.  BYOP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache # 2 located in Trenmar Lake Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entrance to park is located off Wooler Road just south of Telephone Road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The park area is gated and is sometimes locked at night so its a good idea to park on the road if you will be there late.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This park was obviously once well maintained but it has obviously been let go. You will see lots of evidence of this during your visit. But despite that it is a nice wooded area very close to Trenton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container is a fragmentation cache retrieved from Aaron Haynes' &quot; Pay it Forward&quot; cache located near Napanee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please watch for POISON IVY ... I got into it somewhere in the park while planting this series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONGRATULATIONS to billedm and Go Play Outside on their shared FTF !!!</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache name should be a hint as to the general area in which this box is located. Warning: THIS CACHE IS PLACED NEAR A DAM AND CANAL. PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS WHEN IN THIS AREA. THERE IS NO NEED TO GO NEAR THE DAM OR CANAL OR  TO CLIMB ON OR UNDER THE STEEL STRUCTURE  TO RETRIEVE THIS CACHE!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Geocache has been placed with the permission of Parks Canada&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a hybrid geocache/letterbox.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; For those who are unfamiliar with letterboxing we will try to describe it.  Letterboxing is very similar to geocaching with the exception that those who seek letterboxes seldom use GPS units but rely mainly on hints that are posted on a website (www.atlasquest.com or www.letterboxing.net) We mainly use Atlasquest.   Another difference is letterboxers do not trade swag but exchange stamp impressions which most custom carve. Letterboxers stamp their trail stamp image into the logbook and write any notes they want to add the same as a geocacher would do. They then make an impression of the Letterbox stamp in their own logbook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Please feel free to join the letterbox fun, there are not nearly as many letterboxes in Ontario as Geocaches but it is a nice supliment to geocaching. Please be stealthy when going for and replacing this cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This cache is a 4x6 Lock N Lock covered in Black Duct tape. It contains 2 baggies. One for the Geocache with a logbook, pencil, and a sheet with information on the history of the Trent Severn, and the other is the Letterbox with a logbook,a trailstamp. (PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THE CUSTOM STAMP !!) . Feel free to take a look and login and join the fun at the above mentioned website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; There is no SWAG in the container, Parks Canada requests no exchange of SWAG in any caches located within park boundaries.  The stamp you will find in the Letterbox side is so boxers can stamp this image into their collector book. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THE CUSTOM STAMP. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When putting the container back please make sure the lid is facing toward the main structure. This will allow the container to be tucked in and therefore be out of site. This is a high muggle area and the life of this Hybrid depends on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HISTORY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Construction began on the Trent Severn Waterway in 1833. The first lock sites were Bobcaygeon and Purdy's Mills, now Lindsay. Construction began in this area around the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In July of 1920, the first vessel to complete a through-passage was the motor launch Irene. The journey from Trenton to Port Severn took nine days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The 386 km long waterway stretches from Trenton Ontario, on the Bay of Quinte to Port Severn on Georgian Bay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the early days the locks were all operated by hand, now the lockmasters get assisted by modern technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large steel structure were you found this cache/box is now abandoned, but was once used to install a dam so maintanance could be performed on the canal between here and Lock 6.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please go to the following websites for a more detailed description of the system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.parkscanada.ca/&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;http://www.tswpanel.ca/english/historytsw.asp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to Pookie and Guardian14 for being FTF !!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations on find # 1400 to Go Play Outside !!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: AA1QNGZ - Trent Severn Lock # 6&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Our 100th plant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is located on a little known island near the town of Frankford, Ontario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrain is pretty much level depending on the route you take. The trails can me muddy especially in the spring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache should be an easy find. It is not designed to be difficult but just to take you to a nice spot on the island.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a small black Lock N Lock. Logbook only with no pen/pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I took the following description from another cache (Bata Island - GC2MWXC).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is located on Bata Island.The paths are open and very friendly to the young or old. Bring your dog, have a picnic lunch (no tables) or throw in a fishing line. Trails can be damp in the spring but nothing that a good pair of boots won't cure. This is an all season cache and promises to have different wildlife views each time you come. The entrance is not marked and can seem a little tricky. Just off Glen Ross road on a dirt road just beyond large piles of rock if you're going north from Frankford. Bata or Sill Island Total: 1.7 kilometres At the point Glen Ross Road crosses just north of Huffman Road, a dirt road leads by a pile of rocks to a bridge which leads over to Sill Island (also known as Bata Island). A walk around the island is a must. This is one of Frankford's little secrets: a beautiful little island with a few easy trails and some great views of the river. It's a perfect spot for a picnic. Before you cross the yellow bridge to the island, take a look at the old millstones lying near the bridge. One nestles in the water just north of the bridge and a couple of others are lying on the bank not far away. I hope someone saves at least one of these and puts it in a prominent place (on the island, say) before they are ploughed into the earth. These stones were used in pairs to grind grain. Grindstone, near Bata/Sill Island, north of Frankford The concrete stones have an outer band of black flintstone-like material, like concrete wheels with flintsone tires. Metal bolts keep the stones from falling apart. A grist mill was built in Frankford in the 1880s and operated until 1972. One website lists a W.A.R. Milne as the Miller at Sills' grist mill until his early death in 1920. The trails are marred by a few yahoos who have thrown garbage here and there, but it's not overwhelming. On the spring day I walked these trails, I got my first view of wild flowers for the season. In areas, beautiful covers of blue spread through the woods. The trails are easy, and wander to each end of the island. There are a few places where you can stop by the water to picnic. At the north end, there are abutments to an old bridge, where ducks, geese and other birds gather. I saw a white bird with an incredibly long orange beak sitting on one of the abutments. (Damn. I need to study bird species.) The northern loop, at just over 1 kilometre, is the longest round-trip stroll. It has a little 200-metre spur running parallel to the north-east side of the trail. I found this a bit wet on the spring day I walked it. As the northern spur loops back to the bridge, an open area appears; this would make another nice picnic spot. The south trail, about 340 metres, leads to the section of the river that splits Bata/Sill Island from the little island to the south. You can get a good view of the dams to the south from here and the Sills Island Generating Station, (sic: that's how it's listed by Ontario Power generation), which is the second oldest generating station in the province. It was originally used as a paper mill. The G.E. Sills Paper Mill or the above-mentioned grist mill were presumably the origin of the island's name. A little 100-metre spur about 115 metres from the bridge cuts across the island from the south trail to the eastern side. It's not well travelled and I debated as to whether it was an &quot;official&quot; trail. It's best to stick to the trails on the island as you could disturb a lot of flora and fauna tromping through the bush, especially as there are lots of stopping places to picnic. The island is so small that you'll have no trouble spotting wildlife. Check &quot;the musings of a sad girl&quot; for some detail on this area. This blog has more detail on the flora and fauna on the island than I could ever hope to supply. The bridge to the island is not marked at the road, so keep an eye out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***CONGRATULATIONS to mcbali on FTF !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!***</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">SCUTTLEHOLES - MOIRA RIVER This area is considered to be an outstanding example of a karst development which is only uncommonly found throughout Ontario. The Moira Karst site extends from Latta in the south to Chisholm's Mill in the north. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has deemed the area to be ANSI (Area of Natural &amp; Scientific Interest) &amp; is geologically &amp; ecologically sensitive. As such, please stay on the clearly marked trail &amp; respect the area immediately surrounding the cache site. Unique geological features have been created in the limestone bedrock by the dissolving action of water erosion. Features range from sinkholes, collapsed caverns, underground channels, limestone islands to blind channels in the river's course. Sections of the river actually disappear underground only to resurface further downstream. While many of the geological formations are on private property (such as the Moira Cave with its 1000 meters of passageways) &amp; not available to the public, a good example of a scuttlehole can be seen at: N44 19.107 W077 19.761. It is approximately 3 m high, 10 m long &amp; 5 m wide &amp; can be entered cautiously during snow-free months. Please use caution &amp; discretion as it requires a short but steep 3 m climb down a limestone formation. It is unnecessary to enter the cave as the cache is located about 40 m away. What's really strange about the area is that during July , August &amp; into September you can walk on sections of the dry limestone riverbed. However, during the spring runoff the Moira River Canoe Club perform their annual whitewater races in the same location!! From the cave location you can see the guy wires that hold the racing gates stretched across the river. The cache is available year round but exploration of the entire area is best during the months listed above. Pictures (taken over the past 2 years) of the cave, dry riverbed &amp; whitewater kayaking all taken within 100 m of the cave location are included with this listing. &lt;br/&gt;Enjoy but please use caution with kids near the river during the spring runoff &amp; at other times due to several visible collapsed sinkholes and open caves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Be careful when
searching for this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be a good idea
to bring someone along as the terrain is a little tricky and it's
probably a good idea to have someone with you - this isn't a well
traveled road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please make sure that
the cache is anchored back in place when you have finished...it
will be long gone if it comes loose.  Make sure you don't drop
the log book while signing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a
film canister. Bring your own pen! A flashlight may help you out
also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun...but
&lt;u&gt;please be careful&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

caches are a series of micro-caches that take you to beautiful and
some forgotten cemeteries throughout the area. We introduce you to
these cemeteries as a way of exploring our local history, and those
who were early settlers here. While visiting we hope that you can
reflect on their lives and contributions to the communities that
they helped build into where we live today. Please respect their
resting place and ensure that extreme care is taken during your
visit. Please bring your own pen!&lt;/p&gt;

&quot;Restin'&quot; caches are
a series of micro-caches that take you to beautiful and some
forgotten cemeteries throughout the area. We introduce you to these
cemeteries as a way of exploring our local history, and those who
were early settlers here. While visiting we hope that you can
reflect on their lives and contributions to the communities that
they helped build into where we live today. Please respect their
resting place and ensure that extreme care is taken during your
visit. Please bring your own pen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a quick find
along Hwy-41 in Northbrook.  Some of my relatives are buried
here. While in the area, check out the caches in the nearby
villages of Cloyne and Flinton if you haven't already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

through Cloyne and surrounding areas, uprooting and breaking off
trees and damaging power lines.  45mm hail was recorded during
the storm.  The storm was a &lt;b&gt;microburst&lt;/b&gt;, a fast moving
downward column of wind, similar to a tornado.  The microburst
caused one injury and one fatality as well as extensive damage to
property and trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you drive in to this cache, look into the
forest and see the remains from this microburst.  There are
many trees that are uprooted and fallen.  The cache is hidden
in an area with significant damage.  Take some time and look
around and see the force that storms like these have.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Congratulations to pooky14 for the First to Find (FTF).
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a fairly easy micro on what locals call Myer's Rapids.
Across the road (506) are some cool caves and a great picnic spot
(that you have to wade through the river to get to). Many people
fish in this river also.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please note that this cache is right along a busy highway. Please be careful and walk on the ditch side of the guardrail. You can park just south of the cache where the guardrail ends. DO NOT park right at the cache as the shoulder is too narrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I recently learned of this spot by some locals and thought it was an interesting spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approx 20 years ago a beaver dam located in Bon Echo Park broke and sent a torrent of water toward hwy 41. The water washed out the soil including Hwy 41 itself down to bare rock right into Mazinaw lake.&lt;br/&gt;When standing at the guardrail facing West (away from the lake) you can see the large amount of material that was eroded away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today there is a large culvert and reenforcement rocks to prevent this from happening again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was told when Mazinaw Lake's water is lower and when the light is right you can see the large &quot;sandbar&quot; of eroded material that flows out a distance into Mazinaw Lake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to Guardian14 for the FTF !!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Redsuspenders on find # 700 !!</groundspeak:long_description>

Please use caution and wear appropriate footwear. Climbing gear is not required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a camo'd micro. Logbook only. Bring your own pen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache location is just off Hwy 41 just north of a closed down restaurant called the Moosehorn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have noticed this rockface everytime I drive to work in Denbigh, so I finally made the climb up. The view is great you can see both Macivoy and Irving Lakes. Definately worth the climb in my opinion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache will be changed to a larger container soon, but for now the micro will get you up there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can park on the road by the snowmobile trail that leads you to the base of the hill. It is a short hike (approx 200 metres) into the base of the hill. But be careful as the shoulder is very narrow. There may be room for 1 vehicle just up the trail, but you will have to be sure to have your car all the way off the trail. Alternately you can park approx 1/2 km north up the road in a larger road way which intersects the same snowmobile trail. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I will add the waypoints for the trailhead and alternate parking within the next week&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be careful during hunting season (mid Oct to mid Dec)</groundspeak:long_description>

This will be an easy find as you can park within 10 metres of the cache. You will have to walk up a small embankment during the lastfew metres of your hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a replacement for the Cool Cow Cache that had gone missing a few months ago. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a 4 litre plastic container, that is large enough for most TB's, geocoins, etc.  Cache contains a small prize for the 1st Five finders. Cache is tethered to the tree it is located so it will not be carried away by animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache has a cow related theme, so if possible please make trades cow related if possible. But if you don't have cow related items still feel free to trade anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache has been placed with the permission of the owners of the 41 Stop. They encourage geocaching, so don't worry about being stealthy as they know exactly where the cache is located.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you think cache has gone missing please report it to the staff at 41 Stop (they will let me know about it), or messege me.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Not to far from our cottage this is a nice out of the way secluded waterfall where Moore Creek runs into the Madawaska river the cache can be reached by small boat, canoe, or kayak (watch out for shallow rocks if coming in with a motor boat) Once you reach the waterfall you will need to follow the trail on the south side to the top and then make your way to the north side of the creek I Supplied a way point for a free boat ramp, but if your going by canoe or Kayak you can always slip it in from the 523

R. R. Tolkien. Ce sont les esprits de la forêt, des créatures à l'apparence d'arbres qui font probablement partie des peuples les plus anciens de la Terre du Milieu. Leur nom provient du vieil anglais, où le terme ent désigne un « géant », dans le sens d'une race mystérieuse à laquelle on attribuait toute sorte de travaux antiques gigantesques&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Les Huorns sont des Ents qui sont presque retournés à l'état sauvage (à l'état d'arbres), quant à l'aspect au moins.&lt;br/&gt;Ils restent observateurs, silencieux, guettant ce qui se passe tout autour d'eux. Ils sont très nombreux. Il est parfois difficile de les voir bouger, mais ils peuvent le faire très rapidement, et s'entourer d'ombres ou de brumes s'ils le désirent. Ils peuvent communiquer avec les Ents. Ils sont méfiants, sauvages, et peuvent se révéler très dangereux. Les autres Ents doivent tout le temps les surveiller. Si certains Huorns ont peut-être un cœur véritablement mauvais, tel le Vieil Homme-Saule de la Vieille Forêt, la plupart ne sont pas véritablement mauvais, mais farouches et hostiles envers les êtres marchant sur deux pattes, et ils détestent les Orcs.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Celui ci garde la foret et empeche les hommes de la detruire.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;  Vieux Proverbe Ent Africain : &quot; Si l'arbre savait ce que lui réserve la hache, il ne lui aurait pas fourni la manche &quot;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Attention: On m'a informé que l'ancien centre comunautaire (salle age d'or) est maintenant une residence privé je suis passé rencontrer les nouveaux propriétaires et leur expliquer la cache. Il y a pas de probleme car la cache n'est pas sur leur terrais mais bien a coté. SVP evité de vous stationné et/ou passé dans la cour privé. Se stationner sur le coté de cette petite route c'est sans danger car c'est juste un rang. Merci de bien la replacer et de respecter la quiétude des voisins ;)</groundspeak:long_description>

Dans cette ligne, la bleuetiere de Val-Senneville&lt;br/&gt;voit le jour en 1966. C'est un reve longuement caresse par l'abbe&lt;br/&gt;George Beland et Real Coulombe (Mon Grand Pere), qui sera le&lt;br/&gt;premier president du Syndicat de production. Apres deboisement la&lt;br/&gt;Caisse populaire de Val-Senneville accorde un pret pour&lt;br/&gt;l'amenagement de 100 acres qui, la premiere annee, donne 28 000&lt;br/&gt;livres de bleuets. Cela procure d'importants revenus d'appoint a de&lt;br/&gt;nombreuse familles. Merci a la Societe d'histoire et de Genealogie&lt;br/&gt;de Val-d'Or.

Malheureusement, j'ai du la deplace de l'endroit original avant
mmme de l'activer, detruite par des geomoldus je croyais elle etait
assez loin de la route pour ne pas devoir la cacher
enormement...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ce coup ci elle est un peu plus loin...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
J'ai du modifier les atrubuts elle doit maintenant etre fait a la
nage ... le pont a ete brulé (probablement de main criminelle) donc
ce fait en hiver ou vous devez nager ;(&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cette photo est probablement la derniere qui aura ete prise de ce
pont :( grosse perte!!!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Soit huit verres d’eau ! La plus grande partie de cette eau est bue, et le reste provient de votre alimentation.&lt;br/&gt;Des fonctions corporelles normales, telles que la transpiration et l’urine, font perdre au corps jusqu’au 1,07 litres d’humidité par jour. Lorsque vous pratiquez du sport, ce chiffre est encore plus élevé. Boire de l’eau n’est pas un luxe superflu : il est essentiel que vous gardiez votre teneur en eau. &lt;br/&gt;La déshydratation se définit en fonction du poids corporel. Une perte en eau représentant aussi peu que de 1 % à 2 % du poids corporel est déjà considérée comme de la déshydratation. Une perte qui atteint de 15 % à 20 % du poids corporel peut provoquer la mort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;La déshydratation peut être aiguë, comme à la suite d’un exercice intense, ou plutôt chronique, en conséquence d’une consommation insuffisante et prolongée d’eau ou d’autres boissons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le meilleur moyen de détecter une déshydratation est d’observer la couleur de l’urine. Chez les personnes en bonne santé, elle devrait être jaune très pâle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Les premiers signes de déshydratation :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;une urine foncée;&lt;br/&gt;la bouche et la gorge sèches;&lt;br/&gt;un manque d'énergie;&lt;br/&gt;la peau sèche;&lt;br/&gt;des maux de tête et des étourdissements;&lt;br/&gt;une intolérance à la chaleur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Et plus speciellement pour les personne qui font de l'exercices physique comme la randonne et le geocaching.&lt;br/&gt;Vous devez toujours apporter avec vous de l'eau et si possible en avoir de secours si la randonne devait se prolonger&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bon Geocaching et apportez de l'eau! ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK320T9 - Pont&lt;br/&gt;N 48° 15.487 W 077° 37.591&lt;br/&gt;Park</groundspeak:long_description>
