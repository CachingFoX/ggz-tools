This cache is placed in honor of my new Grand Daughter (Jodie) who helped put on the label. You don't have to go under the bridge or down to the water unless the water is high. I am hidden by fossles so look very close because a fossle covers the entrance to my home. You can pull off at the end of the bridge then follow the vhicle path that goes down beside the bridge. The cache is between the top of the bridge and the river below, not on the bridge or bridge rail. remember your clues you will need them to locate Jodies little hide.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache I guess you could say is sort of a Guard Rail cache but probably not like any you have ever seen. It blends very well with its environment and you will be lucky to find it. Come see if you can. Happy Caching </groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is located close to the now closed 7 springs well. It is placed near the small wooden gun boat in the park. Enjoy the park and the History along with Beautiful country settings in this quiet sleepy little town.

in the remains of an old Civil War Fort



&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the site of a Union Fort, built in 1864
to protect the rear of the Union lines, to prevent Confederate
forces from advancing in the event the lines were captured. To get
credit for this cache you must find out the common name for the
artillery that was once there and enter it as the code phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have placed a cache in each
of the four Civil War Era Batteries / Forts in owned by
Chesterfield County. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.co.chesterfield.va.us/Tourism/civilwarsites.asp&quot;&gt;http://www.co.chesterfield.va.us/Tourism/civilwarsites.asp&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Great care has been
taken to not disturb important archeological areas, so please do
not enter any area that has been marked off-limits to the
public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good Luck and

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;p&gt;A small micro cache (log only) hidden on this
   small Chesterfield County property which held major significance
   during two different historical periods :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bermuda Hundred was started in 1613, after the
English settlers made peace with the Virginia natives. It was named
after the traumatic shipwreck of the &quot;Third Supply&quot; bringing
reinforcements to Virginia in 1609. The leaders of that expedition
were shipwrecked in Bermuda and had to take their wrecked ship
apart and build two smaller ships to finally get to Virginia.
Bermuda Hundred was initially intended to include several
&quot;hundreds&quot; upstream and downstream of the Appomattox River. The
Bermuda settlements were attacked severely in 1622, when the
natives abandoned their efforts at peaceful coexistence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bermuda Hundred never gained prominence again
until 1864 when a Union Army occupied it. The Federal troops under
Major General Benjamin F. Butler landed here, between Richmond and
Petersburg, in early May 1864. His Army of the James threatened
both cities in his drive west from landings between the James and
Appomattox Rivers. Confederates under Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard
blocked him via the construction of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=fa4d1f16-5719-4ba3-ab6f-f887b1c94287&quot;&gt;
Howlett's Line&lt;/a&gt;. Within weeks, Butler was trapped between the
two rivers and remained there until Petersburg was evacuated in
April 1865.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signal Tower at Bermuda Hundred Landing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache was a gift
from my son for Father's Day. I am very fortunate to have a great
son, who introduced me to Geocaching in 2001. This cache is placed
in honor of all the father / son geocachers who spend time together
going to out of the way places to find a cache or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is an Ammo
Can,  with a very special gift to the first finder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of two
caches hidden in Pocahontas State Park that are disguised as
something natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are not always
as they seem!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The cache is very
   small, but does have room for small items, Geocoins or even
   small Travel bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be careful to
place the cache back exactly as you found it and to recreate any
surroundings you may have disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park at the Main
Entrance to the Park (fees apply).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is on the
perimeter of the entrance field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This micro cache was
   placed in honor of the 3rd Annual Richmond Rally at Pocahontas
   State Park. If you are visiting from outside the Richmond area,
   you may not know that we have one of the best Burger restaurants
   in the state.  So if you find this cache and you are hungry
   - just look across the parking lot for good food, good fun and
   great fries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to tell you
that a lot of planning went into this cache, but the reality is
that I found a bison tube with a log ready to go in my car while at
a vendor site. I looked around and thought &quot;Why not place it here?&quot;
So that is how this cache came to be. It should be a relatively
easy park and grab with minimal muggle issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Tarzan is a fictional character, an archetypal feral child raised in the African jungle by apes, who later returns to civilization only to largely reject it and return to the wild as a heroic adventurer. Created by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tarzan first appeared in the novel Tarzan of the Apes (magazine publication 1912, book publication 1914), and then in twenty-three sequels and innumerable works in other media, authorized or not.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">It is claimed by some that the nursery rhyme is actually about Little Jack Horner, steward to Richard Whiting, the last abbot of Glastonbury Abbey before the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII of England. Legend has it that, prior to the abbey's destruction, the abbot sent Horner to London with a huge Christmas pie which had the deeds to a dozen manors hidden within it. During the journey Horner opened the pie and extracted the deeds of the manor of Mells in Somerset. The manor properties included lead mines in the Mendip Hills, hence &quot;He pulled out a plum&quot; - from the Latin plumbum, for lead. While records do indicate that Thomas Horner became the owner of the manor, both his descendants and subsequent owners of Mells Manor have claimed that the legend is untrue.

A 16th-century rhyme noted:

    &quot;Hopton, Horner, Smyth and Thynne:
    When Abbotts went out, they came in.&quot;

The first publication date for &quot;Little Jack Horner&quot; is 1725, but all the common English nursery rhymes were long in circulation before they appeared in print.

This cache is hidden in Chesterfield's &quot;Horner Park,&quot; thus the name.  As caches go, there is nothing tricky about this one.  You've probably seen this hide techniques a hundreds of times before.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This Micro is right
across the street from one of Richmond's long time employers, known
to it's employees as &quot;Uncle Phil&quot;. There is ample parking available
and other than shift change (07:00, 15:00, 23:00) muggles should be
managable. Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;

1. A fixed, intense dislike;repugnance: I have formed an aversion to lamp post caches.
2. The cause or object of such a feeling.  Lamp post caches are
repugnant.
3. The avoidance of a thing, situation, or behavior because it has been
associated with an unpleasant or painful stimulus. I will not seek to find any more lamp post caches.

I HATE LAMP POST CACHES !!!
An Evil Frog Prince Cache - Originally placed 1/7/2007
 
Lamp post caches require minimal skill or intelligence to find and even less
to hide. The only thing they are good for is to increase your “numbers”. Some caches are hidden under the cover and require only a primitive
mono-synaptic reflex response to locate the container. The more
creative caches are magnetic nano-containers placed 20 feet or more
up the pole. To successfully retrieve this type of cache, I started
carrying a cane fishing pole in my car when geocaching.

When the Princess found out what the fishing pole was for, she sent me to a therapist. My therapist suggested behavior modification therapy to assist in overcoming my intense dislike for lamp post caches. After weeks of graded exposure where I was required to visualize and eventually touch a
picture of a lamp post cache, she said I was ready to use positive
reinforcement to win victory over my aversion. Her assignment was
for me to hide a lamp post cache and experience the joy of watching
hordes of geocachers rush to the cache. Each email notification
that the cache has been found serves to reinforce my joy and
eventually aid in overcoming my hatred for lamp post
caches.

Thank you for aiding in my recovery. Please replace the cache exactly as
found so others can share in the JOY! Be sure to bring a pen to sign the log. Posting a find without signing the log will result in a less than joyous deletion of the entry.

As you leave to hunt for the cache ... don't forget your fishing pole !!!

The cache IS NOT hidden under any lumber, in or under trash cans, or anywhere that would require moving or disrupting any of the fixtures in the area.  

This cache is in a small metal Whitman's Sampler tin.  The container is not large enough to support many items.  Muggles can be a problem so please be discreet when retrieving the container and be sure to replace it as found.  If visitors are present, just purchase a soft drink from one of the machines, take a seat at the picnic table, and wait for them to leave.  This can be an easy night time find as the area is lighted.  The area is easily accessible even by wheel chair.

I was expecting to have found a slightly filled log when I opened this one up but was one happy cacher once that lid came off! Great case of coordinate accuracy today. Funny how some times that happens and other times I'm ready to ask Santa for a new model. Now I see why a super-nearby cache was archived. Heh, one that I spent 20 minutes looking for about a month and a half ago before giving up and discovering it didn't live there anymore. Nifty container you got there. SL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

&lt;b&gt;It should be a cache and dash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Be sure to inspect within a 10' radius in any direction.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Introducing this cache that is near the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park, but not on park land, called &lt;b&gt;Deep Run&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A micro in a wood, it's located very near the easternmost tributary of Deep Run Creek, the site of Confederate encampments in 1862. The cache is next to a county road which is subject to many muggles and parking is now of a temporary nature.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please replace precisely as found or the value of the cache may be
diminished.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you walk about 25' or so to the West from the cache, you should see what I felt was a fine view of Deep Run, especially when the water levels are higher as they were on the date this cache was place here. &lt;br/&gt;

I'd like to think it was my impeccable ability to describe the possible hiding places as we approached the parking area.

The cache is next to a county road which is subject to quite a few muggles and some small amount of stealth might be required.&lt;br/&gt;

Insure that you do not touch any areas that are private. The cache is not in the bushes, not on private land, and there should be no reason to leave the city maintained areas to reach the cache.

You probably should leave your picnic basket in the car. You'll catch the name of this park when you turn off the main drag. This cache will be available for finding 24/7, 365 days a year. I think this one is a tougher than any of my previous hides, but you shouldn't have much trouble making the find. As usual, BYOP and please replace carefully. Happy Caching! </groundspeak:long_description>

All VooDini’s caches in the Fairfax area are suitable for children. The original cache is loaded with an assortment of goodies to include a coin. Please only trade one item so that others may have something to enjoy. 

This is a great park and I went to the information center to get their approval to geocache. It seems FCPA may have an outdated list online as the info center stated they participate and advocate geocaching.


Enjoy.

I found this one by accident, and I'm not really  sure if its #1 or #2.  I was looking for #1, spiraling out from the coordinates in a thorough search pattern.  Then I spotted this one in the open and amazingly obvious.  Its about 50' from the posted coordinates.  Unfortunately my batteries died while looking so I can't provide a better reading.  I removed the the food items and repacked the contents in the baggie.  Rehid it with just a bit of natural cover.</groundspeak:text>

All VooDini’s caches in the Fairfax area are suitable for children. The original cache is loaded with an assortment of goodies to include a coin. Please only trade one item so that others may have something to enjoy. 

This is a great park and I went to the information center to get their approval to geocache. It seems FCPA may have an outdated list online as the info center stated they participate and advocate geocaching.

I started at GZ and worked a spiral search pattern out to 100' which luckily lead to finding the other cache nearby :-).  I CITO'd out another nearly full bag of trash too.  Don't worry, there is more left for you too.  Owner confirmation of this hide would be wonderful.</groundspeak:text>

I had about twenty minutes of time to search before the crowds of kids and adults began arriving for the &quot;Magic in the Park&quot; show in the amphitheater.  Perhaps the owner could provide a confirmation the cache is still in place and/or provide a clue to its location.</groundspeak:text>

Its challenging to hunt for it when the park is busy and the trains are running by regularly.  The listed coordinates seem to put it close to some likely spots but they're all empty.  Pulled quite a bit of trash out during these searches though.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Visited BLP to remedy one of my GC caches but the park was so crowded today it was impossible to find it and replace it.  So I pulled up the OX app and went hunting for this one instead.  The parking area nearby is still closed for reconstruction so I used the wide gravel shoulder about 400' east.  Approaching ground zero I spotted the container immediately.  It was lidless, in the stream bed, contents distributed nearby including the lid.  Critters found some of the contents delicious and had dislodged the container and gnawed it open.  I cleaned up what I found, putting the drier, non-food contents and the log back inside.  The lid is still serviceable.  I'm not sure where it was originally hidden, so picked a decent spot close to the listed coordinates and tucked it away.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

http://www.fairlakes.com/ Depending on the time of day I would recommend a bagel or a slice of pie.

No need for stealth. When you find the cache you will understand. You will be surprised how calm the environment is, even though it is near to traffic.

Enjoy.

Had no luck with them but he found the cache before I had loaded up coords due to his choice of access to the area.  Did some trading and signed in on the sticky note under Networkcacher.  Did punch up coords and they were 75' from where we were.  Cool spot!  </groundspeak:text>

However, as it was currently found, it stands a good chance of being muggled by the first landscaping crew passing by with a trashbag... I'm just saying. The caches are appreciated and a little tweaking to hide technique and coordinate generation could make all of the VooDini caches spectacular!</groundspeak:text>

As described, it was surprisingly secluded here.  Finally I called off the looking and headed out.  As an afterthought I scanned another spot and there was the box!  Its about 70' from the listed coords but easy enough to see.  Signed the log and tucked it back in place.  This will be a very different spot if we get a normal amount of rain again.

All VooDini’s caches in the East Market area are suitable for children. The original cache is loaded with an assortment of goodies. Please only trade one item so that others may have something to enjoy. Awesomeness of VooDini’s cache should be in the range of 4-5. After your find, walk over to Whole Foods or Silver Diner for a quick bite. If you are having GPS issues walk over to Dick’s sporting goods for new equipment.
No need for stealth. When you find the cache you will understand. You will be surprised how calm the environment is, even though it is near to traffic.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True"> VooDini is particular to East Market Fairfax area. It is recommended you spend a half day and enjoy the scenery and amenities like Whole Foods, which is less than .1 M from the cache http://www.shopeastmarket.com/homepage.cfm?id=8. All VooDini’s caches in the East Market area are suitable for children. The original cache is loaded with an assortment of goodies. Please only trade one item so that others may have something to enjoy. Awesomeness of VooDini’s cache should be in the range of 4-5. After your find, walk over to Whole Foods or Silver Diner for a quick bite. If you are having GPS issues walk over to Dick’s sporting goods for new equipment.
No need for stealth. When you find the cache you will understand. You will be surprised how calm the environment is, even though it is near to traffic.
Enjoy.
VooDini

I did add another cache to this location that you can get to. So Cache added and with more goodies than the original that is there. Did this about 30 minutes ago.</groundspeak:text>

A large portion of a tree very near GZ came down recently, possibly last night.  There was tremendous debris covering part of the road and the paved trails.

VA. Safe during the day but I would advise against visiting after
dark. 

My sister and I, along with our cousins, used to play in this park
while visiting our grandmother, Rhoda Hooper. She owned a home down
the street from it for 47 years. Her daughters Stevie, Karen and
Leslie, used to play in the park as well. When my Grandmother
recently passed, we visited the old neighborhood. Seeing the
children playing on Tyler Ave and in the park brought back fond
memories for everyone. My mother writes, &quot;The houses on Tyler Ave
were built post-WW2 and the children who grew up there in the 50s
and 60s will never forget that area. We played together in the
park, played softball on the fields and skated in the pavilion long
before it was officially a Fairfax County park. While we generally
only see each other now at funerals, all one has to do is say Tyler
Ave and we all remember the same things.&quot; My uncle Joe passed last
weekend and we again found ourselves in Falls Church. While
listening to everyone who grew up in the neighborhood and spent
time in the park, the idea to place a geocache here was born. At a
later date this micro will be replaced with a proper full size
container.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Home sweet home for this cache is a cute as a button park on the pre-approved list for geocaching by FCPA.

You might find this cache nothing to write home about, a diamond in the rough or something in between. But even if you can't find your way out of a paper bag, this hide shouldn't drive you up a wall.

Remember what goes around comes around, so don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today as a good cache is hard to find and if you are between a rock and a hard place and find that your dog won't hunt, take the bull by the horns for seek and ye shall find!

As this is my first cache I aimed to make it child's play, easy as pie, KISS, a no brainer, easy as ABC, a piece of cake, like shooting fish in a barrel, a slam dunk.

Don't take the path less travelled as this cache conforms to FCPA requirements and therefore requires very little off the path exploration.

Cache is initially stocked with several kid friendly items. Please rehide so cache is not visible. I believe this to be wheelchair accessible, but if you disagree please let me know and I'll adjust the listing accordingly.

Congrats to wetfit, demonstrating that early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and first to find!

Optional Additional Logging Requirement (ALR): Use a cliché in your log, bonus points for using one not already spoken for. This is optional and your log will not be rubbed out if there is no cliché in sight. But it is more fun than a barrel of monkeys!

NOTICE: This park is open during daylight hours only. Please be respectful of park hours. If you enter the park after hours you are trespassing. If you are stopped you can be ticketed or arrested and will put the future of geocaching in the parks in jeopardy. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Post what you see over the fence. This is a time-lapse project in observation.

Where you are standing was once a a dumping area for refuse from the now-extinct neighborhood over-the-fence. It has been covered up by mulch created from hundreds of mature trees which were removed to start the latest construction project. 

There were once deer, wild turkeys, foxes, black snakes, and other animals running around here. New retention ponds are attracting geese, but all other wildlife has been vastly reduced in population. You can now even see the Metro station since trees and even large hills have been leveled in favor of a flat landscape.

The cache area is lit 24/7 (not a hint).  You can pretty much ignore trespassing signs - just like the hundreds of people who walk through daily on their way to the metro.  Parking is another matter... either park at the Metro and walk over, or keep a sharp eye out for the tow truck. Public-non-permit parking is on Regent's Tower Street. It is a two mile walk to retrieve a towed vehicle. I'm just saying...

2/21/2011 - Downsized the cache to the dreaded film canister after property survey markers appeared nearby. The cache is still hidden in the exact same spot as it was when it was a small. 

8/20/2011 - returned from vacation to see that a large building has gone up within yards of the cache! This may make GPSr's act funky.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The cache is name is OVER The Fence. That is slightly misleading. Stay out of the construction area and focus on a white colored object.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I had put in my dues with a Pirate Rat hide like this before, so the find was a snap.  In fact, the &quot;camo&quot; was out of whack, so it made it even easier.  (I put it back as it should be).  Unfortunately the log got wet.  Still took some ink though.  Thanks PR!

Oh--I saw some pretty big structures going up over the fence.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A small cache located near many fine museums. Bring a pen to sign the log. No room for any trade items, so keep your cargo stowed.

The nation's manifest destiny is echoed in the dreams and visions that are juxtaposed between the nearby Air &amp; Space Museum and the Museum of the American Indian. The cache is on public property and adheres to all caching guidelines. It is not on museum grounds or federal park land.

The cache is respectful to its surroundings, and no extreme efforts are needed to retrieve it. No pole climbing, finger pokes, or periscopes required. Nothing needs to be dismantled or disassembled, so play nice. Stealth is a plus, though, since there are many times of day where tourists abound.

I loved this park from the moment I layed eyes on it. I just knew I had to plant a geocache here. This cache is appropriately named. As I was hiding it, I got a nasty evil bruise on my head, and like the doofus I am, I go, 'Wow, the name of this cache should have something to do with bruises.' Not only did I bonk my head when I hid this cache, but I scraped up my knee. Long story short, be careful when you find this cache and keep your doctor on speed dial. This cache is pretty well concealed, so rehide it exactly how you found it. Cache contents are geared towards the kiddies. No FTF prize. Enjoy the cache! Happy Hunting!! </groundspeak:long_description>

Nice and easy cache. This cache was named for the lack of H2O in Wheaton Regional, our home park. As we were walking to find this cache we noticed that there was no water in all the streams due to the extreme heat. There are many nice trails and geocaches in Wheaton Regional so find the rest after you find this one. Well, hope for rain and Happy Hunting!!!

Nice and easy walk on the Acorn Hills trail in Wheaton regional park. Less than 100' off the path. Up around this area there used to be a campsite. The place where the cache is hidden probably used to be a way to get water, something like a well. We asked the people at the Nature Center, but not even they knew exactly what it is. This should be a simple find. The coords seemed okay but post better ones if you find them. There is a colored pencil in the cache for use of signing the log.

This geocache is near the Nature Center of Wheaton Regional Park in Silver Spring. Visit the Nature Center after you find this cache. It's a nice complex and even more fun for the kids. There are plenty of nice hiking trails that start around where the cache is. This wouldn't be considered a cache-and-dash, but its a pretty easy cache that you don't have to walk far to get to. 
I have been walking up at this park for years and it has always been one of my favorites. It includes LOTS of nice hiking paths, nature center, botonical gardens, ice-skating rink, dog park, and much, much more. Also, in the summer they have a butterfly show. Great opportunity for photo freaks. Stop off at the show after you grab the cache. You won't be disappointed.

This is my first cache hide and I hope you like it.

The area where the cache is hidden can have high muggle density sometimes. Stealth may be required.

The cache is a micro bison tube. No trades and BYOP. The cache is green.

Some people have reported problems finding the cache, so I added a better hint which should be used if you can't find the cache using the coords. It is very much an offset.  </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The cache is greener on the other side of the fence.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

The cache is in a hidden part of Meadowood that backs up to residential area, so most people don't know about it. There is a pond down near where the cache is planted. The pond is beautiful and has some HUGE fish inside. At the moment, you may not see them though because the pond is covered in gallons of pond scum. The park is really nice and includes: basketball court, tennis court, baseball diamond, soccer field, 2 playgrounds, and some short hiking trails. If you go behind the baseball diamond, you will see a little path. Follow that, and if you start to see a pond, you are in the right place. Don't let your pointer make you go buschwacking. If you go around to the bottom right side of the pond near the black fence, there is a trail. That trail will lead you to the cache. The cache itself is an empty pill bottle (got the idea from another cacher) with Chesapeake Bay Foundation stickers on it. For some reason, I felt like putting nothing but marbles (and the log) in the cache. If you can, leave a marble and takeone. A writing utensil couldn't fit into the cache, so BYOP. Happy Hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is the first cache hidden in the woods of the Underground Railroad Trail. This hike I discovered a little while ago, and you barely ever see anyone on the trail. When I first saw there were geocaches at the park, &quot;Green Hell&quot; and &quot;Sandy Spring Cache&quot;, I was so excited. But I saw that they were at the beginning and the end of the hike that I usually walk. So, I decided that we needed one in the middle. Find all three of the caches when you go looking for this one or the others. The cache is right by the stream crossing part of the hike. This cache is not a hard terrain, but be careful, there can be snakes in this area. The cache is well camoflauged, so please put it back EXACTLY how you found it. There is some pertty elaborate swag in the cache, so take whatever you want as a FTF prize. Enjoy the hide! Happy Hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I was out caching in this area and ended up not finding the other caches because all the paths to get to them were overgrown with poison ivy.  I walked away after a hour of walking around trying to find a clear path with nothing signed and just a bit of annoyance at the PI that thwarted me.  On my walk back I was grumbling to myself about how there were all these other places to hide a cache where there would be no poison ivy to deal with and then it dawned on me that I had a container in the car so after grabbing it I made a short trek back out and hid this cache where you won't have to walk through any poison ivy to find it.

It is near a walking path just outside of a housing development but can be a bit muddy and require dealing with some large rocks and plants in the way.(though none of them were poisonous when it was hidden)</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I stopped by today to do a maintenance run while I was in town and the cache is in great shape.  There is more swag in the container then when it was hid and there are two logs in the book.  Udderly was one and there was one before it with no name just commenting that they found it before Johnathan.

I had also stopped by to use my new GPSr to average the location a bit better as when i made the initial hide it was with an old Explorist 210 and i figured I could get it zeroed in a bit better but after I left it to average for 15 minutes I wrote down what it said and came home to find that they were the same as the published one so there should be no problem finding it.

Still no poisonous plants in the area and I hope it stays that way.  There is fresh turned dirt and dozer tracks so here is to hoping it doesn't get driven over and turned under.</groundspeak:text>

My wife and I really like the idea of bringing the whole family along so we thought our first cache should be family friendly.

Cache is located in the Black Hills regional park system.
There are plenty of parking spots and entry points to the trail. Trail is nice paved blacktop, easy walking. You could even bring your bikes along for this one. Trail follows along little Seneca lake so if you're at all into fishing bring your gear as the fishing is great! Area is also dog friendly.

If you're up for some real fun take the canoe out and go after this one!

will be picking a general cache hiding style and adding my own
twist to try and change it up a bit. When you arrive at ground zero
you should soon discover what classic hide this one is based
on.&lt;br/&gt;
This particular style is one of my&lt;br/&gt;
personal favorites. I have found many cool caches in great
locations hidden in the classic style. This cache is my attempt to
make this type of hide a bit more interesting.&lt;br/&gt;
Bring a pen to this one the container is small and only contains a
log book.&lt;br/&gt;
In addition to this one being the latest variant cache I'm also
placing it to commemorate the first birthday of Crash's
wondertwins! for the record they found their first cache with mom
and dad before their 1st bday :) This cache is an easy walk and kid
friendly but could be a challenging hide depending on your
experience etc.&lt;br/&gt;
As with all my recent caches it's important that you take the time
to re-hide this one&lt;br/&gt;
carefully and back the way you found it. This will preserve the
experience for the next&lt;br/&gt;
cacher.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">After a lengthy geo-retirement I'm back. The last cache I had hidden was in 2003. My recent purchase of a smartphone capable of geocaching rekindled my interest in the sport. Once I got out and found a cache or two I remembered what I loved about the game. Now that I have little ones I'm looking forward to getting them out and caching as a family. I wanted to get some family friendly caches out there for like minded folks.

Upon my return to the game I found the trend of the micros / nanos has continued. I'm a fan of more traditional caches so I wanted to do my part to start getting some more traditional caches out in some of my favorite parks close to home. This one is family friendly as noted although there are some sticker bushes in and around ground zero. It wouldn't be caching if there weren't at least some stickers and or poison ivy. 

The park itself has become my favorite launching point for local road cycling routes. You can do anywhere from 20 - 50+ rides leaving from this parking lot over some wonderful scenic and mellow back roads. The Frederick Peddlers do Wed night bike rides out of this park every week.

You are looking for a good size rubbermade container. I started the cache with a number of cool trinkets I had laying around as well as some of my newly created custom lanyards and bike chain keychains I plan to use as my new signature items. I am also launching my first TB since coming out of geo retirement from this cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Devil's Den is the nickname for a terrain feature south of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, that was the site of fierce fighting at the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War.

Devil's Den is a rocky expanse of shrubs and scrub trees, the southernmost part of Houck's Ridge, directly west of Little Round Top across the Plum Run Valley (also known to the soldiers as the &quot;Valley of Death&quot;). The central feature of Devil's Den is an outcropping of massive boulders. This igneous rock, similar in appearance to granite, is an outcrop of diabase sill, known to geologists as &quot;Gettysburg Sill&quot;, that is about a mile (1,600 m) wide, 1,800 feet (550 m) thick, and runs for almost 40 miles (64 km), directly through the Gettysburg Battlefield. It was formed over 180 million years ago under and within the beds of sandstone and shale that covered the area and over time was forced upward between existing strata. Where the sheet has been exposed to the seasonal freezing of water in the crevices and cracks, it has broken into smaller pieces that have been weathered over the years into separate boulders.

This landmark gained importance in the second day of the fighting near Gettysburg, July 2, 1863, with a Confederate assault by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's First Corps through this terrain. Conducted by the division of Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood, and including both the Texas Brigade and 3rd Arkansas, the charge was directed towards the left flank of the Union Army of the Potomac and hit Devil's Den as well as the high ground at Little Round Top. Devil's Den was defended by the Union III Corps division of Maj. Gen. David B. Birney, later reinforced by the V Corps.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Gouverneur Kemble Warren was a civil engineer and prominent general in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

At the start of the Gettysburg Campaign, as Confederate General Robert E. Lee began his invasion of Pennsylvania, Warren is best remembered for arranging the last-minute defense of Little Round Top, and is often referred to as the &quot;Hero of Little Round Top.&quot; 

On the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 2, 1863, Warrren climbed the smaller of two rocky hills south of Gettysburg, known as Little Round Top, Warren found only a small Signal Corps station there. He saw the glint of bayonets in the sun to the southwest and realized that a Confederate assault into the Union flank was imminent. He hurriedly sent staff officers to find help from any available units in the vicinity. 

Warren had initiated the defense of Little Round Top, recognizing the importance of the undefended position on the left flank of the Union Army. He directed on his own initiative, the brigade of Colonel Strong Vincent to occupy it just minutes before it was attacked. Warren suffered a minor neck wound during the Confederate assault.

One of Vincent's regiments, the 20th Maine, led by Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, has received most of the fame for the defense of Little Round Top, but there is little doubt that the efforts and bravery of Vincent were instrumental in the eventual Union victory.

Thirty years later, Chamberlain received a Medal of Honor for his conduct in the defense of Little Round Top. The citation read that it was awarded for &quot;daring heroism and great tenacity in holding his position on the Little Round Top against repeated assaults, and carrying the advance position on the Great Round Top.&quot;

The Statue: 
Warren standing in uniform, with field binoculars on a granite pedestal, made of stone quarried at Little Round Top.

Confirmation Code Phrase:
In front the statue is a plaque dedicated to Warren. What is the dedication date? 
Use all numbers, month/day/year (6 digits).

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This Monument commenorates Lincoln's Getttysburg Address, November, 19 1863.

The &quot;few appropriate remarks&quot; of Lincoln at Gettysburg came to be accepted with the passing of years not only as a fine expression of the purposes for which the war was fought, but as a masterpiece of literature. An effort to have the words of the martyr President commemorated on this battlefield culminated with the inclusion in the act approved February 12, 1895, which established Gettysburg National Military Park, of a provision for the erection of such a memorial. Pursuant to this authority, the Park Commission erected the Lincoln Address Memorial, in January 1912, near the west gate of the national cemetery.

Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address 

Four score and 7 years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. 
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. 

We are met on a great battlefield of that war. 

We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. 

The brave men, living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here....

It is rather for us to be dedicated to the great task remaining before us…amp;quot;that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion…amp;quot;that we highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth. 

CONFIRMATION CODE PHRASE:

It could be 100 degreesoutside but this water is fed from the mountain and is very cold all the time.It is also a great place to camp, nice trails in wooded ares.

 So grab some smooth stones, enjoy the lake and try it for yourself.  See if you can do my uncle proud!

All Geritol Follies caches are on level ground or easily walkable paths with the exception of the last few feet to the cache site. There is never a need to bushwhack. 


The container is a black polyurethane ammo box with a green geocache.com sticker on the outside. Please be respectful of the area. 
Waypoint #1:
N43 00.083
W077 38.899
Notice the items nearby. Using these items, count the number of screws on the plaque and the year of dedication.

These numbers will help you find the final cache.

______= # of screws

______ = year of dedication

To find Waypoint #2:
Add the number of screws to N43.00.131. This is your new latitude.

Subtract the year of dedication from W077.40.982. This is your new longitude.

Enter these coordinates and proceed to Waypoint #2.

Waypoint #2:
Locate the Stull Family.
Add the total of Jacob and Susannah’s ages to N43.00.069.

Subtract Abigail’s birth year from W077.40.777.
The result of your calculation is the resting spot of the final cache. You now have the final cache coordinates.

Final Cache: Remember to trade even and fair. Please hide as well or better than found! The final cache is located in a wooded area. The ground may be uneven. Be watchful of the terrain for any unexpected hazards. This is an easy walk if you are careful!

We encourage CITO – please bring a bag with you and help keep the area free of trash.

We hope you enjoyed your visit to another cache in the Geritol Follies series, Geritol Rush

This is located in a beautiful park just outside Rochester, NY. I spend a lot of time in this park just exploring and decided that I need to finally put a cache in somewhere. I hope you enjoy the fairly easy hunt for this one.
I name all my cats after Physicists and Schrodinger was my first pet. She was with us for 14 years and I will miss my her. What better way to honor my pets than put caches up with their names.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is my first. 

Im near the road, but dont park there.  You cant easily get to me but im not that hard to get.  Im close so my owner can see me but they cant reach me! I cant be found
using a wheelchair but my contents have helped those in them for years.  Please take from me but do only to trade.  Use one item to 'scale' your caching history. Please follow rules in the cache.  And leave me hints how to better my cache.  Thank you and good hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>

All Geritol Follies caches are on level ground or easily walkable paths with the exception of the last few feet to the cache site. There is never a need to bushwhack.




Geritol Sam brings you to a place that you may have driven by and not even noticed. Many people have ‘passed’ this way that were instrumental in settling our area. Names of note: William and Mehitable Hincher, first white settlers west of the Genesee River and Sam Patch, Lake Captain and famous daredevil (there is also a packet boat bearing his name). This is also the final resting place for many Revolutionary, War of 1812 and Civil War Veterans. The first lighthouse keeper also resides here. Take time to look around. Maps are available. If you are from the area, you will notice other names that are familiar to you. 
The final cache container is small, (not quite a micro but almost) with no room for trade items unless similar in size to hat pins, small TB’s/geo coins, geo-george dollars, etc. The log is small too, with only room for the date and a small stamp or signature. BYOP (Bring your own pencil/pen.) There are FTF items should you choose to take them. Please be sure to secure the container lid tightly and replace as good or better than found and report any maintenance issues.

Bring the kids, let them learn a little about Sam Patch and the area, give them the GPS and let them do the math!

Locate the final resting place of Sam Patch’s remains, which were found the spring after he leaped to his death over Upper Falls and into the Genesee River. Friday the 13th was indeed his unlucky day!

N43 16.435
_________ Subtract the year of his birth
_________ This is your new setting.

W077 35.947
__________ Add the date of his final leap
___________ This is your new setting.

The above coordinates will take you to the final cache.

We hope you have enjoyed this walk through time. Please be respectful of the area. Muggles are out and about so be discreet and stealthy. We encourage CITO, so please do your share.

Cache is placed in the Point Petre area.

This cache replaces an archived multi cache that ended in this area.

Cache is a 6X6 square Lock N Lock with room for GC's and small TB's.

This area has significant history for the mothballed Avro Arrow. During developement this area was used to test Avro Arrow models.
They shot rocket powered models of the Arrow over Lake Ontario.

No models have ever been recovered even though the area has been searched many times and even was the subject of an episode of Sea Hunters.

Take some time and enjoy the whole area.

Easy walk on an abandoned railway line. 2km round trip from recommended parking spot.

We were given permission from the CO (Freshair4me) to adopt the original cache (GC106GC), but it was archived before the process could start.

The following description is taken directly from the previous listing.
_______________________

The cache is extremely well hidden out of view. Be sure to replace its protective cover/camouflage (if removed). Please be VERY careful to leave it exactly as you found it! We wouldn't want the cache to go missing in action.
Thank you.
The fun of this cache is in the hunt and with that, PLEASE RESPECT THE CACHERS CODE BY NOT ADDING ANY SPOILER INFO OR PHOTOS TO YOUR LOGS. Any spoilers will be deleted by cache owner. 
The hike begins near Lake Consecon on County Road #1 and traverses along the abandoned railroad.

The posted coordinates above (N43° 59.263 W077° 29.350) will lead you to a redirect written in black marker (now changed to a plasic label).
This will give you the coordinates to the second waypoint where you will find the cache. The cache is hidden completely out of sight. Please be very careful to leave it exactly as you found it.
If You must know the cache names meaning, then you will have to scientifically research the terminology.

NOTES:
1. Geocache is a small peanut butter type container, so don't bring anything too big to put into it.
2. Family friendly and an excellent place to let your pet off the leash for a run.
3. This trail is often shared by hikers, mountain bikers, snowmobilers, and ATVers. Please keep an eye out for others and step aside if necessary.

Happy Caching 2010 style!!!

Another restin' series cache in a small quaint cemetery.

Cache is a camo taped keyholder. BYOP.

While there check out the old United Empire Loyalist cemetery across the road.  I wanted to plant the cache there but there were no good hiding spots.

There is a huge history of caches never lasting very long in this cemetery.  SKYE53 has graciously replaced the missing cache for me so a BIG Thank You to SKYE53 !!! 

 Please utilize extreem stealth on this one and don't be too obvious when getting this cache. Keep your GPSr out of site until you get close to the cache. Which is located in the south west corner of the cemetery.

As with any Restin' series cache please respect your surroundings.</groundspeak:long_description>

It was quite the climb to plant this one and even difficult climbing down.

Cache is a camo'd film cannister. BYOP

You can continue up the hill to take a look but please do not go any farther as it is private property.

We do not consider this cache winter friendly.

Cache # 3 located in Trenmar Lake Park.

Entrance to park is located off Wooler Road just south of Telephone Road.

The park area is gated and is sometimes locked at night so its a good idea to park on the road if you will be there late.

This park was obviously once well maintained but it has obviously been let go. You will see lots of evidence of this during your visit. But despite that it is a nice wooded area very close to Trenton.

The container is a fragmentation cache retrieved from Aaron Haynes' &quot; Pay it Forward&quot; cache located near Napanee.

Please watch for POISON IVY ... I got into it somewhere in the park while planting this series.

This park was obviously once well maintained but it has obviously been let go. You will see lots of evidence of this during your visit. But despite that it is a nice wooded area very close to Trenton.

The camo is fragile so please rehide the cache exactly as found. 

Remove the lid only and extract the logbook. Please replace as found.

Probably will be a good idea to bring something (tweezers, etc) to extract the logbook from the container.

Cache is micro size. Logbook only so BYOP.

Located in Mount Pelion Park. There have been previous caches here, and we thought a place with such an awsome view deserved a new one.
Hopefully this one lasts awhile.

Although this cache can be accessed in the winter you will not be able to park near the cache, also the climb will be &quot;interesting&quot;. 

Also there is quite a steep hill on either side of the path that leads to the cache. Please watch your children, and or pets.

We noticed this little gem on a caching tour and knew it just had to have a cache to bring people to this cute little church.

The cache is not in the church but feel free to enter the church and stay a while.

The owner welcomes visitors but as mentioned earlier please be respectful of this wonderful little place.

On a sign outside the church:

This hide is more difficult than we normal hide our caches but we thought the area cachers could use a bit of a challenge.
Terrain is fairly level right upto the cache.

Cache is a bison tube.

Cache is # 12 of a series of caches planted in Quinte area parks, and recreational area.

Zwick's Park is home to many festivals and activities in Belleville every year including the Belleville Waterfront and Ethnic Festival, Canada Day Celebrations, Ribfest etc.. 

Some would be surprised to know that this whole area was once a garbage dump.

With about 33% of seekers posting a DNF on this one we are going to bump up the difficulty from 2 to a 2.5 . 

This was never intended to be a difficult cache but was a result of trying to find an acceptable location.

We will add a hint as well.</groundspeak:long_description>

Our 1st multi, so we hope you like it.

First and foremost I ask you to NOT NOT NOT take the most direct route to the final !!!!! PLEASE don't do it !!! 

Cache is named after a 1980's arcade game of the same name.

Once you find the redirect and final you will know why it was named this.

Both the redirect and the final are camo'd film containers. The redirect only has the coordinates to the final. Please Do NOT put travellers in the redirect.

The final has a logbook only so BYOP.

We wanted to plant a bigger final cache but there was really only 1 hiding spot we liked and a bigger cache may be discovered.

Enough room for small trades and trackables. This cache is close enough to the 401 that it also could be used for a trackable drop off location.

Cache is # 5 in a series of caches to be planted in Quinte area parks and recreational areas.

Cache is a camo'd film container. Logbook only. BYOP.

East Riverside Park was once a popular and busy swimming area. Now its a lesser used park that is home to a large flock of Canada Geese through out the summer months.

If you still have to get Cache Blitz # 2 - Ships Ahoy .. I dare you to take the shortest route to it LOL!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Please replace all stages, containers, and natural camo you find exactly as found.  This will allow the next cacher to have the same fun as you did.
Thanks!

 Please be on the lookout for Poison Ivy, and thistle plants !!!

Cache is located near but not on the George &amp; Lois Wishart Dam.
This dam is one of many along the lower end of the Moira River,
The dams are part of an ice/flood control system operated by the Quinte Conservation Authourity.

There is a dedication plaque near N 44 11.730
W 077 23.474.  You can't get right to it but you can see it through the fence. (if you have good eyesight). I was originally going to make it part of the multi however since you can't get right upto it I didn't want to take a chance that it would get covered in snow or ice. Please take the time to read the plaque if you are able. 

You will notice there is a fence around the dam area. 
You do not need to enter the fenced in area to complete this multi.
You also do not need to go near the edge of the river to complete this multi.

Please find the safest route between stages!

Stage 1 is a simple redirect.

Stage 2 you will be required to read a sign and do some steps to get the coordinates to the final.

N 44 11.ABC
W 77 23.CBD

A= How many letter &quot; i &quot;s are on the sign minus 1.
B= The largest single digit on the sign
C= How many letter &quot;G&quot;'s are on the sign.
D= The most common digit on the sign.

Checksum for A+B+C+D = 23


The final is a small Lock N Lock with room for small trackables and trade items.

This Geocache has been placed with the permission of Parks Canada

This cache is a hybrid geocache/letterbox.
 
 For those who are unfamiliar with letterboxing we will try to describe it.  Letterboxing is very similar to geocaching with the exception that those who seek letterboxes seldom use GPS units but rely mainly on hints that are posted on a website (www.atlasquest.com or www.letterboxing.net) We mainly use Atlasquest.   Another difference is letterboxers do not trade swag but exchange stamp impressions which most custom carve. Letterboxers stamp their trail stamp image into the logbook and write any notes they want to add the same as a geocacher would do. They then make an impression of the Letterbox stamp in their own logbook.

 Please feel free to join the letterbox fun, there are not nearly as many letterboxes in Ontario as Geocaches but it is a nice supliment to geocaching. Please be stealthy when going for and replacing this cache. 

 This cache is a 4x6 Lock N Lock covered in Black Duct tape. It contains 2 baggies. One for the Geocache with a logbook, pencil, and a sheet with information on the history of the Trent Severn, and the other is the Letterbox with a logbook,a trailstamp. (PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THE CUSTOM STAMP !!) . Feel free to take a look and login and join the fun at the above mentioned website.

 There is no SWAG in the container, Parks Canada requests no exchange of SWAG in any caches located within park boundaries.  The stamp you will find in the Letterbox side is so boxers can stamp this image into their collector book. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THE CUSTOM STAMP. 

When putting the container back please make sure the lid is facing toward the main structure. This will allow the container to be tucked in and therefore be out of site. This is a high muggle area and the life of this Hybrid depends on it.

HISTORY

Construction began on the Trent Severn Waterway in 1833. The first lock sites were Bobcaygeon and Purdy's Mills, now Lindsay. Construction began in this area around the same time.

In July of 1920, the first vessel to complete a through-passage was the motor launch Irene. The journey from Trenton to Port Severn took nine days.

 The 386 km long waterway stretches from Trenton Ontario, on the Bay of Quinte to Port Severn on Georgian Bay.

 In the early days the locks were all operated by hand, now the lockmasters get assisted by modern technology.

The large steel structure were you found this cache/box is now abandoned, but was once used to install a dam so maintanance could be performed on the canal between here and Lock 6.

Please go to the following websites for a more detailed description of the system.

This is one of 3 caches now located on Bata Island.

Bata Island
The Other End of Bata Island.
The Gnome of Bata Island.

Please read the descriptions from those caches for a detailed description of the island.


CACHE IS NOT AT POSTED COORDINATES


PLEASE NOTE : The park is closed from 11pm to 5am.
The posted coordinates are for the first glow tack on the island. 
Please note: The ORANGE glow dots that are on the bridge railing are NOT part of the trail, but are simply there to give you an idea what you will be looking for once on the island.


Night find details
-------------------

Once parked cross the bridge (there are orange glow dots on the bridge).


Once over the bridge use the following legend to find the cache.

BLUE GLOW TACK - Always turn right at the next trail intersection.

WHITE GLOW TACK - Keep on trail and keep looking ahead for the next tack.

ORANGE GLOW TACK - Always turn left at the next trail intersection.

Please note that sometimes there was no place to put a tack right at a trail intersection so sometimes the tack is close to the intended intersection. Always remember that the tacks will have you turn onto a trail and not into the woods etc..

When you find both a white and a blue tack together you will be close.  Then carefully shine your light around to find 2 orange tacks nearby. The cache will be there.


Please note : at some point you may come to a tree with 2 blue glow dots. This is where the stand alone letterbox is planted (in stump). You can visit the letterbox (but can't log it here) if you wish or simply continue past this tree to find your way to the cache.

Cache is located on a little known island near the town of Frankford, Ontario.

Terrain is pretty much level depending on the route you take. The trails can me muddy especially in the spring.

The cache should be an easy find. It is not designed to be difficult but just to take you to a nice spot on the island.

Cache is a small black Lock N Lock. Logbook only with no pen/pencil.

I took the following description from another cache (Bata Island - GC2MWXC).

Cache is located on Bata Island.The paths are open and very friendly to the young or old. Bring your dog, have a picnic lunch (no tables) or throw in a fishing line. Trails can be damp in the spring but nothing that a good pair of boots won't cure. This is an all season cache and promises to have different wildlife views each time you come. The entrance is not marked and can seem a little tricky. Just off Glen Ross road on a dirt road just beyond large piles of rock if you're going north from Frankford. Bata or Sill Island Total: 1.7 kilometres At the point Glen Ross Road crosses just north of Huffman Road, a dirt road leads by a pile of rocks to a bridge which leads over to Sill Island (also known as Bata Island). A walk around the island is a must. This is one of Frankford's little secrets: a beautiful little island with a few easy trails and some great views of the river. It's a perfect spot for a picnic. Before you cross the yellow bridge to the island, take a look at the old millstones lying near the bridge. One nestles in the water just north of the bridge and a couple of others are lying on the bank not far away. I hope someone saves at least one of these and puts it in a prominent place (on the island, say) before they are ploughed into the earth. These stones were used in pairs to grind grain. Grindstone, near Bata/Sill Island, north of Frankford The concrete stones have an outer band of black flintstone-like material, like concrete wheels with flintsone tires. Metal bolts keep the stones from falling apart. A grist mill was built in Frankford in the 1880s and operated until 1972. One website lists a W.A.R. Milne as the Miller at Sills' grist mill until his early death in 1920. The trails are marred by a few yahoos who have thrown garbage here and there, but it's not overwhelming. On the spring day I walked these trails, I got my first view of wild flowers for the season. In areas, beautiful covers of blue spread through the woods. The trails are easy, and wander to each end of the island. There are a few places where you can stop by the water to picnic. At the north end, there are abutments to an old bridge, where ducks, geese and other birds gather. I saw a white bird with an incredibly long orange beak sitting on one of the abutments. (Damn. I need to study bird species.) The northern loop, at just over 1 kilometre, is the longest round-trip stroll. It has a little 200-metre spur running parallel to the north-east side of the trail. I found this a bit wet on the spring day I walked it. As the northern spur loops back to the bridge, an open area appears; this would make another nice picnic spot. The south trail, about 340 metres, leads to the section of the river that splits Bata/Sill Island from the little island to the south. You can get a good view of the dams to the south from here and the Sills Island Generating Station, (sic: that's how it's listed by Ontario Power generation), which is the second oldest generating station in the province. It was originally used as a paper mill. The G.E. Sills Paper Mill or the above-mentioned grist mill were presumably the origin of the island's name. A little 100-metre spur about 115 metres from the bridge cuts across the island from the south trail to the eastern side. It's not well travelled and I debated as to whether it was an &quot;official&quot; trail. It's best to stick to the trails on the island as you could disturb a lot of flora and fauna tromping through the bush, especially as there are lots of stopping places to picnic. The island is so small that you'll have no trouble spotting wildlife. Check &quot;the musings of a sad girl&quot; for some detail on this area. This blog has more detail on the flora and fauna on the island than I could ever hope to supply. The bridge to the island is not marked at the road, so keep an eye out.

Cache is placed in the Thurlow Wildlife Management Area, which is operated by the Moira River Conservation Authourity.

Parking is at N44 16.885  W 077 23.343 which is just off Mudcat Lane in Thurlow.

Please do not do this cache at night.

Cache is a camo'd micro with only a logbook BYOP, but cache is extremely well hidden and I am not sure anyone will ever find it. 

The cache container was picked up in Aaron Haynes' fragmentation cache &quot;Pay It Forward (GC25661)'' which is located northeast of Napanee.

Planted this cache after noticing this WMA and thought it needed a cache to bring people to this little known WMA..

I explored the area a little bit but at time of planting the cache the main trailwas flooded about 200 meters from the parking area.

During my visit I noticed a few different species of wildlife including Squirrels, Chipmunks, a few differnt waterfowl in the flooded area.

It looks like the area goes alot further than I could walk and there maybe other access points to it but use the parking coordinates to get closest to the cache.

The area is quite large and goes all the way to the Moira River.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">SCUTTLEHOLES - MOIRA RIVER This area is considered to be an outstanding example of a karst development which is only uncommonly found throughout Ontario. The Moira Karst site extends from Latta in the south to Chisholm's Mill in the north. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has deemed the area to be ANSI (Area of Natural &amp; Scientific Interest) &amp; is geologically &amp; ecologically sensitive. As such, please stay on the clearly marked trail &amp; respect the area immediately surrounding the cache site. Unique geological features have been created in the limestone bedrock by the dissolving action of water erosion. Features range from sinkholes, collapsed caverns, underground channels, limestone islands to blind channels in the river's course. Sections of the river actually disappear underground only to resurface further downstream. While many of the geological formations are on private property (such as the Moira Cave with its 1000 meters of passageways) &amp; not available to the public, a good example of a scuttlehole can be seen at: N44 19.107 W077 19.761. It is approximately 3 m high, 10 m long &amp; 5 m wide &amp; can be entered cautiously during snow-free months. Please use caution &amp; discretion as it requires a short but steep 3 m climb down a limestone formation. It is unnecessary to enter the cave as the cache is located about 40 m away. What's really strange about the area is that during July , August &amp; into September you can walk on sections of the dry limestone riverbed. However, during the spring runoff the Moira River Canoe Club perform their annual whitewater races in the same location!! From the cave location you can see the guy wires that hold the racing gates stretched across the river. The cache is available year round but exploration of the entire area is best during the months listed above. Pictures (taken over the past 2 years) of the cave, dry riverbed &amp; whitewater kayaking all taken within 100 m of the cave location are included with this listing. 
Enjoy but please use caution with kids near the river during the spring runoff &amp; at other times due to several visible collapsed sinkholes and open caves.

It is the provincial tree of Ontario and we have them in abundance on our property. It can be readily distinguished by its needle bundles of 5 as opposed to the Red or Norway Pine which has 2 needles per cluster. 
This is an easy cache near our property...but don't let that scare you off...we can't see you from the house. Of course, if you see me out shovelling the driveway in the winter I do have a second &amp; third shovel!! Seriously, if you see us out &amp; about don't hesitate to stop &amp; talk...we're cachers too.

Cache is a camo'd Nutello jar (sorry, I have a sweet tooth so its all gone) suitable for small trade items.

Conservation area is closed between sunset and sunrise. Please do not cache when park is closed.

Cache is located in the Vanderwater Conservation.

The cache is located at the starting point for many caches located in this park, so I thought it would be a good warm up before a long trek.

I planted this cache right after acheiving # 500  at the nearby cache &quot; A Natural High&quot;.

Cache is a small circular Lock N Lock.  (provided by Aaron Haynes with thanks).

Is it possible for the next finder to check the coordinates and email/post them ? Thanks

If you are a Letterboxer then rumour has it there is a LB very close by.

This was a favorite place to hang out when my mom was growing up in Flinton in the 60s and 70s.  Please respect the area and use stealth while searching for the cache.

The cache is very close to the water so be careful and keep an eye on your children.  Please cover the cache when you finish with it to prevent muggles from finding it.

This is an easy micro find.  An easy ATV trail is nearby (Access from Hastler Rd.) that is great for biking and walking. It contains a log book and pencil (bring your own just in case.)  It could hold micro geocoins (no regular ones). Please replace the cache as you found it.
Additional Hidden Waypoints
TH1EZ0A - Trailhead for the walker
N 44° 41.565 W 077° 12.033
This is the trailhead that should be used if you want to [b]walk[/b] to the cache location.  It is less than a 500m walk on hard-packed ATV trails.  If you would prefer to drive to within 100m of the cache, select the other trailhead
TR1EZ0A - Trailhead for the driver
N 44° 41.716 W 077° 12.170
This is the trailhead that should be used if you want to [b]drive[/b] nearly to the cache location. It is less than a 100m walk on hard-packed ATV trails. If you would prefer to walk about 500m to the cache instead, use the other waypoint.</groundspeak:long_description>

through Cloyne and surrounding areas, uprooting and breaking off
trees and damaging power lines.  45mm hail was recorded during
the storm.  The storm was a &lt;b&gt;microburst&lt;/b&gt;, a fast moving
downward column of wind, similar to a tornado.  The microburst
caused one injury and one fatality as well as extensive damage to
property and trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you drive in to this cache, look into the
forest and see the remains from this microburst.  There are
many trees that are uprooted and fallen.  The cache is hidden

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is a fairly easy micro on what locals call Myer's Rapids.
Across the road (506) are some cool caves and a great picnic spot
(that you have to wade through the river to get to). Many people
fish in this river also.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please note that this cache is right along a busy highway. Please be careful and walk on the ditch side of the guardrail. You can park just south of the cache where the guardrail ends. DO NOT park right at the cache as the shoulder is too narrow.

I recently learned of this spot by some locals and thought it was an interesting spot.

Approx 20 years ago a beaver dam located in Bon Echo Park broke and sent a torrent of water toward hwy 41. The water washed out the soil including Hwy 41 itself down to bare rock right into Mazinaw lake.
When standing at the guardrail facing West (away from the lake) you can see the large amount of material that was eroded away.

Today there is a large culvert and reenforcement rocks to prevent this from happening again.

I was told when Mazinaw Lake's water is lower and when the light is right you can see the large &quot;sandbar&quot; of eroded material that flows out a distance into Mazinaw Lake.

Congratulations to Guardian14 for the FTF !!!

Cache is a camo'd micro. Logbook only. Bring your own pen.

Cache location is just off Hwy 41 just north of a closed down restaurant called the Moosehorn.

I have noticed this rockface everytime I drive to work in Denbigh, so I finally made the climb up. The view is great you can see both Macivoy and Irving Lakes. Definately worth the climb in my opinion.

Cache will be changed to a larger container soon, but for now the micro will get you up there.

You can park on the road by the snowmobile trail that leads you to the base of the hill. It is a short hike (approx 200 metres) into the base of the hill. But be careful as the shoulder is very narrow. There may be room for 1 vehicle just up the trail, but you will have to be sure to have your car all the way off the trail. Alternately you can park approx 1/2 km north up the road in a larger road way which intersects the same snowmobile trail. 

I will add the waypoints for the trailhead and alternate parking within the next week

Be careful during hunting season (mid Oct to mid Dec)</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache is at a popular Bancroft area business. We stopped here to grab a Letterbox (see www.Atlasquest.com for more info on this very similar hobby as geocaching), and did a search from our phone for nearby caches. Hmmm there was none. Well we said &quot;we will just have to fix that&quot;.  Had our stuff with us and put one together on the spot.

 The day the cache was planted this place was VERY busy, but we are sure it had something to do with the fact it was a long weekend.  So please use steath when retrieving this cache.

 Also please recover cache in a similar manner as we did, hopefully this will ensure this cache stays around for a while.

 At time this cache was placed contents were some small swag and a TB.</groundspeak:long_description>

Another Restin' series cache located in a local cemetery.

This cemetery has only a few markers which leads to me believe that it is newer cemetery

Cache is a camo'd micro with only a logbook. Bring your own writing utensil.

If you happen to be a letterboxer then rumour has it there is a nearby letterbox to find here as well.</groundspeak:long_description>

This will be an easy find as you can park within 10 metres of the cache. You will have to walk up a small embankment during the lastfew metres of your hunt.

This cache is a replacement for the Cool Cow Cache that had gone missing a few months ago. 

Cache is a 4 litre plastic container, that is large enough for most TB's, geocoins, etc.  Cache contains a small prize for the 1st Five finders. Cache is tethered to the tree it is located so it will not be carried away by animals.

This cache has a cow related theme, so if possible please make trades cow related if possible. But if you don't have cow related items still feel free to trade anyway.

This cache has been placed with the permission of the owners of the 41 Stop. They encourage geocaching, so don't worry about being stealthy as they know exactly where the cache is located.

If you think cache has gone missing please report it to the staff at 41 Stop (they will let me know about it), or messege me.</groundspeak:long_description>

La Bleuetiere de Val-Senneville (1966) La grande region de
val-d'or, ou les incendies de foret ont fortement fertilisé le sol,
se revele, quand la temperature est clemente, une grosse
productrice de bleuets. dans les annees 1960, l'epicier Germain
Houde, gerant de la succursale regionale de la Blueberry
Corporation of America, expedie annuellement plus de 1.5 million de
livres de bleuts a une confiserie de Scranton, en Pennesylvanie, ou
ils sont transformes en confiture a tarte, Ce qui signifie,
annuellement, plus d'une trentaine de remorques remplies a ras bord
de beaux bleuets. Dans cette ligne, la bleuetiere de Val-Senneville
voit le jour en 1966. C'est un reve longuement caresse par l'abbe
George Beland et Real Coulombe (Mon Grand Pere), qui sera le
premier president du Syndicat de production. Apres deboisement la
Caisse populaire de Val-Senneville accorde un pret pour
l'amenagement de 100 acres qui, la premiere annee, donne 28 000
livres de bleuets. Cela procure d'importants revenus d'appoint a de
nombreuse familles. Merci a la Societe d'histoire et de Genealogie
de Val-d'Or. Source:

 Photo: Jeune fille dans la bleuetiere de Val-Senneville, en aout
1967. Plusieurs familles du secteur tirent de la ceuillette des
bleuets, chaque fin d'ete, un revenu d'appoint non negligeable.

est d’une grandeur de 100 pieds et traverse la rivière
Senneville. Construit en 1955, c'est le plus récent des
ponts couverts du Québec toujours debout.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Brulé le 18 aout par des personnes sans aucune consiences ni
respect du patrimoine et des biens public :(&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Malheureusement, j'ai du la deplace de l'endroit original avant
mmme de l'activer, detruite par des geomoldus je croyais elle etait
assez loin de la route pour ne pas devoir la cacher
enormement...&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
ce coup ci elle est un peu plus loin...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
J'ai du modifier les atrubuts elle doit maintenant etre fait a la
nage ... le pont a ete brulé (probablement de main criminelle) donc
ce fait en hiver ou vous devez nager ;(&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Cette photo est probablement la derniere qui aura ete prise de ce
pont :( grosse perte!!!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Les adultes ont un besoin quotidien de 1,5 à 2 litres d’eau

L’eau est l’aliment le plus essentiel ; les adultes ont un besoin quotidien de 1,5 à 2 litres d’eau. Soit huit verres d’eau ! La plus grande partie de cette eau est bue, et le reste provient de votre alimentation.
Des fonctions corporelles normales, telles que la transpiration et l’urine, font perdre au corps jusqu’au 1,07 litres d’humidité par jour. Lorsque vous pratiquez du sport, ce chiffre est encore plus élevé. Boire de l’eau n’est pas un luxe superflu : il est essentiel que vous gardiez votre teneur en eau. 
La déshydratation se définit en fonction du poids corporel. Une perte en eau représentant aussi peu que de 1 % à 2 % du poids corporel est déjà considérée comme de la déshydratation. Une perte qui atteint de 15 % à 20 % du poids corporel peut provoquer la mort.

La déshydratation peut être aiguë, comme à la suite d’un exercice intense, ou plutôt chronique, en conséquence d’une consommation insuffisante et prolongée d’eau ou d’autres boissons.

Le meilleur moyen de détecter une déshydratation est d’observer la couleur de l’urine. Chez les personnes en bonne santé, elle devrait être jaune très pâle.

Les premiers signes de déshydratation :

une urine foncée;
la bouche et la gorge sèches;
un manque d'énergie;
la peau sèche;
des maux de tête et des étourdissements;
une intolérance à la chaleur.

Et plus speciellement pour les personne qui font de l'exercices physique comme la randonne et le geocaching.
Vous devez toujours apporter avec vous de l'eau et si possible en avoir de secours si la randonne devait se prolonger

Bon Geocaching et apportez de l'eau! ;)
