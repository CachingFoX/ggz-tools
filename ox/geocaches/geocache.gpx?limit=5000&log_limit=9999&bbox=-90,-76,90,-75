Resguardo La pastora.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Se llega tomando una chiva o transporte particular desde Pereira, dirigiéndose hacia la florida en carretera pavimentada. Posteriormente se continúa hacia el cedral, aproximadamente 1 hora en carretera sin pavimentar. Una vez en el cedral se toma camino de herradura a pie alrededor de 2 horas hasta llegar a la pastora, donde se dispone de alojamiento, alimentación y zona de camping. El caché es un contenedor plástico de color verde biche.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Encuentre el árbol más grande de la pastora (aprox. 1.5 metros de diámetro). Camine 65 pasos en dirección a la cabaña de la zona de camping y después 20 pasos en dirección sur. Encontrará un árbol en forma de &quot;Y&quot;, busque en sus raíces el tesoro.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Es primera vez que exploro este caching. No sé si deba publicar las coordenadas.

Quedo atento a instrucciones ...

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">En la vìa que conduce de Bogotá a Manizales se encuentra el cache, especificamente en el carril derecho viniendo de Manizales despuès de pasar el alto de letras y antes de llegar a Cerro bravo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the road from Bogota to Manizales is the cache, specifically in the right lane coming from Manila after spending the height of letters and before arriving at Cerro Grande.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;El volcán Cerro Bravo está construido sobre rocas intrusivas terciarias de composición granodiorítica, pertenecientes al Stock de Manizales, y rocas metamorficas paleozoicas del Grupo Cajamarca, en intersección de fallas del Sistema Palestina con otras de dirección transversal. Sus primeros estadios de formación finalizaron con la formación de calderas y los últimos corresponden a explosiones piroclásticas y formación de domos. Los productos del volcán son lavas que recorrieron distancias máximas de 5 km y alcanzaron espesores hasta de 100 m, domos, depósitos de flujos, oleadas y caídas piroclásticas y lahares o flujos de lodo. La composición petrológica varía entre andesitas y dacitas, compuestas de plagioclasa, ortopiroxeno, hornblenda, titanomagnetita, con relictos de cuarzo y biotita. Esto explica la emisión de lavas muy viscosas que pueden moverse lentamente por distancias cortas o la formación de domos que no fluyen y taponan el conducto volcánico y son total o parcialmente destruidos por colapso gravitacional o por voladura para destapar el cráter; también, facilita la ocurrencia de erupciones piroclásticas muy violentas con producción de grandes columnas de erupción, debido al alto contenido de gases en el magma. Los lahares se forman aprovechando la abundancia de agua, los valles estrechos y las pendientes altas.&lt;br/&gt;Fuente: Ingeominas.&lt;br/&gt;El cache es un animal que nunca encontraras en esta zona.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The volcano Cerro Bravo is built on Tertiary intrusive rocks of granodioritic, Stock belonging to Manizales, and Paleozoic metamorphic rocks of the Cajamarca Group, fault intersecting with other Palestine System transverse direction. His early training stages ended with the formation of boilers and correspond to recent explosions and pyroclastic formation of domes. The products of the volcano are lava that traveled distances up to 5 km and reached thicknesses of up to 100 m, domes, tanks flows, pyroclastic surges and falls and lahars or mudflows. The petrological composition varies between andesites and dacites, composed of plagioclase, orthopyroxene, hornblende, titanomagnetite, with relict quartz and biotite. This explains the emission of highly viscous lavas that can move slowly for short distances or to form domes that do not flow and clog the volcanic conduit and are wholly or partially destroyed by bombing or by gravitational collapse to uncover the crater also facilitates the occurrence very violent eruptions with pyroclastic producing large eruption columns, due to the high gas content in the magma. Lahars form taking advantage of the abundance of water, narrow valleys and steep slopes.&lt;br/&gt;Source: Ingeominas.&lt;br/&gt;The cache is an animal that never find in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 05° 04.266 W 075° 17.027 </groundspeak:long_description>

En el sitio donde llegamos al pie de la quebrada, miramos la roca del norte de la cueva y veremos una pista. Para acceder al cache hay que bajar por entre las rocas, por el decenso que lleva a la base de la roca de la pista. No hay que a travesar el estrecho tunel que permite descender, sino que debemos buscar en esta zona. El sitio es oscuro y por ende recomendamos llevar linterna pues entre tanta piedra no será facil de encontrar. Desde donde uno se puede parar el cache esta hacia el sur oriente.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;R11HEYC - Referencia 1&lt;br/&gt;N 06° 08.086 W 075° 33.870&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R21HEYC - Referencia 2&lt;br/&gt;N 06° 07.796 W 075° 33.986&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R31HEYC - Entrada a Cuevas&lt;br/&gt;N 06° 07.289 W 075° 33.932&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ST1HEYC - Parque Eco.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Opencaching.com would like you to know that the container is not located at the listed coordinates; You will be standing at the first head stone in a series of four.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache was placed on Memorial Day, Monday, May 25, 2009.&lt;br /&gt;
On this day we honor those who gave the ultimate sacrifice: their lives for the citizens of the Great Nation of the United States of America;&lt;br /&gt;
Remember them as you explore this cemetery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Cache is located in Cudworth Cemetery in Wanchese, NC.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finding the various plots should be easy; there are waypoints attached to this page for your use.&lt;br /&gt;
Finding the final location will require some note taking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is in a Cemetery, so remember to respect the area; stand up any fallen flags, and no caching at night.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As you explore you will find many Daniels, Tillett, Etheridge, and Williams plots; they are common names from this area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also there is section in this cemetery that Memorializes some homeless men that were employed by the Department of the Interior.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The container you seek is a well-stocked Ammo Box. It is placed with a large, green GeoCaching Sticker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The container is not located near any grave.&lt;br /&gt;
The container IS located on Private Property.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a lot of different swag items for you to trade, if you wish.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to retrieve numbers from the head stones from four particular Military Men.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Steps of the cache will point them out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Use this space to fill in the required numbers.&lt;br /&gt;
N 35 50._ _ _&lt;br /&gt;
N 35 50.A B C&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
W 075 38._ _ _&lt;br /&gt;
W 075 38.D A E&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
N 35° 50.846 W 075° 38.677&lt;br /&gt;
At Step One you will be at the grave of Robert G. Scarborough:&lt;br /&gt;
The last digit of the year of his birth is letter 'C'.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
N 35° 50.848 W 075° 38.670&lt;br /&gt;
At Step Two you will be at the grave of Truman B. Sanderlin:&lt;br /&gt;
The third digit of the year of this birth is letter 'B', The last digit of the year of his death is letter 'E'.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
N 35° 50.843 W 075° 38.667&lt;br /&gt;
At Step Three you will be at the grave Roy Linwood Davis Jr.:&lt;br /&gt;
The last digit of the day of his birth is letter 'A'.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
N 35° 50.832 W 075° 38.616&lt;br /&gt;
At Step Four you will be at the grave of Dewey Elwood Mann:&lt;br /&gt;
The month of his birth is letter &quot;D&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
(Example: January = 1)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You must sign the log to claim a find for this cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No caching at night; your log will be deleted, if there is evidence that you attempted this cache after sundown. Some GPSr's have Sun/Moon Applications; if you are caching after sundown, even though it may not be 'dark', in my opinion, you are caching at night.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Cache accessible all hours year round but night caching could bring official visitors with blue lights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located near a Manteo, NC, landmark that has been a favorite destination for visitors and locals since 1967.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Container is large enough for small Christmas related ornaments &amp; collectibles and could be a Travel Bug hotel. A very high Muggle Factor during summer months will make stealth necessary to retrieve/replace cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Staff does not know about the cache but if you get a chance please say hello to the owner Mr. Greene and thank him for giving permission to place this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Town of Manteo wraps around Shallowbag Bay on the eastern side of Roanoke Island, part of North Carolina's Outer Banks. Named the seat of government for Dare County in 1870, this waterfront community incorporated in 1899. Nearby attractions include a representative 16th century ship at Roanoke Island Festival Park, Roanoke Marshes Lighthouse, The Elizabethan Gardens, and Waterside Theatre, home to the nation's oldest outdoor symphonic drama, The Lost Colony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Permission from land owner was granted for placement of this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Multi-Cache at a busy intersection frequented by some of the most
handy fix-it persons on the Outer Banks. Parking available although
at times finding a parking place might be a problem. However, with
a little patience a spot always opens up. High year-round Muggle
factor &lt;b&gt;WILL&lt;/b&gt; make &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;stealth necessary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt; to
retrieve/replace cache.

Coordinates listed are for the first of two stages. Both containers
appropriate for location with most cache materials from the
establishment where cache is hidden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Coords should put you on the northeast side of a fence in or near a
parking lot with &lt;b&gt;NO NEED&lt;/b&gt; to go onto the bordering s/w
private residence property and you &lt;b&gt;DO NOT&lt;/b&gt; need to touch the
green telephone box while searching for this cache. First location
large enough only for the vehicle holding the coordinates to the
second but you may have to search a bit to find them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CAUTION:&lt;/b&gt; This area could flood during adverse weather. Log
is in a plastic container for that reason so please make sure lid
is on tight. You should keep that in mind if leaving any tradables
or trackables.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both points on busy through fares within a short walking distance
of each other. Cache should not be too difficult to find but with
Muggles everywhere cautious and surreptitious behavior will help
avoid drawing attention to you. Should any little Muggle eyes
observe you . . . the cache will be stolen! Once the cache has been
found feel free to take a stroll through town. It's a great place
for a walking tour with lots to see and a few famous people have
been seen around town.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Town of Manteo wraps around Shallowbag Bay on the eastern side
of Roanoke Island, part of North Carolina's Outer Banks. The seat
of government for Dare County since 1870, this waterfront community
incorporated in 1899. Nearby attractions include a representative
16th century ship at Roanoke Island Festival Park, Roanoke Marshes
Lighthouse. A couple of miles north are The Elizabethan Gardens and
Waterside Theatre, home to the nation's oldest outdoor symphonic
drama, The Lost Colony.&lt;br /&gt;

Many are homeless, lost or abandoned animals; primarily a large variety of dogs and cats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Responsibilities here include the sheltering of unwanted or stray dogs and cats; enforcement of State and County ordinances relating to the keeping, restraint, and humane treatment of animals; education of the public concerning responsible animal ownership and proper animal care; responsible placement of adopted animals; and the humane disposition of unwanted, unadopted, sick or injured animals. Because of pet overpopulation, four million cats and dogs—about one every eight seconds—are put down in U.S. shelters each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past, a shelter was more commonly referred to as a &quot;DOG pound&quot;, a term which had its origins in the impoundments of agricultural communities, where stray cattle would be penned up or impounded until claimed by their owners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some animal shelters euthanize animals not adopted within a set period of time; others have a policy of only putting down animals that are in distress due to age or illness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep in mind that not only is this a busy place but the county gas pumps are right next door to the south, building maintenance is next door to the north, and the county detention center is right across the street.

simple Park &amp; Grab if you have a &lt;b&gt;Retrieval Implement&lt;/b&gt; and
can search when Muggles are not in the vicinity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations to &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;onemoore&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for being First to Find.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The home company for this
location produces 100,000 gallons of milk per day and sells 1.5
million gallons of ice cream annually with a product line that
features 48 flavors of ice cream, 33 varieties of milk and five
kinds of ice cream novelties.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are five Dairy Cow Breeds:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Holstein&lt;/b&gt;   ~   Originating in northern Holland
with a distinctive black and white coloring, Holsteins are
considered “powerhouses” when it comes to producing
milk providing up to 150 lbs. (20 gallons) per day. Holsteins
outnumber all other dairy breeds in the U.S. and produce 90% of the
milk supply. The spotted markings on Holsteins are like
fingerprints. No two cows have the same pattern. Holsteins are one
of the largest dairy cattle breeds, weighing in at an average of
1200 to 1400 lbs. Their milk has a relatively low butterfat
content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jersey&lt;/b&gt;   ~   This short-horned dairy cattle
breed is the smallest of the dairy breeds with adults averaging 900
lbs. They are widely accepted to be the most efficient at
converting forage into milk. Unlike Holsteins, Jersey cows produce
milk relatively high in butterfat. Originating the English Channel
Island of Jersey, this breed is believed to have descended from
French cattle. A Jersey cow is usually a shade of fawn or cream,
but darker shades are possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guernsey&lt;/b&gt;   ~   Guernsey cows have a
distinctive tan and white coloring &amp; are relatively small with
an average weight of about 950 lbs. However, they produce more milk
per unit of body weight than any other breed. Originating on
Guernsey, another of the English Channel Islands, they are thought
to have descended from the cattle of nearby Normandy and Brittany.
Some dairy farmers looking for cows with excellent immunity to
disease and high milk quality select Guernseys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ayrshire&lt;/b&gt;   ~   The Ayrshire breed of dairy
cattle originated in Scotland in the late 18th century and were
introduced into the United States in 1837. They are medium-sized
and white mixed with red or brown in color. Ayrshires are excellent
grazers and good, consistent milk producers. Ayrshires were
formerly used as dual-purpose dairy and meat producers. Their
importance as a breed has declined, especially in favor of the
Holstein, but Ayrshires still remain popular in parts of the
U.S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brown Swiss&lt;/b&gt;   ~   Brown Swiss cows, which are
native to Switzerland, are one of the oldest breeds in existence.
While these cattle are classified as a dairy breed in the U.S.,
they are often considered a dual-purpose breed in other parts of
the world as they are heavier boned and thicker fleshed than the
cattle of other dairy breeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Road on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Muggle proximity

Pawnbrokers may be our oldest
financial institutions with a history dating back to ancient
Chinese, Greek and Roman civilizations. The word pawn is derived
from a Latin word meaning pledge. Items are pawned to a Pawn Shop
broker as collateral, or pledges, for a cash loan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Items pawned for a loan are held for a contractual time period. The
pawner can purchase an item back for the amount of the loan plus an
agreed-upon interest amount. Both the amount of time and rate of
interest are governed by law and a pawnbroker’s policies.
However, if the loan is not paid within the agreed time, the item
will be offered for sale to anyone. The defaulted loan is not
treported since the pawnbroker has physical possession of the item
and may recoup any loan value through an outright sale of the item.
That default can become a treasured find for another
customer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on local laws and business needs today’s Pawn Shop
services include secured loans to individuals, fee-based check
cashing, payday loans, vehicle title or house title loans, and
currency exchange services. Known primarily for lending money, some
pawnbrokers retail other valuable items including large collections
of unusual, antique and estate jewelry. You might find anything in
a Pawn Shop from art supplies all the way down to zebra
saddles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Edward Teach (c.1680–November 22, 1718), better known as “Blackbeard,” is believed to have sailed the Atlantic Ocean between the Delaware Bay 60 miles to the north and the Outer Banks of North Carolina about 138 miles to the south “as the crow flies.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twenty-two (22) ships are reportedly sunk along the Virginia coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe some of the treasures from these ships found their way to Chincoteague Island. Enjoy the hunt!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional trivia: The initials “E.W.P., July 23, 1905” (more than 100 years ago) are written in the plaster above the attic stairwell in the structure closest to this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache container is a camouflage-painted pill bottle with a second container inside to keep the log dry.

&lt;b&gt;Description:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Located near the site of an Old School Baptist Church, One of the
first in this area of Delaware. Established in 1733 at the site of
an old baptist church, this area has graves dating back into the
the early 1700's. The foundation can still be seen around a few old
graves if you look closely. Many names on the markers may be
familiar to you, as the history of Delaware can always be found
among the many old grave yards in the First State.</groundspeak:long_description>

This geocache is a part of the Delaware Cache around the colonial
hundreds event&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Come Visit Ebenezer
      Cemetery 
&lt;p&gt;Ebenezer Cemetery, A final resting place of a
small group of Delawarians who helped build the local community.
This old church is a joining of two religious groups, The Methodist
&amp; the Episcopal Church. A small group in central Delaware
decided to start a small community church that would fit the needs
of the locals. They found a joining of two groups that met their
needs. The ME church was just what they needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often to see how a local area is built, you
need to see the groups of people that actually built and led the
community. Grave yards are a great way to learn who was around way
back then. Many local families are represented, Caulk, Toulsen,
Tolson, Hopkins and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located near the gravesites of many hardworking
families of the local area. Use caution in the area as there may be
broken glass, discarded household items, and other obstacles to be
dealt with. The container is a blue 30. cal ammo can with items
that relate to the local area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please restore the cache site as you found it. If you can, this
would be a great place to do some CITO, also visit the graves
nearby and take a look back into history!!!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Bring your own pen! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forty miles from Philadelphia, was (and still is) the little town of Greenwich, the principal settlement of Cumberland County in 1774. &lt;br/&gt;The Cohansey creek is a navigable stream of some size running through the county of Cumberland and emptying into the Delaware Bay. In the autumn of 1774, the quiet inhabitants along the banks of the creek were startled by the appearance of a British brig called the &quot;Greyhound.&quot; Sailing about four miles up the Cohansey, the brig stopped at the village of Greenwich, which was the first landing from its mouth. She was laden with a cargo of tea sent out by the East India Tea Company, which was undoubtedly under the impression that the conservative feelings and principles of the people of New Jersey would induce them to submit quietly to a small tax. The result showed that the temper of the people was little understood by the East India Tea Company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having found an English sympathizer, a Tory, as they were called, one Daniel Bowen, the Greyhound's crew secretly stored the cargo of tea in the cellar of his house. However, this unusual procedure was noted by the citizens who immediately appointed a temporary committee of five to look after the matter until a county committee might be appointed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;News of the Boston Tea Party had already reached Greenwich and the defiant example was regarded by many of the local settlers as worthy of their own contempt for the British. Fate now presented them with a ready-made opportunity to duplicate the act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the evening of Thursday, December 22, 1774, a company of about forty young Whigs, disguised as Indians, entered the cellar of Bowen's house. They took possession of the whole cargo, conveyed the tea chests from the cellar into an adjoining field, and piling them together, burnt them in one general conflagration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

You will see what I mean when you're on the platform. Keep your eyes peeled for fiddler crabs, bald eagles, and numerous other critters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy walk on a paved surface.

Trail starts near the baseball fields and goes into the woods. Bring your fishing pole(and your license if over 16) there is good fishing along this stream. Do not walk on the old stone wall, some rocks will move and the cache is not there anyway.  Easy way in is to go to the creek then up the hill, less thorns to deal with.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Visit the location of a project by Marian Cruger Coffin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marian Cruger Coffin was responsible for designing and planting the landscaping on the university campus. The plan for Delaware College called for two ordered rows of Elm and Oak trees, emphasizing the order and austerity of the campus. Conversely, her plan for the Women’s College called for flowering trees and shrubs, to soften the architecture and create a &quot;romantic&quot; atmosphere. Most importantly, Coffin designed a central &quot;recreation area&quot; consisting of a magnolia circle and paths that bordered an oval-shaped green. This area was intended to create a transitional space between the two campuses, where men and women could meet and relax, without leaving the University grounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just recently, a few Fountains have been added to the plan, this cache is located near one of them.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No need to get wet, cache is accessable without getting wet.  Bring your own pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please replace as found.  This is a very busy area on Campus.  Best to find this cache in the early morning, or evening or night time hours.  Also &quot;BIG BROTHER&quot; Is now watching the area. Check this out for an example, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g7ZPCwbCA0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do not park anywhere you should not. The parking police will give you a ticket. Metered parking is available nearby if needed. Just watch your car so you do not get a ticket.

geocache find. Not quite to the date but the same general area.
There was a cache near the parking lot called &quot;Sock Her&quot; by
lavarock that was my first find. Since then I have been hooked.
Thanks lavarock!&lt;br /&gt;
This cache should be a lot more muggle proof but might also be
geocacher proof. Well, we'll see. This container is about 4&quot; long
roughly and very, and I mean very, well camo'd which is the reason
for the overall 3.5 rating. Be sure to watch for muggles especially
if there is a ball game going on.&lt;br /&gt;



Please be sure to hide the cache EXACTLY as found to
ensure it's longevity from muggles. There is a pencil in the cache
but be sure to bring a pen in case it gets worn down.&lt;br /&gt;
Happy Caching! :)

Be careful of the traffic, not for kids or pets and as always have FUN..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have always loved visiting these structures and Pennsylvania  has 197 of them, over 25 in Lancaster County. Mercer's Mill Covered Bridge or Mercer's Ford Covered Bridge and is very busy so be alert at all times. The view here is great and this one even has a window, so enjoy the view of the little creek. Cache is inside, no need to crawl under the bridge. Please hide as found so others may have the same fun.&quot; Remember &quot;  it is your responsibility to do this cache safely. Disclaimer: You are under no obligation to hunt my cache. You do so at your own risk. Like any outdoor sport, it carries the risk of unforeseen hazards. Use your best judgment with the environment and conditions. As conditions and cache locations may vary, it is the responsibility of the searcher to be familiar with the conditions in the area to be searched, to adequately prepare for those conditions, and to conduct oneself safely and responsibly and remain within his or her personal abilities and limitations. Children should be well supervised. When and if you find a cache, you are under no obligation to touch it, reach it, climb to it, dig for it, pick it up, or even open it. Open it at your own risk. If food or drink is present, do not consume it, throw it out. Good Luck with this one.</groundspeak:long_description>

Found at 15:00 with mblatch on our way from Valley Forge to Philadelphia via the Schuylkill River Trail on a beautiful Spring day. I wasn't sure where I would end up for #2000 but I'm considering the entire trail as the milestone find not one particular cache. We found this one pretty quickly despite the nearby police that had the street blocked off for the regatta. As long as they don't notice you go over the wall all is well. :smile: TN, dropped in a commemorative Ericles #2000 button and signed up the log. It's been a long and interesting journey.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">#2000. Number 84 of 101 today. Found at 15:00 with mblatch on our way from Valley Forge to Philadelphia via the Schuylkill River Trail on a beautiful Spring day. I wasn't sure where I would end up for #2000 but I'm considering the entire trail as the milestone find not one particular cache. We found this one pretty quickly despite the nearby police that had the street blocked off for the regatta. As long as they don't notice you go over the wall all is well. :smile: TN, dropped in a commemorative Ericles #2000 button and signed up the log. It's been a long and interesting journey. Can't wait to see what the next 2K brings me! Thanks for the series and TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Sitting at home and more SRT caches get published at 8:30am. I made a call to HBWG asking if he wants to go grab them.
While I'm on the phone with him I get an email from SA who says he's 50 minutes away but heading in my direction.
Woo Hoo [:D] an hour later SA arrives and we all head to the first cache. And the rain held off for us the entire bike ride.
A great series of caches, after getting the hang of the hides we all started checking the &quot;usual&quot; spots and got lucky and found a couple that 
were not out yet. How cool is that? Thanks for a really cool series and great hides SRT [:D]</groundspeak:text>

Sitting at home and more SRT caches get published at 8:30am. I made a call to HBWG asking if he wants to go grab them.
While I'm on the phone with him I get an email from SA who says he's 50 minutes away but heading in my direction.
Woo Hoo [:D] an hour later SA arrives and we all head to the first cache. And the rain held off for us the entire bike ride.
A great series of caches, after getting the hang of the hides we all started checking the &quot;usual&quot; spots and got lucky and found a couple that 
were not out yet. How cool is that? Thanks for a really cool series and great hides SRT [:D]</groundspeak:text>

Sitting at home and more SRT caches get published at 8:30am. I made a call to HBWG asking if he wants to go grab them.
While I'm on the phone with him I get an email from SA who says he's 50 minutes away but heading in my direction.
Woo Hoo [:D] an hour later SA arrives and we all head to the first cache. And the rain held off for us the entire bike ride.
A great series of caches, after getting the hang of the hides we all started checking the &quot;usual&quot; spots and got lucky and found a couple that 
were not out yet. How cool is that? Thanks for a really cool series and great hides SRT [:D]</groundspeak:text>

Sitting at home and more SRT caches get published at 8:30am. I made a call to HBWG asking if he wants to go grab them.
While I'm on the phone with him I get an email from SA who says he's 50 minutes away but heading in my direction.
Woo Hoo [:D] an hour later SA arrives and we all head to the first cache. And the rain held off for us the entire bike ride.
A great series of caches, after getting the hang of the hides we all started checking the &quot;usual&quot; spots and got lucky and found a couple that 
were not out yet. How cool is that? Thanks for a really cool series and great hides SRT [:D]</groundspeak:text>

Sitting at home and more SRT caches get published at 8:30am. I made a call to HBWG asking if he wants to go grab them.
While I'm on the phone with him I get an email from SA who says he's 50 minutes away but heading in my direction.
Woo Hoo [:D] an hour later SA arrives and we all head to the first cache. And the rain held off for us the entire bike ride.
A great series of caches, after getting the hang of the hides we all started checking the &quot;usual&quot; spots and got lucky and found a couple that 
were not out yet. How cool is that? Thanks for a really cool series and great hides SRT [:D]</groundspeak:text>

Sitting at home and more SRT caches get published at 8:30am. I made a call to HBWG asking if he wants to go grab them.
While I'm on the phone with him I get an email from SA who says he's 50 minutes away but heading in my direction.
Woo Hoo [:D] an hour later SA arrives and we all head to the first cache. And the rain held off for us the entire bike ride.
A great series of caches, after getting the hang of the hides we all started checking the &quot;usual&quot; spots and got lucky and found a couple that 
were not out yet. How cool is that? Thanks for a really cool series and great hides SRT [:D]</groundspeak:text>

Sitting at home and more SRT caches get published at 8:30am. I made a call to HBWG asking if he wants to go grab them.
While I'm on the phone with him I get an email from SA who says he's 50 minutes away but heading in my direction.
Woo Hoo [:D] an hour later SA arrives and we all head to the first cache. And the rain held off for us the entire bike ride.
A great series of caches, after getting the hang of the hides we all started checking the &quot;usual&quot; spots and got lucky and found a couple that 
were not out yet. How cool is that? Thanks for a really cool series and great hides SRT [:D]</groundspeak:text>

Found at 10:03 with mblatch on our way from Valley Forge to Philadelphia via the Schuylkill River Trail on a beautiful Spring day. I'm placing my primary log on #1 in the series as it seems a logical place to put it. I never had any inclination to do a &quot;power trail&quot; until this one popped up. Dozens of the same container, the same hide, the same terrain… meh! The SRT however features varied terrain, lots of sights and a great history. The series still managed to exceed my expectations. I saw a lot on the 30+ mile bike ride! Rows of daffodils. Fields of buttercups. Great blooms of cherry and magnolia trees. About 100 warnings to a local Demon. Several magnificent waterfalls and a handful of charming little ones. Great Gothic churches and historic train stations. At least 5 types of power-line including a long since retired simple cross design that happened to be right by a cemetery. Castle-like walls and fantastic stone arched bridges. Great big works of art and petite folk art. Sculptures, murals, carvings, plaques &amp; of course a few of the caches were works of art in their own respect. Aside from the ubiquitous nanos the hides and containers were diverse and interesting. I wish more of them had been active but on a trail like this when stealth is all but impossible there's really no way to prevent muggle attention and unfortunately caches will go missing. We noticed quite a few had been replaced already. Thanks for the maintenance! We got passed by hundreds of warrior bikers wearing superhero outfits and riding on $3600 bikes. I wonder if any of the &quot;ONYERLEFTS!&quot; did this many miles today. On a cheap ten year old bike? Would they even be seen in a $10 K-mart helmet? :grin: If all power trails were this well done I would seek out more of them but I think this one is fairly unique for our region. All told I took 1 button, left 1 button , 2 pencils and 3 Easter peeps. Many thanks to the folks who placed and maintain the series, to Marc for keeping the field-notes and performing logging duties and to the weather for being absolutely perfect for biking in the spring. Thanks for the opportunity for adventure, for the great series and for find #2000!</groundspeak:text>

Stop&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
After finishing a 3 day, 27 cache challenge in New Jersey, we
quickly discovered this was one of our favorite and most frequent
places to stop.&lt;br /&gt;
 As always please watch out for Muggles &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MMC : MICRO MASTERS CHALLENGE&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


This &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Micro&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is part of a series of micros created
by some great hiders and creative micro makers of Southeast
Pennsylvania. There are a number of Micro Masters contributing to
this series, thanks to all of them. Find all individual micros,
enjoy the hides, the adventure and gather the clues from each and
find the final. Will you accept the
Micro Master's Challenge?



&lt;p&gt;Each micro is a unique work of art created and owned by each
Micro Master Team. In each cache there will be a clue that you must
gather and record. These clues will lead you to a final mystery
cache located somewhere in the SEPAG area. This series is bound to
challenge you, make you smile and reward you after every cache you
find. &lt;b&gt;Remember to write down the code from this
cache!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




Teams are allowed and encouraged! We recognize that caching
with a team is great fun but we also want to ensure that each
person joins the hunt for each micro before joining the hunt for
the final. You may also find these by yourself. Please follow all
the rules on each Micro Masters Cache page.
&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well I saw 22 get published and # 26. I didn't want to ride my bike down just for 2 caches. And knowing that there is probably a 23,24,and a 25 coming out soon.
Well, I was depressed today and just needed to get out of the house. So I went for them.
Scored FTF on 22 and 26 [:D] Thanks SRT.
Between 22 and 26 I looked for the missing group of numbers but came up empty.</groundspeak:text>

Well, I was depressed today and just needed to get out of the house. So I went for them.
Scored FTF on 22 and 26 [:D] Thanks SRT.
Between 22 and 26 I looked for the missing group of numbers but came up empty.</groundspeak:text>

Didn't leave my house until after I did my chores of raking the leaves and cleaning.
Which meant I left the house around 2:30pm. Found a blank log in each cache.
After getting the feel for the hides, was able to make 1 other non-published find.
To future cachers, i can tell you to look for bison tubes and mkh's</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">It's 6:30pm and its like pitch black out. The bike trail is really cool at night.

Its like going back in a time machine. 
You pass all the old factories and wonder what life used to be like then.
Not to mention, very near those factories are old houses of the workers that kept those old buildings alive for so long.

I had a flashlight with me but I never use it at night when alone. It's just all too peaceful and a light would be distracting.
Even in Norristown, it's dark, its quite, it's peaceful. I love it. Riding along with just my thoughts, which usually scare the hell out of me.
but tonight I just really needed to be alone. Home life is just a bitch. Holidays suck. All the brouhaha is just maddening.
There is something to be said about a man and his thoughts.....

At any rate, i couldn't extricate the cache from it's hiding spot and i didn't want to brake it trying to get it out.

Had a wonderful ride back contemplating &quot;42&quot;</groundspeak:text>

It is one of a number of spy thrillers of the time which have conspicuous sci-fi elements. In this case it is the inclusion of deadly spores which turn people into creatures made of fungus.

&lt;br /&gt;
1 log book.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Missione Hydra&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is a 1965 Italian science-fiction film directed by Pietro Francisci. It stars Leonora Ruffo as Chaena, the commander of a spaceship from the constellation Hydra which has crashed on the island of Sardinia.&lt;br /&gt;
The latest cache in a series based on Italian SF movies from the 60's. Eventually I'll move onto other genres, of which there is no shortage.&lt;br /&gt;
This is a short walk from the way point. I ask people to show a little discretion in finding this one as it's near a road intersection which can be busy. The last thing I want is to see this compromised by Enemy Agents.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cache only contains a scroll to sign your name and date. Sorry about the size, but I needed to do something with one of the micro cache containers I took from the cache on Mt. Trashmore.&lt;br /&gt;
This is also in response to a comment I heard at last night's ChesMont cacher gathering. The feeling was that the area had been &quot;cached out&quot;. My response: &quot;We'll just have to do something about that!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is easy to get to, but is located next to a busy section of Route 724.</groundspeak:long_description>

And a whole lotta refrigerator magnets.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We conclude our tribute to the great Italian science fiction films of the 60's with the greatest one. From Wikepidia:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barbarella&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is a 1968 Franco-Italian science fiction film based on Jean-Claude Forest's French &lt;i&gt;Barbarella&lt;/i&gt; comics. The film was directed by Roger Vadim and stars Jane Fonda, who was Vadim's wife at the time.&lt;br /&gt;
In an unspecified future (the video release states it is the year 40,000), Barbarella (Jane Fonda) is assigned by the President of Earth (Claude Dauphin) to retrieve Doctor Durand Durand (Milo O'Shea) from the planet Tau Ceti. Durand Durand is the inventor of the Positronic Ray, a weapon. Earth is now a peaceful planet, and weapons are unheard of. Because Tau Ceti is an unknown region of space there is the potential for the weapon to fall into the wrong hands.

After last week's big undertaking, I've gone with something much simpler.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Billion Dollar Brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is a 1967 British espionage film directed by Ken Russell and based on the novel &lt;i&gt;Billion-Dollar Brain&lt;/i&gt; by Len Deighton. The film features Michael Caine as secret agent Harry Palmer, the anti-hero protagonist of the film versions of &lt;i&gt;The IPCRESS File&lt;/i&gt; (1965) and &lt;i&gt;Funeral in Berlin&lt;/i&gt; (1966). The &quot;brain&quot; of the title is a sophisticated computer with which an ultra-right-wing organization controls its worldwide anti-Soviet spy network.</groundspeak:long_description>

On his voyage in 14 _ _ , Columbus not only discovered America, but gave peppers their name. In search of black pepper from the Orient, he assumed the spicy pods used to flavor foods in America were a form of black pepper and mistakenly called them &quot;pimiento,&quot; or pepper. Actually, the plants are not related at all. &lt;br/&gt;H. Pickle Packers International has its own official limerick and theme song - the Pickle Polka. The pickle got its name in the  _ _ 00's when English speaking people mispronounced William Beukelz' name - he was a Dutch fisherman known for pickling fish.&lt;br/&gt;I. Good pickles have an audible crunch at  _ _  paces. This can be measured at &quot;crunch-off&quot; using the &quot;scientific&quot; device known as the Audible Crunch Meter.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A Little History
Eeny, &quot;meanie&quot;, miny, moe, which can be spelled a number of ways,
is a childrens counting rhyme, used to select a person to be &quot;it&quot;
for games and similar purposes. The rhyme has existed in various
forms since the 1850s, or perhaps earlier, and is common in many
countries.
Many stories exist about the &quot;real&quot; meaning of the first line,
although the most commonly accepted theory is that they are just
nonsense syllables.
The American version:
Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!
Catch a tiger by the toe!
If he hollers let him go!
Eenee, Meenee. Mainee, Mo!
You are it!
Controversial alternative versions of this poem replace the word
tiger with the N...... word, which in the eyes of some has tainted
the rhyme entirely. Rudyard Kipling's version which replaced the
word tiger with the N...... word was the most commonly recited
version in the United States and Canada until as late as the early
1970s when school aged children became aware of the political
incorrectness of the poorly-aged wording. The word &quot;tiger&quot; soon
became the standard, as parents were quick to correct their
children not to use the &quot;N&quot; word.
Excerpt from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.You can find the cache after a short hike from the parking lot.
I saw three deer while I was there. They practically walked right
up to me. I hope your so lucky! Happy caching!

&lt;b&gt;MMC : MICRO MASTERS CHALLENGE&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


This &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Micro&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is part of a series of micros
created&lt;br /&gt;
by some great hiders and creative micro makers of Southeast&lt;br /&gt;
Pennsylvania. There are a number of Micro Masters contributing
to&lt;br /&gt;
this series, thanks to all of them. Find all individual
micros,&lt;br /&gt;
enjoy the hides, the adventure and gather the clues from each
and&lt;br /&gt;
find the final. Will you accept the&lt;br /&gt;

border=&quot;0&quot;&amp;gt;Micro Master's Challenge?
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each micro is a unique work of art created and owned by
each&lt;br /&gt;
Micro Master Team. In each cache there will be a clue that you
must&lt;br /&gt;
gather and record. These clues will lead you to a final
mystery&lt;br /&gt;
cache located somewhere in the SEPAG area. This series is bound
to&lt;br /&gt;
challenge you, make you smile and reward you after every cache
you&lt;br /&gt;
find. &lt;b&gt;Remember to write down the code from
this&lt;br /&gt;
cache!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;

 width=&quot;100&quot; /&amp;gt;
Teams are allowed and encouraged! We recognize that
caching&lt;br /&gt;
with a team is great fun but we also want to ensure that each&lt;br /&gt;
person joins the hunt for each micro before joining the hunt
for&lt;br /&gt;
the final. You may also find these by yourself. Please follow
all&lt;br /&gt;
the rules on each Micro Masters Cache page.

&lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;From the cemetery to the sanitarium,
enjoy the sanctuary on the hill above the Booming Valley&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The History:&lt;/b&gt; In the late nineteenth century the
Centennial Springs Hotel was erected on the Klapperthal side of
Neversink Mountain. The hotel was never a financial success and in
1909 was purchased for use as a Tuberculosis Sanitarium. With no
cure for the disease many people opted to spend their final days in
the resort like settings of the TB Sanitariums. &lt;a href=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/log/f6bff5ad-b4c6-45db-a42b-00bfef2a7e45.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;This voluntary quarantining, more
than any other factor, helped stem the spread of the disease.
Eventually penicillin reduced the need for the Sanitariums, but its
invention wasn't in time to save my great uncle who died in the
Berks County TB Sanitarium in the late 1920s. Not much information
remains about the sanatorium on Neversink mountain - but some of
the original foundations have survived. If you follow the
waypoints, this cache will act as a mini tour of Reading's &quot;other
mountain&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/log/1dee2125-6e9d-43a3-8554-34f7560cc9bc.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Hike:&lt;/b&gt; The recommended approach to the cache is from
the Klapperthal/Forest Hills side though the mountain is covered in
usable trails. Follow the red blazed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berks-conservancy.org/Portals/0/pdf/NMPbrochure_1mb.pdf&quot;&gt;
Upper Glen Trail&lt;/a&gt; and head for the primitive trails when you get
to The Pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Hide:&lt;/b&gt; The cache is a small &quot;fuse can&quot; painted for
camouflage. Nothing needs to be moved to find it but given the
surroundings it could be difficult to spot. Bring a flash-light.
You don't need it to find the cache but it could come in handy to
explore the fountain pond &amp; original hotel cellar. Are those
meat hooks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache location borders private property. Please approach GZ
from the South and do not venture up the hill to the East or climb
on top of the structure. Protect our right to public property by
respecting their right to private property. Thanks, be safe and
enjoy the hunt!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Berks County Conservancy allows the public to hide
geocaches on land it protects provided they ask for approval. We
will provide the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/b56e1a07-77fc-47dd-b42d-5e68a2805fb1.jpg&quot;&gt;Approved Geocache&lt;/a&gt;&quot; logo and ask that it is
included with the description. For a copy of our Gecaching Policy
and Regulations pertaining to our properties please &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berks-conservancy.org/&quot;&gt;contact our
office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;R116ZND - Centennial Pond&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 19.173 W 075° 53.446&lt;br /&gt;Though it looks as though it may have been a flooded foundation, this is the remains of a decorative pond that dates to late in the days of the Sanitarium. Lots of frogs to see (and hear) when the weather is warm.&lt;br /&gt;R216ZND - Spring House&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 19.151 W 075° 53.324&lt;br /&gt;This was most likely part of the Denglers Glen Hotel which burned in 1931. This natural spring house has been restored. It's cool inside even in the heat of the summer. Look around for the old Hotel foundation and the outline of &quot;Mirror Lake&quot; which was actually a small pond.&lt;br /&gt;R316ZND - Neversink Mountain Railroad Trestle&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 18.940 W 075° 53.500&lt;br /&gt;At one time the Neversink Mountain Railroad ran all around the mountain. Connecting trains brought passengers and tourists from neighboring towns &amp; cities. When the last of the hotels went out of business in 1917 the railroad closed up shop as well. The remnants of this trestle and many rail beds can still be found along the mountain.&lt;br /&gt;R416ZND - Klapperthal Road Trailhead&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 18.882 W 075° 53.545&lt;br /&gt;This is the official trailhead &amp; parking for the hike. There's room here for 5 or 6 vehicles.&lt;br /&gt;R516ZND - Forest Hills Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 18.810 W 075° 53.545&lt;br /&gt;For overflow parking, you can enjoy a trip through Forest Hills cemetery. The pond at this spot is just down the hill from the original Klapperthal Park Pavilion. </groundspeak:long_description>

Please stop at the Nature Center and pickup a trail map if you are new to this area.  This area was low income housing when I was growing up and I was never allowed to venture back into this area.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could always see the dam from the road, but today was the first day I could get a closer look at it.  The location of the cache is not the closest point to the dam, but I did not learn that little fact until after I placed the cache.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parking area is N 40 20.847 W 75 29.024&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache is one of a series of pill bottles for your caching pleasure. Some are grounded, some are not, others are just _______? and all are fun so . . . HAVE FUN!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please replace this cache as you found it and then take some time to look around and enjoy this beautiful area.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A cache in Point Pleasant Community Park&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A park without a cache, how could it be? I had to rectify this
situation immediately! I found the perfect spot a short walk from
the parking area.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
This beautiful little park overlooks the Tohickon Creek, which
feeds into the Delaware River. The park has a 1/3 mile nature trail
with many scenic and serene places to stop and ponder. Picnic
tables are by the bridge. Point Pleasant is a quaint little town
with several things to see and do. Bed and Breakfasts abound in
this area, and if you're in the mood (and season) you can find
someplace to rent a canoe, kayak or innertube down the
Delaware.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Congrats!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;FTF:&lt;/b&gt; Geo-Ben&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Allentown's first opencache and hopefully more to follow. This cache is hidden under the big 78 bridge. You are seeking a regular size lock and lock with a notebook, pen, some items for trade, and a $5 bill for FTF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache area is the Lehigh Parkway. There is a lot of good crushed stone paths for walking and biking. Also a lot of dirth paths off the main path for walking. There are many things to see including; old hunters cabin, covered bridge, and other old structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best parking can be had at the covered brige area parking lot (N40º 34.104   W75º 29.920). Then cross the covered bridge (to the side where hunters cabin is on) and walk down the path less then 1/2 mile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Closer parking can be had at (N 40° 33.907   W 075° 30.321) but may be more difficult to find the parking area for non-locals. If you chose this parking lot, cross the bridge and walk for about 5-10 minutes to the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache should not be a hard find and shouldn't be easily found by non-cachers. Please use the hint if needed. Beware of mugglers walking on the trail. Please hide same or better then found.   &lt;br/&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;Cache is hidden at (N 40 33.984   W 75 30.242)   </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Northern Berks County is the destination of choice for many of the area's outdoor enthusiasts. With its beautiful vistas (Pinnacle, Pulpit Rock, Dan's Pulpit), great hiking trails (Appalachian, Valley Rim, Sand Spring, Tom Lowe), world famous Hawk Mountain Sanctuary bird refuge, and geologic wonders (River of Rocks, Blue Rocks) there is much to see and do. In fact, it would be a shame to come here and not enjoy Mother Nature's gift to us! So...let's go for a hike...a long hike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To claim this cache, you will need to lace up your hiking boots and prepare to spend the entire day (or weekend) on the trail and in the woods. This is a six stage multi-cache that will take past the Pulpit Rock, the Pinnacle, Dan's Pulpit, the Balancing Rocks and the Tri-County Marker. You can easily take a detour to visit Hawk Mountain Sanctuary and the River of Rocks. In all, you will hike over 18 miles (most of it in Berks County but some in Schuylkill and Lehigh). If you decide to park at the Hamburg Reservoir and hike to the cache and back, your hike will be approximately 30 miles. This is not a &quot;stroller friendly&quot; cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obviously such a long hike necessitates an abundance of caution. Take plenty of water, food, water, map &amp; compass, water, flashlight, water, rain gear, water, extra socks and some more water. This is a difficult hike. There are two 1000'+ inclines and much of the trail is very rocky. You may be wise to complete the cache over a weekend and camp along the trail. There are two shelters along the way and several campsites so pack your tent and a bear bag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;None of the individual stages are very difficult to find. If you are willing to hike so far, we hope that you will come away with a smiley. Please note that we may move the final cache and some of the other stages from time to time. If you decide to do this cache in stages, please post a note so that we don't move the stage you are on. No hints should be necessary but we recommend that, with the exception of the first stage, you follow the Appalachian Trail even if your GPSr is telling you otherwise. The AT will get you within a quarter mile of each stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drop off parking: N 40° 35.012 W 075° 56.519&lt;br/&gt;If you want to park overnight you must register with the borough manager ahead of time at 610-562-7821.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pick-up parking: N 40° 41.660 W 075° 50.515&lt;br/&gt;Parking for pick-up. Blue Mountain House Road.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Koen and I figured our area needed a few more geocaches to make our area more interesting to the geocaching world and to have other geocachers enjoy this as a hobby too!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This has become my hobby with my exchange student whom I introduced this to him when he came in August 2009.  We have thoroughly enjoyed geocaching together and thought we'd try to plant some caches before he returns to Holland.  This will give him something to watch and remind him of our great year of fun in the States! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding caches that can hold travel bugs and geocoins are much more interesting!  Please feel free to use this cache for that.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be careful in returning the cache to its hiding spot!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun and keep on Geocaching!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to Zooming Boomers for the FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

I'm one of them that can not speak it.  Although my parents do!  My parents only ever talked it when us kids weren't suppose to know something.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is an expression we say in the area!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;            I, ii, i-e-i!!!!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(You must say the letters and combinations together and fast - HA! HA!!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And maybe somebody else can think of how to say this in English...or write it better so others know how to say this....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Means what the heck!

Total distance is 5-6 miles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is an ammo can just outside the boundary of the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a multistage cache that requires you to project four different waypoints. The listed coordinates will take you to the North Lookout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From there you will need to project the following waypoints (all are true north).&lt;br/&gt;1) 67 degrees for 0.58 miles.&lt;br/&gt;2) 68 degrees for 0.42 miles.&lt;br/&gt;3) 70 degrees for 0.75 miles.&lt;br/&gt;4) 140 degrees for 164 feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You do not have to leave the Skyline Trail (blue blazes) until the final stage. Please use the hints below to be sure you are on the right track. One degree off over 1.75 miles will have you looking in the wrong place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is trail a fee charged by the Sanctuary. If you do not want to pay, you can hike in the Appalachian Trail to the North Lookout and backtrack to the cache. The cache was designed to have you start at the North Lookout. If you use the hints and the AT, you can actually avoid making the full hike. That wouldn't be fun. If you do this please state as much in your log.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The distance from the North Lookout to the cache is about two miles and the trail is rated as &quot;difficult&quot;. You will need to keep both hands free in order to climb down. Bring water and binoculars and enjoy the views.</groundspeak:long_description>

This was the last find for us of the Big Bang series.  It is not in the stores, but you can park there and walk across.  Thanks Teeretoon, my son and I had a good time finding.  Looking forward to some more in our area.  Anyone else searching these will have a nice time and they are all easily accessible, plus food and gas stops nearby.</groundspeak:text>

Now this one was a little tricky, missed it the first time I looked at it, then walked around looking at other spots nearby, until my son looked again at it an yelled to me I was loosing it.  It is not a bottle this time.  Enjoy the piece of gum, hopefully you'll get to it before it goes stale.  for a small cache not sure why people are leaving things, but what the hey, moist towelette and a push pin and now a piece of gum.  Getting hard to close it.</groundspeak:text>

The Big Bang Theory is an American sitcom. The stereotyped geeky and socially awkward scientists characters are a bit overdone but I have seen each type but never together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Making a Big Bang. These caches are near 3 (three) fireworks stores. The stores are at the last exit before the NJ state line (4 miles), where even sparklers are illegal. To make a purchase you enter the Pa door or the other states door and show your ID. In the other states side of the store you can buy sparklers, firecrackers, rockets, etc. So with NJ ID you can buy all you want and drive 4 miles and be home. So who is looking the other way for a buck?  </groundspeak:long_description>

Read the board about the canal, walked on the boats, kids had fun and learned something too.   Great Job.  Learning and playing, well thought out.  Hope you do some more, maybe even put one in a deli or restaurant with secret code the workers have, this way you can have a bite to eat and give them the secret word and they'll tell you where to look inside or outside the establishment.  We had done 3 of the Heinz 57's and started getting hungry, so I reasoned why not put one in an establishment...</groundspeak:text>

BYOP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the area is closed at sundown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located near the old Portland School.  The Portland School bell tower is a familiar sight atop the &quot;school hill&quot;, and many local people received at least part of their public school education in this building. Erected in 1886, the building originally housed all grades through high school. Portland High School graduated students until 1947, when the building was converted into an elementary school serving Portland and parts of Upper Mount Bethel Township. After becoming part of the Bangor Area School District in 1958, the building was used until the opening of the Five Points Elementary School in 1969. It now serves as the Portland Municipal Building.  The Portland Gymnasium and a playground is also on this site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placed with Portland Borough Council permission.</groundspeak:long_description>

When we saw that it had been archieved we just had to place one here.  Hopefully the muggles will leave this one alone.  Remember your camera; a great photo shot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Portland-Columbia Pedestrian Bridge (or as its formally known, The Portland-Columbia Toll Supported Pedestrian Bridge) is a footbridge that crosses the Delaware River, at Portland, in Upper Mount Bethel Township, Pennsylvania, connecting to Columbia, in Knowlton Township, New Jersey. The bridge is owned and operated by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission. &lt;br/&gt;A vehicular bridge had been located at the site of the present bridge since 1869. The original structure was a four-span timber bridge with wooden arches which was covered by a wooden shed with a slate roof.&lt;br/&gt;As of December 1, 1953, the bridge on the site was closed to vehicular traffic, which was shifted to the new Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge, built one-quarter mile downstream of the old bridge.&lt;br/&gt;In August 1955, during the remnants of Hurricane Diane, three of the four spans of the timber bridge washed away. Hurricane Diane was the wettest hurricane to ever hit the North American continent and caused record flooding throughout the northeastern US, but particularly the Delaware River watershed.&lt;br/&gt;Starting in 1957, the bridge was reconstructed as a four-span steel girder bridge system with concrete piers.</groundspeak:long_description>

Our first cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At one time there were four Delaware River crossings at and near Portland Pa; The DRBC bridge for auto traffic, the DRBC foot bridge, the Lehigh &amp; New England Railroad and The Lackawanna Cutoff.  All but one still stands!  The Lehigh &amp; New England Railroad crossed the Delaware River in Portland, PA on a single-track combination deck-truss/deck-girder bridge. This bridge was dismantled in 1966 but there still remain three piers.  You will find the cache near one of these piers.  The initial cache container was an ammo box it was changed on 6/1/11 to a small cache container.  The cache includes a FTF Geocoin prize and a bag of goodies to trade.  Please replace as found this is a high traffic area with many mugglers.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Windsor Village Cemetery is one of the oldest public cemeteries in Broome County (c. 1800). Located off of Chapel St. in the Village of Windsor, NY. The cemetery has two &quot;old sections&quot; (with residents from as far back as the late 1700's), and a third newer section that is still in use. This cemetery is maintained by the Town of Windsor and the Windsor Village Cemetery Association.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cemetery opens at dawn and closes at dusk, no night caching here please.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is named for our Geodog Bella. Bella loves to go on geohunts and walks with us, our kids, and our Windsor Scouts (I am an active Boy Scout parent/merit badge councilor and Cubmaster of the Cub Scouts, and SusieQ79 is the leader of the Girl Scout Troop). While walking Bella today, she decided to stop in to visit my grandmother. While my wife and I cleaned up the dead flowers and picked up some wind debris from a recent storm, Bella found a shady spot and decided that she wanted to hide a geocache (which I had in my backpack).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a sandwich box sized lock-n-lock container. It contains a simple log book wrapped in a plastic bag. There is quite a bit of room in here for trackables and SWAG. When putting in swag, please remember that this is a child and pet-friendly cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you happen to be around the same time as any of our Scouts are (this is one of the cemeteries in the area we are doing a merit badge in), please feel free to introduce yourself to us.</groundspeak:long_description>

Muggles walk the area on regular basis, day and night. The rating is due to the high foot-traffic (especially during special events and the warmer months). This cache may be difficult to locate during winter months. Please bring your own pen and use EXTREME STEALTH.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Town of Windsor is one of the oldest towns in Broome County, having been created in 1807, only one year after the birth of Broome County itself. Two hundred years ago, what is now Windsor was still Indian Territory. (from windsorny.org)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town of Windsor, NY is a great little upstate rural village with a deep and rich history that stretches back to the Revolutionary War. It was high time that someone placed a cache in this location to celebrate all that is Windsor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Windsor Green is the home of many community events: Rhubarb Festival, the Art Festival, Farmer's Market, the Scout Flag Retirement, and dozens of open air concerts through the warmer months. This cache is dedicated to the last official village green in Broome County (and very nearly the last in New York State).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is maintained by the Scouts of Boy Scout Troop 68, Cub Scout Pack 68, and Girl Scout Troop 400.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is on the Erie Canal Trail. The cache is a Loc-N-Loc small camo color container. This is a new Resort in the Rome Westmoreland area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking is available at either end of the walking trail but is closer to State Route 233 (west end).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now for some house rules: IF THERE ARE ONLY 3 TBS INSIDE : please take a TB only if you leave a TB. Otherwise, please just log your visit. IF THERE ARE MORE THAN 3 TBS IN THE RESORT: please feel free to take a TB even if you don't have a TB to trade. I just want to make sure there are at least 3 TBs here at any one time since I don't want the resort to go out of business. I also don't want this resort to be a TB prison and I want to keep the TBs moving hence the flexibility in the house rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 5 TB guests in the resort on its Grand Opening Day so the innkeeper put up a &quot;Vacancy&quot; sign. Spread the word that this TB resort is now open for business!</groundspeak:long_description>

The South Nation River meanders through Eastern Ontario originating northeast of Brockville and draining into the Ottawa River north west of Plantagenet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have only recently discovered this location along the South Nation River, but it has become one of my favourite places. It is very quiet, and the river is beautiful. The cache is named after the sign at the east end of the bridge that I found quite amusing. My &quot;Are You Nuts - GC17A2T&quot; cache is a short drive away down a beautiful old country road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many thanks to Model12 for alerting me to this location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache container is a camouflaged 600 ml Rubbermaid drinking bottle. Please replace the container to ensure that the safety cable is hidden.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The bridge is not passable by car. Approach from the east to avoid backtracking.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

the coming of 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the spring my brother, Hooligansx2,
gave me a couple of containers that he thought might be good cache
containers. I have had them bumping around in my geo-bag since
then. On New Year's Eve, I finally got around to gluing a rare
earth magnet to it and put in a log. I wanted to put it out then,
but got sidetracked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a quick park and grab cache, and is meant only to celebrate
the arrival of 2011.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The tracks near the cache are no longer in use, so do not be
concerned, but Van Buren Street is still very much in use, so keep
a handle on your smallish-humans. In a winter with significant
snow, this cache may be difficult to find. The start of 2011 was
snow-free however.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Happy New Year, Good luck and have
fun!&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Saturday April 25, 2009 from 10:00am to 12:00pm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is along a pretty trail in the Centre and takes you by a beautiful pond and through a pretty wetland area. The last few metres are a modest bushwhack, and you will have to choose your footing carefully. As I was heading to this cache location, I was serenaded by dozens of Spring Peepers, trying to woo mates. That's where the name of the cache comes from.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spring peeper is a small frog species, attaining an adult size between 0.75 inches (19 mm) and 1 inch (25 mm) long. They have a dark cross on their backs roughly in the shape of an &quot;X&quot;, though sometimes the marking may be indistinct. Females are lighter-colored, while males are slightly smaller and usually have dark throats. This frog has a vocal sac located by its throat, which expands and deflates like a balloon to create a short and distinct peeping sound. Only males have the ability to make this loud high-pitched noise, and they use it to attract mates. This creature lives in wetlands, marshes, and pond or swamp regions in order to support the aquatic environment the larvae need. The Spring Peeper breeds between the months of March to June, and deposits around 900 eggs that are hidden under vegetation or debris at the water base. After hatching, they transform into frogs and are ready to leave the water in about eight weeks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;TH1QDGN - Trailhead - Spring Peepers&lt;br/&gt;N 45° 02.176 W 075° 39.176&lt;br/&gt;This is the starting point I recommend. </groundspeak:long_description>

home of the Inkerman Rockets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Inkerman Rockets were founded in
1942 by school teacher Lloyd LaPort, who worked at the elementary
school in the village.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Laporte, originally from Collingwood, Ontario enjoyed hockey and
built a rink in the schoolyard for the children to use. He
eventually purchased some hockey sweaters and entered a team in the
Winchester Town League. From these humble beginnings the Rockets
eventually became one of the top junior teams between Ottawa and
Cornwall. The Rockets had twins Erwin &amp; Edwin Duncan and Leo
Boivin leading them against teams from much bigger centers. Leo
Boivin played professional hockey for the Toronto Maple Leafs and
the Boston Bruins.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the teams greatest accomplishments was during the 1951-52
season when they almost made it to the semi-finals of the Memorial
Cup, but lost to the Quebec City Citadels, who were led by the
legendary Jean Belliveau.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The Rockets provided local hockey fans with exciting action for
nearly 20 years. The legend of the Rockets lives on in
Inkerman.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is currently a bit wet on the trail, but still quite walkable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Kemptville Creek is a tributary of the Rideau River, located in North Grenville township in Leeds and Grenville County within Eastern Ontario, Canada. The Kemptville Creek is 63 kilometres (39 miles) in length and flows through several communities, including Kemptville, Ontario, Oxford Mills, Ontario and Bishop's Mills, Ontario. The creek was historically referred to by the name &quot;South Branch of the Rideau River&quot;, until its name was changed to &quot;Kemptville Creek&quot; in 1908.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK1QDGM - Parking - Yellow Turtle&lt;br/&gt;N 45° 02.225 W 075° 38.904&lt;br/&gt;This is a good place to park </groundspeak:long_description>

The forest floor is covered in a soft bed of pine needles. The approach from the south can be a bit mucky, so watch your step.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pines are among the most commercially important of tree species, valued for their timber and wood pulp throughout the world. In temperate and tropical regions, they are fast-growing softwoods that will grow in relatively dense stands, their acidic decaying needles inhibiting the sprouting of competing hardwoods. Commercial pines are grown in plantations for timber that is denser, more resinous, and therefore more durable than spruce (Picea).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK1QDGY - Parking - Pine Grove&lt;br/&gt;N 45° 02.193 W 075° 40.038&lt;br/&gt;This is a good place to park. </groundspeak:long_description>

The cemetery is still cared for, but some of the stones are showing serious signs of deterioration. The only thing I have been able to learn about Vancamp is that the post office opened here in 1877 under the care of Byron Vancamp. Before this date it was known as Vancamp Mills. There was also a cheese factory in the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a small camouflaged Lock-n-Lock container, that will hold small items and coins.</groundspeak:long_description>

The South Nation River meanders through Eastern Ontario originating northeast of Brockville and draining into the Ottawa River north west of Plantagenet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located at a picnic area and boat launch on Highway 31. If you have done other caches in the series, you will likely notice that the river is starting to become noticeably larger than at the caches closer to South Mountain. Depending on when you visit, you may be able to stop in at the nearby cheese shop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a camouflaged 1kg peanut butter jar.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A simple multi-cache in the Ferguson Forest Centre&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I came across this location while doing a cache in the area last fall. The irony was not lost on me, and I thought that I had to put a cache nearby. This is it. Do not be afraid that this cache will take any longer than a traditional. The final location is within 250m of the posted coordinates. Feel free to pick up any trash on your way out, though you may need help with some items...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was placed in conjunction with the Ferguson Forest Centre CITO event that took place Saturday morning April 25, 2009.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At (or near) the posted coordinates, you will find an official sign that has 3 numbers on it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first number is a dollar figure, and you should call the first digit A.&lt;br/&gt;The second number has 2 digits, and you should call them BC.&lt;br/&gt;The third number has 4 digits, and you should call them DEFG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next part turns things upside down a bit [:)]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The digit H is the digit F turned upside down.&lt;br/&gt;The digit I is the digit D turned upside down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located at:&lt;br/&gt;N45 G(B+1).(I-1)(A-1)(D+2)&lt;br/&gt;W075 (B+D)F.H(A-1)(C-1)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have Fun! When placed, the cache had lots of kid-friendly SWAG. There is a micro bison tube cache container for the first to find.&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Winchester's First Cache now in 3D!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple multi with no brain twisting math at all, I promise. The one twist however is that you need to use your elevation to find the cache, hence the 3D. The area near the posted coordinates is a good place to park, and all waypoints are within 500m of this spot, so there is no need to drive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint 1&lt;br/&gt;==============&lt;br/&gt;At the posted coordinates, find the sign and determine the year the Lion's Club started.&lt;br/&gt;This number is ABCD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearby at the Pool, there is a sign describing the trees that the Winchester Waves Swimming Club donated to the park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E=Number of Autumn Purple Ash&lt;br/&gt;F=Number of Shade Master Locust&lt;br/&gt;G=Number of Emerald Queen Maple&lt;br/&gt;H=Number of Green Mountain Sugar Maple&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint 2&lt;br/&gt;===============&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint 2 is located at:&lt;br/&gt;N45 (B-D-A)(C-A).(E+F+G)(H+G)(F+H)&lt;br/&gt;W075 HA.C(E+F)G&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here you will find a plaque on a large stone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First note your elevation in metres, round this number to the nearest 10 and divide by 10 (Answer Check: this should be an even number. Remember, when rounding to the nearset 10, both 75 and 84 round to 80).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now subtract (E+F+G). This digit is J.&lt;br/&gt;There are two 3-digit numbers on this plaque, K=the sum of the digits of both numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint 3&lt;br/&gt;===============&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint 3 is located at:&lt;br/&gt;N45 0J.(K/5)(K-6)(K/10)&lt;br/&gt;W075 21.J(K-6)(K-7)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, have a look around, then note your elevation in metres, round this number to the nearest 10 and divide by 10. This number is L. (Answer Check: this should be an odd number)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GROUND ZERO&lt;br/&gt;===============&lt;br/&gt;Ground Zero is located at:&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint 3 North coordinates - 0.00H&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint 3 West coordinates - 0.00L&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A Traditional Cache on the South Nation River&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Eric T. Casselman Dam (Chesterville Dam) was constructed in 1978 to replace an existing flashboard weir as part of an extensive South Nation River flood control and low-flow augmentation scheme. The dam is located near the town of Chesterville within Township of North Dundas and controls a total drainage area of 1050 km2. It consists of a 6-bay reinforced concrete structure. The purpose of the dam is to provide water supply for the Nestle Canada Inc. plant (now closed) and to provide flood control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2007, The South Nation Conservation Authority undertook a series of repairs to the dam. These included refurbishing the steel gate and surrounding control structure to remove rust and peeling paint, and repairing a major leakage problem that had been observed between the wooden stop logs and concrete sills at the bottom of the dam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dam is one of the most impressive spots to watch the spring thaw of the river as large chunks of ice make their way up the river. This thaw usually takes place in March, and I will post a note here to advise when this is happening. If you are not sure if it's worth the drive, I personally think it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a school nearby, so please be careful if driving to the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*** UPDATE March 28, 2009 ***&lt;br/&gt;Due to a muggling and  damage to the cache hide location, the container is now a small bison tube covered in camo-tape that should be muggle-proof. The only problem is that is may be cacher-proof as well. The diffculty has been updated appropriately. Look very closely at ground zero. The cache container can be detached for easy signing by using the clip at the container. PLEASE do not remove the anchor.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I've been learning to use all the neat stuff my GPSr can do. After a GA meeting where I learned about routing I decided I wanted to use some of these features to place a cache. This cache hide uses The Routing, Projecting, and Measure Distance features. These waypoints are theoretical only, there is nothing located there. 1. N45 17.028 W75 51.263 2. N45 17.081 W75 51.263 3. N45 17.081 W75 51.225 4. N45 17.135 W75 51.302 5. N45 17.081 W75 51.378 6. N45 17.081 W75 51.340 7. N45 17.028 W75 51.340 Plot these points and run a route through them. You can figure out the distance and and projection direction from what results. Good luck and have fun.

We told our avatar,the geo sheep he could put his wherever he would like, he wanted to make it tough to find to make up for all the difficult  ones that we had to trudge for hours through the woods for that contained no swag at the end.  We reached a compromise with the sheep; it's not a long hike into the woods or a swamp, but its a good camo job so happy hunting. Please bring your own writing tool, feed for the chickadees and watch out for muggles.</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache is filled with random gadgets, toys, trinkets and other stuff. I don't think any other details are necessary as the cache is pretty basic, and very easy to get to.&lt;br/&gt;If you're heading out in late summer or fall, I highly suggest bringing a bag or backpack to carry something home.

I saw this cache on Opencaching before it got published on Geocaching as well. I had planned to head out on my way home, as it's sort of on my way, but once it was on Geocaching.com as well, I knew I had to go. Good job on your first cache.

Signed the log,thanks for the cache!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Pretty simple multi. All waypoints are in this complex and can either be walked to or driven to. Waypoint markers are a ring with washers hanging from it. Use the washers to figure out the location of the next waypoint. You start at Waypoint 1. Waypoint 1: To get the distance of you projection from this waypoint, multiply 45.5 by the number of washers on the ring. To get your bearing for the projection from this waypoint, multiply 14.5 by the number of washers on the ring. (assume &quot;true&quot;) Waypoint 2: To get the distance of your projection from this waypoint' multiply 23.4 by the number of washers on the ring. To get your bearing for the projection from this waypoint, multiply 43.6 by the number of washers on the ring (assume &quot;true&quot;) This will bring you to the final location. Enjoy.
&lt;p&gt;All waypoints can be found easily any time of the year, but as it sits right now, the hide is hit or miss, depending on the weather. I plan to move the container, when I can, but for right now, I'll leave it up to you if you want to take the time or not.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, in a far away land, there
lived two beautiful princesses named Amy and Laura. If there were
two sisters more un-alike, I've never seen them. Where Laura was
the older, calmer one, Amy was not like that at all. Amy would try
anything daring. Although they are completely opposite, they are
also best friends. Here's their story. Now as anyone might guess,
even though they are best friends, they still like to get each
other into trouble from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it has been said that no matter what
Laura would say or do, Amy wouldn't be too far behind. One day
Laura thought, &quot;maybe I could play a little trick on Amy, maybe
something to get her into trouble&quot;. So she made a plan to do just
that. She made a gigantic mess in her room which she then blamed
Amy for. Her parent's weren't that easily fooled though. They knew
what Laura was up to so she was the one who got in trouble. Amy
found this very funny. Next, Laura went somewhere she wasn't
supposed to go. She convinced Amy to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well this plan backfired. Laura ended up
getting in more trouble than Amy. Amy did get in some trouble for
following her sister when she knew she shouldn't. They both learned
a valuable lesson from this. Both girls promised more kindness
towards each other in the future. As they ran off together hand in
hand, they started singing an old song they had learned when they
were younger. &quot;If one and two, where three or four. Would five be
six? Maybe seven? Not eight. Likely nine is zero.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

A double puzzle is when a puzzle must be solved to solve another
puzzle. Pretty obvious, no?
&lt;p&gt;I've made myself a little Double Puzzle from I sheet I found
when I was going through some old college notebooks. I don't
remember if it was part of the class, or if the class was that
boring but in any event, it has served a purpose now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have provided you with 10 sentences with the majority of the
sentence left out. Under one of the spaces in each sentence there
is a letter. This letter represents one of the digits in the
minutes portion of the Co-ordinates. What you need to do is figure
out what the sentence is, then use the appropriate letter to solve
the second puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems easy enough to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solve the puzzles below to find the Co-ordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a  very small portion of the original trail the Algonquin peoples once used for travel from  Black Rapids to Lake Deschêne. This area is very quiet due to its proximity to the cemetery please be respectful as you search for the cache. This is an area to be respected for its historical significance. Take a moment to imagine how it must have been hundreds of years ago. Keep an eye out for muggles at all times the trail is still used by the locals to cut through to the back neighborhood. Do not park in the cemetery, you can park around the block on Rockaway Cres, or on Southwood drive and walk over. Any spoiler photos or logs will be deleted. Photos of the logbook only are acceptable (not the cache)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The not recommended at night attribute has been added.

&lt;p&gt;(There is a different GC code written on the geocaching
Manifesto. Pay no attention to this number, it is for another cache
I'm working on and I grabbed the wrong manifesto when I loaded the
container.)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;So seeing as it is St. Patrick's day, I went over to visit my
friend Patrick O'Mason. He prefers Patty Mason, because to call him
Patty O'Mason, he says, makes him sound like a place you sit to
enjoy drinks. Anyway, that is neither here nor there.&lt;br /&gt;
I made my yearly trip out to my friend Patty's lodge and was
enjoying some fine refreshments with him when he got all
serious.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Can I show you something?&quot; He asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;It depends.&quot; I replied, kinda worried.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Not that, jackass.&quot; he said, and pulls out a piece of paper.&lt;br /&gt;
I was helping clean up some of my grandfather's stuff and I came
across this.&quot; he said, showing me a piece of paper with a bunch of
symbols on it.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;I think it's some kind of code.&quot; He said.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;No SH__.&quot; I said, and looked at the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've included a copy of the page, hoping that some of you out
there will be able to help us figure out what it says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**There is a small typo in the encryption, but it doesn't affect
the answer.**&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A little walk through this quite historic area will get you the information you need to find the cache.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Britannia is a neighbourhood and also a street in the west end of Ottawa, on the Ottawa River across from Aylmer. It was once a small cottage town to the west of Ottawa, but rapid growth in all directions during the 20th century meant that it was soon surrounded by the western suburb of Nepean. Larger, modern houses were built in between cottages. Nowadays it is simply an out-of-the-way part of west end of Ottawa, featuring among other things a dog-washing business, an elementary school, a movie theatre complex, a nature trail (Mud Lake), a beach, and a water filtration plant. The neighborhood has a mix of low and high income housing. The lower income areas of the neighbourhood are closer to Richmond Road and the more affluent areas are located near the yacht club at the north end of Britannia Road. Britannia retains some of its early cottage flavour, with a yacht club at the end of the road, and many older cottages living on as bungalows. The way it is surrounded by water, forest, and steep hills means that, with a bit of wildlife-conservation, Britannia will probably keep its reclusive appeal for many more years. The neighbourhood has a perhaps one of its kind 1967 EXPO style dome covering a local children's hockey rink that made it to the top 500 architecturally significant buildings in Canada in 2002 as voted by CIRA, and, is home of the annual Ottawa Folk Festival at Britannia Park. Its history includes a very large and popular canoe club from the turn of the century, which became the Britannia Yacht Club. Canada's only Gold medal winner from the 1936 Summer Olympics, Frank Amyot, paddled these waters in the 1920s and 1930's. The area became popular at the turn of the century because the Ottawa Gas and Electric company extended the trolley line and created an amusement park at Britannia beach to encourage users of the trolley system to use the system on weekends. A cottage and beach community resulted. Winding its way through the river front area is a bike path, which extends from Britannia some 12 kilometers to the Parliament buildings downtown. Today, there is probably no neighbourhood in Ottawa more mixed than Britannia forming a contrast with many of the homogenized satellite communities that have become Ottawa. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The cache is not at the given co-ordinates. This is a start point to collecting the information you will need to find the cache. From these co-ordinates, start heading south on Bradford. Look for historic designation plates on 2 of the houses. Divide 22.5 by the sum of the 2 house addresses, then subtract the result from the Posted Westing. This will give you the Westing at ground zero. Continue down Bradford to Silena. Head East. Continue to Britannia Rd. Head North. Now you will be looking for 4 of these plaques. Divide 30.744 by the sum of these 4 house numbers, then subtract the result from the starting Northing. This will give you the Northing for ground zero. Happy Hunting.

I liked this cache as it took me into an area I'd never been before - the fact there were historic plaques there to read just made it even better.  What a tolerant group of residents these villagers were, to see 35-ish people trampling through their picturesque corner of the world and still greet us with a wave.

babushka doll, is a set of dolls of decreasing sizes placed one

first name &quot;Matryona&quot;, and &quot;babushka&quot; is the Russian word for
grandmother.
&lt;p&gt;This cache is a twist on the traditional theme. Please be
careful when retrieving the log book and be sure to replace it the
way you found it so everyone can enjoy it. The log book is
&lt;b&gt;clearly&lt;/b&gt; marked as such. The notepads in the cache are
swag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now go to this location and make a projection to the final location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the picture you can see a bus stop. You will need the number of the bus that stops there. Multiply 5.55681 by the number of the bus to get your distance,(assume meters), and multiply 3.26136 by the number of the bus to get your bearing.(Assume True)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Round up, your answers should contain &lt;u&gt;no decimals&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

J'ai eu beaucoup de plaisir à résoudre cet énigme visuelle. J'aurais sans doute pu le faire sur place mais j'ai voulu utiliser GMSV et un autre site web [;)] pour évaluer la solution finale. 
Bien heureux d'avoir réussi à nous amener au PZ du premier coup [8D]!
