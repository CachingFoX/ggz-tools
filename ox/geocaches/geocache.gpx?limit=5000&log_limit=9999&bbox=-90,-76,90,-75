Se llega tomando una chiva o transporte particular desde Pereira, dirigiéndose hacia la florida en carretera pavimentada. Posteriormente se continúa hacia el cedral, aproximadamente 1 hora en carretera sin pavimentar. Una vez en el cedral se toma camino de herradura a pie alrededor de 2 horas hasta llegar a la pastora, donde se dispone de alojamiento, alimentación y zona de camping. El caché es un contenedor plástico de color verde biche.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Encuentre el árbol más grande de la pastora (aprox. 1.5 metros de diámetro). Camine 65 pasos en dirección a la cabaña de la zona de camping y después 20 pasos en dirección sur. Encontrará un árbol en forma de &quot;Y&quot;, busque en sus raíces el tesoro.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Ubicado en un sitio estratégico para ver el atardecer. Recomendado buscarlo entre las 4 pm hasta las 5:30 pm. Todo el trayecto se puede hacer en carro particular o servicio publico. La ultima parte se hace a pie, caminando 100 mts hacia un cerro desde donde se puede ver un hermoso atardecer. 

El punto más cercano corresponde a un pequeño establecimiento donde se puede hacer pesca deportiva y comer unas deliciosas tortas de chocolo. Ubiquese en el puente por donde pasa un pequeño río. 20 metros adelante del establecimiento mirando hacia el sur este, en la cima del primer cerro se encuentre el tesoro en un contenedor color verde biche. </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Al final del puente por donde pasa el riachuelo mire hacia el sur este camine 50 metros por la via carreteable y desviece a la izquierda pase sobre un pequeño obstáculo hacia el potrero y y siga el camino de herradura hacia la cima del cerro. Busqué a 1.50 mts de un arbol que ha sido cortado.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

A este lugar se puede llegar tomando un bus integrado al metro, (el q va para la escuela de ingenieria), antes de el alto hay una entrada por la cual se toma el sendero muy bien demarcado y luego de unos 45 minutos se llega al mirador #3 donde ademas de la hermosa vista encontraran un contenedor con un conejo (que viene del jardin botanico), un dado (que viene de juegos tradicionales), un mosqueton con brujula y un dinosaurio. espero q lo disfruten y q este permanezca alli un buen tiempo.</groundspeak:long_description>

Remember them as you explore this cemetery.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Cache is located in Cudworth Cemetery in Wanchese, NC.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Finding the various plots should be easy; there are waypoints attached to this page for your use.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is in a Cemetery, so remember to respect the area; stand up any fallen flags, and no caching at night.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As you explore you will find many Daniels, Tillett, Etheridge, and Williams plots; they are common names from this area.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
You will need to retrieve numbers from the head stones from four particular Military Men.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Steps of the cache will point them out.&lt;br/&gt;

You must sign the log to claim a find for this cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
No caching at night; your log will be deleted, if there is evidence that you attempted this cache after sundown. Some GPSr's have Sun/Moon Applications; if you are caching after sundown, even though it may not be 'dark', in my opinion, you are caching at night.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A family friendly cache with easy access and parking close to the cache. Expect a High Muggle Factor during summer months. Cache accessible all hours year round but night caching could bring official visitors with blue lights.

Located near a Manteo, NC, landmark that has been a favorite destination for visitors and locals since 1967.

Container is large enough for small Christmas related ornaments &amp; collectibles and could be a Travel Bug hotel. A very high Muggle Factor during summer months will make stealth necessary to retrieve/replace cache.

Staff does not know about the cache but if you get a chance please say hello to the owner Mr. Greene and thank him for giving permission to place this cache.

The Town of Manteo wraps around Shallowbag Bay on the eastern side of Roanoke Island, part of North Carolina's Outer Banks. Named the seat of government for Dare County in 1870, this waterfront community incorporated in 1899. Nearby attractions include a representative 16th century ship at Roanoke Island Festival Park, Roanoke Marshes Lighthouse, The Elizabethan Gardens, and Waterside Theatre, home to the nation's oldest outdoor symphonic drama, The Lost Colony.

Permission from land owner was granted for placement of this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Multi-Cache at a busy intersection frequented by some of the most
handy fix-it persons on the Outer Banks. Parking available although
at times finding a parking place might be a problem. However, with
a little patience a spot always opens up. High year-round Muggle
factor &lt;b&gt;WILL&lt;/b&gt; make &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;stealth necessary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt; to
retrieve/replace cache.

Coordinates listed are for the first of two stages. Both containers
appropriate for location with most cache materials from the
establishment where cache is hidden.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Coords should put you on the northeast side of a fence in or near a
parking lot with &lt;b&gt;NO NEED&lt;/b&gt; to go onto the bordering s/w
private residence property and you &lt;b&gt;DO NOT&lt;/b&gt; need to touch the
green telephone box while searching for this cache. First location
large enough only for the vehicle holding the coordinates to the
second but you may have to search a bit to find them.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CAUTION:&lt;/b&gt; This area could flood during adverse weather. Log
is in a plastic container for that reason so please make sure lid
is on tight. You should keep that in mind if leaving any tradables
or trackables.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Both points on busy through fares within a short walking distance
of each other. Cache should not be too difficult to find but with
Muggles everywhere cautious and surreptitious behavior will help
avoid drawing attention to you. Should any little Muggle eyes
observe you . . . the cache will be stolen! Once the cache has been
found feel free to take a stroll through town. It's a great place
for a walking tour with lots to see and a few famous people have
been seen around town.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Town of Manteo wraps around Shallowbag Bay on the eastern side
of Roanoke Island, part of North Carolina's Outer Banks. The seat
of government for Dare County since 1870, this waterfront community
incorporated in 1899. Nearby attractions include a representative
16th century ship at Roanoke Island Festival Park, Roanoke Marshes
Lighthouse. A couple of miles north are The Elizabethan Gardens and
Waterside Theatre, home to the nation's oldest outdoor symphonic
drama, The Lost Colony.&lt;br/&gt;

The nearby facility, staffed and managed by the Outer Banks SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), is concerned with the welfare of all animals including domestic, feral or wild. Many are homeless, lost or abandoned animals; primarily a large variety of dogs and cats. 


Responsibilities here include the sheltering of unwanted or stray dogs and cats; enforcement of State and County ordinances relating to the keeping, restraint, and humane treatment of animals; education of the public concerning responsible animal ownership and proper animal care; responsible placement of adopted animals; and the humane disposition of unwanted, unadopted, sick or injured animals. Because of pet overpopulation, four million cats and dogs—about one every eight seconds—are put down in U.S. shelters each year.


In the past, a shelter was more commonly referred to as a &quot;DOG pound&quot;, a term which had its origins in the impoundments of agricultural communities, where stray cattle would be penned up or impounded until claimed by their owners.

Some animal shelters euthanize animals not adopted within a set period of time; others have a policy of only putting down animals that are in distress due to age or illness.


Keep in mind that not only is this a busy place but the county gas pumps are right next door to the south, building maintenance is next door to the north, and the county detention center is right across the street. Muggles abound at all locations at all hours.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The home company for this
location produces 100,000 gallons of milk per day and sells 1.5
million gallons of ice cream annually with a product line that
features 48 flavors of ice cream, 33 varieties of milk and five

&lt;br/&gt;
There are five Dairy Cow Breeds:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Holstein&lt;/b&gt;   ~   Originating in northern Holland
with a distinctive black and white coloring, Holsteins are
considered “powerhouses” when it comes to producing
milk providing up to 150 lbs. (20 gallons) per day. Holsteins
outnumber all other dairy breeds in the U.S. and produce 90% of the
milk supply. The spotted markings on Holsteins are like
fingerprints. No two cows have the same pattern. Holsteins are one
of the largest dairy cattle breeds, weighing in at an average of
1200 to 1400 lbs. Their milk has a relatively low butterfat
content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jersey&lt;/b&gt;   ~   This short-horned dairy cattle
breed is the smallest of the dairy breeds with adults averaging 900
lbs. They are widely accepted to be the most efficient at
converting forage into milk. Unlike Holsteins, Jersey cows produce
milk relatively high in butterfat. Originating the English Channel
Island of Jersey, this breed is believed to have descended from
French cattle. A Jersey cow is usually a shade of fawn or cream,
but darker shades are possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guernsey&lt;/b&gt;   ~   Guernsey cows have a
distinctive tan and white coloring &amp; are relatively small with
an average weight of about 950 lbs. However, they produce more milk
per unit of body weight than any other breed. Originating on
Guernsey, another of the English Channel Islands, they are thought
to have descended from the cattle of nearby Normandy and Brittany.
Some dairy farmers looking for cows with excellent immunity to
disease and high milk quality select Guernseys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ayrshire&lt;/b&gt;   ~   The Ayrshire breed of dairy
cattle originated in Scotland in the late 18th century and were
introduced into the United States in 1837. They are medium-sized
and white mixed with red or brown in color. Ayrshires are excellent
grazers and good, consistent milk producers. Ayrshires were
formerly used as dual-purpose dairy and meat producers. Their
importance as a breed has declined, especially in favor of the
Holstein, but Ayrshires still remain popular in parts of the
U.S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brown Swiss&lt;/b&gt;   ~   Brown Swiss cows, which are
native to Switzerland, are one of the oldest breeds in existence.
While these cattle are classified as a dairy breed in the U.S.,
they are often considered a dual-purpose breed in other parts of
the world as they are heavier boned and thicker fleshed than the
cattle of other dairy breeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Road on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Muggle proximity
considered in the Difficulty Rating. Log only, BYOP.

Pawnbrokers may be our oldest
financial institutions with a history dating back to ancient
Chinese, Greek and Roman civilizations. The word pawn is derived
from a Latin word meaning pledge. Items are pawned to a Pawn Shop
broker as collateral, or pledges, for a cash loan.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Items pawned for a loan are held for a contractual time period. The
pawner can purchase an item back for the amount of the loan plus an
agreed-upon interest amount. Both the amount of time and rate of
interest are governed by law and a pawnbroker’s policies.
However, if the loan is not paid within the agreed time, the item
will be offered for sale to anyone. The defaulted loan is not
treported since the pawnbroker has physical possession of the item
and may recoup any loan value through an outright sale of the item.
That default can become a treasured find for another
customer.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Depending on local laws and business needs today’s Pawn Shop
services include secured loans to individuals, fee-based check
cashing, payday loans, vehicle title or house title loans, and
currency exchange services. Known primarily for lending money, some
pawnbrokers retail other valuable items including large collections
of unusual, antique and estate jewelry. You might find anything in
a Pawn Shop from art supplies all the way down to zebra
saddles.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Congratulations to Dakota J for the FTF. A long-time friend making
a career of getting there first.&lt;br/&gt;

Forty miles from Philadelphia, was (and still is) the little town of Greenwich, the principal settlement of Cumberland County in 1774. 
The Cohansey creek is a navigable stream of some size running through the county of Cumberland and emptying into the Delaware Bay. In the autumn of 1774, the quiet inhabitants along the banks of the creek were startled by the appearance of a British brig called the &quot;Greyhound.&quot; Sailing about four miles up the Cohansey, the brig stopped at the village of Greenwich, which was the first landing from its mouth. She was laden with a cargo of tea sent out by the East India Tea Company, which was undoubtedly under the impression that the conservative feelings and principles of the people of New Jersey would induce them to submit quietly to a small tax. The result showed that the temper of the people was little understood by the East India Tea Company.

Having found an English sympathizer, a Tory, as they were called, one Daniel Bowen, the Greyhound's crew secretly stored the cargo of tea in the cellar of his house. However, this unusual procedure was noted by the citizens who immediately appointed a temporary committee of five to look after the matter until a county committee might be appointed.

News of the Boston Tea Party had already reached Greenwich and the defiant example was regarded by many of the local settlers as worthy of their own contempt for the British. Fate now presented them with a ready-made opportunity to duplicate the act.

On the evening of Thursday, December 22, 1774, a company of about forty young Whigs, disguised as Indians, entered the cellar of Bowen's house. They took possession of the whole cargo, conveyed the tea chests from the cellar into an adjoining field, and piling them together, burnt them in one general conflagration.

Some off trail hiking required, but the growth wasn't too bad. 


A cache within a cache. There is an interesting story of the area near this cache. Inside the cache are some photos, you will need to answer the question in the cache in order to complete the find.

The original cache that used to be here was the first one that gave us a hard time. Simple you will say when you see it, but it was hidden so well it took us awhile to find. 
Nice place to relax and &quot;Recharge&quot; your batteries. You will see what I mean when you're on the platform. Keep your eyes peeled for fiddler crabs, bald eagles, and numerous other critters.

Easy walk on a paved surface. The only obstacle you have to contend with is a tree that is leaning over the path. Hopefully this will be removed soon.

6' accuracy when Cache was placed.</groundspeak:long_description>

geocache find. Not quite to the date but the same general area.
There was a cache near the parking lot called &quot;Sock Her&quot; by
lavarock that was my first find. Since then I have been hooked.
Thanks lavarock!&lt;br/&gt;
This cache should be a lot more muggle proof but might also be
geocacher proof. Well, we'll see. This container is about 4&quot; long
roughly and very, and I mean very, well camo'd which is the reason
for the overall 3.5 rating. Be sure to watch for muggles especially
if there is a ball game going on.&lt;br/&gt;



Please be sure to hide the cache EXACTLY as found to
ensure it's longevity from muggles. There is a pencil in the cache
but be sure to bring a pen in case it gets worn down.&lt;br/&gt;
Happy Caching! :)

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MMC : MICRO MASTERS CHALLENGE&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;


This &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Micro&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is part of a series of micros created
by some great hiders and creative micro makers of Southeast
Pennsylvania. There are a number of Micro Masters contributing to
this series, thanks to all of them. Find all individual micros,
enjoy the hides, the adventure and gather the clues from each and
find the final. Will you accept the
Micro Master's Challenge?



&lt;p&gt;Each micro is a unique work of art created and owned by each
Micro Master Team. In each cache there will be a clue that you must
gather and record. These clues will lead you to a final mystery
cache located somewhere in the SEPAG area. This series is bound to
challenge you, make you smile and reward you after every cache you
find. &lt;b&gt;Remember to write down the code from this
cache!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




Teams are allowed and encouraged! We recognize that caching
with a team is great fun but we also want to ensure that each
person joins the hunt for each micro before joining the hunt for
the final. You may also find these by yourself. Please follow all
the rules on each Micro Masters Cache page.
&lt;br/&gt;

A. American households purchase pickles every  _ _  days. 
B. More than  _ _  percent of all households eat pickles. 
C. Americans consume more than _ pounds of pickles per person annually.
D. Pickles are fat free and low in calories. An average-size dill contains only  _ _  calories.
E. Approximately 100,000 to 1 _ _ ,000 acres are devoted to growing pickling cucumbers in the United States.
F. They are grown in more than  _ _  states, with the biggest producers being California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, North and South Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin. 
G. On his voyage in 14 _ _ , Columbus not only discovered America, but gave peppers their name. In search of black pepper from the Orient, he assumed the spicy pods used to flavor foods in America were a form of black pepper and mistakenly called them &quot;pimiento,&quot; or pepper. Actually, the plants are not related at all. 
H. Pickle Packers International has its own official limerick and theme song - the Pickle Polka. The pickle got its name in the  _ _ 00's when English speaking people mispronounced William Beukelz' name - he was a Dutch fisherman known for pickling fish.
I. Good pickles have an audible crunch at  _ _  paces. This can be measured at &quot;crunch-off&quot; using the &quot;scientific&quot; device known as the Audible Crunch Meter. Pickles that can be heard at only one pace are known as denture dills. 
J. During WWII the U.S. Government tagged  _ _  percent of all pickle production for the ration kits of the armed forces.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A Little History
Eeny, &quot;meanie&quot;, miny, moe, which can be spelled a number of ways,
is a childrens counting rhyme, used to select a person to be &quot;it&quot;
for games and similar purposes. The rhyme has existed in various
forms since the 1850s, or perhaps earlier, and is common in many
countries.
Many stories exist about the &quot;real&quot; meaning of the first line,
although the most commonly accepted theory is that they are just
nonsense syllables.
The American version:
Eenee, Meenee, Mainee, Mo!
Catch a tiger by the toe!
If he hollers let him go!
Eenee, Meenee. Mainee, Mo!
You are it!
Controversial alternative versions of this poem replace the word
tiger with the N...... word, which in the eyes of some has tainted
the rhyme entirely. Rudyard Kipling's version which replaced the
word tiger with the N...... word was the most commonly recited
version in the United States and Canada until as late as the early
1970s when school aged children became aware of the political
incorrectness of the poorly-aged wording. The word &quot;tiger&quot; soon
became the standard, as parents were quick to correct their
children not to use the &quot;N&quot; word.
Excerpt from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.You can find the cache after a short hike from the parking lot.
I saw three deer while I was there. They practically walked right
up to me. I hope your so lucky! Happy caching!

&lt;b&gt;MMC : MICRO MASTERS CHALLENGE&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;


This &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Micro&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is part of a series of micros
created&lt;br/&gt;
by some great hiders and creative micro makers of Southeast&lt;br/&gt;
Pennsylvania. There are a number of Micro Masters contributing
to&lt;br/&gt;
this series, thanks to all of them. Find all individual
micros,&lt;br/&gt;
enjoy the hides, the adventure and gather the clues from each
and&lt;br/&gt;
find the final. Will you accept the&lt;br/&gt;

border=&quot;0&quot;&amp;gt;Micro Master's Challenge?
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each micro is a unique work of art created and owned by
each&lt;br/&gt;
Micro Master Team. In each cache there will be a clue that you
must&lt;br/&gt;
gather and record. These clues will lead you to a final
mystery&lt;br/&gt;
cache located somewhere in the SEPAG area. This series is bound
to&lt;br/&gt;
challenge you, make you smile and reward you after every cache
you&lt;br/&gt;
find. &lt;b&gt;Remember to write down the code from
this&lt;br/&gt;
cache!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;

 width=&quot;100&quot; /&amp;gt;
Teams are allowed and encouraged! We recognize that
caching&lt;br/&gt;
with a team is great fun but we also want to ensure that each&lt;br/&gt;
person joins the hunt for each micro before joining the hunt
for&lt;br/&gt;
the final. You may also find these by yourself. Please follow
all&lt;br/&gt;
the rules on each Micro Masters Cache page.

&lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;From the cemetery to the sanitarium,
enjoy the sanctuary on the hill above the Booming Valley&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The History:&lt;/b&gt; In the late nineteenth century the
Centennial Springs Hotel was erected on the Klapperthal side of
Neversink Mountain. The hotel was never a financial success and in
1909 was purchased for use as a Tuberculosis Sanitarium. With no
cure for the disease many people opted to spend their final days in
the resort like settings of the TB Sanitariums. &lt;a href=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/log/f6bff5ad-b4c6-45db-a42b-00bfef2a7e45.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;This voluntary quarantining, more
than any other factor, helped stem the spread of the disease.
Eventually penicillin reduced the need for the Sanitariums, but its
invention wasn't in time to save my great uncle who died in the
Berks County TB Sanitarium in the late 1920s. Not much information
remains about the sanatorium on Neversink mountain - but some of
the original foundations have survived. If you follow the
waypoints, this cache will act as a mini tour of Reading's &quot;other
mountain&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/log/1dee2125-6e9d-43a3-8554-34f7560cc9bc.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Hike:&lt;/b&gt; The recommended approach to the cache is from
the Klapperthal/Forest Hills side though the mountain is covered in
usable trails. Follow the red blazed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berks-conservancy.org/Portals/0/pdf/NMPbrochure_1mb.pdf&quot;&gt;
Upper Glen Trail&lt;/a&gt; and head for the primitive trails when you get
to The Pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Hide:&lt;/b&gt; The cache is a small &quot;fuse can&quot; painted for
camouflage. Nothing needs to be moved to find it but given the
surroundings it could be difficult to spot. Bring a flash-light.
You don't need it to find the cache but it could come in handy to
explore the fountain pond &amp; original hotel cellar. Are those
meat hooks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache location borders private property. Please approach GZ
from the South and do not venture up the hill to the East or climb
on top of the structure. Protect our right to public property by
respecting their right to private property. Thanks, be safe and
enjoy the hunt!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Berks County Conservancy allows the public to hide
geocaches on land it protects provided they ask for approval. We
will provide the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/b56e1a07-77fc-47dd-b42d-5e68a2805fb1.jpg&quot;&gt;Approved Geocache&lt;/a&gt;&quot; logo and ask that it is
included with the description. For a copy of our Gecaching Policy
and Regulations pertaining to our properties please &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berks-conservancy.org/&quot;&gt;contact our
office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;R116ZND - Centennial Pond&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 19.173 W 075° 53.446&lt;br/&gt;Though it looks as though it may have been a flooded foundation, this is the remains of a decorative pond that dates to late in the days of the Sanitarium. Lots of frogs to see (and hear) when the weather is warm.&lt;br/&gt;R216ZND - Spring House&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 19.151 W 075° 53.324&lt;br/&gt;This was most likely part of the Denglers Glen Hotel which burned in 1931. This natural spring house has been restored. It's cool inside even in the heat of the summer. Look around for the old Hotel foundation and the outline of &quot;Mirror Lake&quot; which was actually a small pond.&lt;br/&gt;R316ZND - Neversink Mountain Railroad Trestle&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 18.940 W 075° 53.500&lt;br/&gt;At one time the Neversink Mountain Railroad ran all around the mountain. Connecting trains brought passengers and tourists from neighboring towns &amp; cities. When the last of the hotels went out of business in 1917 the railroad closed up shop as well. The remnants of this trestle and many rail beds can still be found along the mountain.&lt;br/&gt;R416ZND - Klapperthal Road Trailhead&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 18.882 W 075° 53.545&lt;br/&gt;This is the official trailhead &amp; parking for the hike. There's room here for 5 or 6 vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;R516ZND - Forest Hills Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 18.810 W 075° 53.545&lt;br/&gt;For overflow parking, you can enjoy a trip through Forest Hills cemetery. The pond at this spot is just down the hill from the original Klapperthal Park Pavilion. </groundspeak:long_description>

east, covered with a small bit of bark. Please rehide as well as
found or better. It should make a nice, easy first find for any
budding geocachers. There is a playground, basketball court, sand
volleyball court, and lot of other amenities nearby.

&lt;p&gt;This cache can be for one of two things, depending on your
situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two other caches in this park, as of this posting. One
is easy to find but hard to get to. The other is easy to get to but
hard to find. So this cache is here for those of us who came here
but couldn't find one or both other caches, or decided not to
attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you could view this cache as a bonus to coming
out to this park to find the other two caches. This way, you'll
definitely walk away with something!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Congrats!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Please stop at the Nature Center and pickup a trail map if you are new to this area.  This area was low income housing when I was growing up and I was never allowed to venture back into this area.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You could always see the dam from the road, but today was the first day I could get a closer look at it.  The location of the cache is not the closest point to the dam, but I did not learn that little fact until after I placed the cache.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The parking area is N 40 20.847 W 75 29.024&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is one of a series of pill bottles for your caching pleasure. Some are grounded, some are not, others are just _______? and all are fun so . . . HAVE FUN!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please replace this cache as you found it and then take some time to look around and enjoy this beautiful area.</groundspeak:long_description>

nice playground and pavilions for picnicking. Just next door you'll
find a community pool and a carousel, subject to seasonal and
hourly availability.

I came to this park with my family for a little friend's birthday
party. After swinging on a big swing for a while with my daughter
and looking around, (and having gotten over the shock of not seeing
a cache already listed at this park) I decided to share this park
with others and place a small cache. If you're able, bring the kids
along to play nearby while you search for the cache, then have a
picnic lunch under the nearby pavilions. You'll find parking close
by as well.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Congrats!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A park without a cache, how could it be? I had to rectify this
situation immediately! I found the perfect spot a short walk from
the parking area.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
This beautiful little park overlooks the Tohickon Creek, which
feeds into the Delaware River. The park has a 1/3 mile nature trail
with many scenic and serene places to stop and ponder. Picnic
tables are by the bridge. Point Pleasant is a quaint little town
with several things to see and do. Bed and Breakfasts abound in
this area, and if you're in the mood (and season) you can find
someplace to rent a canoe, kayak or innertube down the
Delaware.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Congrats!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Allentown's first opencache and hopefully more to follow. This cache is hidden under the big 78 bridge. You are seeking a regular size lock and lock with a notebook, pen, some items for trade, and a $5 bill for FTF.

Cache area is the Lehigh Parkway. There is a lot of good crushed stone paths for walking and biking. Also a lot of dirth paths off the main path for walking. There are many things to see including; old hunters cabin, covered bridge, and other old structures.

Best parking can be had at the covered brige area parking lot (N40º 34.104   W75º 29.920). Then cross the covered bridge (to the side where hunters cabin is on) and walk down the path less then 1/2 mile.

Closer parking can be had at (N 40° 33.907   W 075° 30.321) but may be more difficult to find the parking area for non-locals. If you chose this parking lot, cross the bridge and walk for about 5-10 minutes to the cache.

Cache should not be a hard find and shouldn't be easily found by non-cachers. Please use the hint if needed. Beware of mugglers walking on the trail. Please hide same or better then found.   
.
Cache is hidden at (N 40 33.984   W 75 30.242)   </groundspeak:long_description>

With its beautiful vistas (Pinnacle, Pulpit Rock, Dan's Pulpit), great hiking trails (Appalachian, Valley Rim, Sand Spring, Tom Lowe), world famous Hawk Mountain Sanctuary bird refuge, and geologic wonders (River of Rocks, Blue Rocks) there is much to see and do. In fact, it would be a shame to come here and not enjoy Mother Nature's gift to us! So...let's go for a hike...a long hike.

To claim this cache, you will need to lace up your hiking boots and prepare to spend the entire day (or weekend) on the trail and in the woods. This is a six stage multi-cache that will take past the Pulpit Rock, the Pinnacle, Dan's Pulpit, the Balancing Rocks and the Tri-County Marker. You can easily take a detour to visit Hawk Mountain Sanctuary and the River of Rocks. In all, you will hike over 18 miles (most of it in Berks County but some in Schuylkill and Lehigh). If you decide to park at the Hamburg Reservoir and hike to the cache and back, your hike will be approximately 30 miles. This is not a &quot;stroller friendly&quot; cache.

Obviously such a long hike necessitates an abundance of caution. Take plenty of water, food, water, map &amp; compass, water, flashlight, water, rain gear, water, extra socks and some more water. This is a difficult hike. There are two 1000'+ inclines and much of the trail is very rocky. You may be wise to complete the cache over a weekend and camp along the trail. There are two shelters along the way and several campsites so pack your tent and a bear bag.

None of the individual stages are very difficult to find. If you are willing to hike so far, we hope that you will come away with a smiley. Please note that we may move the final cache and some of the other stages from time to time. If you decide to do this cache in stages, please post a note so that we don't move the stage you are on. No hints should be necessary but we recommend that, with the exception of the first stage, you follow the Appalachian Trail even if your GPSr is telling you otherwise. The AT will get you within a quarter mile of each stage.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Enjoy great hike starting at Hawk Mountain's North Lookout. Total distance is 5-6 miles.

Cache is an ammo can just outside the boundary of the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary.

This is a multistage cache that requires you to project four different waypoints. The listed coordinates will take you to the North Lookout.

From there you will need to project the following waypoints (all are true north).
1) 67 degrees for 0.58 miles.
2) 68 degrees for 0.42 miles.
3) 70 degrees for 0.75 miles.
4) 140 degrees for 164 feet.

You do not have to leave the Skyline Trail (blue blazes) until the final stage. Please use the hints below to be sure you are on the right track. One degree off over 1.75 miles will have you looking in the wrong place.

There is trail a fee charged by the Sanctuary. If you do not want to pay, you can hike in the Appalachian Trail to the North Lookout and backtrack to the cache. The cache was designed to have you start at the North Lookout. If you use the hints and the AT, you can actually avoid making the full hike. That wouldn't be fun. If you do this please state as much in your log.

The distance from the North Lookout to the cache is about two miles and the trail is rated as &quot;difficult&quot;. You will need to keep both hands free in order to climb down. Bring water and binoculars and enjoy the views.</groundspeak:long_description>

This series could have 2 (two) meanings.

1. The Big Bang Theory is an American sitcom. The stereotyped geeky and socially awkward scientists characters are a bit overdone but I have seen each type but never together.

2. Making a Big Bang. These caches are near 3 (three) fireworks stores. The stores are at the last exit before the NJ state line (4 miles), where even sparklers are illegal. To make a purchase you enter the Pa door or the other states door and show your ID. In the other states side of the store you can buy sparklers, firecrackers, rockets, etc. So with NJ ID you can buy all you want and drive 4 miles and be home.

This was the last find for us of the Big Bang series.  It is not in the stores, but you can park there and walk across.  Thanks Teeretoon, my son and I had a good time finding.  Looking forward to some more in our area.  Anyone else searching these will have a nice time and they are all easily accessible, plus food and gas stops nearby.</groundspeak:text>

This series could have 2 (two) meanings.

1. The Big Bang Theory is an American sitcom. The stereotyped geeky and socially awkward scientists characters are a bit overdone but I have seen each type but never together.

2. Making a Big Bang. These caches are near 3 (three) fireworks stores. The stores are at the last exit before the NJ state line (4 miles), where even sparklers are illegal. To make a purchase you enter the Pa door or the other states door and show your ID. In the other states side of the store you can buy sparklers, firecrackers, rockets, etc. So with NJ ID you can buy all you want and drive 4 miles and be home. So who is looking the other way for a buck?</groundspeak:long_description>

Now this one was a little tricky, missed it the first time I looked at it, then walked around looking at other spots nearby, until my son looked again at it an yelled to me I was loosing it.  It is not a bottle this time.  Enjoy the piece of gum, hopefully you'll get to it before it goes stale.  for a small cache not sure why people are leaving things, but what the hey, moist towelette and a push pin and now a piece of gum.  Getting hard to close it.</groundspeak:text>

A P&amp;G camoed pill bottle. Lowest gas price in the area acroos the road.

Route 31 is a highway in New Jersey, United States. It runs 49 mi from Trenton, north to an intersection with U.S. Route 46 in Buttzville.

The highway was constructed from 1926 to 1935. It was known as Route 30 between 1927 and 1953, when it was renumbered to Route 69 to avoid conflicting with U.S. Route 30 in southern New Jersey. It was renumbered to Route 31 in 1967 due to sign theft that resulted from the sexual meaning of the number 69.

Note that the area is closed at sundown.

The cache is located near the old Portland School.  The Portland School bell tower is a familiar sight atop the &quot;school hill&quot;, and many local people received at least part of their public school education in this building. Erected in 1886, the building originally housed all grades through high school. Portland High School graduated students until 1947, when the building was converted into an elementary school serving Portland and parts of Upper Mount Bethel Township. After becoming part of the Bangor Area School District in 1958, the building was used until the opening of the Five Points Elementary School in 1969. It now serves as the Portland Municipal Building.  The Portland Gymnasium and a playground is also on this site.

Placed with Portland Borough Council permission.</groundspeak:long_description>

When we saw that it had been archieved we just had to place one here.  Hopefully the muggles will leave this one alone.  Remember your camera; a great photo shot.

The Portland-Columbia Pedestrian Bridge (or as its formally known, The Portland-Columbia Toll Supported Pedestrian Bridge) is a footbridge that crosses the Delaware River, at Portland, in Upper Mount Bethel Township, Pennsylvania, connecting to Columbia, in Knowlton Township, New Jersey. The bridge is owned and operated by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission. 
A vehicular bridge had been located at the site of the present bridge since 1869. The original structure was a four-span timber bridge with wooden arches which was covered by a wooden shed with a slate roof.
As of December 1, 1953, the bridge on the site was closed to vehicular traffic, which was shifted to the new Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge, built one-quarter mile downstream of the old bridge.
In August 1955, during the remnants of Hurricane Diane, three of the four spans of the timber bridge washed away. Hurricane Diane was the wettest hurricane to ever hit the North American continent and caused record flooding throughout the northeastern US, but particularly the Delaware River watershed.
Starting in 1957, the bridge was reconstructed as a four-span steel girder bridge system with concrete piers.</groundspeak:long_description>

At one time there were four Delaware River crossings at and near Portland Pa; The DRBC bridge for auto traffic, the DRBC foot bridge, the Lehigh &amp; New England Railroad and The Lackawanna Cutoff.  All but one still stands!  The Lehigh &amp; New England Railroad crossed the Delaware River in Portland, PA on a single-track combination deck-truss/deck-girder bridge. This bridge was dismantled in 1966 but there still remain three piers.  You will find the cache near one of these piers.  The initial cache container was an ammo box it was changed on 6/1/11 to a small cache container.  The cache includes a FTF Geocoin prize and a bag of goodies to trade.  Please replace as found this is a high traffic area with many mugglers.</groundspeak:long_description>

Parking is available at either end of the walking trail but is closer to State Route 233 (west end).


Now for some house rules: IF THERE ARE ONLY 3 TBS INSIDE : please take a TB only if you leave a TB. Otherwise, please just log your visit. IF THERE ARE MORE THAN 3 TBS IN THE RESORT: please feel free to take a TB even if you don't have a TB to trade. I just want to make sure there are at least 3 TBs here at any one time since I don't want the resort to go out of business. I also don't want this resort to be a TB prison and I want to keep the TBs moving hence the flexibility in the house rules.

There are 5 TB guests in the resort on its Grand Opening Day so the innkeeper put up a &quot;Vacancy&quot; sign. Spread the word that this TB resort is now open for business!</groundspeak:long_description>

I was in Morrisburg a few weeks ago, and was hoping to find some caches. There were none! I decided to scout out a spot to hide one myself, and found this spot on a beautiful moonlit night. This can be a very high muggle area, so please do your best to be discreet.

The cache container is a small bison tube but is not visible. The anchor is visible but difficult to see. I was able to retrieve the cache without using any tools, but a rudimentary tool may make retrieval easier. Please do not remove the anchor. The cache container can be detached from the tether to make signing the log easier. 

Bring your own pencil. When replacing the log, roll it up and put it in the cap, then slide the body of the container over the log.

Have Fun! </groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is the first in a series of caches along the South Nation River. The South Nation River meanders through Eastern Ontario originating northeast of Brockville and draining into the Ottawa River north west of Plantagenet.

The first waypoint in this cache is interesting as the road where it is located has just recently been updated in mapping data and now finally appears correctly in Google Maps mere decades after the road was moved from it's previous location. The maps on Geocaching.com and Garmin Mapsource are still incorrect.


WAYPOINT 1
==================
At the start coordinates, you will find a plaque commemorating the building of &quot;The West Bridge&quot;. Note the year that the bridge was opened. This number is ABCD

Ground Zero
=================
Ground Zero is located at:

N 44 56.267 + A.BCD
W075 30.314 - A.BCD

The cache container is a camouflaged pill bottle that contains a variety of small items, log and a pencil. Please leave the pencil for others to sign the log.

Small trades only, please.

This cache is the second in a series of caches along the South Nation River. The South Nation River meanders through Eastern Ontario originating northeast of Brockville and draining into the Ottawa River north west of Plantagenet.

The cache is not located at the start coordinates, but starting at the parking location, go to the gate. On the gate, you will find a year. Add a decimal to make this year a number in the form A.BCD.

Ground Zero
=========================
The cache is located at 

N 44 56.738 + A.BCD
W 075 29.557 - A.BCD

The cache is a camouflaged 1KG peanut butter jar.

This cache was set up as an example of a traditional cache in the woods for the second &quot;GeoCaching for Families&quot; event put on by me at the South Mountain Library on June 13, 2009. It is a camouflaged 1½ litre mayonnaise jar.

This cache is located near the new South Mountain library building that is under construction at the time of placement of the cache. This building is the result of years of dedicated work by the Friends of The South Mountain Library, a massive community fund raising drive and relentless lobbying of township council.

If you are here when the library is open, stop in and say hi to our friendly librarians and let them know you are geocaching. They know all about it.

This cache is the third in a series of caches along the South Nation River. The South Nation River meanders through Eastern Ontario originating northeast of Brockville and draining into the Ottawa River north west of Plantagenet.

This cache was placed for the &quot;Geocaching for Families&quot; event that I put on at the South Mountain library Saturday May 10, 2008. A few newbies were introduced to Geocaching and their finds were logged under my daughters (JuJiBug) account. 

WARNING: The area south of Ottawa has been inundated with Wild Parsnip and there is quite a lot of Wild Parsnip at this cache site. Do not crash around in this stuff, as the sap will burn your skin when exposed to sunlight. Washing is sufficient protection. For more info on Wild Parsnip see http://dnr.wi.gov/wnrmag/html/stories/1999/jun99/parsnip.htm I learned this first hand a few years ago. Trust me on this one. Pictures are in the image gallery to aide in identification.

 
Waypoint 1
===============================
At the posted coordinates, you will find a memorial to an immigrant to the area. Note the county where this person came from. Where A=1, B=2, C=3 etc. add the numbers of the letters of the county name, and square the answer. This number is ABCD. 

Answer check
==================
The Digital root of the answer is 9.

Ground Zero
==================================
Ground Zero is located at:

N 44 57.845 + A.BCD
W 075 28.556 - A.BCD

The cache container is a camouflaged 2.7 litre Lock-Lock style container. There is lots of room for larger trades, so go crazy.

This cache is the fourth in a series of caches along the South Nation River. The South Nation River meanders through Eastern Ontario originating northeast of Brockville and draining into the Ottawa River north west of Plantagenet.

WARNING: The area south of Ottawa has been inundated with Wild Parsnip and there may be quite a lot of Wild Parsnip at this cache site. Do not crash around in this stuff, as the sap will burn your skin when exposed to sunlight. Washing is sufficient protection. I learned this first hand a few years ago. Trust me on this one. Pictures are in the image gallery to aide in identification. For more information go to http://dnr.wi.gov/wnrmag/html/stories/1999/jun99/parsnip.htm 

The posted coordinates are the location of a plaque commemorating the building of Baldwin's Bridge. The year on the plaque is ABCD. The tag with the minutes of the final cache location is on the ACth post from the end of the guardrail. But from what end? Find the letters to form a two-letter direction found in the fourth word of the organization that provided assistance for the project.

Assume N45 and W075 and assume the bridge is on a north-south road.

The cache container is a camouflaged 500ml peanut butter jar. There is not too much room for large trade articles. At time of placement, it contained a few key chains and some other small items.

This is the first GeoCache that we have placed.

It is located at a small little-known park on the banks of the South Nation River. There are picnic tables, and lots of room for kids to run. There is parking at the start coordinates. Take time to look around at the historic information found on rocks in the park.

Waypoint 1
=======================================
At the start coordinates, you will find a plaque titled &quot;The Fence&quot; which has 2 years on it. The earliest year is AAAA. The later year is BBBB.

Waypoint 2
=================================
The second waypoint is at:

N 45 02.076-AAAA
W 075 20.228+BBBB

At the second waypoint, you will find a plaque with a 4-digit year. This number is CCCC. The Lot number on the plaque is DD. The concession number is E.

Ground Zero
==================================
Ground Zero is located at:

N 45 02.044-CCCC
W 075 21.943+EDD

The cache container is a camouflaged 1 kg peanut butter jar.

This cache is the fifth in a series of caches along the South Nation River. The South Nation River meanders through Eastern Ontario originating northeast of Brockville and draining into the Ottawa River north west of Plantagenet.

I have only recently discovered this location along the South Nation River, but it has become one of my favourite places. It is very quiet, and the river is beautiful. The cache is named after the sign at the east end of the bridge that I found quite amusing. My &quot;Are You Nuts - GC17A2T&quot; cache is a short drive away down a beautiful old country road.

Many thanks to Model12 for alerting me to this location.

The cache container is a camouflaged 600 ml Rubbermaid drinking bottle. Please replace the container to ensure that the safety cable is hidden.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The bridge is not passable by car. Approach from the east to avoid backtracking.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

the coming of 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the spring my brother, Hooligansx2,
gave me a couple of containers that he thought might be good cache
containers. I have had them bumping around in my geo-bag since
then. On New Year's Eve, I finally got around to gluing a rare
earth magnet to it and put in a log. I wanted to put it out then,
but got sidetracked.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is a quick park and grab cache, and is meant only to celebrate
the arrival of 2011.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The tracks near the cache are no longer in use, so do not be
concerned, but Van Buren Street is still very much in use, so keep
a handle on your smallish-humans. In a winter with significant
snow, this cache may be difficult to find. The start of 2011 was
snow-free however.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Happy New Year, Good luck and have
fun!&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A traditional cache in Kemptville's Ferguson Forest Centre

This cache was placed for the Ferguson Forest Centre Spring CITO Event. Saturday April 25, 2009 from 10:00am to 12:00pm.

This cache is along a pretty trail in the Centre and takes you by a beautiful pond and through a pretty wetland area. The last few metres are a modest bushwhack, and you will have to choose your footing carefully. As I was heading to this cache location, I was serenaded by dozens of Spring Peepers, trying to woo mates. That's where the name of the cache comes from.

The spring peeper is a small frog species, attaining an adult size between 0.75 inches (19 mm) and 1 inch (25 mm) long. They have a dark cross on their backs roughly in the shape of an &quot;X&quot;, though sometimes the marking may be indistinct. Females are lighter-colored, while males are slightly smaller and usually have dark throats. This frog has a vocal sac located by its throat, which expands and deflates like a balloon to create a short and distinct peeping sound. Only males have the ability to make this loud high-pitched noise, and they use it to attract mates. This creature lives in wetlands, marshes, and pond or swamp regions in order to support the aquatic environment the larvae need. The Spring Peeper breeds between the months of March to June, and deposits around 900 eggs that are hidden under vegetation or debris at the water base. After hatching, they transform into frogs and are ready to leave the water in about eight weeks.

home of the Inkerman Rockets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Inkerman Rockets were founded in
1942 by school teacher Lloyd LaPort, who worked at the elementary
school in the village.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Laporte, originally from Collingwood, Ontario enjoyed hockey and
built a rink in the schoolyard for the children to use. He
eventually purchased some hockey sweaters and entered a team in the
Winchester Town League. From these humble beginnings the Rockets
eventually became one of the top junior teams between Ottawa and
Cornwall. The Rockets had twins Erwin &amp; Edwin Duncan and Leo
Boivin leading them against teams from much bigger centers. Leo
Boivin played professional hockey for the Toronto Maple Leafs and
the Boston Bruins.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
One of the teams greatest accomplishments was during the 1951-52
season when they almost made it to the semi-finals of the Memorial

As I was out looking for locations for some new caches for the CITO of October 3, I found this trail. It seemed like it wasn't getting too much traffic, so may be a candidate for some maintenance on the 3rd.

This is a nice simple cache just off the trail.

This cache was placed for the Ferguson Forest Centre Spring CITO Event. Saturday April 25, 2009 from 10:00am to 12:00pm.

This cache is along a pretty trail in the Centre and gives a nice view of Kemptville creek. It is currently a bit wet on the trail, but still quite walkable.

The Kemptville Creek is a tributary of the Rideau River, located in North Grenville township in Leeds and Grenville County within Eastern Ontario, Canada. The Kemptville Creek is 63 kilometres (39 miles) in length and flows through several communities, including Kemptville, Ontario, Oxford Mills, Ontario and Bishop's Mills, Ontario. The creek was historically referred to by the name &quot;South Branch of the Rideau River&quot;, until its name was changed to &quot;Kemptville Creek&quot; in 1908.

This cache was placed for the Ferguson Forest Centre Spring CITO Event. Saturday April 25, 2009 from 10:00am to 12:00pm.

This cache is along a pretty trail in the Centre that opens out into a beautiful stand of tall pines. The forest floor is covered in a soft bed of pine needles. The approach from the south can be a bit mucky, so watch your step.

Pines are among the most commercially important of tree species, valued for their timber and wood pulp throughout the world. In temperate and tropical regions, they are fast-growing softwoods that will grow in relatively dense stands, their acidic decaying needles inhibiting the sprouting of competing hardwoods. Commercial pines are grown in plantations for timber that is denser, more resinous, and therefore more durable than spruce (Picea).

Mountain Township was a rural farming township with a rich history. It was comprised of farmland and 4 villages, Mountain, South Mountan, Inkerman and Hallville. Thanks to the Ontario government's massive push for almalgamation of municipalities, it ceased to exist on January 1, 1998, as it became part of North Dundas Township. 4 days later, the area was hit with a massive ice storm. Authorities still claim that was a coincidence...

With a name like Mountain, the relative flatness of the township is often the butt of jokes. The township was not named for any geological feature, but in fact was named after the Right Reverend Jacob Mountain (1750 - 1825), the first Protestant Bishop of Quebec.

This cache is placed in a still active cemetery northwest of Inkerman.

This cache is placed in an old cemetery in the former community of Vancamp. The cemetery is still cared for, but some of the stones are showing serious signs of deterioration. The only thing I have been able to learn about Vancamp is that the post office opened here in 1877 under the care of Byron Vancamp. Before this date it was known as Vancamp Mills. There was also a cheese factory in the town.

I was out hiding a couple of new caches for the Fall CITO in Ferguson Forest Centre, and found this interesting spot. I knew this was where I needed to hide a cache for the event. The terrain rating will vary dramatically depending on the time of year that the cache is visited. If you are visiting at one of the times when the bridge is necessary, you may be inclined to sing the following song.

    I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay. 
    I sleep all night and I work all day.
    I cut down trees. I eat my lunch. 
    I go to the lavatory. 
    On Wednesdays I go shoppin' 
    And have buttered scones for tea

I have stopped there to keep this a family cache and to avoid questions like, &quot;Daddy, what does that mean?&quot;</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is the seventh in a series of caches along the South Nation River. The South Nation River meanders through Eastern Ontario originating northeast of Brockville and draining into the Ottawa River north west of Plantagenet.

This cache is located at a picnic area and boat launch on Highway 31. If you have done other caches in the series, you will likely notice that the river is starting to become noticeably larger than at the caches closer to South Mountain. Depending on when you visit, you may be able to stop in at the nearby cheese shop.

You are looking for a camouflaged 1kg peanut butter jar. Please replace the cache as you found it and Have Fun!</groundspeak:long_description>

I came across this location while doing a cache in the area last fall. The irony was not lost on me, and I thought that I had to put a cache nearby. This is it. Do not be afraid that this cache will take any longer than a traditional. The final location is within 250m of the posted coordinates. Feel free to pick up any trash on your way out, though you may need help with some items...

This cache was placed in conjunction with the Ferguson Forest Centre CITO event that took place Saturday morning April 25, 2009.

At (or near) the posted coordinates, you will find an official sign that has 3 numbers on it.

The first number is a dollar figure, and you should call the first digit A.
The second number has 2 digits, and you should call them BC.
The third number has 4 digits, and you should call them DEFG.

The next part turns things upside down a bit [:)]

The digit H is the digit F turned upside down.
The digit I is the digit D turned upside down.

The cache is located at:
N45 G(B+1).(I-1)(A-1)(D+2)
W075 (B+D)F.H(A-1)(C-1)

Have Fun! When placed, the cache had lots of kid-friendly SWAG. There is a micro bison tube cache container for the first to find.

I discovered that Winchester had no Geocaches and I felt that that was a situation that simply needed to be rectified, so here you go. Winchester's First Cache now in 3D!

This is a simple multi with no brain twisting math at all, I promise. The one twist however is that you need to use your elevation to find the cache, hence the 3D. The area near the posted coordinates is a good place to park, and all waypoints are within 500m of this spot, so there is no need to drive. 

Waypoint 1
==============
At the posted coordinates, find the sign and determine the year the Lion's Club started.
This number is ABCD.

Nearby at the Pool, there is a sign describing the trees that the Winchester Waves Swimming Club donated to the park.

E=Number of Autumn Purple Ash
F=Number of Shade Master Locust
G=Number of Emerald Queen Maple
H=Number of Green Mountain Sugar Maple

Waypoint 2
===============
Waypoint 2 is located at:
N45 (B-D-A)(C-A).(E+F+G)(H+G)(F+H)
W075 HA.C(E+F)G

Here you will find a plaque on a large stone.

First note your elevation in metres, round this number to the nearest 10 and divide by 10 (Answer Check: this should be an even number. Remember, when rounding to the nearset 10, both 75 and 84 round to 80).

Now subtract (E+F+G). This digit is J.
There are two 3-digit numbers on this plaque, K=the sum of the digits of both numbers.

Waypoint 3
===============
Waypoint 3 is located at:
N45 0J.(K/5)(K-6)(K/10)
W075 21.J(K-6)(K-7)

First, have a look around, then note your elevation in metres, round this number to the nearest 10 and divide by 10. This number is L. (Answer Check: this should be an odd number)

GROUND ZERO
===============
Ground Zero is located at:
Waypoint 3 North coordinates - 0.00H
Waypoint 3 West coordinates - 0.00L

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A Traditional Cache on the South Nation River

The Eric T. Casselman Dam (Chesterville Dam) was constructed in 1978 to replace an existing flashboard weir as part of an extensive South Nation River flood control and low-flow augmentation scheme. The dam is located near the town of Chesterville within Township of North Dundas and controls a total drainage area of 1050 km2. It consists of a 6-bay reinforced concrete structure. The purpose of the dam is to provide water supply for the Nestle Canada Inc. plant (now closed) and to provide flood control.

In 2007, The South Nation Conservation Authority undertook a series of repairs to the dam. These included refurbishing the steel gate and surrounding control structure to remove rust and peeling paint, and repairing a major leakage problem that had been observed between the wooden stop logs and concrete sills at the bottom of the dam.

This dam is one of the most impressive spots to watch the spring thaw of the river as large chunks of ice make their way up the river. This thaw usually takes place in March, and I will post a note here to advise when this is happening. If you are not sure if it's worth the drive, I personally think it is.

There is a school nearby, so please be careful if driving to the cache.

*** UPDATE March 28, 2009 ***
Due to a muggling and  damage to the cache hide location, the container is now a small bison tube covered in camo-tape that should be muggle-proof. The only problem is that is may be cacher-proof as well. The diffculty has been updated appropriately. Look very closely at ground zero. The cache container can be detached for easy signing by using the clip at the container. PLEASE do not remove the anchor.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Apple of my eye is a very easy cache, with a sweet surprise at the cache location (season dependent).

A pretty easy cache, just something we wanted to put out to get back into geocaching. Cache is filled with random gadgets, toys, trinkets and other stuff. I don't think any other details are necessary as the cache is pretty basic, and very easy to get to.
If you're heading out in late summer or fall, I highly suggest bringing a bag or backpack to carry something home. (You'll understand when you get there). Cache is placed in a location where it is less likely to be stumbled upon, but will bring you past many prime spots. </groundspeak:long_description>

had a tough time, had some GPS issues, telling us we were on the spot, but the dot on the map didn't match. When we finally got it all refreshed, and to the correct spot we STILL couldn't find it... After a few minutes of looking, there is was :) A great way to spend the day :)</groundspeak:text>

I saw this cache on Opencaching before it got published on Geocaching as well. I had planned to head out on my way home, as it's sort of on my way, but once it was on Geocaching.com as well, I knew I had to go. Good job on your first cache.

Signed the log,thanks for the cache!

This is supposed to be a terrain 1. Approach it from the parking lot side, not the other side.

There's not much to this one. Use your geosense, and watch out for muggles!

Good thing we didn't approach it from the other side of the fence, at least without a canoe!  A bit damp.  After here, we also found a delicious greek restaurant and had a spot of lunch.  (Well, the restaurant wasn't delicious - a bit too much mortar for my taste - but the food inside certainly was...)

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A matryoshka doll, also known as a Russian nested doll or a
babushka doll, is a set of dolls of decreasing sizes placed one
inside the other. &quot;Matryoshka&quot; is derived from the Russian female
first name &quot;Matryona&quot;, and &quot;babushka&quot; is the Russian word for
grandmother.
&lt;p&gt;This cache is a twist on the traditional theme. Please be
careful when retrieving the log book and be sure to replace it the
way you found it so everyone can enjoy it. The log book is
&lt;b&gt;clearly&lt;/b&gt; marked as such. The notepads in the cache are
swag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose your approach carefully!&lt;/p&gt;

Alternate &quot;always FREE&quot; parking can be found at the RA Centre off
Riverside Dr. if the Vincent Massey parking lot is charging a
parking fee.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Please! There is no need to cross the train tracks! There is a
