This very busy location makes it tricky to place or retrieve the cache without being noticed so stealth is necessary.  As with all our caches this is a small swap and log cache hidden from prying eyes.&lt;br/&gt;Happy 12th birthday Chynna!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Difficult cache to find, search the garden beds near the beach entrance for a tree with tall roots.  Try to camouflage the cache with leaves or bark when replacing.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

It is also opposite the Tyagarah Air Strip where light planes come and go, and you will often see parachutists slowly floating back to earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cache has room for small swaps. You'll need a pen ( i forgot to put one in it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest area is accessable to both north and southbound travellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Kyogle is a small town in rural Northeast NSW. Primarily a beef, timber and dairy area and until a year or so ago had a large plywood factory. Unfortunately a tragic fire destroyed the plant and forced many locals out of work. The town is a gateway to many National Parks and State Forests that lead to a few great caches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache situated in town at the local lookout will hopefully attract a few travellers to experience the inland road while travelling. Follow the lookout signs opposite the hospital and wind your way to a view over the whole town and outlying countryside. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once at the lookout you have two choices,&lt;br/&gt;1.	Walk the remaining 300 metres up a steep track&lt;br/&gt;2.	If you have a 4wd, drive to within 20 metres of the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The track is well defined and has been used recently, however, be warned it is steep and fairly well rutted. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A great spot to bring the kids and spend an enjoyable day.&lt;br/&gt;The kids can enjoy the Animal fun park, see over 150 native and farmyard animals or enjoy a game of mini golf.&lt;br/&gt;A great spot to stop and take a break from the highway.&lt;br/&gt;I placed this cache to replace the &quot;Airmen and the soldier&quot;. A multi-cache placed in memorial to an avaition accident during the 2nd World war that occurred on the Cane fields just East of this location. However this created the problem of people crossing the very busy Pacific Highway. Now we have a relatively easy traditional cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache itself is a Magnetised Eclipse container and is attached to the very noticable icon proudly guarding the castle. Reaching the cache shouldn't provide any problems. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Many years ago, the North Coast of NSW was once covered in a magnificent rainforest called the Big Scrub. These days unfortunately, due to widespread land clearing there are but a few pockets remaining. As a result much of our native flora and fauna have disappeared. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area where we have placed this cache is currently under re-vegetation. Located on the Eastern outskirts of Lismore but still in the middle of Suburbia, this great park is ideal for a lazy afternoon stroll. The park consists of 4 areas. &lt;br/&gt;1.	The bird Sanctuary&lt;br/&gt;2.	Platypus park&lt;br/&gt;3.	Richmond Birdwing butterfly gully&lt;br/&gt;4.	Children playground&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The walkway winds its way beside the creek and over several causeways and bridges. There are quite a few entrances to the park so we will leave that up to you to find the best way in to enjoy all the sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep an eye out for the magnificent Birdwing butterfly. One of the largest butterflys in Australia with a wingspan of up to 15cm. Unfortunately it is also one of the rarest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small to medium sized container in an area that may be a bit tricky due to the tree cover. It is also recommended to bring insect repellent as the mosquitos can be rather thick. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Couldn't get it at first, realiased I had dropped writing stick at previous cache so wandered back to retrieve then returned to try again....

Little bit of walking  - brain &amp; eyes kicked into gear &amp; there was that pesky rock I had been unable to see earlier..

Who said 13 is an unlucky number. Being born on a Black Friday I can not afford to be superstitious. Been there before so knew where I needed to be. Without the difficulty of rain it was an easy cache to find. A muggle family on bikes and scooters and with a pram chose the time I arrived to use the slope on either side of the causeway as a skate board style play area. Mum and dad caught up soon and all left the site.

Thanks Walden Clan. Another one right on my doorstep. It is a great park. Found @0830 today. Lots of water hens but no platypus. This may well be Paddy's release point when my travel bug dog tags arrive.
