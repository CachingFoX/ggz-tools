            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is our first cache hidden on our favourite island, Ko Bulone&lt;br /&gt;Lae. To find the cache, you have to leave the beautiful white sand&lt;br /&gt;beach, cross the small village and get to the small Mango Bay,&lt;br /&gt;which is populated by Chao Lae fishermen. It is better to seek the&lt;br /&gt;cache on low tide! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to use a mosquito repellent, because there are lots&lt;br /&gt;of those hungry insects in the rubber tree plantation and in the&lt;br /&gt;wood which you have cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will be doing cache maintenance about every 1-2 years, beside&lt;br /&gt;this we have a local fisherman having an eye on the cache and we&lt;br /&gt;are also glad for your information about the cache!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Some months ago I tried to go for the two caches on this island. Fortunately there was no ferry at this time and we ended up on other islands which we enjoyed more than Koh Bulone now - and found othere caches of course ;-) Now, on the second attempt, we took the speed boat from Koh Lipe and found the island full of trash, generator noise, smell of burning rubbish and mosquitos. Therefore, after a firs try to go to the cache during high tide, we decided to stay only one night on this island. But I didn't liked to leave whit a proper attempt to get this two promising boxes. After a nap, less than two hours before sunset, I went in a rush back to the Mango Bay and out for the caches. I found them both quickly and in good condition. After I went back immediately as I didn't want to get struck in the dark. But I was faster than expected and the whole trip was done in roughly a houer. Now I feel a bit sad that I didn't  enjoyed this great spot longer. But it was a amazing cache run any way! Thanks a lot for this great experience!

And for everyone who now hesitates to go ther: The next day we feel lazy and just moved closer to the White Beach wher it is more quite and has less mosquitos - and stayed two more days... To me it is still not the nicest isand I visited, but whit it's very different spots and cozy places definitely worth a cache run ;-)</groundspeak:text>

A &quot;normal&quot; car could make the trip without too much effort (except perhaps getting a bit dusty), so perhaps a 4x4 or motorcycle/mountain bike would be more appropriate. There may be mud during the rainy season, but the cache site should not be affected.&lt;br/&gt;The cache itself is located a stone's throw from the roadside.&lt;br/&gt; Note:  This cache is listed elsewhere so you may not be the first to find.</groundspeak:long_description>
