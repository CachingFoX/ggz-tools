Should be an easy find.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I spent a few days as a guest at the nearby resort community and
was surprised at how far I had to go just to grab a few
caches.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This area has some good places to stash a cache so I decided to
place one. I went to the &quot;Outlet&quot; stores and got some great swag
then loaded up a spare ammo can I had in the trunk of my car.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The overhead power lines my throw the signal off a bit, but you
should have no trouble locating the hiding spot.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please hide the cache so that it is not in plain view of the people
that pass by. Please trade fairly. I placed items in the cache that
children would enjoy finding. Please keep with a family friendly
theme.

This cache is placed just before (or after - depending on which way

hiking the trail, make sure you look for the heart cactus to score
bonus points.&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;
 It is between this cache and Big E!'s HC The Turn cache. There are
so many cool and interesting sites along the trail. ENJOY!</groundspeak:long_description>

Cedar City has designated routes for your ATV'ing pleasure. One of
these fine routes leads you through the TUNNEL. &lt;br/&gt;
Check out the city map page &lt;a href=&quot;http://cedarcity.org/DocumentView.asp?DID=337&quot;&gt;Cedar ATV
Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 Have an enjoyable time exploring the area and you might want to
bring &quot;waders&quot; or other protective footwear.
&lt;br/&gt;
Okay really &quot;Waders&quot; aren't necessary, but wear shoes that can get
a little dirty. You will see what we mean when you are there.&lt;br/&gt;
This tunnel is sooooo FUN.&lt;br/&gt;
 Counting would be helpful.&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Remember to use Stealth!&lt;br/&gt;
So what I mean by that is have an alibi ready, especially if it is
taking some time to locate.&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;We stumped the local die-hard cachers on this one, so we moved
the dificulty level up. It is findable, it just might
      take some time. ---ENJOY----&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this cache is here to keep an eye on

UPDATE 2008&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;I guess WE as well as the city of ENOCH
jumped the gun on this......it looks like this is just not the
place for commercial development.

Why Would I........take the chance to get my foot stuck in an animal hole?

&lt;p&gt;JUST FOLLOW the Dominguez and Escalante Trail, just south of the
Thermo Hot Springs, watch for the orange trail markers. Close any
livestock gates you open. And please stay on the TRAIL. There is no
need to drive off road.&lt;/p&gt;

 
&lt;p&gt;Did ya hear, just south of the Thermo hot springs. So maybe you
should go to the Thermo cache first!!!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of us are familiar with the Spanish Trail in this
area....... So here is a little pearl of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominguez and Escalante's group was just north of Cedar City,
Utah, the expedition determined that moving straight west would
bring them directly to Monterey. But now snowstorms and freezing
temperatures began to dampen the spirits of the explorers to the
point of despair. So far, the hardships of exploring a strange land
had been overwhelming. They nearly died of thirst in blistering
heat and lived under the constant threat of attack by unknown
Indians. When the cattle they'd brought had all been consumed, they
were forced to eat their mules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on October 10,1776, when they stopped near Cedar City and
were staggered by a blizzard, Escalante and Dominguez, concerned
with a lack of supplies and the approach of winter, decided to turn
back to Santa Fe. Dissension over this decision led the Fathers to
put the matter in the hands of the Almighty and CAST LOTS, which
confirmed their decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Expedition continued southward instead of heading west.
Before they crossed the Virgin River near present day Toquerville,
Utah, they discovered fields of corn and signs of irrigation, but
no farmers. These Paiutes were the only Indians noted by the
explorers who had progressed beyond seed gathering and small game
hunting. Obstacles on the return trip were, if anything, worse than
those encountered earlier. Freezing in alternating snow and cold
rain, the expedition made its way south and east; twice they were
stopped by cold so frightful they could only huddle around fires to
survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their provisions ran out 6 days after the CASTING OF THE LOTS.
If the LOT had said &quot;Monterey&quot; they would have starved to death in
the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the area, and bits of history.&lt;/p&gt;

Going &quot;in the hole&quot; is the railroader term for when a lower priority train has to wait in a siding for a higher priority to pass. On May 28th 2011 we were stuck in Hogup siding waiting for the Z train to go by. I had time to go for a little walk and drop a geocache. FYI: If you are not a railroader: There is no need to get close to the railroad tracks to find this cache and if trains or maintainance workers are close please stay away from the tracks and trains.

While you are there check out the unregistered benchmark just east of the GZ.
The terrain difficulty is due largely to the remoteness of this cache. Please prepare accordingly.</groundspeak:long_description>

Greenough Park covers about 50 acres of mature cottonwoods, ponderosa pines, dense vegetation and clean, clear water of Rattlesnake Creek. More than 120 species of birds have been spotted in Greenough Park, yet many people walk right by them, unaware of their intriguing habits and striking beauty. On a typical day from April to September, the average visitor will be able to see dozens of species of birds. The City of Missoula established the Arnold Bolle Birdwatching Trail to provide people with an opportunity to learn about the birds which inhabit this ecosystem, as well as to observe them in their natural environment.

&lt;b&gt;Cache Description: The Stages --&lt;/b&gt;
This Multi cache will take the visitor along the &quot;Bolle Birdwatching Trail.&quot; Begin at the 'Infomation Sign'; this is waypoint 'A'. Head across both of the footbridges to the west where you'll encounter the next waypoint, 'B'. Follow the trail clockwise all the way around, stopping at each information plaque to gain the required answer, in order to determine the final cache container location (the coordinates below are for reference). The plaques are listed sequenctially all the way through to 'H'.

&lt;b&gt;Cache Description: The Clues --&lt;/b&gt;
Waypoint 'A' -- N 46 52.481 W 113 58.796 - As a full-fledge bird fanatic, you should be able to see 16+ bird species along the Bolle trail. 1 + _ = A

Waypoint 'B' -- N 46 52.493 W 113 58.846 - This bird walks underwater? _ + 3 = B

Waypoint 'C' -- N 46 52.588 W 113 58.691 - This birds favorite food is a fruit produced by the mountain ash? 9 - _ = C

Waypoint 'D' -- N 46 52.680 W 113 58.647 - With a distinctive red-colored crest, these birds can only be seen in Greenough Park from May to September? _ + 0 = D

Waypoint 'E' -- N 46 52.758 W 113 58.467 - These birds survive almost completely on fish? 7 + _ = E

Waypoint 'F' -- N 46 52.756 W 113 58.419 - The family of these small, insect-eating birds belong to are warblers? _ + 6 = F

Waypoint 'G' -- N 46 52.640 W 113 58.528 - This bird, which feeds on small birds, mice and large insects is America's smallest falcon? 5 + _ = G

Waypoint 'H' -- N 46 52.511 W 113 58.772 - This bird, interpreted by Henry David Thoreau as saying &quot;Maids! Maids! Hang up your tea-kettle-ettle-ettle!&quot; will repeat its song as many as 4,800 times a day? _ + 7 = H

&lt;b&gt;** The Key: True = 1 / False = 2 **&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Cache Description: The Final Coordinates --&lt;/b&gt;
N 46 5A.BCD
W 113 5E.FGH

&lt;b&gt;The Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;
This 1-mile/1.2 km trail begins at the posted coordinates, and makes a complete loop. Half of the trail is paved, while the other winds through part of the wooded area on hard-packed dirt.The entire trail is on nearly flat and level ground; there are five footbridges to cross.The entire loop can be negotiated with a stroller.

&lt;b&gt;The Container --&lt;/b&gt;
A small, round container; accessible during all seasons.

&lt;b&gt;Other Information --&lt;/b&gt;

Running Eagle Falls is a sacred location to the Blackfoot People. It was named for a woman warrior, respected for her great skill in battle, her generosity, and wisdom.

The falls are one area known to be used by Running Eagle (Pitamakan) for her vision quests. Just as she came here for her guidance and strength, people today are still renewed by the beauty of the falls.

Sometimes referred to as &quot;Trick Falls,&quot; these falls have a unique attribute that is not commonly witnessed. In the spring, water flowing down the creek from Two Medicine Lake rushes over the upper fall, so thick and heavy that the lower fall is completely hidden. Later in summer, as flows decrease, the water changes course and begins to flow almost exclusively out of the lower fall. 

&lt;b&gt;The Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;
Flat gravel path.

&lt;b&gt;Logging Requirements --&lt;/b&gt;
To log this Virtual, locate the information plaque near the parking area that relates the story of Running Eagle, as told in both Blackfeet and English. Find the name of the person who provided this story and enter their first and last names as the Code Phrase.

&lt;b&gt;Other Information --&lt;/b&gt;
- This is a Virtual lisiting, there is no container hidden at the posted coordinates. 
- This location is on property managed by the US National Park Service.
- This is an opencaching.com only listing.

The Many Glaciers area is what many people who come to the park expect to see: clear lakes, high-rising mountain peaks, glaciers, fields of wildflowers and wildlife. Dominated by Swiftcurrent Lake, Mount Grinnell, Mount Wilbur, Mount Henkel and Altyn Peak, the Many Glaciers area is a favorite destination for visitors. Many Glaciers Lodge, built in 1914-1915, is the largest lodge in the Park and sits along the shore of Swiftcurrent Lake. It was built in the European Swiss Alp style.

Many of the hiking opportunities in the Many Glaciers area will get visitors out into some of Glacier's most spectacular scenery: Grinnell Glacier, Iceberg Lake, Ptarmigan Falls, and Granite Chalet can all be accessed from this area. 

Many Glaciers is also sometimes referred to as &quot;Many Bears&quot; because of the number of grizzly bears visitors are able to view. It is important to be very aware of bears in this area, as they often use the trails to move around the valley.
