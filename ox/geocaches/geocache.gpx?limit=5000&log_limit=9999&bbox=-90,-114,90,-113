ago. I was coming back from a winning weekend in Laughlin and
pulled over to find a nearby cache. The car wouldn't start when I
was ready to leave. No cell reception. Dead battery. What a
nightmare. I no longer have that car, by the way.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This should be a quick one for you to stop and find. You should not
have to jump any fences.

This is a short walk to the cache. Most of the walk will be a simple stroll but when you get near the cache the terrain will change. Be careful when looking for the cache.

This cache is placed just before (or after - depending on which way
you come) from THE DROP on the Hurricane Canal Hiking Trail. When
hiking the trail, make sure you look for the heart cactus to score
bonus points.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
 It is between this cache and Big E!'s HC The Turn cache. There are
so many cool and interesting sites along the trail. ENJOY!</groundspeak:long_description>

Or you could try it from the other end.... &lt;br /&gt;
Explore the area and enjoy. &lt;br /&gt;

Cedar City has designated routes for your ATV'ing pleasure. One of
these fine routes leads you through the TUNNEL. &lt;br /&gt;
Check out the city map page &lt;a href=&quot;http://cedarcity.org/DocumentView.asp?DID=337&quot;&gt;Cedar ATV
Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Have an enjoyable time exploring the area and you might want to
bring &quot;waders&quot; or other protective footwear.
&lt;br /&gt;
Okay really &quot;Waders&quot; aren't necessary, but wear shoes that can get
a little dirty. You will see what we mean when you are there.&lt;br /&gt;
This tunnel is sooooo FUN.&lt;br /&gt;
 Counting would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;b&gt;I guess WE as well as the city of ENOCH
jumped the gun on this......it looks like this is just not the

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;PLEASE don't make this one harder than it really is.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JUST FOLLOW the Dominguez and Escalante Trail, just south of the
Thermo Hot Springs, watch for the orange trail markers. Close any
livestock gates you open. And please stay on the TRAIL. There is no
need to drive off road.&lt;/p&gt;

 
&lt;p&gt;Did ya hear, just south of the Thermo hot springs. So maybe you
should go to the Thermo cache first!!!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of us are familiar with the Spanish Trail in this
area....... So here is a little pearl of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dominguez and Escalante's group was just north of Cedar City,
Utah, the expedition determined that moving straight west would
bring them directly to Monterey. But now snowstorms and freezing
temperatures began to dampen the spirits of the explorers to the
point of despair. So far, the hardships of exploring a strange land
had been overwhelming. They nearly died of thirst in blistering
heat and lived under the constant threat of attack by unknown
Indians. When the cattle they'd brought had all been consumed, they
were forced to eat their mules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on October 10,1776, when they stopped near Cedar City and
were staggered by a blizzard, Escalante and Dominguez, concerned
with a lack of supplies and the approach of winter, decided to turn
back to Santa Fe. Dissension over this decision led the Fathers to
put the matter in the hands of the Almighty and CAST LOTS, which
confirmed their decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Expedition continued southward instead of heading west.
Before they crossed the Virgin River near present day Toquerville,
Utah, they discovered fields of corn and signs of irrigation, but
no farmers. These Paiutes were the only Indians noted by the
explorers who had progressed beyond seed gathering and small game
hunting. Obstacles on the return trip were, if anything, worse than
those encountered earlier. Freezing in alternating snow and cold
rain, the expedition made its way south and east; twice they were
stopped by cold so frightful they could only huddle around fires to
survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their provisions ran out 6 days after the CASTING OF THE LOTS.
If the LOT had said &quot;Monterey&quot; they would have starved to death in
the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the area, and bits of history.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You will need to drive a dirt road in; UNPASSABLE in wet conditions.  (Unless you like mud bogging)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of us are familiar with the Spanish Trail in this area.......  So here is a little pearl of history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dominguez and Escalante's group was just north of Cedar City, Utah, the expedition determined that moving straight west would bring them directly to Monterey. But now snowstorms and freezing temperatures began to dampen the spirits of the explorers to the point of despair. So far, the hardships of exploring a strange land had been overwhelming. They nearly died of thirst in blistering heat and lived under the constant threat of attack by unknown Indians. When the cattle they'd brought had all been consumed, they were forced to eat their mules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So on October 4,1776, when they stopped near Cedar City and were staggered by a blizzard, Escalante and Dominguez, concerned with a lack of supplies and the approach of winter, decided to turn back to Santa Fe. Dissension over this decision led the Fathers to put the matter in the hands of the Almighty and CAST LOTS, which confirmed their decision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the Expedition continued southward instead of heading west. Before they crossed the Virgin River near present day Toquerville, Utah, they discovered fields of corn and signs of irrigation, but no farmers. These Paiutes were the only Indians noted by the explorers who had progressed beyond seed gathering and small game hunting. Obstacles on the return trip were, if anything, worse than those encountered earlier. Freezing in alternating snow and cold rain, the expedition made its way south and east; twice they were stopped by cold so frightful they could only huddle around fires to survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their provisions ran out 6 days after the CASTING OF THE LOTS. If the LOT had said &quot;Monterey&quot; they would have starved to death in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the area, if you can.  Don't get burned and make sure you read the sign(if you can).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;** Utahjack was FTF here on 5/09/06 **</groundspeak:long_description>

If it is muddy it's easy to get stuck out here, but you probably know that all ready. Be careful out here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Going &quot;in the hole&quot; is the railroader term for when a lower priority train has to wait in a siding for a higher priority to pass. On May 28th 2011 we were stuck in Hogup siding waiting for the Z train to go by. I had time to go for a little walk and drop a geocache. FYI: If you are not a railroader: There is no need to get close to the railroad tracks to find this cache and if trains or maintainance workers are close please stay away from the tracks and trains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you are there check out the unregistered benchmark just east of the GZ.&lt;br/&gt;The terrain difficulty is due largely to the remoteness of this cache. Please prepare accordingly.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The cache is not in a hole, but in a little pocket of the rock. Should be easy enough to find.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

More than 120 species of birds have been spotted in Greenough Park, yet many people walk right by them, unaware of their intriguing habits and striking beauty. On a typical day from April to September, the average visitor will be able to see dozens of species of birds. The City of Missoula established the Arnold Bolle Birdwatching Trail to provide people with an opportunity to learn about the birds which inhabit this ecosystem, as well as to observe them in their natural environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Description: The Stages --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Multi cache will take the visitor along the &quot;Bolle Birdwatching Trail.&quot; Begin at the 'Infomation Sign'; this is waypoint 'A'. Head across both of the footbridges to the west where you'll encounter the next waypoint, 'B'. Follow the trail clockwise all the way around, stopping at each information plaque to gain the required answer, in order to determine the final cache container location (the coordinates below are for reference). The plaques are listed sequenctially all the way through to 'H'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Description: The Clues --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint 'A' -- N 46 52.481 W 113 58.796 - As a full-fledge bird fanatic, you should be able to see 16+ bird species along the Bolle trail. 1 + _ = A&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint 'B' -- N 46 52.493 W 113 58.846 - This bird walks underwater? _ + 3 = B&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint 'C' -- N 46 52.588 W 113 58.691 - This birds favorite food is a fruit produced by the mountain ash? 9 - _ = C&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint 'D' -- N 46 52.680 W 113 58.647 - With a distinctive red-colored crest, these birds can only be seen in Greenough Park from May to September? _ + 0 = D&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint 'E' -- N 46 52.758 W 113 58.467 - These birds survive almost completely on fish? 7 + _ = E&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint 'F' -- N 46 52.756 W 113 58.419 - The family of these small, insect-eating birds belong to are warblers? _ + 6 = F&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint 'G' -- N 46 52.640 W 113 58.528 - This bird, which feeds on small birds, mice and large insects is America's smallest falcon? 5 + _ = G&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waypoint 'H' -- N 46 52.511 W 113 58.772 - This bird, interpreted by Henry David Thoreau as saying &quot;Maids!

It was named for a woman warrior, respected for her great skill in battle, her generosity, and wisdom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The falls are one area known to be used by Running Eagle (Pitamakan) for her vision quests. Just as she came here for her guidance and strength, people today are still renewed by the beauty of the falls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes referred to as &quot;Trick Falls,&quot; these falls have a unique attribute that is not commonly witnessed. In the spring, water flowing down the creek from Two Medicine Lake rushes over the upper fall, so thick and heavy that the lower fall is completely hidden. Later in summer, as flows decrease, the water changes course and begins to flow almost exclusively out of the lower fall. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flat gravel path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Logging Requirements --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this Virtual, locate the information plaque near the parking area that relates the story of Running Eagle, as told in both Blackfeet and English. Find the name of the person who provided this story and enter their first and last names as the Code Phrase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Information --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- This is a Virtual lisiting, there is no container hidden at the posted coordinates. &lt;br/&gt;- This location is on property managed by the US National Park Service.&lt;br/&gt;- This is an opencaching.com only listing.&lt;br/&gt;- Glacier National Park has a high concentration of grizzly bears - use caution while hiking on this trail and make noise.&lt;br/&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Cache Description --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Many Glaciers area is what many people who come to the park expect to see: clear lakes, high-rising mountain peaks, glaciers, fields of wildflowers and wildlife. Dominated by Swiftcurrent Lake, Mount Grinnell, Mount Wilbur, Mount Henkel and Altyn Peak, the Many Glaciers area is a favorite destination for visitors. Many Glaciers Lodge, built in 1914-1915, is the largest lodge in the Park and sits along the shore of Swiftcurrent Lake. It was built in the European Swiss Alp style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the hiking opportunities in the Many Glaciers area will get visitors out into some of Glacier's most spectacular scenery: Grinnell Glacier, Iceberg Lake, Ptarmigan Falls, and Granite Chalet can all be accessed from this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many Glaciers is also sometimes referred to as &quot;Many Bears&quot; because of the number of grizzly bears visitors are able to view. It is important to be very aware of bears in this area, as they often use the trails to move around the valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/manyglacier.htm&quot;&gt;National Park Service Website - Many Glacier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Terrain -- &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flat, paved trail with stairs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Logging Requirements --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this Virtual, find the interpretive sign located between the parking area and Many Glaciers lodge. This sign discusses the history of Many Glacier Lodge; along the top is a phrase that entitles this plaque. Enter this title as the Code Phrase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Information --&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;- This is a Virtual lisiting, there is no container hidden at the posted coordinates. &lt;br/&gt;- This location is on property managed by the US National Park Service.&lt;br/&gt;- This is an opencaching.com only listed cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The following log MAY sound a little whingy, and to be honest, it is... I was cold!
This one took me a while to find, and by the time I did, my hands were extremely cold!  Had a hard time opening the cache and once I did I knew I was in a spot of trouble as the log was rolled VERY tightly inside the container and to get it back in would be a chore.  Signed messily with my almost frozen pen and tried with frostnipped fingers to re-roll the log to fit in the container, but had to march back to the car to warm up the digits and get the log back inside.  Once in, I returned to the scene of the crime but could not for the life of me find the top!!  Finally I found it am carefully replaced the container where I had found it.  
After seeing these ones published, I failed to see that all of them were micros and after this experience and a DNF on another of the series, I decided I would not hunt the rest until it warms up a little.  Also, I missed the FTF on this one by an hour and assumed I would not get the FTF on the others, so there was no rush to find them today!
My hands were so happy to not be outside anymore (I had spent the whole week working outdoors this week and they did not want to have to play in the cold any longer) and they quickly warmed up and were much happier with a coffee instead of cold snow and metal.
Thanks for the series and bringing me out to the area!  Hope to find the rest after the world warms up a little more!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The central Alberta area has been plagued by a number of suspected alien abductions in recent months. All remain unexplained, and few if any gained media attention. This series of caches commemorate these unfortunate souls, and further investigation may bring answers to the mysteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first abduction, a 1.5 litre plastic camoflaged container containing a log, pen, and assorted small tradables. Please return and hide well, this is a much muggled area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yuri and Yo Mai slipped away from the other students at the College. They had their secret place, and all the “little extras” the two foreign students needed for the evening. The other students may not understand, but this moment together, alone together, was important to them both.&lt;br/&gt;Away from the lights, they walked together into the gathering darkness. Yuri carried the blanket they kept for just these moments. Yo Mai, in Chinese fashion, carried the bag of treats they secreted from the other students. She followed close by Yuri’s side, feeling him near in the gathering darkness. They walked on into the trees.&lt;br/&gt;Others watching them go were not surprised. The young Russian student was quiet and unassuming. Yo Mai was more outgoing and widely liked. And as different as the two were, they seemed drawn together by a common need. They were drawn thus frequently. As they disappeared through the spruce into the darkness, the other students smiled, nudged and quickly went back to their own entertainments.&lt;br/&gt;The walk was steep, but not long. They stepped carefully on the narrow trail, close enough to touch, back and forth across the switchbacks, close enough to hear each other’s breath. But they did not speak. They knew where they were going.&lt;br/&gt;The trees closed in around them, shutting out the distant college sounds, and the street lights from over the hill side. They could hear the water as they approached. They could see the moon start to shine through the small breaks in the clouds, looking much like a blurry face in a wide tumble of sheets. The warm evening enveloped them. The moisture from the lake soothed them. The small shine on the water welcomed them to their special place.&lt;br/&gt;Yuri spread the blanket in the accustomed spot. He smiled one of his rare smiles, smoothed a rumpled corner, and invited Yo Mai to join him as so often before. She in turn carefully placed her package on the ground beside the blanket, slipped delicately out of her jacket, and lowered herself on to the blanket with a soft sigh.&lt;br/&gt;Their eyes met in the moonlight. They listened for others coming... for voices... for sounds of footsteps. They heard frogs and night birds, ducks splashing in the distance, and faint wind in the branches. They heard water lap the shore, and crickets in the grassy slope above them. But no people. Their eyes stayed locked and Yo Mai nodded. “It’s time,” she said.&lt;br/&gt;Their actions began slowly, politely, and carefully. The precious bag was retrieved. Hearts beat faster. Yo Mai’s head went back with parted lips for that sip of bliss. Yuri tasted the salt on his tongue, and felt the warm juices run down his fingers and on to this wrist. They both closed their eyes in private joy.&lt;br/&gt;...then the humming started. Softly at first and rising to a pitch. At first the two students didn’t notice. But soon it crept into their reverie and commanded their attention. Wind swirled around them and lights flashed in their eyes. Yuri dropped his hamburger to the ground... Yo Mai’s coffee spilt on the blanket (You did understand they bought a picnic supper, right?) And the two were never heard from again.&lt;br/&gt;The authorities searched for them when the two didn’t return to the college. Local reports of “lights in the night” and “flying saucers” were discredited but all that remained was a stained blanket and an empty Big Mac wrapper. No one knows what really happened. This cache commemorates their disappearance.</groundspeak:long_description>

Kids can make it easily but watch them near the water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is our first cache, so please be kind. We were inspired by the likes of Black Shark and Geonana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please return the cache as you found it, to make it challenging for others.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The central Alberta area has been plagued by a number of suspected alien abductions in recent months. All remain unexplained, and few if any gained media attention. This series of caches commemorate these unfortunate souls, and further investigation may bring answers to the mysteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fred always loved the country and wanted to live there for a long time. Rather he liked his idea of the country, not knowing much if anything about it. He loved the romance of riding the range, without ever wondering how the cowboys stored coffee pots, frying pans and bacon in the bedroll on the back of their saddles. Details didn’t matter much to Fred, he was fully convinced that a 200HP car was harder to handle than a 1HP horse…or would be if he could only find the horses gas pedal. He’d actually planned to buy a horse until the neighbour told him they were hayburners… Fred was afraid of grass fires.&lt;br/&gt;After a few years of looking he bought an acreage with all the essentials:&lt;br/&gt;1. A one-ton dual wheel pickup truck (Japanese of course)&lt;br/&gt;2. Two bales of straw and a blue heeler dog, both to ride in the truck&lt;br/&gt;3. A pair of cowboy boots, with scalloped tops to tuck in his Jordache jeans.&lt;br/&gt;4. A Stetson hat with a paisley hat band.&lt;br/&gt;5. And a used Caterpillar snowblower, in anticipation of winter blizzards.&lt;br/&gt;Then he bought “THE QUAD”. He never used its model name because it terrified him, and of course it wasn’t the pink version the salesman called the “pussycat” either. It clashed with his hat band and his ego. The QUAD was big enough to make him feel powerful, even though he had to rebuild two gates to drive it across the acreage.&lt;br/&gt;The QUAD was actually his undoing. The day he had it into the shop for its monthly tune-up, he spotted the combination light bar, siren mount, satellite receiver attachment on display and had it installed. When he returned home at dusk he rode the QUAD all the way down to the South Quarter (okay, maybe 250 yards across the acreage) to test the new lights and siren. He never returned.&lt;br/&gt;Authorities believe the multitude of assorted lights on a moon-buggy-like vehicle attracted the alien’s attention. They may have thought it a distress signal, or a landing beacon, or just looked so darned funny they couldn’t resist.&lt;br/&gt;We will never know for sure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An easy drive up on a paved country road.</groundspeak:long_description>
