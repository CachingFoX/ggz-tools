No wails here today just some trucks screaming passed on their endless journey.
from the Cache you can see the small township of Wail
Situated on the edge of the Wail State forest a good practice area for off road 4wd driving in sand, very close is the wail nursery which has a large selection of native plants.</groundspeak:long_description>

No wails spotted, but crossed the w(r)ail climbed the hill wa(i)y up high found cache, then went to get back in car and found white mud all over shoes. WAIL OH WAIL, white mud on black carpet in car [:D]. But plenty of grass nearby, all good, TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

Our geo friend who lives nearby informs us there is also a log and stump at this GZ that would be quite suitable for a container as well.
Cheers,

TNLNSL, although our BYO pen geocoin had a visit to mark the occasion.  Thanks honeysucker.</groundspeak:text>
