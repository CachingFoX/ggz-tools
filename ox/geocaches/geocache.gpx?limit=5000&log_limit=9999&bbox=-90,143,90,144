Our geo friend who lives nearby informs us there is also a log and stump at this GZ that would be quite suitable for a container as well.

TNLNSL, although our BYO pen geocoin had a visit to mark the occasion.  Thanks honeysucker.</groundspeak:text>

care.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Welcome to Bambra Wetlands and another cache brought to you by Mrs
1SR. 
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I can not find any info on the wetlands. It is a
bit dry at the moment but that has not stopped the bird life. There
is a small gravell path (few weeds on it) winding its way around
native flora. The majority of trees and bushes have small name
plates so you know what they are. Take your time and walk around
(doesnt take long about 200m circuit) and watch the birds. We
spotted an owl in one tree while placing the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

 
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a 1lt sistema container with the usual
goodies. Enjoy!!!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This one was too close to pass by while taking the back way home from our bushwalk today so I dropped in for a look.  The coordinates had me in the swampy area so after a peek at the hint, I was soon logging the find at 17:55 about 8 metres from the GZ I was reading.

What a pleasant spot [:)].  I wonder how many people know this is here; well, at least one more does now [;)].  I remember coming down to our school camp in this general area many years ago, although it was a bit further along the road.
