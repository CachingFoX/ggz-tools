Scouts take off and land gliders at the nearby airfield which is
the entrance you are now standing at.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Scout Air Activities Centre is a Scout Activity Centre,
Campsite, located in scrubland near Blanchetown, approximately
150kms from Adelaide.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Combine the thrills of a flying experience, with an idyllic bush
camp surrounded by wombats, kangaroos and birds, and sunsets to die
for with unspoilt clear skies full of stars, and you have the Scout
Air Activities Centre!

 Historically Sedan was a place to pass through. With no surface
water it was only visited seasonally by Aborigines who lived along
the River Murray or those who lived in the hills. White settlers
lived seasonally in little huts that dotted the countryside. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 They visited in the spring and winter, fed their stock and
returned to the hills when the feed ran out. The Overlanders, using
the ‘Old Sydney Track’, which was the stock route between the
Eastern States and Adelaide, passed through Sedan. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
The Hundred of Bagot was proclaimed on the 19th of April 1860. It
was one of the many land releases of the time, relieving pressure
on the Adelaide Plains and Hills for the developing Colony. People
were then able to cultivate the land and settle permanently. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Early settlers were the Germans, seeking religious freedom, from
Silesia and the British who sought better living conditions. The
town is surrounded by dry-stone wall structures built by these
early settlers. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
The nearby structure is one of the many structures that still stand
as a testament to the conditions of the early settlers.</groundspeak:long_description>

Set well back from the road it is surrounded by a rabbit proof fence.

 The reserve has been surveyed and 67 native plants and 12 introduced species have been identified. Because of the rabbit proof fence, one variety which is no longer in the area, the 'Kangaroo Grass' flourishes. 

It once covered a large are of the hlls, but the rabbits have completely eradicated it. This grass may on seasonal occations show rapid growth in the cemetery area and create some untidyness. 

Please understand the need to preserve it.</groundspeak:long_description>

While waiting for the droppers and wire to arrive I looked across and there was a magnificent view with a farm gate saying Murray View. A perfect spot for a cache.

I am not sure if you can see the Murray from here but you couldn't today through the rain and fog.

The steers in the next paddock were friendly and inquisitive.

All I had at the time was an Eclipse tin and you will need to bring your own writing stick. Enjoy the view.</groundspeak:long_description>

Vigour of the child who grows up and mischievous feeling are very human works in &quot;Child's tree&quot; (1985) that exists in Aoyama's National Children's Castle against &quot;Tower in the sun&quot; (1970) even divine the form that draws features in order that give off a golden gleam in Taro Okamoto's work and a beautiful curve that is. 
Do the face down of the face on the tip of the branch that extended to eight people as all are seen from children. It seems to be made it to height that the child that it is made to hold in the plinth can get on.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Old Shimbashi Station reproduces the external appearance of the first Shimbashi Station,the Tokyo terminus of Japan's first railway line opened on 14 October 1872,as faithfully as possible on its original site.The first station building was designed by the American architect R.P.Bridgens(1819-91).Construction started in May 1871 and was completed in December of the same year.Western-style buildings was still rare in Tokyo at that time,but the station's imposing design symbolized Japan's modernization in tandem with the westernized rebuilding of Ginza Dori soon after the opening of the railway.

The Passenger-terminal functions of Shimbashi Station were transferred to the new Tokyo Station when it was opened in 1914 and Shimbashi Station was renamed Shiodome Station and became a freight terminal.The Shimbashi Station name was transferred to Karasumori Station,which still remains as today's Shimbashi Station.In its new role as a freight terminal,Shiodome played a pivotal part in Japan's subsequent economic growth.
 
Unfortunately,the magnificent old station building in Shiodome,which had symbolized Japan's westernization movement during the Meiji period(1868-1912),was destroyed by fire following the Great Kanto Earthquake on 1 September 1923.Renovation works in Shiodome freight terminal from 1934 onwards resulted in the demolition of the old remaining platforms and original structures not destroyed by the 1923 fire.
Following the closure of Shiodome freight terminal in 1968,archaeological excavations in 1991 led to the discovery of the station site and the unearthing of the platforms and foundations of the first Shimbashi Station building.On 10 December 1996,the Japanese government designated the remains of the station building and part of the platform as the Old Shimbashi Station Historic Site.
This reproduction of the first station building has been built to conserve and display these historic remains and to commemorate the birthplace of railways in Japan.
The dotted line shows the extent of the government-designated Old Shimbashi Station Historic Site.

旧新橋停車場は、1872（明治5）年10月14日に開業した日本最初の鉄道ターミナル新橋停車場の駅舎の外観を、当時と同じ位置に、できるだけ忠実に再現したものです。
新橋停車場駅舎は、アメリカ人R・P・ブリジェンスの設計による木骨石張りの構造で、1871（明治4）年5月に着工、同年12月に完成し、西洋建築がまだ珍しかった時代の東京で、鉄道開業直後に西洋風に整備された銀座通りに向かって、威容を誇っていました。
1914（大正3）年、新設の東京駅に旅客ターミナルの機能が移り、それまでの烏森（からすもり）駅が新橋の名を引き継いで現在の新橋駅となり、貨物専用駅となった旧駅は汐留駅と改称、物流の大拠点として戦前戦後を通じて東京の経済活動を支えました。
文明開化の象徴として親しまれていた旧駅舎は、1923（大正12）年9月1日の関東大震災に際して火災のため焼失し、1934（昭和9）年から始まった汐留駅改良工事のため、残存していたプラットホームや構内の初施設も解体されました。
1986（昭和61）年、汐留駅はその使命を終えて廃止され、敷地の再開発工事に先立つ埋蔵文化財の発掘調査が1991（平成3）年から行われた結果、旧新橋停車場駅舎とプラットホームなど構内の諸施設の礎石が発掘されました。1996（平成8）年12月10日、駅舎とプラットホームの一部の遺構が史跡『旧新橋停車場』として国の指定を受け、この史跡を保護しつつわが国鉄道発祥の往時を偲びために、駅舎を再建することになったものです。
