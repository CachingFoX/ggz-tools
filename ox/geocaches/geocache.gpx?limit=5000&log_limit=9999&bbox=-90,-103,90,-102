I came down to get FTF on a cache just down the interstate and
turned around here where there is the smallest underpass I've ever
seen, only one car can go through at a time so be careful!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Cache was a 35mm container but a mouse ran off with it, so it's now
a preform hanging nearby the original coords.

I saw this marker a few weeks ago while out caching and thought
this spot needs a cache, it's a nice bit of history! So pow, here
it is.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The discovery of Oil in Ector County December 28, 1926, marked the
beginning of a new economic era for this region. The first Well, &quot;
J.S. Cosden No.1-A W.E. Connell &quot;, was named for the driller and
owner of land. Its meager initial output of 38 barrels per day did
not cause much excitement, but experts insisted that vast oil
deposits lay under area (permian basin). In 1929, Robert Penn's
Gusher catapulted Odessa to boom-town fame. Oil has sustained the
area economy since then, although the discovery Well was pugged and
abandoned in 1940. Recorded Texas Historic Landmark - 1967. Please
make sure to hide this cache back EXACTLY as found, don't move it
around it's camo is perfect for it's spot.

Well Intro to Disc Golf caches are nice to get you to the park, but
this one will get you to learn a bit about the game. If you play
some of these will be easy, otherwise you might need to look things
up but I'm making this pretty simple.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is in the brush of the course, alot of Disc Golf players
complain about this back area, but I quite enjoy it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Trail Disc Golf Course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Final Cache is an Ammo box with some goodies and a FTF prize
sitting nicely under the container. I hope that DiscGolfers won't
be looking this far from the hole for their discs.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is a simple trivia cache, answer each of the questions below
and put the corresponding information into the coords.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A. Who is known as the &quot;father of Disc Golf&quot;?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Superman - 32&lt;br/&gt;

Ed Headrick - 31&lt;br/&gt;
Tim Selinske - 102&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
B. Scoring a hole in one is called a(n):&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Birdie - 52&lt;br/&gt;
Good Job - 67&lt;br/&gt;
Ace - 49&lt;br/&gt;
Lucky Shot - 38&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
C.PDGA rules prohibit discs weighing more than 200 grams.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
True - 393&lt;br/&gt;
False - 398&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
2010 - 103&lt;br/&gt;
2003 - 102&lt;br/&gt;
1987 - 101&lt;br/&gt;
2056 - 122&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
E. A disc that is understable will increase the natural angle of
the disc.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
True - 22&lt;br/&gt;
False - 21&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
F. There are a wide variety of discs, divided into three basic
categories: putters, all-purpose mid-range discs, and UFO's.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
True - 738&lt;br/&gt;
False - 633&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Coordinates are:&lt;br/&gt;
N A B.C&lt;br/&gt;
W D E.F&lt;br/&gt;

This cache is the 5th in my line of Intro to Disc Golf
caches.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Should be a relatively easy find, camoed container in the tree. I
had an evil cache in mind for this one but decided I'll do that one
elseware.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is the largest Disc Golf course in the Midland / Odessa area.
Lots of complicated shots some good distance drives. If your new to
the game be careful on this course, you can easily loose a
disc!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is a great park, the entire park has quite a few good caches,
a nice pond, pathway under the interstate leads to the next disc
golf course in Odessa at McKinney park, great walking trail.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
At the cache location you are near the basket for hole number 10 on
the course. I put this one in a tree far enough away that
DiscGolfers that don't cache shouldn't stumble upon it trying to
find their discs stuck in trees.&lt;br/&gt;

This is the largest Disc Golf course in the Midland / Odessa area.
Lots of complicated shots some good distance drives. If your new to
the game be careful on this course, you can easily loose a
disc!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is a great park, the entire park has quite a few good caches,
a nice pond, pathway under the interstate leads to the next disc
golf course in Odessa at McKinney park, great walking trail.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Be careful when getting this cache, your going about as close to a
Basket as I can find a way to put a cache. This is hole #11 and the
one on this course people talk about the most due to the uniqueness
of the basket mount. Watch for discs heading your way, they will be
launching from the west heading to this hole.&lt;br/&gt;

This spot may be familiar to some of the cachers in the area as
Charizard once had a nice cache in this same area. In fact this is
the location where my parents made their first find, and one of my
first was out here.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When I found the original cache at this location with my wife it
was a very nice evening with one fantastic sunset from up
there.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is meant to be a difficult one, it might be simple for
some might take forever, go around sunset to see a nice West Texas
Sunset from a good little place off the road where you won't be
bothered.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Your looking for a Bright Pink &quot;Scuba&quot; tube, but well hidden in my
opinion.</groundspeak:long_description>

Today I was running service in Odessa and had some time to kill
between appointments so I scouted out some areas to put a few
caches.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
After my service calls I was heading to get some drinks for my
sister and go to the office when I came across this big guy and
thought it really needed a cache.&lt;br/&gt;

This is an idea I came up with while flipping through junkmail at the office, Got permission to do it and made the cache.

The cache is not on the building or on the fence, you don't really need to leave the parking spot.

I hope you enjoy the cache, I've never seen one quite like this.

My apologies to the First to Find Crowd, no money was left over for a prize after the price of building the cache location. </groundspeak:long_description>

If there's a game going I recommend skipping this one.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Looking for a nano that's just the right color. Approach the cache
from the west, no need to cross fences etc...&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Good Luck, No hint :D

it was originally a drug test container. Replaced with something

Welcome to Cowden Park!
&lt;p&gt;I've always enjoyed this park, decent playground equipment, huge
open spaces. At one time I had two Geocaches here called Cachers
Heaven 1 &amp; 2. One got muggled one too many times and the park
has changed alot since 2 was placed, so I'm pulling the current 2
(original container recently vanished) and placing these two new
caches to show the new sport available in this park now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DiscGolf is not the most popular sport in this area, but man
it's alot of fun. This was the first course I played at, it is a
decent course, could have been laid out better. It's 9 holes here
is a link to the course layout etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dgcoursereview.com/course.php?id=1159&quot;&gt;Cowden Park DG
Course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend you give DiscGolf a try while in the area, launching
spot for hole one is not far from the cache, and you'll be going
right past Intro to DiscGolf #2 on the way to hole #4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This park is right on my way home from work, so most days me, my
brother and my cousin stop in for a game of DG on the way home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache contains a log. BYOP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had to make this a small one due to the amount of times I've
seen things muggled in this park Use lots and lots of stealth&lt;/p&gt;

The Cache is not at the listed coordinates! Don't go there,
defiantly don't come into my house, do note however, coordinates
listed are my house, and if I'm out watering the grass, stop by and
say hi.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Now on to the cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I love puzzle caches, but most people shy away from them, so I made
this silly little fun puzzle cache for people to enjoy and have fun
working.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To get the coordinates for this cache you must complete the
following riddles and puzzles. Should be fairly easy for the most
part, and most can be easily found on the internet if you have
trouble.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This cache listing is broken into a few pieces to get the true
coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Fill in the blanks of the coordinates with the answers from the
following:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Part 1:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Is Fort Stockton, Texas - North, East, South, or West of the
country of Paraguay?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = A

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Part 2:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A high school has a strange principal. On the first day, he has his
students perform an odd opening day ceremony:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There are one thousand lockers and one thousand students in the
school. The principal asks the first student to go to every locker
and open it. Then he has the second student go to every second
locker and close it. The third goes to every third locker and, if
it is closed, he opens it, and if it is open, he closes it. The
fourth student does this to every fourth locker, and so on. After
the process is completed with the thousandth student, how many
lockers are open?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = B

Part 3:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
My Car rolled off the assembly line on October 17, 1964. If I'm
able to keep my car running and I don't wreck it, how old will it
be on May 28, 2024?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = C&lt;br/&gt;

Part 4:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
What is the square root of 271,441&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = D&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Part 5:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
What part of Texas is this cache located in?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = E

Part 6:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
102 (Didn't see that coming did ya?)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = F

Part 7:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Square root of 64&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = G

Part 8:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
How many spark plugs did a 2000 Ford Excursion with a diesel engine
have?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = H&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Coordinates are:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A B° C.D&lt;br/&gt;
E F° G.H&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you have trouble please e-mail me and enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Final Location is near a city pool, so if you got kiddos and it's
hot, take your swimsuits!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

This park has been in need of a cache for along time....&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
We have dedicated this cache to our puppy that passed away not long
ago, she loved this park, chasing the ducks, and running from them.
(big baby..)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is fairly small, some nice stuff in it though.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt; Good luck!

Just over five years ago me and my wife went by my parents house
after being out of town and heard Bandit6789 discussing some
crazyness called geocaching.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Sounded interesting though I wasn't sure what it was until work the
next day then we set out to find some, enjoyed it, signed up, and
here we are five years to the date later.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Of course most know I wasn't able to cache all of that time, I had
my first son in April of 07 and at that time I wasn't able to do
much caching, our house was small taking care of the kiddo was alot
of work, so I didn't do much for a year or two.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Last year we had our second kiddo but knowing what we're up against
and a better house to do it in makes taking care of the boys much
easier and now... I can cache!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Should be an easy find, enjoy it!</groundspeak:long_description>

I was in San Antonio recently and came across a cache with this concept and I loved it and wanted to do it here. I had the perfect spot but there was a cache too nearby. Thankfully tlien11 is a great sport and made room for me.

Once you sign the log you can swap fortunes! If you don't have a fortune to swap please don't take the one that's there. If you want to swap fortunes, find somewhere to grab one.

Instructions for fortune swapping if you choose to do so: bring a new fortune, from a fortune cookie. Now this will take some simple planning on your part. Once you have the new fortune sign and date the back. Remove the old fortune and place the new one in the cache.

You will then need to log the fortune you retrieved, NOT the one you placed in the cache.

I have permission from the property owners to place this cache here.

Watch out for muggles! </groundspeak:long_description>

I like to look at stars, and this is an excellent place to do so. Just far enough out of town that the city lights don't bother too much, but close enough that you don't have to make a trip out of it. Watch the traffic when pulling in, mind the dip, and come late to enjoy the stars in full view. Area is plenty safe to hang out for a while once you're off the road.</groundspeak:long_description>

placing this one and a few other caches nearby.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I placed these two caches because one I miss the former cache here,
and two I placed these a few days before an event in Odessa where
alot of us intend to drive to Hobbs afterward and cache as much as
we can, these give people more to hit on the way out of town and
back if they wished to!&lt;br/&gt;

seen in one night, only while in the truck though, none while out
placing this one and a few other caches nearby.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I placed these two caches because one I miss the former cache
across the street, and two I placed these a few days before an
event in Odessa where alot of us intend to drive to Hobbs afterward
and cache as much as we can, these give people more to hit on the
way out of town and back if they wished to!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Enjoy!

years old) were going on a nice little caching trip today to
Monahans, Andrews and back Midland (giving his momma a break) When
I told him in Monahans we were going to Andrews next he got super
excited, me of course forgetting why until we got there and he was
disappointed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You see, a good friend of mine has a son named Andrew who is
younger than my kiddo and Will really likes to go to his house and
play with him, so he was understandably disappointed. On route we
happened upon this spot and it was just begging for a cache, so I
thought I'd accommodate it.</groundspeak:long_description>
