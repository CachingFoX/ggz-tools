This cache container is a plastic ammo can (provided by Reisfield) about 100 feet off trail.  I intended to replace one of Reisfield's missing kayak caches this summer, but I never made it there.  So instead, I hid his container very far from any water and named it in his honor.  Speaking of water,  you should bring some.  This may be a long walk for you and there isn't much shade in these parts.</groundspeak:long_description>

From the main parking lot, there are two ways south to the cache.
You can head east through the woods until you reach a north/south
boundary trail (then head south to the cache), or follow the old
farm road south (this is a beautiful easy walk, but will require
more bushwhacking in the end). I suggest making a loop out of it.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK24NE4 - Pine Meadows parking lot&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 51.608 W 072° 43.417</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is a medium sized lock-n-lock hidden in a traditional manner about 15-20 feet from the trail.  Once you've found the cache...  if you are still wondering why I brought you out this far, check out the hunter's stand about 80 feet west of the cache (waypoint provided below).  Climb up (it's very secure) and take a look around.

walk through an area of the pine barrens north of Sunrise Highway.


In 1995 a major fire swept through the Long Island Pine Barrens.
Starting in Westhamton, it easily jumped Sunrise Highway and spread
northwest across the pine-oak forest. Approximately 7000 acres were
leveled by the blaze. The pine barrens are dependent on fire for
regrowth and 14 years later we can see the new teenagers have grown
up nicely. This hike will take you through a sea of young, green
pitch pines and scrub oak. The trees are starting to get tall, but
there are still some vantage points to enjoy the green vista. This
cache is located in the northern section of the burn. The trail is
mostly sandy. You are looking for an ammo can 6-8 feet from the
trail.</groundspeak:long_description>

attention. So while I was perusing my trail map for a good loop
through the area, I noticed a feature called &quot;Deep Hollow&quot;. I
wondered just how deep Deep Hollow was. If you find this cache, you
will realize that it is aptly named.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
If you are hiking the Paumanok Path, it's just a short detour to
get to this cache. But be forewarned... once you enter Deep Hollow
you may not be able to get back out easily! The approach from the
west is milder, but it's a long and twisty trail. You might be
tempted to bushwhack, but beware of ticks and chiggers if you
do.&lt;br/&gt;
Fare thee well, and enjoy the peace and quiet in the hollow, it's a
nice spot to stop for lunch before getting back to the hills of
Manorville.</groundspeak:long_description>

take the white blazes rather than the wide sandy road. It's a lot
more interesting and now you can grab a smiley along the
way.







The cache is small and only contains a logbook and pencil. There's
not much room for tradables, but geocoins will fit nicely. I
recommend parking on Red Creek Road at N40 53.613 / W072 33.973.
It's about 3/4 mile from there. Watch for the white blazes of the
Paumanok Path and follow them to gz.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is an easy hike from the north end of Toppings Path (about 3/4 mile).  Start heading south on Toppings, then look for a SW turnoff about halfway there.  This is a little better than walking the sandy and muddy Toppings route south.

&quot;As I'm ramblin' you can travel with me too.&quot;</groundspeak:long_description>

Bill (WRR) thought it was time to reset the caches he had hidden in
the area. So Rozz and I joined him for a walk while we picked up
the old ones and hid some new ones. Bill's Fox Pond Bonus was such
a nice hide that I figured this spot deserved a revisit. This cache
is an orange matchstick container.</groundspeak:long_description>

&quot;You will search, babe,
At any cost.
But how long, babe,
Can you search for what's not lost?
Ev'rybody will help you,
Some people are very kind.
But if I can save you any time,
Come on, give it to me,
I'll keep it with mine.&quot;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">North Branford was originally part of the Totoket settlement (purchased in 1638 from the Indian chief Montowese). The Totoket area was bounded on the south by Long Island Sound, on the west by the Stony River (Farm River) and the Great Pond (Lake Saltonstall). At that time, the northerly areas of the Branford/ Totoket settlement were primarily cleared for orchards and farming and were known as “North Farms.” North Branford was incorporated as a town in 1831. As a lasting commemorative of the nation’s  bicentennial in 1976 , a 77- acre tract of land on the Branford River was purchased for a park and, in a town-wide contest, named North Farms, the original designation of the area. 

North Farms Park has three primary trails with varying degrees of difficulty. The Yellow Trail is designed to be a safety trail that can be used by all ages with little or no hiking skills needed. The trail runs northeast to the Branford River. Once across the river, this trail runs north to south. The Orange Trail is also a relatively easy trail. This is a short trail located in the northeastern part of the park. It connects the northern portions of the Yellow and White Trails. This trail virtually divides the park in half. The White Trail is the most difficult  trail and requires some expertise in hiking skills. The trail runs north along the perimeter of the park and leads to the Branford River where there is no way to cross at the present time. The trail is picked up on the northeastern side of the river and intersects with the northern end of the Yellow Trail and continues southeasterly along the perimeter. At the eastern point it intersects with the Orange Trail and then  continues to Valley Road. This area has a steep incline. The trail then turns to the southwest and  descends on a steep hill which leads to the area of the old dams where the trail dead ends at the Branford River. This is also the intersection of the Yellow Trail at its southern point. On the southwestern corner of the park, the White Trail heads north thru moderate woods and climbs a steep upgrade to the  southern end of the open field.

Found this spot on a bike ride this morning and figured it would be a nice place for a cache. I was told by a man I met there, also riding his bike, that this place used to be a race track for cars that wanted to bypass a nearby stoplight.

I've been looking around for a little while to find some nice hiking trails in Groton, and I finally found some, tucked away nicely behind the Marriott. This cache is the first of 6 that I've placed in my Dark Hollow series. If you're going for all of them in one shot I recommend following the trail and doing them in the following order: 
-Deep in
-Dark Hollow
-Eriko's Birthday
-Hollowed Out
-Shisa's Hollow
-Sliced

Continue hiking down the Dark Hollow trails, it get's a little sketchy following the trail to this cache, keep following the trail as best as you can, this one is only about 80 feet or so off the trail.

To find your way back keep following the trail to the T and take a right, then follow the creek back until you get to a familiar spot.

Bring bug spray.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">It's Eriko's Birthday today. I went for a hike today at Dark Hollow and decided to place this cache as a gift of sorts. BYOP. Bring bug spray; it's not too bad at GZ but on the way there could be another matter.

The trail is fairly easy to follow. The cache is only about 30-40 feet off the trail, so no need to bushwhack.

I made this a quick park and grab so after finding the cache, stay and enjoy the park. There are many activities to do here, basketball, tennis, soccer, baseball and it even has a play area for younger kids.  
Be careful with younger kids near the road when retrieving the cache.

You will be looking for a camouflage matchstick holder.  There is a small pencil but BYOP just in case.  The FTF prize is a shirt, one size fits all. 
A shirt in a micro?  The FTF will see how I fit it in.

Congratulations to lindgrenfamily for their FTF!

The planet also appears to have seas or oceans based on its blue-green appearance. An extremely large radiation-contaminated star cluster is located on at least one side of its surrounding space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edible, protein-rich algae grow on the planet surface, as scouted by Athena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After almost all of the ships manage to get across the almost-unnavigable and deadly star cluster cloud, harvesting and processing of the algae begins in order to resupply the Fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two weeks later, as harvesting is wrapping up, Galen Tyrol mysteriously detects the presence of the Temple of Five, built by the Thirteenth Tribe approximately 4,000 years before. The Temple is the supposed location of the Eye of Jupiter, an artifact mentioned in the Sacred Scrolls. It is believed to point the way to the Thirteenth Tribe's destination, Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shortly after Chief Tyrol discovers the temple, a Cylon fleet appears over the planet, seeking the Eye. This results in the Battle of the Algae Planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the battle the planet's sun goes nova, as predicted by Lieutenant Gaeta. The Colonial ground forces are evacuated and both fleets jump away, just as the expanding star consumes the planet. The nova ultimately turns out to be the Eye of Jupiter, and a similar nova, which occurred around the time of the first exodus, gives the Colonials their next clue as to the location of Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Parking in Hunter Crossing Condo Complex*****&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*******CONGRATS MR ECHO AND KDUBS FOR FTF*********</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thanks Josh for a fun series.  What made it even better is the knowlege as to why you place this series.  When you do a quasi power series it is hard to write a unique log for each one.  For me they all seem to blend in.  Because of this I will reference all other caches in this series to this log.   This was the first cache I found  in this series. The first one is always the toughest in a power series because you have to get a feel of the CO's hides and containers.  This cache I took a little more time than expected but once found it gave me the mind set of this series. 

What a great place for this series.  Between the massive and endless fields,  the ride along the river, the shooting range and the motorcross track it made this an interesting day.  The dirt road had enough mud and water spots to give my Jeep a rugged look.  When ever I see a mud puddle the little boy in me makes it impossible for me to not go throught them at a high rate of speed and send the muddy water in every direction.  At the end of the series my Jeep had some war paint on it.  As I drove from cache to cache I was glad to see all the friendly waves from all the passing motorist and pedestrians.  It was also amazing that all of this land belongs to the hunting club.  The many posted no trespassing signs mad it abundantly clear that they meant business if anyone encrouched or hunted on their property.  It appeared to me that some of the passing motorist were members of the hunting club patrolling the roads to catch all those who didn't pay mind to all of the postings.  I know enough that you never want to piss off anyone  who belongs to a hunting club and is most likely carrying a firearm. 

Thanks for spending the time to set up this series and even though you called this series &quot;Spew pew pew&quot; it is far better than the other &quot;spews&quot; that gave you the idea to place it. </groundspeak:text>

You can still see the remains of the concrete slabs where they parked the mobile missile launchers. The trail runs along the top of Pinnical Ridge from Rt 372 to Rt6 in Farmington. There are lots of great views along the way. Check out N41.41.425 W072.49.966 for a great view of Plainville\Bristol. Great place to go rock climbing. Watch pets and children near the cliffs.

Cache is an Ammo Box.

This is our first cache in the Diverse Beliefs Series. Enjoy the cache.

Magikal Cauldron is an easy cache, compared to others in the park, (some of which are quite challenging). A standard size lock and lock filled with incense, spell candles, crystals, and shells etc. Many items reflect the five elements of earth, water, air, fire and spirit. If possible, we ask that trade items be special to you in this way.

Enjoy!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Sessions Woods is a wildlife management area full of well maintained hiking trails and sites to see galore. The entire trail loops almost three miles and along your hike there are many pit stops with sites to see. Beaver Pond, the Fire Tower, the Backyard Sanctuary and the Waterfalls are just to name a few. This has been a long time favorite hiking area with our kids, as the trails are not difficult or rugged. At the right time of the year the pond is adorned with lily pads while gorgeous pink and white lilies bloom and cover the entire lake. There are many benches to rest and take in the sounds and sites of nature as well. There is ample parking for the trails in front of the Education Center which houses great wildlife exhibits - well worth a visit before or after your hike (it is free of charge). Be sure to grab a trail guide to learn more while hiking.

With each stage (6 plus the final) of this multi-cache you will find the coordinates that will lead you to the next stage. You'll need a pen to sign the log book and BRING-TWEEZERS to extract coordinats for each stage. We ask that you place each stage back as you found them. Some stages are obvious while others need a little stealth, a cacher's eye and a bit of endurance. Be warned some stages will require a bit of bush whacking (may not be suitable for the little ones). The final stage is a large .50cal ammo can with tradeables and a log book. There is a gift card for the FTF thats inside the log book. Also there is a travel coin inside trying to find it's way home to the U.K. We hope you enjoy your journey!

It's a wild life after all!
It's a trail of nature
A path of wonder
It's a world of beauty
And a world of critters
There's so much that we can see
If you take the time to be aware
It's a wild life after all!
There is today
Under one golden sun
To hike these trails
And have some fun
The trees divide
The trails are wide
It's a wild life after all!</groundspeak:long_description>

route 4. Cache is an ammo box placed in a traditional way. Enjoy
the walk. This park is a historic landmark in the center of
Unionville. It contains the remnants of an “electrical
amusement park” that flourished from 1895 to 1905. Purchased
by the Town of Farmington in 2001, it provides 20.5 acres of open
space with two miles of hilly walking trails. The park contains
five circular “kettles” formed during the glacial age.
Guided tours are available through the Unionville Museum.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">brought you to this spot for several reasons. Not the least of which is that I wanted to place a Nanocache that I picked up at REI last night... But also because from this location you can actually see some really cool stuff in the center of downtown Hartford.

From this spot you can see The Cathedral of St. Joseph. This imposing structure was built in 1958 after a mysterious fire burnt down the original - built in 1876. Turn around and you can literally walk across a huge bronze inlaid compass marking the geographic center of the city of Hartford. All the while skulking in the shadows of &quot;The World's Largest Colonial Style Building&quot; - the current HQ for insurance giant, Aetna.

All three of these things are pretty cool in my opinion.

Caution: Some stealth is required as the Aetna building is HEAVILY guarded. There are private security officers constantly patrolling the streets around the site. There are also cameras located above the front door beyond the compass rose.

This is a NANO cache with just a log. </groundspeak:long_description>

please bring your own pen and tweezers might help.

This cache is located near the Green Lady Cemetery, officially known as Seventh Day Baptist Cemetery. If you are a local, you have certainly heard the many stories through the years. The cemetery is best-known by the name of Green Lady Cemetery, due to stories and sightings of a green spectral figure known as the Green Lady. No one is exactly sure who the Green Lady was in life, but many believe she is the ghost of a Seventh Day Baptist named Elisabeth Palmiter. Legend has it that in April 1800, Elisabeth's husband, Benjamin, went into town to get some supplies. Suddenly a bad snow storm broke out; Benjamin decided to stay in town and wait for the weather to die down. When he didn't return right away, Elisabeth went out to try and find him. After getting lost in the storm, she drowned in one of the nearby swamps.

In one version of the story, Benjamin returned home to find his wife missing. After an exhaustive search, he found her frozen body in a swamp; she was wearing a pretty green dress. In other versions of the story, Benjamin was either unwilling to save Elisabeth or murdered her and threw her body into the swamp as a cover-up. Since this is a local legend, no one is absolutely certain what really happened. Regardless of what really happened, many people walking near the cemetery at night have claimed to see a female apparation surrounded in a green mist. According to most accounts, she merely appears without provocation or pattern, smiles and then dissipates. Some people have also claimed to see mysterious lights, looking like a flashlight or lantern carried by an unseen person. Some think it could be the ghost of Benjamin Palmiter, perpetually searching for Elisabeth in the swamp. Whomever she was, many teens have spread the word and her legend lives on.

 Please note that Upson Road is a dirt road and the cemetery has No Trespassing signs posted. We took care in making sure we placed it outside of the cemetery, entering via Covey Road. Park anywhere on Covey Road and follow the coordinates to the cache.

As always please be respectful of the fact that you are in a cemetery. Have Fun :D</groundspeak:long_description>

Derrin who died Mar. 30, 1898, age 85. Locate the obelisk marking

cemetery. &quot;The Derrings (Derrin) built a home before 1766 in a
section of West Avon...&quot; is the only reference in a local history
book to this (c. 1747) farmhouse. Little is known of the family
other than they built several houses in the western part of Avon in
the 18th century. The home's size and architectural details suggest
that they were engaged in farming and were of modest means.

Be sure to bring a pencil. Not availible at night. Cache within 20'
of the Derrin monument. No need to touch any monuments. As always
be aware of surroundings and enjoy.....

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is located on the edge of Pine Meadow Cemetery, located in New Hartford. Lots of cool old stones to see.  The township of New Hartford was granted to the Hartford patentees. The settlement commenced about the year 1733, and it appears to have been incorporated soon after. The first settlers were from Hartford. Their names were John, Cyprian and Zachariah Watson, Joseph Gillet, Noah Merril, deacon Martin Smith, Thomas Olcott, Stephen Kelsey, Matthew Gillet, John Andrus, Jonathan Marsh, Daniel Shepherd, Samuel Douglass, Eleazer Goodwin, and others. The first minister in the town was the Rev. Jonathan Marsh, son of the Rev. Jonathan Marsh of Windsor, ordained October, 1739. He continued in the ministry between fifty-four and fifty-five years. As this was a frontier town, some fortifications were erected for the defense of the inhabitants.

New Hartford is 20 miles northwest from Hartford. It is bounded north by Barkhamsted, east by Canton, west by Torrington, and south by Burlington and Harwinton. It is six miles in length, and averages about the same distance in breadth. The township is hilly and mountainous, containing a range of mountains of considerable elevation, consisting of granite and other primitive formations.



Please bring a pencil. Parking is anywhere you find it. Enjoy.

Heading to southern VT with the two younger Cashlets for a weekend of hiking, caching and playing.  Stopped by here on the way west to pick up a cache and a Delorme grid that I haven't found yet.  We read the previous logs so we knew we would be looking away from the posted coordinates (which was correct -- we parked at the posted coordinates).  After looking again at a place the kids had already searched I found the well hidden container and took a set of averaged coordinates which are posted here.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gregor Mendel&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;Founded science of genetics&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregor Mendel was an Augustinian priest and scientist, who
gained posthumous fame as the figurehead of the new science of
genetics for his study of the inheritance of certain traits in pea
plants. Mendel showed that the inheritance of these traits follows
particular laws, which were later named after him. The significance
of Mendel's work was not recognized until the turn of the 20th
century. The independent rediscovery of these laws formed the
foundation of the modern science of genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel's attraction to research was based on his love of nature.
He was not only interested in plants, but also in meteorology and
theories of evolution. Mendel often wondered how plants obtained
atypical characteristics. On one of his frequent walks around the
monastery, he found an atypical variety of an ornamental plant. He
took it and planted it next to the typical variety. He grew their
progeny side by side to see if there would be any approximation of
the traits passed on to the next generation. This experiment was
&quot;designed to support or to illustrate Lamarck's views concerning
the influence of environment upon plants.&quot; He found that the
plants' respective offspring retained the essential traits of the
parents, and therefore were not influenced by the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple test gave birth to the idea of heredity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel's research reflected his personality. Once he crossed
peas and mice of different varieties &quot;for the fun of the thing,&quot;
and the phenomena of dominance and segregation &quot;forced themselves
upon notice.&quot; He saw that the traits were inherited in certain
numerical ratios. He then came up with the idea of dominance and
segregation of genes and set out to test it in peas. It took seven
years to cross and score the plants to the thousand to prove the
laws of inheritance! From his studies, Mendel derived certain basic
laws of heredity: hereditary factors do not combine, but are passed
intact; each member of the parental generation transmits only half
of its hereditary factors to each offspring (with certain factors
&quot;dominant&quot; over others); and different offspring of the same
parents receive different sets of hereditary factors. Mendel's work
became the foundation for modern genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of genetic theory is no longer questioned in anyone's
mind. Many diseases are known to be inherited, and pedigrees are
typically traced to determine the probability of passing along an
hereditary disease. Plants are now designed in laboratories to
exhibit desired characteristics. The practical result of Mendel's
research is that it not only changed the way we perceive the world,
but also the way we live in it.&lt;/p&gt;

[size=1]Svp. Utilisez l'icône approprié! [/size]
On est tout de même bien content de cette petite promenade car c'est vraiment une belle journée pour prendre l'air avant la pluie qui est annoncée pour demain.

C'est tellement plus simple et tellement plus agréable sans la neige [8D]. Je ne regrette pas du tout d'avoir attendu à ce temps-ci pour revenir faire cette série.
