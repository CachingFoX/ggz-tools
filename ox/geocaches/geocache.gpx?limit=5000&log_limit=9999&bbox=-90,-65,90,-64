Te felicito por la idea de esconder un caché en la ciudad de Córdoba.
Siento decirte que el caché no está o es muy dificil de encontrar.
En su lugar escondí otro caché (espero que no te moleste)
te invito a verlo al mismo en:

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located within Thomas Raddall Provincial Park is a very special kind of archaeological site; a site of shell middens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The E'se'get Archaeology Project, E'se'get is the Mi'kmaw word meaning &quot;to dig for clams&quot; and a midden is a communal dump site for domestic waste. Researchers from the Canadian Museum of Civilization have been working with a dozen undergraduate archaeology students from the University of New Brunswick in these ancient shell heaps. The middens in this location, made of clam, mussel and oyster shells were collected and eaten by Mi'kmaq 500 to 2000 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working in shell middens can offer some important information because of the calcium carbonate in the shell heaps help preserve organic materials. Bone, antler and other biodegradable materials of cultural significance would normally be dissolved into our Maritime acidic soil. Other artificats like stone tools, pottery, fire hearths and dwelling features found in and around the middens provide and opportunity to learn about the Mi'kmaw way of life along the coastal shores of Mi'kmaki; land of the Mi'kmaq. The E'se'get Archaeology Project is looking to understand the connection between the Mi'kmaq and their marine ecosystem and environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This geocache is part of the 2011 NS Provincial Parks Geocaching challenge.

I had a really difficult time finding this cache.  My GPS had me looking 65 feet away and over a fence.  Even though I thought &quot;how odd for the blackrattles to send me over a fence...&quot;  As I was giving up and walking back to the trail, voila, there it was.  My batteries were getting low, that might be the cause of my problems though....</groundspeak:text>

A storm surge in excess of 12 meters inundated this area. The water completely destroyed the natural sea wall and washed much of the road into Victoria lake.The cache is hidden just off the road near the start of the worst of the damage. It is a small lock and lock type container. At the time of hiding it contained only a log. BYOP.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is not uncommon to see cars from as far away as California, Florida and British Columbia parked along the causeway while the owners catch a few sets.  Depending on the wind and the sea conditions the surfing can be quite spectacular.It was the site of a recent Winter Break Invitational surf competition for professional surfers from across North America. The cache is located near a rough parking area near the middle of the causeway. Cache contains only a log so BYOP. Enjoy the cache, enjoy the view and hang ten if you so choose.</groundspeak:long_description>

There were fairly large herds of cattle for this area. The gentleman who owned the pasture passed away. Now the land is being subdivided into building lots. The hill beside the road has one of the finest views that I am aware of.  You can see all the way from Port Medway to White Point. This view was entirely wasted on the cattle, but seems to be much appreciated by the new owners. Just past this cache is the first view of the ocean from the road and a little used beach on a road to the right at he bottom of the hill.</groundspeak:long_description>

People from the county can come and drop off yard waste. It is then piled up and composted. Residents can come and get compost to use on gardens free of charge just for the hauling. We have used this compost to build gardens on our lot which was burned by a forest fire many years ago, but which still had no topsoil. It is a great resource.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is a small parking spot on the other end where the trail crosses Highway #3.&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a Lok &amp; Lok plastic camoed container between a small &amp; reg. in size. At hiding it contained a log, pencil, pen, a varity of small trade items and a FIRST TO FIND PRIZE!!!!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">My 9 year old daughter has found some geocaches with me and now she wanted to hide one.  So today we hid one along a nice trail just outside of the town of Liverpool that doesn't seem to be used very much.  Maybe geocaching will change that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Meadow Pond Brook Walking Trail is a 1km trail though a mature forest of large pines and hardwoods.  The coords listed below are for the parking area/trailhead.  Once you start on the trail it does fork off in two directions.  Stay to the left and follow the well maintained path which does form a loop.  If you take the right side trail at the begining you will end up on the abandoned railway trail which does NOT lead to the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located off the trail a little bit(minor bushwacking) to prevent it from being muggled.  Please rehide the cache as well or better then you found it.  The cache is a large camoed peanut butter jar filled with some kids toys and a log book. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF prize is a new unactivated set of Travel Bug Dog Tags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK1D7QZ - Parking Area/Trail Head&lt;br/&gt;N 44° 01.565 W 064° 43.190&lt;br/&gt;Park here and follow the trail.  Stay to the left at the fork as you start your walk.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located on the grounds of the Simeon Perkins Museum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simeon Perkins was born in Norwich, Connecticut and moved to Liverpool in 1762 as part of the New England Planter migration.  He immediately started in business trading for fish and lumber which he sold in New England, Newfoundland, Europe and the West Indies.  When war broke out between England and the colonies, Simeon, like most residents, remained neutral, owing to close family connections in New England.&lt;br/&gt;The toll taken on local businesses, by American warships capturing local vessels, caused many to shift allegiance to the British cause. After an attempted looting of the town by an Amerhcan ship, Perkins and a few others outfitted a ship and received a Letter of Marque and became privateers. &lt;br/&gt;Simeon Perkins owned or partnered in many privateers  that sailed from Liverpool, some with great success. One, the brig Rover, was said to be so successful preying on shipping near Cape cod, that the Cape Cod Canal was built to protect shipping from having to transit around the Cape, where privateers waited.&lt;br/&gt;Simeon Perkins was also active in public life, serving in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1765-1768 and again from 1770-1799. all together he held 27 public positions, none of which paid a salary.&lt;br/&gt;With all of this, Simeon Perkins is best know for the diary that he kept form 1766-1812 near his death.  The diary contains a wealth of information  on life in this era and records deaths, births and marriages,as well as ship sailings and arrivals. The diary is on display in the Museum which is open year round. You can also tour the original house from June to October.</groundspeak:long_description>

This series will be based on historical  people places and events in the history of the town.&lt;br/&gt;The first cache is in honour of Sylvanus Cobb.  Sylvanus Cobb was an original proprietor of the town. He was no stranger to the area of Nova Scotia, as he was at the first siege of Louisbourg in 1745. In 1748 he was master of a ship running between Annapolis and Boston.  In 1749 he purchased an armed sloop, the York, which he hired out to the British navy.  In 1755, during the Seven Years War, he took two prizes off  Cape Sable Island and was awarded a large amount of prize money by the Admiralty Court.&lt;br/&gt;In 1758  Sylvanus took General Wolfe under the guns of the fortress for a reconnaissance of the fortifications. General Wolfe gave much praise for the bravery and seamanship of Capt. Cobb.  &lt;br/&gt;In 1759 Capt. Cobb became a proprietor of the new township of Liverpool. Liverpool township was to run from Cape Sable Island to Port Medway and continuing 14 miles inland from the shore.  Sylvanus transported many of the other original residents to the new settlement.  On July 1, 1760, at the  first meeting of the proprietors, Capt. Cobb made a petition to be granted a piece of land to build a\house and a wharf.  The land was granted and the house was built at the foot of present day Wolf street. This  park is at the site of his original home which was built from materials he transported from New England.&lt;br/&gt;In 1762 the British sailed against the Spanish in Havana. While in Havana Capt. Sylvanus Cobb succumbed to a fever and died. |He was buried in Havana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first set of coordinates will take you to a monument to Sylvanus Cobb. To find the cache container you have to read the plaque and use the dates to find the final coordinates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final cache is at  N  44 02.A&lt;br/&gt;                                W 064 43.B&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find A you subtract 1300 from the first date on the plaque.  To get B you subtract 1213 from the last date on the plaque.  This will give you the coordinates of the final cache container.  The cache is a micro but does have a small FTF prize. Please use it wisely and don’t leave it in the woods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S11ZJ02 - Final cache&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

This bridge is somewhat interesting in that it pivots in the middle. When oceangoing ships came up the river, the drawbridge near the site of the present town bridge would open and the train bridge which has gears on the center span would pivot out of the way and allow ships to pass up as far as the present Morton House. There they would be laden with lumber from the Milton sawmills and would then float back down river to top off the load once they crossed the bar.&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a 35 mm film canister near the end of the bridge. The cache is winter friendly, but the trail can get slippery and the cache is near the bank, so care should be taken. Parking can be had at either end of the trail. Cache contains only a log, bring your own writing implement.</groundspeak:long_description>

The view from this cache shows the river and Mersey Seafoods, one of the major employers in the town. The interesting thing about this fish plant is that it was originally designed to move. It was built like a barge and could be towed to the fishery instead of having the fished hauled all the way back. It has never been moved since being placed here, but it is interesting that it could have been.</groundspeak:long_description>

The area along Bristol Avenue was a separate village called Bristol. The area where Mersey Seafoods rests was called Dean's Point. People travelling up and down he coast would have a servant ride a horse up the river to cross in Milton, or The Falls as it was then known, and then back down the river to either Bristol or Liverpool.  The owner would then cross the river at Dean's point by water ferry and then mount up and ride to their destination. This saved quite a bit of time on the horse for a wealthy landowner out to check on their holdings.&lt;br/&gt;In recent years this road was used to bypass Bristol Avenue for a major upgrade to the sewer and water lines.</groundspeak:long_description>

Built in 1855 it remains relatively unchanged. The light is named for the battery situated adjacent to it which protected the harbour from 1760 until 1860. the light guided many a mariner to safety in the harbour and the guns protected the town from numerous raids by American privateers. One such raid is depicted in July of each year during Privateer Days, complete with cannons and muskets firing.&lt;br/&gt;The light was manned from 1855 until 1951 when it was electrified and automated. The light is of an unusual design, and is described in nautical books as &quot;the frustrum of a pyramid on a square base&quot;.  during WWII it also housed a group of military weather watchers who shared the space inside with the keeper and his family.&lt;br/&gt;Today the light is open to the public as a museum and tourist information area. You can go in during opening  hours and climb the light tower and operate the foghorn.&lt;br/&gt;This can be a high muggle area, please use caution. Bring a writing utensil as there is none inside.</groundspeak:long_description>

They would sail up the river through the drawbridge at Bristol, and through the rotating train bridge. Here they would be loaded with lumber and in most cased apples for shipment to Europe and the West Indies. The land is now part of the Morton House B&amp;B. The owners graciously allow people to continue to use the wharf area for swimming and boating. The building near the bank is used by the Milton Canoe and Camera Club, who are very active in canoeing and boating in the area, often giving canoe and kayak lessons at this spot.</groundspeak:long_description>

I still fondly remember coming home from school and watching Archie shoeing horses or oxen. We used to watch in amazement as the sparks flew when he made the shoes or other implements that people needed. the museum is left pretty much as Archie McNight left it. You can almost hear the ring of the hammer on steel that was the hallmark of a blacksmith's shop.&lt;br/&gt;This series of caches are placed to honor the 250th anniversary of the founding of Liverpool. The original township grant covered the majority of present day Queens and Shelburne counties.</groundspeak:long_description>

A short walk will take you to the spot where, in my youth the village Cenotaph resided.  As kids we would go to the Remembrance Day Service at the Milton community Hall, then we would carry the wreaths to the Cenotaph to lay them out.  &lt;br/&gt;With the completion of Tupper Park on the other side of the river, the Cenotaph was relocated to make it easier for everyone to get to.&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located at the top of the hill and you can see the old cement pad from the cenotaph. A nice view of the area and the new Milton Cemetery are to be found here.  Cache is fairly out in the open.</groundspeak:long_description>

There were sawmills on both sides of the river. There were also no power dams on the Mersey. These were built in the 1920's as part of the construction of teh Mersey Paper mill, by Isaac Walton Killam. The new riverbed was blasted out of bedrock and diverted to make use of the hydroelectric turbines.  This moved much of the old riverbed below the present dam.&lt;br/&gt; The cache is located in an old fish ladder that is no longer near the water. You can see parts of the old dam nest to the old fish ladder.  The footing is a little rough and care should be taken on the rocks.&lt;br/&gt;There is a bench by the river to enjoy the view or maybe cast a line or two. It must be a great fishing spot since more fish have been caught here than ever swam up the river.</groundspeak:long_description>

Eh cache is a small Lock and Lock type of container. &lt;br/&gt;The old Cornwallis road is not much to look at, just another old logging road abandoned after it was no longer needed. It started with much loftier goals. &lt;br/&gt;When General Cornwallis was Governor of Nova Scotia, he set out a defense plan that included a network of roads to allow garrisons at different towns to support each other. He sent surveyors out to lay out this network of roads between major towns of the time. This road is built on part of the original road laid out to run from Liverpool to Annapolis. I don't think much of the road was ever built but this one, being on the original survey was called by many, The Old Cornwallis Road</groundspeak:long_description>

Young and old alike came from far and wide to enjoy a swing on the rope and a dip in the cool refreshing spring-fed lake. We enjoyed the rope swing for 25 years and it was old when we started.  Several years ago someone cut the tree down with a power saw, whether for safety reasons or out of malice is unknown. Many still use the area for swimming, so if you came cacheing bring your trunks and have a dip, the water is fine.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a very short walk from the car, and if you traversed down Old Liverpool Road, you can probably make this a P&amp;G too, otherwise, park near the sand pit and walk down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series of caches is placed along Old Liverpool Road and Halfway Road in Annapolis County.  Caches range from a bison tube to a large peanut butter jar, some cammoed some not and almost all are Park and Grabs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old Liverpool Road begins just off West Dalhousie Road near where it meets Highway 10.  It starts as a fairly good country road, deteriorates to a rough county road, and improves again.  Halfway Road is a two-lane dirt road that meets up with Lake Pleasant Road near where it meets Highway 10 in Springfield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The circuit took us approximately 2.5 hours to complete, keeping in mind that we placed caches all along the way.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A special thanks to F&amp;V for providing many of the caching containers that we used today.</groundspeak:long_description>

Keep looking, it IS there!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series of caches is placed along Old Liverpool Road and Halfway Road in Annapolis County.  Caches range from a bison tube to a large peanut butter jar, some cammoed some not and almost all are Park and Grabs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old Liverpool Road begins just off West Dalhousie Road near where it meets Highway 10.  It starts as a fairly good country road, deteriorates to a rough county road, and improves again.  Halfway Road is a two-lane dirt road that meets up with Lake Pleasant Road near where it meets Highway 10 in Springfield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The circuit took us approximately 2.5 hours to complete, keeping in mind that we placed caches all along the way.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A special thanks to F&amp;V for providing many of the caching containers that we used today.</groundspeak:long_description>

Thanks to Ervind for the idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is dedicated to the youngest girl Simpson (Maggie). It is a small Peanut butter jar, the co-ordinates might be off a bit because kept jumping at time of placement.

You're looking for a film canister.Homer took the small amount of Christmas money he made working as a Santa at the Springfield Mall and bet it at the dog track. Although Homer had inside information on which dog was going to win; he instead bet on the &quot;long shot,&quot; Santa's Little Helper, believing the dog's name to be a sign. Santa's Little Helper finished last and his frustrated owner abandoned him. Homer and Bart adopted Santa's Little Helper, and everyone was so happy that it was a merry Christmas after all.</groundspeak:long_description>

Well, it was one cache far away from any other cache, so it wasn't a huge priority, and to be quite honest, we didn't know how to get there.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We scouted it out once or twice, figured it out, but then didn't have time to go after the cache.  Today was different.  We wanted to make it easier for others to find their way to this cache.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This road is fairly decent for any type of SUV.  We've planted a series of P&amp;G caches all along it to make it more fun for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you arrive at this location, there's really only one good spot for a cache.  Look there and you will be rewarded.  You're looking for a PB jar.  Enjoy.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The geocache called &quot;Geocache&quot; was our closest to home cache that was still unfound for nearly two years.  What's the hold up you ask?  Well, it was one cache far away from any other cache, so it wasn't a huge priority, and to be quite honest, we didn't know how to get there.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We scouted it out once or twice, figured it out, but then didn't have time to go after the cache.  Today was different.  We wanted to make it easier for others to find their way to this cache.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This road is fairly decent for any type of SUV.  We've planted a series of P&amp;G caches all along it to make it more fun for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just past this cache, about 200 feet there is a small washout in the road.  We were able to navigate it without incident.  This is the worst spot in the road, it improves from here on out.</groundspeak:long_description>

We've planted a series of P&amp;G caches all along it to make it more fun for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ammo can is hidden at the parking.  The first 150 feet are the roughest, the rest is a nice trail.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located along the shoreline of Panuke Lake.  A boat is required to get you close then it is a straight up climb for almost 250 feet.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache will prove to be very challenging and dangerous.  If your used to urban park n grab style caching this one is NOT for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take highway 101 and take the St. Croix exit, travel towards St Croix and Three Mile Plains until you come to Panuke Road which is located at N44º 57.815 W064º 05.192 Follow Panuke Rd to the end and you will find the boat launch located at N44º 54.205 W064º 05.039&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located almost 18.5km South of the boat launch so if your considering paddling please prepare to make this a two or three day adventure. Paddlers need to pay attention to the wind conditions at all times on Panuke Lake. At times it can be impossible to paddle against the high winds on this lake and the wind direction can change to make for a hard paddle in both directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please bear in mind that this cache is in a remote wilderness area. There is no cell phone service and no nearby highways. You should NOT attempt this cache alone.  Once you reach N44º 44.508  W064º 07.865 you will need to leave your water craft and start the climb to the cache.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BE CAREFULL WHEN CLIMBING UP THE CLIFF FACE.  The rocks are covered in moss and lichen which are very slippery and to make things even more difficult the rocks are loose and wobbley.  It is only about a 80m climb but it is straight up and there is no trail.  BE VERY CAREFULL!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are up for this challenge you will be awarded with a great view of Panuke Lake and the satisfaction of knowing you completed a 5 star D/T geocache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a 50 cal. ammo can with lots of swag and a nice FTF prize.  It is winter friendly but I can't imagine anybody climbing this cliff with ice and snow on the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This challenging geocache is NOT for everyone.  Know you limits and stay safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLEASE BE VERY CAREFULL AND TAKE YOUR TIME WHEN CLIMBING UP AND DOWN THE CLIFF FACE!!! &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Pack a lunch and explore for the day.  Cell service is only available in a few spots, there are no services, and the roads are in fairly decent shape for most vehicles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this location you can see the names of the organizations that help to keep these roads maintained.  This small cache is located in an evergreen tree.  Enjoy your caching day in this beautiful area.</groundspeak:long_description>

Along a great series of snow mobile trails (which, consequently are in much better shape than many nearby roads) there are several directional signs and distance markers.  The last of 3 nanos along this route, you're seeking a magnet.  Enjoy the hunt.</groundspeak:long_description>

Yes again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, you're probably wondering why I'm sending you to a micro in the woods.  I'm guessing that you won't hate this one - please come out and prove me right!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located on the Fire road that serves as the access to my series of caches known as B.o.B and there are several other caches nearby.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a film canister that is in no way camouflaged.  In fact, it's been altered to make it more visible.  The name of the cache is a good place to start your search, which should be quick and easy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you happen to have a flashlight on you, it will aid in your hunt - however it is not at all necessary to find the cache.  You should be able to see it as soon as you get out of the car, providing you park in the right spot.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Give Micros a chance!  Try it, you might like it!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the 1st of a series of caches that are located on a few of my favorite smallmouth bass lakes.  Panuke Lake is a very popular lake for smallmouth bass tournments.  I was actually prefishing this lake for an upcoming tournment and took a break from fishing to hide this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find this cache you will need a boat.  There may be some backwoods logging road that I am unaware of which might make it possible to find the cache without a boat, however I am sure a boat, canoe, kayak, etc would be best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take highway 101 and take the St. Croix exit,  travel towards St Croix and Three Mile Plains until you come to Panuke Road which is located at N44º 57.815  W064º 05.192  Follow Panuke Rd to the end and you will find the boat launch located at N44º 54.205  W064º 05.039&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is north of the boat launch which is the area of the lake consisting of many dead trees and stumps sticking out of the water.  Smallmouth Bass love hiding in amongst these trees and stumps.  Boaters need to be carefull of the many stumps and trees that may be just below the surface.  The water level varies a great amount according to the time of year and the power dam located at the far north end of the lake.  At the time of placing the cache, the water level was very high.  In fact it was the highest I have ever seen it for this lake.  During the late summer and early fall the water level will be very low and the lake will look very different.  This also affects the fishing.  The spots I catch lots of fish changes according to the time of year and water level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located in a quiet little cove with a waterfall. The cove is almost 3km from the boat launch.  Paddlers need to pay attention to the wind conditions at all times on Panuke Lake.  At times it can be impossible to paddle against the high winds on this lake and the wind direction can change to make for a hard paddle in both directions.  The cache contains some of the normal trading stuff, log book, stash note and some fishing &quot;tackle&quot;.  For the FTF is an assortment of hand tied fishing flies. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is the reincarnation of GCKWMG &quot;The Matrix&quot; by Soul
Eagle. It is reinstated with his permission and full support.
Without Soul Eagle, this multi-cache would not be possible. Many
thanks to him for originally placing it, and for helping me to
reopen it.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
A challenging maze composed of multiple
waypoints and paths in which you must navigate to find the cache
and decisions you make determine how long you spend in &lt;b&gt;THE
MATRIX&lt;/b&gt;. Located in a picnic park under a stand of red pine; 3
km east of Kingston on Route 1; off Hwy 101 between Exits 16 and
17.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To start, park near the given
coordinates and look for the first clue. Clues consist of a metal
tag with two rows of 7 characters in 1/4&quot; letters. In each row from
left to right you will find a letter, which is the clue
designation, followed by the last three digits each of the LAT and
LON in decimal minutes.&lt;br /&gt;
The remaining part of the coordinates is the same as the start
position. There will also be a letter on the left side of the tag
between the two rows and is the present waypoint designation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(Clue Example: A123456
=&lt;br /&gt;
Clue/Waypoint A - Nxx°xx.123'
Wxxx°xx.456')&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clues are easily visible and within reach of the average person but
placed as to be inconspicuous. There are trails or roads that lead
to all clues and cache is less than 15m of a trail so no
bushwhacking. All clues will lead you toward the cache but
decisions you make, determine how many waypoints you go through
(Min 4 - Max 12).&lt;br /&gt;
Rated D-3.5 because of the waypoints, complexity, distance and time
factors. The terrain is easy and scenic but be prepared to spend an
hour and walk a average of 1500m to find your way to the cache. The
average distance between clues is 200m; the longest is 600m.&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is available year round, kid friendly and in a large plastic
container.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Helpful tips: A basic map is available and
helpful but not necessary to find the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
The park is closed Oct 11 - May 21 to vehicle traffic but
accessible year round on foot and you may see geomuggles. Due to
the abundance of tall trees, your GPS may wander. Read tags
carefuly due to imperfect stamping and note&lt;br /&gt;
3 &amp; 5 have a flat top while 6 &amp; 8 have a round top.&lt;br /&gt;
Read the whole description carefully.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Town of Berwick's Recreation Department is teaming up with Geoken and Ramblin 'Rose to provide a free outdoor adventure on October 22, 2011 at 1:00pm. Join us at the Berwick Town Hall for some exciting fun and our first Geocache Event: Intro to Geocaching. Geocaching is an outdoor treasure hunt where participants use a GPS device to “hide and seek” containers called geocaches. You will learn all there is to know about geocac...hing, browse a display table, and get the chance to look for local geocaches!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Introduction to Geocaching session will be directed to people recently involved in Geocaching, or those looking to learn more. Enthusiasts will instruct a two-part session for all ages on Geocaching with a classroom training session followed by an outdoor field session. Participants are encouraged to bring a GPS as there will only be a limited supply available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The indoor session will include:&lt;br/&gt;• Introduction to geocaching&lt;br/&gt;• How to get started&lt;br/&gt;• GPS Overview&lt;br/&gt;• Trackables&lt;br/&gt;• Etiquette principles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take home handouts will cover details step by step, assisting in exploring beyond the introductory level. At the end of the session, we'll move outdoors with GPS units in hand to begin our journey of discovery...ending with the &quot;find&quot; of actual geocaches located nearby in the Town. A team of experienced field assistants will be on hand to ensure everyone gets as much personal attention as necessary to make their first geocaching expedition a success!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Date: October 22, 2011 at 1:00pm- until participants find the Treasure(around 4:00pm)&lt;br/&gt;Location: Berwick Town Hall, 236 Commercial Street Berwick, NS &lt;br/&gt;N45 02.784 and W64 44.153&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt; As one of my geobuddies, Nova Man, said in the write-up for a cache he placed recently, &quot;I think all exits should have a P&amp;G so long as it is safe to park.&quot; I totally agree. So here is one at Exit 12 on Highway 101. 
&lt;p&gt;It is in a spot where muggles abound early in the day and again late in the day.  Throughout the day others drop by to check their mail nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize - it's a nano due only to the high muggle factor. Bring your own pen or pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache itself is winter friendly, although getting to ground zero may be challenging in deep snow! In wet weather waterproof boots may be wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Nova Man on the FTF! He will be receiving a Tim Hortons card on me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

The cache is located along the lower portion of the trail. The best starting route is near the picnic shelters and travel down the steep hills to the bottom. There are three bridges along the way. Start having a look around when you reach the second. You'll be looking for a container with log book, pencil, and various small objects for trading inside.</groundspeak:long_description>

River. This area can sometimes have lots of muggles, so some
stealth maybe required. Be CAUTIOUS when venturing off the trail.
There are steep banks and can be slippery. This cache can be
accessed during winter month, however with deep snow the cache
maybe more difficult to find. Happy hunting&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located at the site of the original Deportation Cross in Grand-Pre before it was moved to Horton Landing in 2005.  Travel to Grand-Pre and park in the National Historic Site's overflow/picnic area, located across the road from the main building. From there you can walk the dyke road that's right next to it. It's an excellent gravel road, but remember it's how local farmers travel from field to field so keep an eye out for working machinery during planting or harvest season. After about a 12 minute walk you'll come across a railroad crossing on your right. At this point you'll need to start following the tracks to get to your destination. The railway has been long abandoned so there is a fair amount of growth along the way. If you stay on the tracks it is easily passable. You'll come across another railway crossing. Travel straight through it and continue along the tracks for a few more minutes. The original location of the Deportation Cross is nearby. It stood there from August 1924 to June 2005. Since it was on private land, the cache is hidden up near the tracks so there is no fear of trespassing. You'll be looking for a container with log book, pencil, and various small objects for trading inside.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is also the option to pass the wharf and park along a pull-off at the corner. If you decide to park here, you may want to take a minute to check out the beach since there is a path leading down to it from here. Either way, you'll need to cross the road to get to the cache. The path leading down to the stream isn't well marked and not very obvious if you're not looking for it. If you have trouble locating it, use the coords included. Once you start down the path, continue traveling up stream to get to the cache location. You'll be looking for a container with log book, pencil, and various small objects for trading inside.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;CC341M1 - Path to the stream&lt;br/&gt;N 45° 10.214 W 064° 44.609</groundspeak:long_description>

The terrain is generally quite easy as you'll spend most of your time on the beach. Coming from Halls Harbour, travel along West Halls Harbour Rd and turn onto Simpson Rd. Turn right onto Huntington Point Rd and travel to the end where you'll find a small parking area. Walk west along the beach past all the cottages until you get to a semi-secluded area with a stream run-off and pond. You will find the cache nearby. It is hidden above the shoreline as the tides can reach very high levels at various times of the year. Inside you'll find a log book, pencil, and various small objects for trading.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The area around Blomidon Provincial Park is one of many locations in the Atlantic Provinces said to have been a campsite of the Mi’kmaq legendary character Glooscap. Its rugged coastline and steep slopes were said to be a desirable site for Glooscap’s camp because of its great view and its unattainable walls, he could survey the area for miles.&lt;br/&gt;Many legends tell of Glooscap’s adventures in Mi’kma’ki, land of the Mi’kmaq. One of these stories talks about the day Glooscap left the Mi’kmaw people. Glooscap gathered all the peoples of the land on the high cliffs of Blomidon, and told them he must go on to new areas and teach new people. As a gift from the Mi’kmaq people, they presented Glooscap with a stone pipe. Glooscap thanked the people of Blomidon and accepted the pipe gift. Glooscap then called on the whale for transportation. The first whale to answer his call was a Finback whale, he was far too small to carry Glooscap on his back so Glooscap asked for this whale’s bigger brother. The Finback whale swam off and got his biggest brother, the Blue Whale. The Blue Whale came into the cliffs of Blomidon and asked Glooscap if he needed a ride.&lt;br/&gt;Glooscap travelled off on the back of the Blue Whale and headed West down the Bay of Fundy and then off into the sea. The Whale swam for days and was very tired so Glooscap told the Whale that his part of this trip was done. Glooscap thanked the Whale and wanted to present him with a gift in thanks for all of the help that the whale had given. Glooscap looked in his travel wrap and took out the pipe that he had been given; Glooscap said that he wanted the whale to have it. Glooscap said to the whale, when you get back to Mi’kma’ki tell the people that even though I have gone on a journey that I will return to Mi’kma’ki in their greatest time of need. ... The Whale swam off, back home, smoking his new pipe.&lt;br/&gt;That is why today we are reminded of Glooscap’s promise of returning, every time we see the blow of a whale’s spout. That’s just the smoke of the pipe that the Mi’kmaq gave Glooscap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This geocache is part of the 2011 NS Provincial Parks Geocaching challenge.

Named after the Mi'kmaq man-god, Glosscap, this travel way is full of exciting legends and sites of cultural significance to the Mi'kmaw people. On the northern shore of the Minas Basin you will find Five Islands Provincial Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mi'kmaq legend says that the native god Glooscap created these five islands - Moose, Diamond, Long, Egg and Pinnacle (These rocks are visible today as islands near the park's headland.) - when he threw chunks of sod at a &quot;Mi'kmuesu&quot;, a Mi'kmaw Wizard who was mocking the powers of Glooscap and who turned himself into a giant beaver to escape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Mi'kmaq legend, Glooscap was created by Gisoolg (the one who has created you) and who was brought to life by 3 bolts of lightning stricking the red sands of the Bay of Fundy. The first bolt gave him shape, the second gave him life but was still connected to the land, all he could do was observe and learn. The third bolt of lightning set him free to travel throughout Mi'kmaki to teach the Mi'kmaw people about the environment and the wisdom and knowledge of how to live with it's plants and animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This geocache is part of the 2011 NS Provincial Parks Geocaching challenge.

This is midway along the beautiful and rugged coastal trail. I suggest you park at the Herring cove beach parking lot and walk up to it although it is accessible from the other end of the trail near the pool if you prefer a longer walk. Cache is about 600 meters in from the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can you imagine looking out on the bay and seeing scows, steamers, schooners and other sailing vessels? Ships were not only built out of ports such as Alma, but large vessels sailed into port and further up into the bay, as the main highway for transportation was the water. While larger vessels waited off shore, smaller vessels such as scows and barges would transport lumber from the wharf. Take some time to sit and take in the view or explore along the beach
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Français&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ce lieu est à mi-chemin le long du magnifique et robuste sentier Coastal Trail. Je vous suggère de stationner dans le parc de stationnement de la plage Herring Cove et marcher jusqu'à à mais, il est accessible à partir de l'autre extrémité de la piste près de la piscine si vous préférez une promenade plus longue. La cache est environ 600 mètres du stationnement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pouvez-vous imaginer regarder sur la baie et de voir les chalands, les bateaux à vapeur, des goélettes et autres bateaux à voile? Des navires ont été non seulement construit dans les ports tels que Alma, mais les grands navires naviguaient dans le port et plus haut dans la baie, car la route principale pour le transport était l'eau. Alors que les grands navires attendaient au large des côtes, des plus petits navires tels que les chalands et péniches permettraient de transporter du bois à partir du quai. Prenez le temps de s'asseoir et de profiter de la vue ou d'explorer le long de la plage.

This cache is located close to where the old covered bridge used to cross the river to the park, if you look across to Alma you can still see the remnants of the old bridge footing. This is the quickest and easiest find of this year's caches.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is the site where the Alma covered bridge connected both sides of the Upper Salmon river. It was a one way bridge, spanning 985feet long. Built in 1920, the portion that was uncovered swung open to allow boats upriver. A second bridge was built that could accommodate two lanes of traffic which we 
use today. The covered bridge was torn down in 1968 as it was no longer required.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Français&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cette cache est située à proximité de l'endroit où le vieux pont couvert était utilisé pour traverser la rivière dans le parc, si vous regardez vers Alma, vous pouvez encore voir les vestiges de la semelle de l'ancien pont. C'est la plus rapide et plus facile des caches à trouver de cette année.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
C'est le site où le pont de l'Alma couverte connectant des deux côtés de la rivière Upper Salmon. Il était un pont à une voie, couvrant 985 pieds en longueur. Construit en 1920, la partie qui a été découverte s'ouvrit pour permettre aux bateaux à monter la rivière. Un deuxième pont a été construit qui pouvait accueillir deux voies de circulation que nous utilisons aujourd'hui. Le pont couvert a été démoli en 1968, car il n'était plus nécessaire.</groundspeak:long_description>

thicket of young evergreens between Blair Lake Road and the Trans
Canada. It is well hidden from muggles. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the time of placement the cache contained a stash note, log
book, pencils and post cards. There are no trading items in the
cache. The smaller inner container is for the log book and small
post cards. Use it to send letters and postcards to other
geocachers! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not sure how a geo-post office works? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These caches are placed to hold postcards or small items. Each
postcard or item will have a short message and a forwarding address
on it. The address will contain the person's name that you are
trying to send the postcard to, their home city, and a destination
cache. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The idea is to move postcards between Geo-Post Offices until they
reach their destination. When you move a postcard or message from
one place to another, let the person who it's being sent to know
where you moved it to, because they might be near enough to go and
pick it up. If you move a postcard from one Geo-Post Office to
another, please move it closer to the city or cache! You can send
any message you want to anyone you want! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How do you get started? Easy! Just write up your postcard and drop
it in the Geo-Post Office! &lt;br /&gt;

This park was once a large pond before being bulldozed by the
powers that be years ago. The pond was the site of several
factories that used the brook for power. Several willow trees
surrounded the pond which went over behind the fire hall across the
street as far as the ball field. People gathered here to curl and
skate in the winter. In summer bands would play on floating
bandstands while vendors sold hot roasted peanuts. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 ** The cache will survive the winter but you may have to dig. **

inside of the bag as you found it. You may have to dig around for
this during winter the way the snow drifts around here. The cache
has been given extra protection for winter. There is no need to go
anywhere near the train tracks or cross them, so please don't.
Enjoy the cache. &lt;br /&gt;

I was up this way caching and realized that I have found more
caches in New Brunswick than Nova Scotia. This is a small thank-you
to all of you in New Brunswick that have placed caches. I get great
pleasure out of the ongoing search for them. Thanks for all the
time and effort!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Alberton Railway Station building is a fine example of an Edwardian railway station in PEI. It is located in the Town of Alberton near the former railway tracks which is now part of the Confederation Trail. The station has been incorporated as a tourist information centre into a green space known as Stone Station Park. It has adjacent picnic areas and shade trees. The registration includes the footprint of the building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Alberton Railway Station is significant as one of only 2 &quot;boulder stations&quot; constructed in PEI. The other is at Kensington, PEI. It was built of granite stone in 1904-1905 according to the design of the architect, Charles B. Chappell (1857-1931). He was born in Charlottetown and became noted for his work in other areas of the Maritimes. In PEI, he designed the Charlottetown City Hall (1887) and former Prince of Wales College Building (1898) which has since been destroyed. The Alberton Station served a vital economic role in Alberton until it closed in 1971.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please leave as found (or better) and sign the logbook!&lt;br/&gt;BYOP!&lt;br/&gt;(Bring your own pen/pencil!)&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember - the decision to search for any geocache (or to participate in any outdoor activity), and the responsibility for your own safety lies with you!</groundspeak:long_description>
