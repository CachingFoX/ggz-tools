            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located within Thomas Raddall Provincial Park is a very special kind of archaeological site; a site of shell middens.

The E'se'get Archaeology Project, E'se'get is the Mi'kmaw word meaning &quot;to dig for clams&quot; and a midden is a communal dump site for domestic waste. Researchers from the Canadian Museum of Civilization have been working with a dozen undergraduate archaeology students from the University of New Brunswick in these ancient shell heaps. The middens in this location, made of clam, mussel and oyster shells were collected and eaten by Mi'kmaq 500 to 2000 years ago.

Working in shell middens can offer some important information because of the calcium carbonate in the shell heaps help preserve organic materials. Bone, antler and other biodegradable materials of cultural significance would normally be dissolved into our Maritime acidic soil. Other artificats like stone tools, pottery, fire hearths and dwelling features found in and around the middens provide and opportunity to learn about the Mi'kmaw way of life along the coastal shores of Mi'kmaki; land of the Mi'kmaq. The E'se'get Archaeology Project is looking to understand the connection between the Mi'kmaq and their marine ecosystem and environment.

From the Liverpool side there is lots of parking behind the Municipal Building and the trail starts right there. There is a small parking spot on the other end where the trail crosses Highway #3.
The cache is a Lok &amp; Lok plastic camoed container between a small &amp; reg. in size. At hiding it contained a log, pencil, pen, a varity of small trade items and a FIRST TO FIND PRIZE!!!! Enjoy.

FTF honors go to______Harley Privateers____ Congratulations !!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">My 9 year old daughter has found some geocaches with me and now she wanted to hide one.  So today we hid one along a nice trail just outside of the town of Liverpool that doesn't seem to be used very much.  Maybe geocaching will change that.

The Meadow Pond Brook Walking Trail is a 1km trail though a mature forest of large pines and hardwoods.  The coords listed below are for the parking area/trailhead.  Once you start on the trail it does fork off in two directions.  Stay to the left and follow the well maintained path which does form a loop.  If you take the right side trail at the begining you will end up on the abandoned railway trail which does NOT lead to the cache.

The cache is located off the trail a little bit(minor bushwacking) to prevent it from being muggled.  Please rehide the cache as well or better then you found it.  The cache is a large camoed peanut butter jar filled with some kids toys and a log book. 

FTF prize is a new unactivated set of Travel Bug Dog Tags.

Park here and follow the trail.  Stay to the left at the fork as you start your walk.

You will have to either backup a little or pull ahead a little from where the cache is located to get the best view. If possible please take a picture and post it to show what the view was like 
for your visit. The cache is available all year long.

I will be adding more caches to this series as time and opportunity allow, please take the time to enjoy each one as they are posted.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Parking coords are listed for the starting point.  Once you are at the posted coords above, you will find a small loc-n-loc container hidden(winter friendly).  This is the easy part, now it gets tougher. 

Inside the small loc-n-loc are some playing cards and instructions on how to figure out the final cache coords.  Please don't remove anything from this container and reshuffle the cards before rehiding the container back in it's hidey hole.  The final cache is no more then 550m from the starting point.  No heavy bushwacking is required at anytime.  The final cache is relatively winter friendly.  If there is a couple feet of snow, a little digging may be required to find the cache's hidey hole.  Please rehide both the containers as well as you found them or better.

Good luck and remember it is all in the cards.

We present you an official ACGA cache. It is only a short walk from the parking lot nearby and site of the 1st Geocache in Canada monument, indicating the coordinates of GCBBA.

The cache is .50 cal ammo can. Inside you will find a Rite-in-Rain log book, stash note, geocaching pencils and swag contributed by the geocaching community at the 7th Anniversary of Geocaching in Canada Event (GC11AQT).

Check out the other geocaches located on the Island, and of course visit GCBBA.

This series of caches is placed along Old Liverpool Road and Halfway Road in Annapolis County.  Caches range from a bison tube to a large peanut butter jar, some cammoed some not and almost all are Park and Grabs.  

Old Liverpool Road begins just off West Dalhousie Road near where it meets Highway 10.  It starts as a fairly good country road, deteriorates to a rough county road, and improves again.  Halfway Road is a two-lane dirt road that meets up with Lake Pleasant Road near where it meets Highway 10 in Springfield.

The circuit took us approximately 2.5 hours to complete, keeping in mind that we placed caches all along the way.  

A special thanks to F&amp;V for providing many of the caching containers that we used today.</groundspeak:long_description>

This series of caches is placed along Old Liverpool Road and Halfway Road in Annapolis County.  Caches range from a bison tube to a large peanut butter jar, some cammoed some not and almost all are Park and Grabs.  

Old Liverpool Road begins just off West Dalhousie Road near where it meets Highway 10.  It starts as a fairly good country road, deteriorates to a rough county road, and improves again.  Halfway Road is a two-lane dirt road that meets up with Lake Pleasant Road near where it meets Highway 10 in Springfield.

The circuit took us approximately 2.5 hours to complete, keeping in mind that we placed caches all along the way.  

A special thanks to F&amp;V for providing many of the caching containers that we used today.</groundspeak:long_description>

This series of caches is placed along Old Liverpool Road and Halfway Road in Annapolis County. Caches range from a bison tube to a large peanut butter jar, some cammoed some not and almost all are Park and Grabs.

Old Liverpool Road begins just off West Dalhousie Road near where it meets Highway 10. It starts as a fairly good country road, deteriorates to a rough county road, and improves again. Halfway Road is a two-lane dirt road that meets up with Lake Pleasant Road near where it meets Highway 10 in Springfield.

The circuit took us approximately 2.5 hours to complete, keeping in mind that we placed caches all along the way.

A special thanks to F&amp;V for providing many of the caching containers that we used today.</groundspeak:long_description>

The original container went missing so, while this replacement is hidden in a similar manner to the original, it is moved 55 feet into the woods from the road.

This series of caches is placed along Old Liverpool Road and Halfway Road in Annapolis County. Caches range from a bison tube to a large peanut butter jar, some cammoed some not and almost all are Park and Grabs.

Old Liverpool Road begins just off West Dalhousie Road near where it meets Highway 10. It starts as a fairly good country road, deteriorates to a rough county road, and improves again. Halfway Road is a two-lane dirt road that meets up with Lake Pleasant Road near where it meets Highway 10 in Springfield.

The circuit took us approximately 2.5 hours to complete, keeping in mind that we placed caches all along the way.

A special thanks to F&amp;V for providing many of the caching containers that we used today.</groundspeak:long_description>

We know they do not actually live in this Springfield but who knows, they just might. If so, it is purely coincidental and this series is inspired by the &quot;Bunker&quot; series in Yarmouth, NS. Thanks to Ervind for the idea.

This cache is dedicated to the youngest girl Simpson (Maggie). It is a small Peanut butter jar, the co-ordinates might be off a bit because kept jumping at time of placement. Also, there were Muggles across when we were placing the cache as well.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is dedicated to the loving wife and mother of the Simpson family. Marge is the glue that holds the family together.  Beware of muggles because the cache is located in a high traffic area.  It appears as though this spot is especially busy on Wednesday evenings.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is dedicated to Lisa Simpson. At eight years old Lisa is the second child of Homer  and Marge, younger sister of Bart, and older sister of Maggie. She is highly intelligent and plays the baritone saxophone. Lisa was something of a &quot;female Bart&quot; who mirrored her brother's mischief, but as the series progressed she became a more sophisticated and intellectual character. Lisa is the most intellectual member of the Simpson family, and many episodes of the series focus on her fighting for various causes. The cache is a small Peanut butter jar.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is actually dedicated to a Simpson  T.V. Show character. We could not resist putting a cache here since it fell into both our Simpson and B.o.B series of caches.</groundspeak:long_description>

Roads in this part of the countryside can be rough.  On nearby Highway 10 the residents have picket signs on their lawns &quot;Pave our Road&quot; and there are &quot;Rough Road Ahead&quot; signs everywhere.  One such sign had said &quot;next 13 kms&quot; and a frustrated resident changed it to 113 kms.  This sign is similar, as you will see when you get there.</groundspeak:long_description>

Santa's Little Helper is the family's pet dog.  You're looking for a film canister.Homer took the small amount of Christmas money he made working as a Santa at the Springfield Mall and bet it at the dog track. Although Homer had inside information on which dog was going to win; he instead bet on the &quot;long shot,&quot; Santa's Little Helper, believing the dog's name to be a sign. Santa's Little Helper finished last and his frustrated owner abandoned him. Homer and Bart adopted Santa's Little Helper, and everyone was so happy that it was a merry Christmas after all.</groundspeak:long_description>

Snowball is the family's pet cat.  This cache is a film canister near a stream. Snowball V, a dark grey female cat that first appeared in &quot;I D'oh-Bot&quot; and has been the family cat ever since. In order to save money on a new food dish, Snowball V was renamed Snowball II to save confusion about the cats before her. She is the current cat owned by the family.</groundspeak:long_description>

We scouted it out once or twice, figured it out, but then didn't have time to go after the cache.  Today was different.  We wanted to make it easier for others to find their way to this cache.  

This road is fairly decent for any type of SUV.  We've planted a series of P&amp;G caches all along it to make it more fun for you.

Once you arrive at this location, there's really only one good spot for a cache.  Look there and you will be rewarded.  You're looking for a PB jar.  Enjoy.</groundspeak:long_description>

Just past this cache, about 200 feet there is a small washout in the road.  We were able to navigate it without incident.  This is the worst spot in the road, it improves from here on out.</groundspeak:long_description>

We scouted it out once or twice, figured it out, but then didn't have time to go after the cache.  Today was different.  We wanted to make it easier for others to find their way to this cache.

This ammo can is hidden at the parking.  The first 150 feet are the roughest, the rest is a nice trail.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located along the shoreline of Panuke Lake.  A boat is required to get you close then it is a straight up climb for almost 250 feet.  

This cache will prove to be very challenging and dangerous.  If your used to urban park n grab style caching this one is NOT for you.

Take highway 101 and take the St. Croix exit, travel towards St Croix and Three Mile Plains until you come to Panuke Road which is located at N44º 57.815 W064º 05.192 Follow Panuke Rd to the end and you will find the boat launch located at N44º 54.205 W064º 05.039

The cache is located almost 18.5km South of the boat launch so if your considering paddling please prepare to make this a two or three day adventure. Paddlers need to pay attention to the wind conditions at all times on Panuke Lake. At times it can be impossible to paddle against the high winds on this lake and the wind direction can change to make for a hard paddle in both directions.

Please bear in mind that this cache is in a remote wilderness area. There is no cell phone service and no nearby highways. You should NOT attempt this cache alone.  Once you reach N44º 44.508  W064º 07.865 you will need to leave your water craft and start the climb to the cache.  

BE CAREFULL WHEN CLIMBING UP THE CLIFF FACE.  The rocks are covered in moss and lichen which are very slippery and to make things even more difficult the rocks are loose and wobbley.  It is only about a 80m climb but it is straight up and there is no trail.  BE VERY CAREFULL!!!

If you are up for this challenge you will be awarded with a great view of Panuke Lake and the satisfaction of knowing you completed a 5 star D/T geocache.

The cache is a 50 cal. ammo can with lots of swag and a nice FTF prize.  It is winter friendly but I can't imagine anybody climbing this cliff with ice and snow on the ground.

This challenging geocache is NOT for everyone.  Know you limits and stay safe.

PLEASE BE VERY CAREFULL AND TAKE YOUR TIME WHEN CLIMBING UP AND DOWN THE CLIFF FACE!!!

Pack a lunch and explore for the day.  Cell service is only available in a few spots, there are no services, and the roads are in fairly decent shape for most vehicles.

At this location you can see the names of the organizations that help to keep these roads maintained.  This small cache is located in an evergreen tree.  Enjoy your caching day in this beautiful area.</groundspeak:long_description>

This won't be as difficult as you think it might be.  Along a great series of snow mobile trails (which, consequently are in much better shape than many nearby roads) there are several directional signs and distance markers.  The second of 3 nanos along this route, you're seeking a magnet.  Enjoy the hunt.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is a large tube hidden under some rocks.  It's not winter friendly.  Enjoy these back-roads, we do!

This area is one of the only spots along these backroads where there is cell phone and/or internet service.  If you need to check clues or 'phone a friend' this is the place to do it.</groundspeak:long_description>

Several of these caches in this series are located on a well maintained dirt road that links Torbrook and Fox Mountain.

This area is very popular with hunters, so use caution.

This cache should be a quick easy find.

This won't be as difficult as you think it might be.  Along a great series of snow mobile trails (which, consequently are in much better shape than many nearby roads) there are several directional signs and distance markers.  The last of 3 nanos along this route, you're seeking a magnet.  Enjoy the hunt.</groundspeak:long_description>

So, you're probably wondering why I'm sending you to a micro in the woods.  I'm guessing that you won't hate this one - please come out and prove me right!

This cache is located on the Fire road that serves as the access to my series of caches known as B.o.B and there are several other caches nearby.  

You are looking for a film canister that is in no way camouflaged.  In fact, it's been altered to make it more visible.  The name of the cache is a good place to start your search, which should be quick and easy.  

If you happen to have a flashlight on you, it will aid in your hunt - however it is not at all necessary to find the cache.  You should be able to see it as soon as you get out of the car, providing you park in the right spot.  

Give Micros a chance!  Try it, you might like it!</groundspeak:long_description>

Several of these caches in this series are located on a well maintained dirt road that links Torbrook and Fox Mountain.

This area is very popular with hunters, so use caution.

Since this B.o.B is, in pretty rough shape, we decided it best to put the cache a little bit away from the bridge itself.  You will need to &quot;Watch your Step&quot;.  The improvised cache container may help you to do just that.  Enjoy your hunt.  You're looking about 4 feet up for this winter friendly cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is a small (1.5x1.5.1 inch) camoed plastic container.  Please bring your own writing stick.  

The first five caches in this series are located on a well maintained dirt road that links Torbrook and Fox Mountain.  

This area is very popular with hunters, so use caution.  

The river is very pretty - be sure to take time to enjoy your surroundings.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the 1st of a series of caches that are located on a few of my favorite smallmouth bass lakes.  Panuke Lake is a very popular lake for smallmouth bass tournments.  I was actually prefishing this lake for an upcoming tournment and took a break from fishing to hide this cache.

To find this cache you will need a boat.  There may be some backwoods logging road that I am unaware of which might make it possible to find the cache without a boat, however I am sure a boat, canoe, kayak, etc would be best.

Take highway 101 and take the St. Croix exit,  travel towards St Croix and Three Mile Plains until you come to Panuke Road which is located at N44º 57.815  W064º 05.192  Follow Panuke Rd to the end and you will find the boat launch located at N44º 54.205  W064º 05.039

The cache is north of the boat launch which is the area of the lake consisting of many dead trees and stumps sticking out of the water.  Smallmouth Bass love hiding in amongst these trees and stumps.  Boaters need to be carefull of the many stumps and trees that may be just below the surface.  The water level varies a great amount according to the time of year and the power dam located at the far north end of the lake.  At the time of placing the cache, the water level was very high.  In fact it was the highest I have ever seen it for this lake.  During the late summer and early fall the water level will be very low and the lake will look very different.  This also affects the fishing.  The spots I catch lots of fish changes according to the time of year and water level.

The cache is located in a quiet little cove with a waterfall. The cove is almost 3km from the boat launch.  Paddlers need to pay attention to the wind conditions at all times on Panuke Lake.  At times it can be impossible to paddle against the high winds on this lake and the wind direction can change to make for a hard paddle in both directions.  The cache contains some of the normal trading stuff, log book, stash note and some fishing &quot;tackle&quot;.  For the FTF is an assortment of hand tied fishing flies.

The cache is a small (1.5x1.5.1 inch) camoed plastic container.  Please bring your own writing stick.  

The first five caches in this series are located on a well maintained dirt road that links Torbrook and Fox Mountain.  

This area is very popular with hunters, so use caution. 

Please don't attempt this one in icy conditions and take care not to fall!  This cache is not suitable for small children.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This multi cache will take you to a few areas managed by Kings County Recreation.  It was placed as a part of the NS Winter Caching Challenge, 2010.

Upon arrival at the first waypoint you need to search for coordinates to the second stage.  It is approximately 7 kms by road from WP1 to WP2.  At the second stage, you must search for coordinates to the final location of the geocache.  

All stages are winter friendly and the final is a regular sized mayo jar that has been cammoed to its environment.

Please enjoy this beautiful spot.  While the locations are all near roads and/or houses, please exercise caution in hunting season and dress appropriately.  All locations can be high muggle areas in summer.

The cache is dedicated to H.Chipman for several reasons:

1.  This cacher has several caches that use this type of container.
2.  This container was a FTF prize in a Chipman cache.
3.  Our 3000th find was a Chipman cache.

You are seeking a NANO in the woods.


Congratulations to hchipman for the FTF!  How appropriate!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is the reincarnation of GCKWMG &quot;The Matrix&quot; by Soul
Eagle. It is reinstated with his permission and full support.
Without Soul Eagle, this multi-cache would not be possible. Many
thanks to him for originally placing it, and for helping me to
reopen it.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
A challenging maze composed of multiple
waypoints and paths in which you must navigate to find the cache
and decisions you make determine how long you spend in &lt;b&gt;THE
MATRIX&lt;/b&gt;. Located in a picnic park under a stand of red pine; 3
km east of Kingston on Route 1; off Hwy 101 between Exits 16 and
17.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To start, park near the given
coordinates and look for the first clue. Clues consist of a metal
tag with two rows of 7 characters in 1/4&quot; letters. In each row from
left to right you will find a letter, which is the clue
designation, followed by the last three digits each of the LAT and
LON in decimal minutes.&lt;br/&gt;
The remaining part of the coordinates is the same as the start
position. There will also be a letter on the left side of the tag
between the two rows and is the present waypoint designation.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(Clue Example: A123456
=&lt;br/&gt;
Clue/Waypoint A - Nxx°xx.123'
Wxxx°xx.456')&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Clues are easily visible and within reach of the average person but
placed as to be inconspicuous. There are trails or roads that lead
to all clues and cache is less than 15m of a trail so no
bushwhacking. All clues will lead you toward the cache but
decisions you make, determine how many waypoints you go through
(Min 4 - Max 12).&lt;br/&gt;
Rated D-3.5 because of the waypoints, complexity, distance and time
factors. The terrain is easy and scenic but be prepared to spend an
hour and walk a average of 1500m to find your way to the cache. The
average distance between clues is 200m; the longest is 600m.&lt;br/&gt;
Cache is available year round, kid friendly and in a large plastic
container.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Helpful tips: A basic map is available and
helpful but not necessary to find the cache.&lt;br/&gt;
The park is closed Oct 11 - May 21 to vehicle traffic but
accessible year round on foot and you may see geomuggles. Due to
the abundance of tall trees, your GPS may wander. Read tags
carefuly due to imperfect stamping and note&lt;br/&gt;
3 &amp; 5 have a flat top while 6 &amp; 8 have a round top.&lt;br/&gt;
Read the whole description carefully.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Note - Stay away from the wooden structure, it is unsafe also look at the hint and your gps for location.

Update for October, 2010 - I have increased the difficulty due to the plethora of DNF - I guess it is harder than I thought.</groundspeak:long_description>

Join us at the Berwick Town Hall for some exciting fun and our first Geocache Event: Intro to Geocaching. Geocaching is an outdoor treasure hunt where participants use a GPS device to “hide and seek” containers called geocaches. You will learn all there is to know about geocac...hing, browse a display table, and get the chance to look for local geocaches!

The Introduction to Geocaching session will be directed to people recently involved in Geocaching, or those looking to learn more. Enthusiasts will instruct a two-part session for all ages on Geocaching with a classroom training session followed by an outdoor field session. Participants are encouraged to bring a GPS as there will only be a limited supply available.

The indoor session will include:
• Introduction to geocaching
• How to get started
• GPS Overview
• Trackables
• Etiquette principles

Take home handouts will cover details step by step, assisting in exploring beyond the introductory level. At the end of the session, we'll move outdoors with GPS units in hand to begin our journey of discovery...ending with the &quot;find&quot; of actual geocaches located nearby in the Town. A team of experienced field assistants will be on hand to ensure everyone gets as much personal attention as necessary to make their first geocaching expedition a success!

Date: October 22, 2011 at 1:00pm- until participants find the Treasure(around 4:00pm)
Location: Berwick Town Hall, 236 Commercial Street Berwick, NS 
N45 02.784 and W64 44.153

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt; As one of my geobuddies, Nova Man, said in the write-up for a cache he placed recently, &quot;I think all exits should have a P&amp;G so long as it is safe to park.&quot; I totally agree. So here is one at Exit 12 on Highway 101. 
&lt;p&gt;It is in a spot where muggles abound early in the day and again late in the day.  Throughout the day others drop by to check their mail nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize - it's a nano due only to the high muggle factor. Bring your own pen or pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache itself is winter friendly, although getting to ground zero may be challenging in deep snow! In wet weather waterproof boots may be wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Nova Man on the FTF! He will be receiving a Tim Hortons card on me!&lt;/p&gt;

These trails pass along ponds, waterfalls and over many small streams. The cache is located along the lower portion of the trail. The best starting route is near the picnic shelters and travel down the steep hills to the bottom. There are three bridges along the way. Start having a look around when you reach the second. You'll be looking for a container with log book, pencil, and various small objects for trading inside.</groundspeak:long_description>

River. This area can sometimes have lots of muggles, so some
stealth maybe required. Be CAUTIOUS when venturing off the trail.
There are steep banks and can be slippery. This cache can be
accessed during winter month, however with deep snow the cache
maybe more difficult to find. Happy hunting&lt;br/&gt;

While we were here we noticed a lot of remnants of a time gone by and thought it would be a great place for a cache.  Nearby there is an abandoned farm machine - does anyone know what it was/did?  

On the road to this cache there are some trees that may scratch your paint job - beware!   Most can be moved if you have a passenger.

Horton  Bluff  Lighthouse is located at the entrance to the Avon River and overlooks Minas Basin and Cape Blomidon. There are some great views from here, but because of erosion, getting too close to the cliffs can be dangerous. Don't worry though, the cache is located well out of harms way.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located at the site of the original Deportation Cross in Grand-Pre before it was moved to Horton Landing in 2005.  Travel to Grand-Pre and park in the National Historic Site's overflow/picnic area, located across the road from the main building. From there you can walk the dyke road that's right next to it. It's an excellent gravel road, but remember it's how local farmers travel from field to field so keep an eye out for working machinery during planting or harvest season. After about a 12 minute walk you'll come across a railroad crossing on your right. At this point you'll need to start following the tracks to get to your destination. The railway has been long abandoned so there is a fair amount of growth along the way. If you stay on the tracks it is easily passable. You'll come across another railway crossing. Travel straight through it and continue along the tracks for a few more minutes. The original location of the Deportation Cross is nearby. It stood there from August 1924 to June 2005. Since it was on private land, the cache is hidden up near the tracks so there is no fear of trespassing. You'll be looking for a container with log book, pencil, and various small objects for trading inside.</groundspeak:long_description>

Driving North on Black Rock Rd, as you approach the shore you can turn off to the right and park at the wharf. There is also the option to pass the wharf and park along a pull-off at the corner. If you decide to park here, you may want to take a minute to check out the beach since there is a path leading down to it from here. Either way, you'll need to cross the road to get to the cache. The path leading down to the stream isn't well marked and not very obvious if you're not looking for it. If you have trouble locating it, use the coords included. Once you start down the path, continue traveling up stream to get to the cache location. You'll be looking for a container with log book, pencil, and various small objects for trading inside.

The terrain is generally quite easy as you'll spend most of your time on the beach. Coming from Halls Harbour, travel along West Halls Harbour Rd and turn onto Simpson Rd. Turn right onto Huntington Point Rd and travel to the end where you'll find a small parking area. Walk west along the beach past all the cottages until you get to a semi-secluded area with a stream run-off and pond. You will find the cache nearby. It is hidden above the shoreline as the tides can reach very high levels at various times of the year. Inside you'll find a log book, pencil, and various small objects for trading.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The area around Blomidon Provincial Park is one of many locations in the Atlantic Provinces said to have been a campsite of the Mi’kmaq legendary character Glooscap. Its rugged coastline and steep slopes were said to be a desirable site for Glooscap’s camp because of its great view and its unattainable walls, he could survey the area for miles.
Many legends tell of Glooscap’s adventures in Mi’kma’ki, land of the Mi’kmaq. One of these stories talks about the day Glooscap left the Mi’kmaw people. Glooscap gathered all the peoples of the land on the high cliffs of Blomidon, and told them he must go on to new areas and teach new people. As a gift from the Mi’kmaq people, they presented Glooscap with a stone pipe. Glooscap thanked the people of Blomidon and accepted the pipe gift. Glooscap then called on the whale for transportation. The first whale to answer his call was a Finback whale, he was far too small to carry Glooscap on his back so Glooscap asked for this whale’s bigger brother. The Finback whale swam off and got his biggest brother, the Blue Whale. The Blue Whale came into the cliffs of Blomidon and asked Glooscap if he needed a ride.
Glooscap travelled off on the back of the Blue Whale and headed West down the Bay of Fundy and then off into the sea. The Whale swam for days and was very tired so Glooscap told the Whale that his part of this trip was done. Glooscap thanked the Whale and wanted to present him with a gift in thanks for all of the help that the whale had given. Glooscap looked in his travel wrap and took out the pipe that he had been given; Glooscap said that he wanted the whale to have it. Glooscap said to the whale, when you get back to Mi’kma’ki tell the people that even though I have gone on a journey that I will return to Mi’kma’ki in their greatest time of need. ... The Whale swam off, back home, smoking his new pipe.
That is why today we are reminded of Glooscap’s promise of returning, every time we see the blow of a whale’s spout. That’s just the smoke of the pipe that the Mi’kmaq gave Glooscap.

Located within the upper todal region of the Bay of Fundy you will find the Minas Basin and a travel route that runs on both northern and southern shored known as the Glooscap Trail. Named after the Mi'kmaq man-god, Glosscap, this travel way is full of exciting legends and sites of cultural significance to the Mi'kmaw people. On the northern shore of the Minas Basin you will find Five Islands Provincial Park.

Mi'kmaq legend says that the native god Glooscap created these five islands - Moose, Diamond, Long, Egg and Pinnacle (These rocks are visible today as islands near the park's headland.) - when he threw chunks of sod at a &quot;Mi'kmuesu&quot;, a Mi'kmaw Wizard who was mocking the powers of Glooscap and who turned himself into a giant beaver to escape.

According to Mi'kmaq legend, Glooscap was created by Gisoolg (the one who has created you) and who was brought to life by 3 bolts of lightning stricking the red sands of the Bay of Fundy. The first bolt gave him shape, the second gave him life but was still connected to the land, all he could do was observe and learn. The third bolt of lightning set him free to travel throughout Mi'kmaki to teach the Mi'kmaw people about the environment and the wisdom and knowledge of how to live with it's plants and animals.

&lt;br/&gt;





Two innovative projects have been recently
added to Fundy National Park’s already aggressive recovery
actions for the endangered Inner Bay of Fundy (IBoF) Atlantic 
salmon population.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
    The first project gets right to the big
question, “where do these salmon go when they leave our
rivers?” If we can find out where they go, we may hope to
find out why they aren't returning. Using GPS
satellite tags, environmental data such as temperature, depth, and
sunlight intensity is logged continuously during the salmons'
marine travel.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
After a pre-determined amount of time or when the fish dies, the
logged information is sent back to us. This data allows researchers
to have a better idea where
the fish went. Preliminary results from last year's experiment
suggest that indeed our fish stay mostly within the Bay but further
marine tracking is planned for the coming year to increase our
understanding of our salmons' marine migration habits.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
    Understanding that the limiting factor to iBoF
Salmon population recovery is commonly accepted to be in the marine
environment, the second project involves rearing our own Upper
Salmon  River smolt
in saltwater in the Bay of Fundy. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Discovering how our fish do in salt water compared to standard
freshwater rearing will improve the effectiveness of our recovery
efforts and contribute to knowledge of the marine phase of their
life cycle overall.  Results of this work will have
significant implications on recovery strategy actions for the Fundy
National Park program.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Last year 700 salmon smolt were distributed to 2 sea cage sites for
salt water rearing.   At the same time 200 smolt, making
up the control group for this experiment,
were taken to another locality for freshwater rearing. 
Preliminary results suggest some encouraging findings as well as
challenges to address in 2010. 2009 field work demonstrated that
our smolt acclimate very well to the saltwater environment and
began feeding almost immediately growing very fast, much as they
would during natural migration in the Bay of Fundy. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Challenges in rearing wild smolt in industrial sea cages were
identified and knowledge gained is currently being used to develop
improved practices for the 2010 season of salt water rearing.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
These projects are the result of partnering with the New Brunswick
Salmon Growers Association and its members, Department of Fisheries &amp; Oceans, the
government of New Brunswick, Atlantic Salmon Federation and local
universities.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To learn more of our salmons' story, visit exhibits at Hueston
Brook and the Visitor Centre. &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Récemment,
deux projets novateurs se sont ajoutés aux mesures de
rétablissement déjà énergiques prises par le parc national Fundy à
l’égard de la population de saumons de l’Atlantique qui
est en voie de disparition dans l’intérieur de la baie de
Fundy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Le premier projet tente de répondre directement à la question
majeure suivante : où les saumons vontils après avoir quitté
nos rivières? Si nous savions où ils vont, nous pourrions peut-être
espérer découvrir pourquoi ils n’en reviennent pas.  Des
données environnementales telles que la température, la profondeur
et l’intensité de la lumière du soleil sont consignées
continuellement au moyen d’étiquettes émettrices GPS pendant
le périple marin des saumons.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Après une période prédéterminée ou à la mort du poisson,
l’information consignée nous est transmise. Ces données
permettent aux chercheurs d’avoir une meilleure idée des
endroits visités par les poissons. D’après les résultats
préliminaires de l’expérience de l’année dernière, nos
poissons resteraient essentiellement dans la baie.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Néanmoins, nous avons prévu d’autres démarches de
localisation marine pour l’année à venir afin
d’approfondir notre compréhension des habitudes de migration
des saumons.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
En prenant en considération que le milieu marin constitue le
facteur limitant généralement admis en ce qui concerne le
rétablissement de la population de saumons à l’intérieur de
la baie de Fundy, le deuxième projet comprend l’élevage de
saumoneaux de la rivière Upper Salmon dans l’eau salée de la
baie de Fundy.  Connaître le rythme de croissance des saumons
dans l’eau salée, comparativement à l’élevage
traditionnel en eau douce, améliorera l’efficacité de nos
efforts de rétablissement et contribuera à la compréhension de la
phase marine de leur cycle de vie global. Les résultats de ces
travaux auront des implications considérables pour la stratégie de
rétablissement du programme du parc national Fundy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
L’année dernière, 700 saumoneaux ont été répartis dans
deux sites d’élevage en cages, en eau salée. Au même moment,
les 200 saumoneaux formant le groupe témoin de
l’expérience ont été amenés dans une autre localité pour être
élevés en eau douce. Les résultats préliminaires
laissent entrevoir des conclusions encourageantes ainsi que des
défis pour 2010. Les travaux effectués sur le terrain
en 2009 démontrent que nos saumoneaux s’acclimatent très
bien au milieu marin, qu’ils ont commencé à se nourrir
presque immédiatement et qu’ils croissent rapidement. En
fait, ils croissent aussi rapidement que s’ils effectuaient
leur migration naturelle dans la baie de Fundy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Les difficultés liées à l’élevage de saumoneaux sauvages dans
des cages flottantes industrielles ont été cernées, et les
connaissances acquises servent actuellement à élaborer de
meilleures méthodes pour la saison d’élevage en eau
salée de 2010.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Ces projets sont le fruit d’un partenariat avec la New
Brunswick Salmon Growers Association et ses membres, le ministère
des Pêches et des Océans, le gouvernement du Nouveau-Brunswick, la
Fédération du saumon Atlantique et les universités locales.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

In September 2010 approximately 70 local Grade 5 and Grade 9 students came to Fundy National Park to plant disease-resistant American beech trees. The American beech tree is a majestic tree that is easily identified by its smooth grey bark. Found throughout eastern North America, most beech trees including those in the Fundy National Park have been heavily impacted by beech bark disease. Beech bark disease is caused when native beech scale insects bore into the bark of the tree creating a wound that then becomes infected by a non-native fungus. Infected trees grow poorly and do not produce the seed crops that are an important food source for many species including black bears.

Using disease-resistant trees naturally occurring in Fundy National Park as well as innovative molecular science and common grafting techniques, a population of American beech resistant to beech bark disease was grown by team of researchers from the Canadian Forest Service’s Atlantic Forestry Centre in Fredericton. These disease-resistant trees are an ecologically acceptable, long-term solution to restore healthy beech to our Acadian Forest. Both Kejimkujik and Prince Edward Island National Parks will also receive disease-resistant beech trees for planting.
With the help of enthusiastic young students, over 100 trees were planted along the Hastings Trail in Fundy National Park. To provide the young trees with further protection from browsing, a deer fence surrounds the new seed orchard. As the trees mature, students and volunteers will be invited to monitor the growth of the trees and help in the propagation of more disease resistant trees for further restoration. 

The American Beech Tree Restoration Project is one of many restoration projects currently underway that is working toward the park’s recognition as a Centre for Restoration Excellence. Through programs like Water for Life, park teams are working to restore populations of Inner Bay of Fundy Atlantic salmon, and restoring the section of Dickson Brook flowing through the Fundy Golf Course. Rivers and streams are reconnected to the ocean by replacing old culverts and building a fish-way around the new Bennett Lake dam. 

The Beech Tree plantation is fragile. Please stay outside the fenced perimeter established to protect it. These young trees are sensitive to disturbance.

Bienvenue au Parc National Fundy!
Vous cherchez une petite boîte imperméable de couleur verte. La boîte contient un message du parc, un crayon et un poinçon (pour votre passeport). N’oubliez pas de perforer votre passeport avec le poinçon. 

Lorsque vous complétez les 5 géocaches, vous courrez la chance de vous mériter une géopièce d’édition limitée (seulement 250 pièces ont été frappées ! Premier arrivé, premier servi !).

Les activités de géocachette sont le résultat d’un partenariat entre l’Atlantic Canada Geocache Association, la Guilde de Fundy et le parc national Fundy. N’oubliez pas de payer les droits d’entrée du parc. Conformément aux lignes directrices sur la géocachette de Parcs Canada, les objets d’échange (y compris les « Travel Bugs ») sont interdits dans les caches. 

Le mardi 21 septembre, quelque 70 élèves de cinquième et neuvième année habitant la région se sont rendus au parc national Fundy afin d’y planter des hêtres à grandes feuilles résistants à la maladie. 
Le hêtre à grandes feuilles est un arbre majestueux que l’on peut facilement reconnaître en raison de son écorce lisse et grise. Prenant racine dans tout l’est de l’Amérique du Nord, ce peuplement d’arbres, incluant celui présent dans la région du parc national Fundy, est gravement touché par la maladie corticale du hêtre. Cette maladie survient lorsque de petits insectes indigènes, soit la cochenille du hêtre, pénètrent dans l’écorce de l’arbre, créant ainsi une blessure qui devient par la suite infectée par un champignon non indigène. La croissance des arbres infectés est alors ralentie et ces derniers ne produisent plus de cultures de semences, lesquelles constituent une importante source d’aliments pour de nombreuses espèces, dont l’ours noir.

En utilisant des hêtres résistants à la maladie qui poussent naturellement dans le parc national Fundy ainsi que des approches novatrices en matière de science moléculaire conjuguées à des techniques courantes de greffe, une équipe de recherche du Centre de foresterie de l’Atlantique à Fredericton, relevant du Service canadien des forêts, ont réussi à donner vie à un peuplement de hêtres à grandes feuilles résistants à la maladie corticale du hêtre. Ces arbres résistants à la maladie représentent une solution à long terme écologiquement acceptable visant le rétablissement de hêtres en santé dans la forêt acadienne. Les parcs nationaux de Kejimkujik et de l’ile du Prince-Edouard recevront également des hêtres à grandes feuilles. 

Grâce aux efforts de jeunes élèves enthousiastes, plus de 100 arbres ont été plantés le long du chemin Hastings dans le parc national Fundy. Afin de fournir aux jeunes arbres une protection accrue contre le broutage, le nouveau verger à graines est entouré d’une clôture à cervidés. Au cours du processus de maturation, les élèves seront invités à suivre de près la croissance des arbres qu’ils ont plantés et à contribuer à la multiplication d’un plus grand nombre de hêtres résistants à la maladie en vue d’assurer un meilleur rétablissement.

Le projet de rétablissement du hêtre à grandes feuilles n’est pas le seul projet de rétablissement présentement en cours dans le parc qui vise la désignation de centre d’excellence de rétablissement. Par l’intermédiaire de programmes tels que « L’eau, source de vie », le personnel du parc s’emploie à rétablir la population du saumon atlantique de l’intérieur de la baie de Fundy; à connaître davantage la martre d’Amérique; à permettre aux rivières et aux ruisseaux du parc de se jeter dans l’océan, et ce, en remplaçant les ponceaux défectueux et en construisant une passe à poissons autour du nouveau barrage du lac Bennett.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



Beavers have drastically changed this area. 
Once there was a stream running through the forest with tall trees
and thick undergrowth- now there is   a pond. The first
thing a beaver does when moving to a new area is build a dam to
raise the water level high enough to form a pond.   The
hardworking adult pair,  with their young, make the dam. 
Trees come down, the pond forms, more trees die because of high
water and are now snags- providing homes and resting spots for many
other living things.  In a few years the banks are cleared and
a lush, green shoreline develops.  Water lilies and cattails
grow, great blue herons visit the pond to feed, owls nest in snags,
smaller birds and mammals live in the tree cavities.  Ducks,
waterfowl, amphibians, reptiles, all make their homes here. 
Before long a whole new ecosystem has formed.  Look out on the
pond.  Can you see the dead standing trees that were once
growing on dry land and now stand in the water?&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
The pond created by this clever rodent is a whole new community of
different plants and animals.  Look around- can you see other
signs of life?  Any clues that the beaver may have been
here?  Early in the evening you have the best chance to
glimpse many of its residents, including the beavers, with whom you
are sharing this special spot .  Keep your eyes and ears ready
to experience life at the beaver pond!&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
When the Beaver moves on to another stream, as it will when the
food supply is diminished , the dam falls into disrepair and
slowly, over time breaks apart.  This gradually lets the water
go, reducing the water level and gradually changing the ecosystem
again.  A meadow will form and another cycle of nature
begins.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Beavers are nature’s engineers- They can create whole new
ecosystems.  In addition to being a home for them and lots of
other living things, beaver ponds are important water storage
systems!  The beaver pond is a natural reservoir which
regulates the flow of water in the stream. Beavers can cause
dramatic alterations to the landscape.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Predators of the beaver include; coyotes, fishers, owls, bear,
mink, bobcats, lynx and humans. Humans are no doubt the
beaver’s worst enemy.  In many situations the beaver is
considered a pest as its landscape altering effects can have
negative implications for roads, farming, etc.  In protected
areas like Fundy National Park, nature is left, as much as
possible, to do her thing. &lt;br/&gt;
Les castors ont radicalement changé le
paysage environnant. Ce secteur renfermait autrefois un ruisseau
qui serpentait dans une forêt remplie de grands arbres et
d’un sous-bois épais. Aujourd’hui, tout cela a été
remplacé par un étang. En s’installant dans un nouveau
secteur, les castors s’affairent en priorité à construire un
barrage afin d’élever suffisamment le niveau d’eau pour
créer un étang. Toute la famille – les parents durs à la
tâche comme les petits – participe au travail de
construction. Les arbres tombent, l’étang se forme, et
d’autres arbres meurent à cause de l’élévation du
niveau d’eau. Ces arbres deviennent des souches, qui
procurent un abri et un lieu de repos à de nombreux autres
organismes vivants. En l’espace de quelques années, les
berges déboisées se tapissent d’une végétation luxuriante.
Les nénuphars et les joncs s’y installent, le grand héron
vient se nourrir dans l’eau, les hiboux nichent dans les
chicots, les petits oiseaux et les petits mammifères élisent
résidence dans les cavités des troncs d’arbre. Oiseaux
aquatiques, amphibiens et reptiles, tous font de cet étang leur
domicile – et c’est un tout nouvel écosystème qui
voit le jour. Jetez un coup d’œil à l’étang.
Pouvez-vous y voir les arbres morts encore debout qui prospéraient
autrefois sur une terre sèche?&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
L’étang créé par cet ingénieux rongeur abrite maintenant une
toute nouvelle communauté de plantes et d’animaux. Regardez
autour de vous. Pouvez-vous voir d’autres signes de vie?
D’autres indices de la présence d’un castor?
C’est en début de soirée que vous avez les meilleures chances
d’apercevoir bon nombre des résidents de l’étang, y
compris les castors, avec qui vous partagez ce coin spécial. Ouvrez
grand les yeux et les oreilles pour faire l’expérience de la
vie à l’étang de castors!&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Lorsque le castor quittera son étang pour un autre ruisseau, comme
il le fera dès que ses réserves de nourriture s’amenuiseront,
le barrage sera laissé à l’abandon, et des brèches finiront
par laisser passer l’eau. Le niveau d’eau baissera, et,
petit à petit, l’écosystème se transformera à nouveau. Il se
formera alors un pré, qui marquera le début d’un autre cycle
de la nature.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Les castors sont les ingénieurs de Dame Nature. Ils peuvent créer
des écosystèmes entièrement nouveaux. Tout en leur procurant un
habitat, à eux à et divers autres organismes vivants, les étangs
sont d’importants réservoirs d’eau qui contrôlent le
débit de l’eau du ruisseau! Les castors modifient vraiment le
paysage de façon spectaculaire.&lt;br/&gt;
Le castor a de nombreux prédateurs : le coyote, le
pékan, le hibou, l’ours, le vison, le lynx roux et le lynx du
Canada. Cependant, il ne fait aucun doute que nous sommes son pire
ennemi. Dans de nombreuses situations, le castor est considéré
comme un animal nuisible, parce que les modifications qu’il
apporte au paysage peuvent avoir des incidences néfastes sur les
routes, l’agriculture, etc. Dans des aires protégées comme le
parc national Fundy, nous laissons Dame Nature à son œuvre
dans la mesure du possible. &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;



Beginning above Dickson
Falls, one of the popular hiking trails of the same name, Dickson
Brook winds its way through the golf course en route to the Bay of
Fundy. Over 100 years of golf course operations and agriculture had
left a large section of this brook in an ecologically degraded
condition. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The stream channel had been
narrowed, straightened, and relocated, and the banks had been lined
with a series of man-made structures including timber cribwork,
stone retaining walls, wire baskets (gabions) and armour rock to
prevent erosion during floods. These structures were ineffective as
they washed out and had to be replaced several times.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Culverts blocked fish passage to upstream spawning grounds and most
of the native vegetation that would have helped stabilize the banks
and provide habitat and cover for fish and wildlife had been
removed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Parks Canada has been slowly restoring Dickson Brook to a more
natural stream. The man-made structures have been removed from the
banks, and the stream channel has been widened to naturally
accommodate floods.  Riffles and pools, important features of
natural streams, were constructed within the channel to stabilize
the stream bed and create fish habitat. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Riffles, which are composed of rocks ranging from sand to large
boulders, were also constructed to provide fish passage through
culverts. Examples of this can be seen at two locations on the
Point Wolfe Road where Dickson Brook enters and exits the golf
course. Native vegetation is being planted along the banks in ways
that maintain golf course play. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Now the brook is better able to handle floods, fish can swim freely
throughout the system, and ecologically diverse habitats for fish
and wildlife continue to be restored. All this, while ensuring a
challenging golfing experience!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
At the cache site you will be able to compare the nearby sections
of Dickson Brook with the pre-restoration photos of the same area
that you will find in the cache. Work on this project is
cutting-edge and award-winning. Play a round and see for
yourself!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As with all restoration projects in the park, monitoring to assess
how well we have achieved our goals is a critical part of the
Dickson brook restoration project. Since 2005, water levels have
been monitored by a hydrometric stream gauging station situated
near the road leading to the swimming pool. Starting last summer,
one of FNP’s Citizen Science programs, Adopt a River,
involves park visitors and other interested participants in water
quality monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You can find out more about monitoring in the park by checking out
FNP’s 
“What’s Up Doc” geocache or by contacting FNP
at fundy.info@pc.gc.ca.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Commençant en
amont des chutes Dickson, l’un des sentiers de randonnée
pédestre populaires du même nom, le ruisseau Dickson serpente à
travers le terrain de golf et se jette dans la baie de Fundy.
Pendant plus de 100 ans, les activités liées au terrain de
golf et l’agriculture ont dégradé l’écologie
d’une vaste partie du ruisseau.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Le lit du ruisseau a été rétréci, refait et détourné. Une série de
structures artificielles, dont un encaissement en bois, des murs de
soutènement en pierre, des paniers métalliques (gabions) et un
enrochement de protection, avaient été érigées sur les rives pour
prévenir l’érosion causées par les inondations. Toutefois,
elles étaient inefficaces, car elles étaient emportées par le
courant et ont dû être remplacées souvent.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Des ponceaux empêchaient les poissons de se rendre dans les aires
de fraie en amont. En outre, la plupart des végétaux indigènes qui
auraient aidé à stabiliser les rives et à offrir un habitat et un
abri aux poissons et à la faune avaient été
arrachés.  &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Parcs Canada restaure tranquillement le ruisseau Dickson pour lui
rendre un aspect plus naturel. Les structures artificielles ont été
dégagées des rives, et le lit du ruisseau a été élargi pour
contenir naturellement les inondations.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Des fosses et des rapides, tous les deux des éléments
essentiels d’un cours d’eau naturel, ont été aménagés
dans le ruisseau pour en stabiliser le lit et créer un habitat pour
les poissons. Des rapides constitués de roches allant du sable à de
grosses pierres ont été construits pour permettre aux poissons de
passer à travers les ponceaux. Des exemples de ces réalisations
peuvent être observés à deux endroits sur le chemin Point
Wolfe, là où le ruisseau Dickson pénètre dans le terrain de golf et
en ressort.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Maintenant, le ruisseau réprime mieux les inondations, les poissons
peuvent nager librement d’un bout à l’autre du cours
d’eau et des habitats diversifiés sur le plan écologique
continuent d’être rétablis pour les poissons et la faune. Et
l’expérience de golf n’en est pas moins
passionnante!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
À la cache, il est possible de comparer les sections voisines du
ruisseau Dickson au moyen de photos prises avant la restauration.
Les travaux effectués dans le cadre de ce projet sont à la pointe
de la technologie et ont été primés. Venez en juger en jouant une
partie de golf!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Comme pour les autres travaux de restauration
entrepris dans
le parc, il est essentiel d’effectuerune surveillance pour évaluer le degré
d’atteinte des objectifs du projet du ruisseau Dickson.
Depuis 2005, le niveau de l’eau est contrôlé par une
station de jaugeage hydrométrique située à proximité de la route
qui mène à la piscine. Lancé l’été dernier, le programme
« J’adopte un cours d’eau », un volet de
l’initiative Citoyens de la science du parc national Fundy,
fait participer les visiteurs et d’autres personnes
intéressées à la surveillance de la qualité de
l’eau. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Pour en apprendre davantage sur la surveillance, consultez 
la géocache « Qu’est-ce qui ne va pas,
Docteur? » du parc national Fundy ou communiquez avec le
personnel du parc en écrivant à l’adresse fundy.info@pc.gc.ca. &lt;br/&gt;

The American marten and the fisher are both members of the weasel family. Both of these predators occupy a place close to the top of the food chain in Fundy’s forest ecosystem. They feed on small mammals, birds, seasonal fruits and carrion. Both species rely heavily on large tracts of older-growth forest, making them fairly specialized in their habitat requirements. They also have fairly low reproductive rates. That is, the average number of young produced per year. Together, these traits make them sensitive to changes in their environment, and in turn, make these species useful for tracking the health of mature forests.

These species were extirpated (became extinct in a particular area) by the 1940s due in large part to over trapping and habitat loss. Fishers were reintroduced by the Province of New Brunswick just north of the park to control the porcupine populations. A total of 16 individual fishers were released by 1968 and later, pine marten were reintroduced in the late 80s and early 90s.

Keeping a close eye on the health of the ecosystems in the park is a central focus for resource conservation staff. Fundy’s monitoring ecologist explained that it is impossible to monitor everything. The challenge is tracking the condition of a carefully selected number of ecological measures that together provide an accurate picture of an ecosystem’s overall health and this is where our two weasels come into play! The monitoring program uses motion-activated cameras set up near bait stations at 30 remote locations in the park. Scientists deploy the cameras at each location for a few weeks during the winter and spring. Capturing these weasels on camera gives researchers an indication of the habitat that is occupied by the two species based on which bait stations they visit. This monitoring aims to determine if these species are present in different areas in the park which in turn is critical for tracking the health of the entire forest ecosystem.

Bienvenue au Parc National Fundy!
Vous cherchez une petite boîte imperméable de couleur verte. La boîte contient un message du parc, un crayon et un poinçon (pour votre passeport). N’oubliez pas de perforer votre passeport avec le poinçon. 

Lorsque vous complétez les 5 géocaches, vous courrez la chance de vous mériter une géopièce d’édition limitée (seulement 250 pièces ont été frappées ! Premier arrivé, premier servi !).

La martre d’Amérique et la martre pêcheuse sont toutes deux membres de la famille des belettes. Ces deux prédateurs occupent une place tout près du haut de la chaîne alimentaire dans l’écosystème de Fundy. Ils se nourrissent de petits mammifères, d’oiseaux, de fruits saisonniers et de charogne. Les deux espèces requièrent de vastes forêts anciennes comme habitat et leur taux de reproduction est relativement bas. Ces caractéristiques rendent ces espèces sensibles aux changements dans leur environnement et les rends utiles pour mesurer la santé des forêts matures.

Le piégeage excessif et la perte d’habitat ont causé la disparition de ces espèces dans les années 1940. La martre pêcheuse fut réintroduite tout juste au nord du parc par la Province du Nouveau-Brunswick, dans le but de contrôler la population de porc-épics. Seize martres pêcheuses furent introduites en 1968 et ensuite la martre d’Amérique à la fin des années 1980 et au début des années 1990.

Le personnel de préservation de la nature du parc se concentre sur la santé des écosystèmes du parc. L’écologiste de surveillance du parc Fundy explique qu’il est impossible de tout contrôler. Le défi est de suivre les conditions d’un certain nombre de données écologiques choisies avec soin, qui, ensemble, nous donne un aperçu précis de la santé globale d’un écosystème. C’est ici que nos deux belettes entrent en action ! Le programme de surveillance utilise une trentaine de caméras activées par le mouvement installées près des postes d’appâts. Les scientifiques déploient ces caméras pendant quelques semaines au printemps et à l’automne. Les photos prises de ces deux belettes donnent aux scientifiques une bonne idée du territoire qu’elles occupent, dépendant des stations qu’elles visitent. Cette surveillance a pour but de déterminer la présence de ces espèces dans différents secteurs du parc, ce qui aide à déterminer la santé global de l’écosystème de la forêt entière.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



Fundy’s forest is bathed in moisture from the
Bay of Fundy. Rain, snow, fog, and air laden with humidity
constantly water the plants. There is no dry season here! (1500 mm
annual precipitation)  This abundance of water creates a
forest some visitors compare with a rain forest. Many kinds of
lichens grow on the tree trunks and branches while receiving all
they need from the air. Old Man’s Beard lichen is the light
green-gray hairy one commonly seen hanging from branches in our
forest.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
This is the Acadian forest...the forest type that covers most of
the Maritime provinces. It is a diverse blend of species typical of
more northerly Boreal forest and southern hardwood forests.
Thirty-two  different tree species are part of this forest
type. The six most common trees in Fundy are Red Spruce , Balsam
Fir, Yellow and White Birch, Red and Sugar Maple.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
As you walk in this forest, notice the differences from place to
place. This forest survives because of its patchwork character.
You’ll see dark, dense evergreens lining the steep slopes of
the river valleys which channel cold air from the Bay of Fundy deep
into the park; a warm, well-drained slope of  majestic
hardwoods; an area of mixed conifer and deciduous trees; a glade
where a big tree died allowing sunlight on to the forest floor
which has become thick with hay-scented ferns; and a patch of dead
old trees standing and fallen amongst young trees vigorously racing
for a place in the sun.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Diversity and cycling change are key characteristics that allow our
forest to thrive in difficult conditions of extremely variable
weather, soil deficiencies, insect erruptions, and abrasive, salty
winds.&lt;br/&gt;
À Fundy, l’humidité de la baie
s’insinue partout dans la forêt, la pluie, la neige, le
brouillard et l’air moite arrosant constamment les plantes.
Il n’y a pas de saison sèche ici! (1500 mm de
précipitations annuelles) Cette abondance d’eau crée un
habitat que certains comparent à une forêt pluviale. Des lichens de
tous genres poussent sur les troncs d’arbre et les branches,
l’air ambiant leur fournissant toute l’eau dont ils ont
besoin. La mousse d’Espagne est le lichen filamenteux de
couleur gris-vert pâle qui pend aux branches des arbres.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Nous sommes ici dans la forêt acadienne... le type de forêt qui
couvre la majeure partie du territoire des provinces Maritimes.
Elle recèle un mélange hétérogène d’essences typiques de la
forêt boréale du Nord et des forêts de feuillus du Sud. La forêt
acadienne est formée de 32 essences différentes. Les six
espèces les plus courantes dans le parc sont l’épinette
rouge, le sapin baumier, le bouleau jaune, le bouleau à papier,
l’érable rouge et l’érable à sucre.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 En marchant dans la forêt, observez les variations
d’un endroit à l’autre. Si cette forêt survit,
c’est grâce à son caractère bigarré. Ici, des peuplements de
conifères sombres et denses dominant des vallées escarpées qui
canalisent l’air froid de la baie vers le cœur du parc;
là, une pente ensoleillée et bien drainée qui sert d’habitat
à des feuillus majestueux; plus loin, une parcelle où conifères et
feuillus font bon ménage; de ce côté, une clairière ensoleillée où
un gros arbre mort a cédé le pas à une colonie touffue de fougères
odorantes; de l’autre, une parcelle où de vieux arbres gisent
au milieu d’arbrisseaux vigoureux qui se disputent une place
au soleil.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
La diversité et les changements cycliques sont les principales
caractéristiques qui permettent à notre forêt de prospérer malgré
le temps extrêmement variable, les sols pauvres, les infestations
d’insectes et les vents abrasifs chargés de sel
marin. &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;



Sharp declines
in eel populations, particularly in the Great Lakes, are causing
concern. &lt;br/&gt;
Parks Canada is working with First Nation communities to use
Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge along with Western science to get
a better sense of the status of this species in Eastern
Canada. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In 2009, eel monitoring was implemented in Kouchibouguac, Cape
Breton Highlands and Fundy National Parks.  More national
parks across the Atlantic region are expected to join these efforts
in coming years to better understand the natural history and
population status of this species.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Here on the Upper Salmon River research began in the spring of 2009
when traps were set to catch some of the expected run of juvenile
eels (elvers) arriving after their very long voyage from the
Saragasso sea. The traps, combined with night dip netting, resulted
in unexpectedly low catches which has raised many more questions
for future exploration.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Could the low numbers be connected to Fundy’s swiftly flowing
and rocky rivers? Maybe the giant Fundy tides are stirring up the
water resulting in a confused freshwater signal for the elvers.
Stay tuned for the next stage in this ongoing research.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Researchers were again at work in the Upper Salmon River
later in the summer. They placed nets in the estuary of the river
checking them regularly.  The captured eels were anaesthetised
before having tiny transmitters carefully implanted. These
transmitters allow researchers to track the movement of the eels in
the water using handheld antennas or radio frequency identification
antenna arrays. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Tiny pit tags, which work like bar codes on items in the grocery
store, were also implanted in many eels. Using a pit tag reader
that displays the number associated with each pit tag, researchers
can identify individual eels and track their growth and
movement.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Using these techniques, we hope to learn more about the American
Eel. In particular, we would like to know more about where adult
eels spend winter. We already know that in lakes with muddy bottoms
they will burrow deep into the mud to stay warm but what about eels
that live in rivers with sandy and rocky bottoms. What do these
eels do when temperatures drop?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To explore the American Eels’ fascinating life cycle check
out the 
“The Eel Deal” geocache on Foster Brook Trail off
the Point Wolfe Road. Check 
www.atlanticgeocaching or FNP Visitor center for more
information.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Le déclin
prononcé des populations d’anguilles, particulièrement dans
les Grands Lacs, est préoccupant. Parcs Canada collabore avec des
collectivités de Premières Nations afin de se former une meilleure
idée de la situation de cette espèce dans l’est du Canada à
l’aide du savoir traditionnel autochtone et des sciences
occidentales.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
En 2009, des projets de surveillance des anguilles ont été mis
en œuvre à Kouchibouguac, dans les hautes-terres du cap
Breton et dans le parc national Fundy. D’autres parcs
nationaux de la région de l’Atlantique sont censés se joindre
à ces efforts au cours des prochaines années pour mieux comprendre
l’histoire naturelle et l’état des populations
d’anguilles.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
Au printemps de 2009, une étude a été amorcée dans la rivière
Upper Salmon. Les chercheurs ont installé des trappes pour capturer
certaines des jeunes anguilles (civelles)
de la remonte prévue qui revenaient d’un très long voyage au
départ de la mer des Sargasses. Combinées à la pêche à
l’épuisette nocturne, les trappes n’ont capturé
qu’un nombre étonnamment faible de civelles, ce qui a soulevé
beaucoup d’autres questions à explorer davantage.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Ce faible nombre serait-il lié aux rivières rocheuses à courant
rapide du parc? Il est probable que les marées géantes de la baie
de Fundy créent des remous, ce qui enverrait un signal confus aux
civelles quant à la présence d’eau douce. Restez au fait de
la prochaine phase de cette étude permanente! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Plus tard dans l’été, les chercheurs se sont remis au travail
dans la rivière Upper Salmon. Ils vérifiaient régulièrement les
filets qu’ils avaient installés. Ils anesthésiaient les
anguilles prises avant de leur implanter de minuscules émetteurs
avec précaution. Ces émetteurs permettent aux chercheurs de suivre
le mouvement des anguilles dans l’eau au moyen
d’antennes portatives ou d’un réseau d’antennes
d’identification par
radiofréquence.    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Des étiquettes microscopiques à transpondeur passif intégré, qui
fonctionnent comme les codes à barres que l’on trouve sur les
articles à l’épicerie, ont aussi été implantées dans de
nombreuses anguilles. Au moyen d’un lecteur, lequel affiche
le numéro associé à chaque étiquette, les chercheurs peuvent
identifier individuellement les anguilles et surveiller leur
croissance et leurs déplacements.   &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Grâce à ces techniques, nous espérons approfondir notre
connaissance de l’anguille d’Amérique. En particulier,
nous aimerions en apprendre davantage sur l’endroit où elles
passent l’hiver. Nous savons déjà qu’elles creusent
profondément dans la boue des lacs aux fonds limoneux pour se
garder au chaud, mais qu’en est-il des anguilles qui vivent
dans des rivières aux fonds sablonneux ou rocheux? Que font ces
anguilles lorsque la température chute?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Pour découvrir le cycle de vie fascinant de l’anguille
d’Amérique, rendez-vous à la geocache
« La ligue des anguilles » du sentier du ruisseau
Foster, près du chemin Point Wolfe. Allez à l’adresse

Fundy National Park protects some of the last old growth Acadian forest in the world – a unique forest found only in the Maritimes, southern Quebec and New England States. The Acadian forest is the transition zone between the northern boreal forests and the deciduous-dominated forest to the south and is listed as one of 6 endangered forest types in North America.


The Fundy coastal forest is often shrouded in mystical fog. In the summer, fog is create when warm air from the over the land meets cooler air over the Bay of Fundy. Water vapour condenses as the warm air cools, forming droplets (fog). Think about what happens when you breathe warm air out on a cold day. Due to the cooling effect of the Bay of Fundy in the summer, it is usually 6’C cooler on the coast than inland areas. IN the winter, the relationship reverses as the bay has a moderating effect.

This cool moisture laden air that hangs over the Fundy coastline results in a forest replete with lush green vegetation with 32 species of treesn and dominated by the Red Spruce found only in the Acadian Forest. In addition to the incredible diversity of trees, the Acadian Forest is home to 431 species of lichens, 43 species of moss and liverwort, and 18 different species of fern that flourish in this cool micro-climate. Living amongst the ferns and trees include 260 species of birds, 38 species of mammals, and 14 species of amphibians.


Whereas most other forest are subject to periodic forest fires, a necessary natural disturbance for fostering biological diversity and ecological sustainability in some ecosystems, forest fires are rare in the Acadian forest as result of frequent periods of rain and fog. Rather, the Acadian forest relies on blow down, and cyclical insect outbreak events such as those of the Spruce Budworm. These events create a patchwork of vegetation allowing for a greater range of habitat types and greater diversity of animals. Le Parc National Fundy protèges certaines des dernières forêts anciennes Acadiennes du monde – forêts qui ne se retrouvent que dans les Maritimes, au Québec et en Nouvelle-Angleterre. La forêt acadienne se trouve à la zone de transition entre la forêt boréale au nord, et la forêt dominée par les espèces à feuilles caduques au sud. Elle est une des 6 forêts sur la liste des type de forêts en voie de disparition en Amérique du Nord.

La forêt côtière de Fundy est souvent enveloppée d’un brouillard mystérieux. En été, le brouillard se crée lorsque l’air chaud du continent rencontre l’air plus frais de la baie de Fundy. La condensation résultant de l’air plus chaud se refroidissant entraine la formation de petites gouttelettes (brouillard). C’est le même phénomène que vous pouvez constater lorsque vous expirez lors d’une froide journée d’hiver. La température de la côte est généralement 6 degrés plus basse que celle dans les terres, due aux eaux froides de la baie de Fundy. Cette situation est inverse en hiver, alors que la température de l’eau tempère la température de l’air côtier.

Toute cette humidité présente dans l’air frais de la côte aide à créer une forêt luxuriante où l’on retrouve 32 espèces d’arbres, et qui est dominée par l’épinette rouge, espèce qui existe uniquement dans la forêt acadienne. En plus de l’incroyable diversité d’arbres, la forêt acadienne recèle 431 espèces de lichens, 43 espèces de mousses et d’hépatiques et 18 espèces de fougères qui prospèrent dans ce microclimat frais. Dispersés dans les arbres et les fougères, on retrouve 260 espèces d’oiseaux, 38 espèces de mammifères et 14 espèces d’amphibiens.
Alors que certaines forêts sont assujetties à des feux de forêt périodiques, perturbations nécessaires pour engendrer la diversité biologique et le développement écologique durable de certains écosystèmes, les feux de forêt sont rares dans la forêt acadienne, empêchés par la pluie fréquente et le brouillard. La forêt acadienne se régénère plutôt suite aux purges causées par les vents parfois violents, ainsi qu’à l’infestation par des insectes, telles que la tordeuses des bourgeons de l’épinette. Ces événements créent une végétation bigarrée, créant un plus grand nombre d’habitats qui attirent une plus grande diversité d’animaux.

This cache is located on the Black Hole trail, which is 5.5 km one way. This trail is located on the 45 Road. Steep rocky descent to Upper Salmon River. Cyclist must use caution.

The geocache is located within the park with participation of Fundy National Park. Please pay appropriate park entry fees. As per the Parks Canada geocaching policy: Trade items are not permitted in caches, this includes Travel Bugs.

Many Maritimer's can remember a time when Atlantic salmon were so plentiful that you couldn't see
the bottom of inner bay of Fundy (iBoF) rivers. These fish that once thrived in rivers like Point
Wolfe River- today are struggling to survive. The population in Fundy National Park has declined by
90% since 1985.

Today there are fewer than 500 iBoF Atlantic salmon living in the wild. The iBoF salmon is
listed under the species at risk act (SARA) as and endangered species and is at serious risk of extinction.

Why are they disappearing? Large scale changes on the land, rivers, ocean, and in the climate
have affected their populations. Rivers like this one were used in the early 1900's for logging and
shipbuilding. Salmon habitat changed as small dams, log drives, sawdust and debris clogged up the rivers.

Loss of freshwater habitat due to the construction of dykes, causeways and dams, such at the causeway on
the Petitcodiac River (in Moncton) create barriers that block fish from swimming upstream to lay their eggs. Thus cutting down the overall salmon population of the inner Bay.

Aquaculture has developed significantly in the outer/ western end of the Bay of Fundy since the 1980's brining along with it disease and invasion of genetically inferior fish to wild populations. River quality and acid rain are having impacts on the ability of the iBoF salmon to survive. Fundy National Park is actively trying to save this endangered population of salmon.

Efforts are ongoing at rivers like this one to re-establish selfs ustaining wild populations of Atlantic salmon in the iBoF Rivers. The work in Fundy is on two fronts (1) to save in captivity some of our salmon who are
genetically specific to Park Rivers so that we have a source for reintroduction and (2) to try to find out what is making them go extinct. Whatever the problem is, it is affecting other species as
well.

Is there hope for the iBoF Atlantic salmon? We hope so! No one really knows for sure why the
populations are not recovering. It could be those factors that caused the population to drop (changes in
river structures, fishing, tidal barriers) that are stopping populations from recovering. But it could be other
things too, such as genetic mixing with farmed fish or long-term changes in ocean temperatures. While the
recovery team is trying to figure it out, we need keeping rivers clean and healthy for salmon and other species.

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;




One of the most important
and interesting areas of a park researcher’s job is
monitoring the health of the park’s ecosystems. This process,
called ecological monitoring, is rather like an annual medical
check-up where a doctor listens to your pulse and your
breathing.   Ecological monitoring takes the pulse of the
environment by regularly measuring a few vital signs – things
that are the main indicators of how the patient (the environment)
is doing.  Park staff monitor several vital signs of each
ecosystem found within the park (forest, coastal, wetlands and
freshwater) to assess changes in their overall health. Monitoring
of the condition of these ecosystems helps us to:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;identify early warning signs of negative changes in the
environment (like a physician detects early symptoms of a more
serious problem before it is too late for treatment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assess the effectiveness of our management actions (like
a medical doctor monitors the patient to see whether the prescribed
treatment is working),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;report the condition of Fundy National Park to our
partners and the public at large.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
One interesting way to monitor the health of streams and rivers is
to study what insects are living there. Certain insects can only
live in streams that are not polluted. You can look for aquatic
insects in streams near your home by turning over rocks and gently
brushing off the insects, clinging to the underside of the rocks,
into a bucket of water.  If you find the free-living caddis
fly larva or the alderfly larva, it is a good sign that the stream
where they are living is in good health.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Recently, Fundy National Park has placed greater emphasis on
developing new experiential programs, called Citizen Science. These
programs provide park visitors and interested residents of the
surrounding area the opportunity to work with park ecologists and
interpreters in monitoring park ecosystems and key
species.   Citizen Science projects rely on volunteers,
who may have no prior scientific training, to help conduct
scientifically credible research and monitoring studies.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
New to Fundy’s suite of Citizen Science programs is
“Adopt a River”.  Participants in the program
learn about the various methods for monitoring aquatic
health.  They are trained how to conduct various activities which include
analysing the physical characteristics of streams and rivers,
chemical properties of water, and, finally, collecting, sorting,
and identifying the invertebrates like mayflies and stoneflies
living in the water.  These measures allow participants and
park ecologists to assess the health of the river, and later, if
necessary, make well-informed decisions on how to improve the
overall health of Fundy’s aquatic ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Last year several successful Citizen Science programs were piloted
and more are planned for 2010. Contact FNP at fundyinfo@pc.gc.ca, or ask at FNP
Visitor Center for more information.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
La surveillance
de la santé des écosystèmes est l’une des parties les plus
importantes et palpitantes du travail d’un chercheur au parc
national Fundy. Appelé surveillance écologique, ce processus
rappelle un examen médical annuel, au cours duquel un médecin prend
le pouls et écoute la respiration de son patient. La surveillance
écologique tâte le pouls de l’environnement en mesurant
régulièrement quelques signes vitaux, c’est-à-dire les
principaux indicateurs de la santé du patient
(l’environnement dans ce cas-ci). Le personnel contrôle
plusieurs signes vitaux de chaque écosystème du parc (forêt, côte,
zone humide, eau douce) pour évaluer les changements dans leur
santé globale. La surveillance de l’état des écosystèmes aide
à :&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;déceler des signes précurseurs de changements négatifs
dans l’environnement, tout comme un médecin détecte des
symptômes précoces d’une maladie grave avant qu’il soit
trop tard pour la traiter;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;évaluer l’efficacité de nos mesures de gestion,
comme un médecin surveille un patient pour voir si le traitement
prescrit fonctionne;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;faire connaître le bilan de santé du parc national Fundy
aux partenaires et au grand public. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Une méthode
intéressante de surveillance de la santé des ruisseaux et des
rivières consiste à étudier les insectes qui y habitent. Certains
insectes peuvent seulement vivre dans des cours d’eau non
pollués. Vous pouvez
prélever des insectes aquatiques dans les cours d’eau de
votre voisinage en retournant les roches, en décollant
délicatement les insectes qui s’y accrochent et en les
recueillant dans un seau d’eau. Si vous trouvez des larves de
phrygane libres ou des larves de sialidé, c’est un signe que
le cours d’eau où elles vivent est en santé.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Dernièrement, le parc national Fundy a mis&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Le programme « J’adopte une rivière » est un nouvel
ajout dans la série Citoyens de la science du parc. Les
participants se familiarisent aux diverses méthodes de surveillance
de la santé aquatique. Ils apprennent à effectuer de multiples
activités, dont l’analyse des caractéristiques physiques des
ruisseaux et des rivières ou des propriétés chimiques de
l’eau ainsi que la collecte, le tri et l’identification
d’invertébrés qui vivent dans l’eau, comme des
éphéméroptères et des perles. Ces mesures permettent aux
participants et aux écologistes du parc d’évaluer la santé
des rivières et, par la suite, si besoin est, de prendre des
décisions éclairées quant à l’amélioration de la santé
globale des écosystèmes aquatiques du parc national
Fundy.   &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
L’année dernière, plusieurs programmes Citoyens de la science
ont été menés avec succès, et d’autres sont prévus
pour 2010. Écrivez à l’adresse fundyinfo@pc.gc.ca, ou bien
adressez-vous au personnel du Centre d’accueil du parc
national Fundy pour de plus amples

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Fundy National Park!

You are looking for a small weather proof green box. In it is a park message, a log book, a pencil and a punch (for your passport). Download the passport HERE. Do not forget to punch your passport. 

When you complete all 5 caches you have a chance to earn a limited edition non-trackable token (Only 250 minted! First-come first- served).

The geocache is a partnership of the Atlantic Canada Geocache Association, the Fundy Guild and Fundy National Park. Please pay appropriate park entry fees. As per the Parks Canada geocaching policy: Trade items are not permitted in caches, this includes Travel Bugs.
There is no need to bushwack to reach this geocache as it follows an established trail. Please consult the park map. You can follow either Laverty Falls or Moosehorn trail. Total distance is between 4.4 to 5km.
In winter, many bird species occupy regions and ignore others depending on the availability of food. They survive by feeding on the seeds and fruits of trees. Ornithologists call this behaviour irruptive. Winter migration patterns and population are influenced by the size of the seed crop produced by trees in a given location. Because of the variation in seed production from year to year, finch species such as Pine and Evening Grosbeaks, Red and White-Winged Crossbills, Purple Finch, Hoary and Common Redpolls, and Pine Siskin vary greatly in number from winter to winter. They feed on a variety of trees such as White, Red and Black Spruce, White and Yellow Birch, and Mountain Ash to name a few.

In Fundy National Park the star of the show is the Pine Grosbeak! Preferring coniferous forests, the Pine Grosbeak will feed on the abundant seeds from Red Spruce Cones. Each year is different however as Red Spruce are mast seeders, meaning they produce large seed crops every two to six years. 

Winters with high cone crops have a ripple effect through the forest ecosystem and the benefits go well beyond wintering birds. Rodents such as Red and Flying Squirrel, White-footed mice, Deer mice, and Eastern chipmunks also show spikes in their numbers during these high cone crop seasons. Small predatory mammals such as the Pine Marten and Fisher, and predatory birds, also do well when the rodent populations increase.

Bienvenue au Parc National Fundy!
Vous cherchez une petite boîte imperméable de couleur verte. La boîte contient un message du parc, un crayon et un poinçon (pour votre passeport). N’oubliez pas de perforer votre passeport avec le poinçon. 

Lorsque vous complétez les 5 géocaches, vous courrez la chance de vous mériter une géopièce d’édition limitée (seulement 250 pièces ont été frappées ! Premier arrivé, premier servi !).

Les activités de géocachette sont le résultat d’un partenariat entre l’Atlantic Canada Geocache Association, la Guilde de Fundy et le parc national Fundy. N’oubliez pas de payer les droits d’entrée du parc. Conformément aux lignes directrices sur la géocachette de Parcs Canada, les objets d’échange (y compris les « Travel Bugs ») sont interdits dans les caches. 
Durant l’hiver, plusieurs espèces d’oiseaux occupent certains secteurs et en ignorent d’autres, au gré de la disponibilité de sources de nourriture. Ils survivent en se nourrissant de graines et de fruits. Les ornithologues qualifient ce comportement d’intrusif. La quantité de graines produite par les arbres dans un certain secteur détermine la population et leur migration. La variation dans la quantité de ces graines d’une année à l’autre influence directement le nombre d’espèces de pinsons, tels que le Durbec des Sapins, le Gros-bec Errant, les Bec-croisés rouge et bifasciés, le Roselin Pourpré, le Sizerin Blanchâtre, le Sizerin Flammé et le Tarin des Pins. Ils se nourrissent des graines de plusieurs arbres, tels que les épinettes blanches, rouges et noires, les bouleaux blancs et jaunes ainsi que le sorbier, pour n’en nommer que quelques unes.

La vedette du Parc National Fundy est sans contredit le Durbec des Sapins ! Préférant les forêts de conifères, le Durbec des Sapins se nourrit des graines abondantes des cônes d’épinette rouge. Chaque année est différent par contre car l’épinette rouge produit généralement une plus grande quantité de graines à intervalle de 2 à 6 ans.

Lorsque une grande quantité de graines est disponible durant l’hiver, l’effet sur l’écosystème va bien au-delà des oiseaux qui hivernent dans la forêt. Les populations de rongeurs comme l’écureuil roux, l’écureuil volant, la souris à pattes blanches, la souris sylvestre et le tamia rayé augmentent durant cette période d’abondance. Et, l’abondance de ces rongeurs fait augmenter la population de mammifères prédateurs, tels que la martre d’Amérique et la martre pêcheuse ainsi que certains oiseaux de proie.

Fundy was the place to be today for geocachers.
This was the hardest hike with its 4.6kms roundtrip with rough terrain and rock hoping.
The falls are really nice and the brook offered a spectacular view.
On the way to the cache we came across TheRetiredHiker and Paulaandstacey and found out that this was their 5000th find.
What an awesome accomplishment. Congratulations.</groundspeak:text>

As we were searching, Cheesepizza arrived from the Laverty falls trail.  We searched together and he made the find.  Then we all walked out back up the steep trail back to the car.  We met dozens of other hikers on their way down and dozens more in the parking lot.  It looks like everyone had the same idea - get the long hard one done in the morning with the hopes that it will warm up later in the day.  We started with many layers and gloves and came out in shirt sleeves!  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

thicket of young evergreens between Blair Lake Road and the Trans
Canada. It is well hidden from muggles. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
At the time of placement the cache contained a stash note, log
book, pencils and post cards. There are no trading items in the
cache. The smaller inner container is for the log book and small
post cards. Use it to send letters and postcards to other
geocachers! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Not sure how a geo-post office works? &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
These caches are placed to hold postcards or small items. Each
postcard or item will have a short message and a forwarding address
on it. The address will contain the person's name that you are
trying to send the postcard to, their home city, and a destination
cache. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The idea is to move postcards between Geo-Post Offices until they
reach their destination. When you move a postcard or message from
one place to another, let the person who it's being sent to know
where you moved it to, because they might be near enough to go and
pick it up. If you move a postcard from one Geo-Post Office to
another, please move it closer to the city or cache! You can send
any message you want to anyone you want! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
How do you get started? Easy! Just write up your postcard and drop
it in the Geo-Post Office! &lt;br/&gt;

This park was once a large pond before being bulldozed by the
powers that be years ago. The pond was the site of several
factories that used the brook for power. Several willow trees
surrounded the pond which went over behind the fire hall across the
street as far as the ball field. People gathered here to curl and
skate in the winter. In summer bands would play on floating
bandstands while vendors sold hot roasted peanuts. &lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>From Moncton, cross the bridge to Riverview. Set your odometer to zero and drive 26 km until you see the Albert Mines rd on the right. Follow this road for 5.7km until you see an old quarry with a gate across the yard. This is on the right side of the road. Drive past this to the second telephone pole and take the dirt road on the right. Drive in here about 1km and just past the hill with the s shaped curve, park your car at N45° 51.681' W064° 40.394' and walk down the trail.

&lt;h1&gt;The Story Teller Series&lt;/h1&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 100 caches that have been placed out in
rural New Brunswick near Salisbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally intended for highway 126 between Moncton and
Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

inside of the bag as you found it. You may have to dig around for
this during winter the way the snow drifts around here. The cache
has been given extra protection for winter. There is no need to go
anywhere near the train tracks or cross them, so please don't.
Enjoy the cache. &lt;br/&gt;

I was up this way caching and realized that I have found more
caches in New Brunswick than Nova Scotia. This is a small thank-you
to all of you in New Brunswick that have placed caches. I get great
pleasure out of the ongoing search for them. Thanks for all the
time and effort!

&lt;h1&gt;The Story Teller Series&lt;/h1&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 100 caches that have been placed out in
rural New Brunswick near Salisbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally intended for highway 126 between Moncton and
Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Lots of driving, lots of rushing into the woods and lots of containers to sign.
Mix that with rain and sun at the same time and we had a blast all day.

Lots of driving, lots of rushing into the woods and lots of containers to sign.
Mix that with rain and sun at the same time and we had a blast all day.

&lt;h1&gt;The Story Teller Series&lt;/h1&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 100 caches that have been placed out in
rural New Brunswick near Salisbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally intended for highway 126 between Moncton and
Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;The Story Teller Series&lt;/h1&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 100 caches that have been placed out in
rural New Brunswick near Salisbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally intended for highway 126 between Moncton and
Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This series of caches is inspired by a recent accidental drive
through the dirt roads of Albert County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, while out caching for the afternoon, I decided that I
had had enough and was ready to return home. Knowing full well
where I was, I decided to punch in Pine Glen Rd into my GPS to see
how far it was from my current location. The GPS calculated a route
and for a lack of anything better to do, I decided to follow
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series of ten caches takes you along the same route I went
that day. Now, keep in mind, I don't own a 4x4 and my car is a tiny
yellow Aveo that is probably the last thing you should be driving
on roads like this. Needless to say, it was an entertaining drive
home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how many caches there are out in Albert County, with the
infamous X and all, I was surprised to see a lack of caches along
this route. So, I marked where I was and said I would return with
some caches so that others could enjoy the route as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache was placed right near a large rut in the road that I
had to make sure I didn't accidentally park the car into and end up
stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the caches in this series are 50cal ammo containers
filled with the usual goodies. I tried to stock the tradeables as
best as I could but my supply is running low right now. All the
caches are located less than 100m from the road, and there is mild
to medium bushwhacking required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BE WARNED!!! There is a lot of tree/bush cover for most of the
caches in this series so GPS accuracy will vary depending on where
you are, and the unit you have. You'll need to be a bit more
patient finding these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This series of caches is inspired by a recent accidental drive
through the dirt roads of Albert County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, while out caching for the afternoon, I decided that I
had had enough and was ready to return home. Knowing full well
where I was, I decided to punch in Pine Glen Rd into my GPS to see
how far it was from my current location. The GPS calculated a route
and for a lack of anything better to do, I decided to follow
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series of ten caches takes you along the same route I went
that day. Now, keep in mind, I don't own a 4x4 and my car is a tiny
yellow Aveo that is probably the last thing you should be driving
on roads like this. Needless to say, it was an entertaining drive
home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how many caches there are out in Albert County, with the
infamous X and all, I was surprised to see a lack of caches along
this route. So, I marked where I was and said I would return with
some caches so that others could enjoy the route as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a nice view of a large hill in the distance from the
spot where I parked the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the caches in this series are 50cal ammo containers
filled with the usual goodies. I tried to stock the tradeables as
best as I could but my supply is running low right now. All the
caches are located less than 100m from the road, and there is mild
to medium bushwhacking required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BE WARNED!!! There is a lot of tree/bush cover for most of the
caches in this series so GPS accuracy will vary depending on where
you are, and the unit you have. You'll need to be a bit more
patient finding these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;The Story Teller Series&lt;/h1&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 100 caches that have been placed out in
rural New Brunswick near Salisbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally intended for highway 126 between Moncton and
Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Lots of driving, lots of rushing into the woods and lots of containers to sign.
Mix that with rain and sun at the same time and we had a blast all day.
Unexpected FTF on this one, we didnt really think that there were still some empty logs left.

&lt;p&gt;This series of caches is inspired by a recent accidental drive
through the dirt roads of Albert County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, while out caching for the afternoon, I decided that I
had had enough and was ready to return home. Knowing full well
where I was, I decided to punch in Pine Glen Rd into my GPS to see
how far it was from my current location. The GPS calculated a route
and for a lack of anything better to do, I decided to follow
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series of ten caches takes you along the same route I went
that day. Now, keep in mind, I don't own a 4x4 and my car is a tiny
yellow Aveo that is probably the last thing you should be driving
on roads like this. Needless to say, it was an entertaining drive
home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how many caches there are out in Albert County, with the
infamous X and all, I was surprised to see a lack of caches along
this route. So, I marked where I was and said I would return with
some caches so that others could enjoy the route as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to see a little stream in the middle of the
wooded area here. Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the caches in this series are 50cal ammo containers
filled with the usual goodies. I tried to stock the tradeables as
best as I could but my supply is running low right now. All the
caches are located less than 100m from the road, and there is mild
to medium bushwhacking required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BE WARNED!!! There is a lot of tree/bush cover for most of the
caches in this series so GPS accuracy will vary depending on where
you are, and the unit you have. You'll need to be a bit more
patient finding these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;The Story Teller Series&lt;/h1&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 100 caches that have been placed out in
rural New Brunswick near Salisbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally intended for highway 126 between Moncton and
Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Out with Ajlong completing the series and looking for the codes for the puzzle caches.
Lots of driving, lots of rushing into the woods and lots of containers to sign.
Mix that with rain and sun at the same time and we had a blast all day.
Got an FTF on this one, we didnt really expect to still find empty logs on this series.

&lt;p&gt;This series of caches is inspired by a recent accidental drive
through the dirt roads of Albert County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, while out caching for the afternoon, I decided that I
had had enough and was ready to return home. Knowing full well
where I was, I decided to punch in Pine Glen Rd into my GPS to see
how far it was from my current location. The GPS calculated a route
and for a lack of anything better to do, I decided to follow
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series of ten caches takes you along the same route I went
that day. Now, keep in mind, I don't own a 4x4 and my car is a tiny
yellow Aveo that is probably the last thing you should be driving
on roads like this. Needless to say, it was an entertaining drive
home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how many caches there are out in Albert County, with the
infamous X and all, I was surprised to see a lack of caches along
this route. So, I marked where I was and said I would return with
some caches so that others could enjoy the route as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this area has a lot of garbage on the side of the
road in spots. I made sure to place the cache in a spot that was
far back enough and not near the trash. Too bad as it is a nice
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the caches in this series are 50cal ammo containers
filled with the usual goodies. I tried to stock the tradeables as
best as I could but my supply is running low right now. All the
caches are located less than 100m from the road, and there is mild
to medium bushwhacking required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BE WARNED!!! There is a lot of tree/bush cover for most of the

&lt;p&gt;Interesting story about this cache. I placed the cache in a
couple of spots but couldn't get decent accuracy so I kept moving
it. Finally I found what I thought was a good spot and let it
average for more than 100 readings while I camo'd it a bit more.
Got to the car and was moving along to the next spot and went to
rename the previous listing, and found that the coordinates had not
saved on the GPS. Drove back to where I thought I had parked the
car and went looking for the cache. Took me a good 20 minutes to
find the cache and re-mark the spot. Thankfully, I had remembered
an upside down tree which was not too far from the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the caches in this series are 50cal ammo containers

&lt;p&gt;BE WARNED!!! There is a lot of tree/bush cover for most of the
caches in this series so GPS accuracy will vary depending on where
you are, and the unit you have. You'll need to be a bit more
patient finding these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h1&gt;The Story Teller Series&lt;/h1&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of 100 caches that have been placed out in
rural New Brunswick near Salisbury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally intended for highway 126 between Moncton and
Miramichi, I decided to hide these a bit closer to home when I
found that it was quite a nice drive in the countryside back here.
Although you're in the middle of nowhere, there were a few really
nice spots that I enjoyed while out for a Sunday drive. Upon
looking at the cache map, I noticed there were not many caches in
the area so why not fill it up with a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with giving you a nice drive through the back roads of New
Brunswick, these caches will also help you to solve three puzzle
caches associated with this series. 
Story Teller #1, 
Story Teller #2, and 
Zor's Origins. All three of those puzzle caches require you to
do this series of caches so be sure to check to see if this cache
has one of the clues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache containers themselves are all small to regular sized
containers and are all winter friendly (unless otherwise noted) so
you'll find them hanging somewhere. They do not have any pencils or
pens so bring your own writing stick. The terrain varies from cache
to cache but most are pretty easy to get at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you'll get to see some of the nice spots I saw while
out and about, otherwise, enjoy the series.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Lots of driving, lots of rushing into the woods and lots of containers to sign.

&lt;p&gt;Moncton, NB. My home town. Although I was not born here, I've
been here long enough that I am proud to call this my home town.
Most people who were born in Moncton have an affinity for it and
can't seem to stay away for very long. Eventually, those who leave
come back and wonder why they ever left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After putting the &quot;Greater Moncton Bus Tour&quot; series together, I
decided I wanted to do another series that involved the city. This
time, I literally looked at a map of the Moncton area and pinned
off four corners on the map and decided that those four spots would
receive caches. Thusly the Four Corners of Moncton cache series was
born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series will take you over several km's of terrain and
you'll see all of the city from one far end, all the way to the
next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in the Upper Coverdale area near the
Turtle Creek road. There's a small little brook that runs across
Coverdale rd and the cache is located downstream, closer towards
the river. There are houses nearby but you should have no trouble
accessing the cache via the mini-trail that has been made in the
area. There's a parking spot right beside the guardrail and you
should be able to follow that pathway towards the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a large ammo container filled with the usual
goodies. The cache is not hard to find and should be easy to even
the greenest cacher. Happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

to your car after having gone shopping at the local grocery store.
&lt;p&gt;In this Wherigo geocache, you'll need to locate your keys in the
parking lot before you'll be able to take your car, and your
groceries, home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cartridge for this Wherigo can be downloaded from 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wherigo.com/cartridge/details.aspx?CGUID=e9fec5dc-ab0e-4f57-9968-683b39725261&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Wherigo was created for the Cache Up NB Wherigo tutorial
event being held in the building located within this parking lot.
Look for it to be published in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual cache is a magnetic micro. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that although this is listed as a puzzle cache, it is actually a Wherigo cache which requires you to download the cartridge from the link provided.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located adjacent to a park near the Dover Rd in
Dieppe. Beautiful park and a nice little walk for you and anyone
else who wants to take a stroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the gates to the park look like they
close at 9pm so if you attempt this cache later than that, you'll
need to park outside the park grounds themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a large ammo container filled with the usual

field with his baseball team and plans to play a game with his
friends. The problem is, he seems to have misplaced some of his
baseball equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the player Tommy. your job is to find your baseball, glove,
and bat, and then go out to the baseball field and have some
fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the necessary cartridge for this cache 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wherigo.com/cartridge/details.aspx?CGUID=577cc29b-6a40-4da8-802c-a0d619403c99&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have hit a home run for your team, you will be given
the coordinates to the final location of the geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache was hidden as part of Cache Up NB's local workshop on
Wherigo's. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual cache container is a camo'd tobacco can. Not winter

&lt;p&gt;Although this is listed as a puzzle cache, it is actually a Wherigo cache and the cartridge can be downloaded via the link above.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
Have you wanted to get the WhereIGo icon on your list of finds but
don't want to do any of the complicated WhereIGo cartridges out
there? Well this cache is the answer. 
&lt;p&gt;This WhereIGo geocache is a simple two zone cache which anyone
should be able to use to find the final container. There's nothing
complicated about the WhereIGo. It's just as easy as walking
through a ball field to a trail and finding a cache. That's it!
You'll have your WhereIGo icon and you won't need to do anything
fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will however need to

download this cartridge file and load it onto your GPS/device.
Only devices that have a WhereIGo player can use this cartridge
file. Known devices that work are the Garmin Colorado, Garmin
Oregon, Garmin Nuvi 550, PocketPC based PDA's with GPS, and
Blackberry devices using OpenWIG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware that this cache is NOT winter friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my 3rd WhereIGo for this area so I hope you enjoy
it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FI1XME0 - Final location&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Location of the physical cache container for this WhereIGo cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

These babies are for the truly money conscious. They all feature no running water, no heat, no cable, no internet, no bathroom, no kitchen, no windows, and no bedrooms. They do have electricity, and the neighborhood is secured by a passcode fence. The front apartments do feature a cool view of an offshoot of the Peticodiac river. The owners of the buildings are a little strange though. They don't like calling them apartments. Instead, they prefer the term &quot;self-storage&quot;. 

You are looking for a 35mm film canister with logsheet only, so bring a writing stick. You won't need to go past the fence to get this cache. It is accessible to everyone at any time.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Jones Lake is a popular scenic part of Moncton. A man-made lake right in the middle of the city and connected to our well known Centennial Park, Jones Lake provides a nice walking area, and a scenic view of the sunset. Lots of decent property in the area including the high end apartment complex which you can see very clearly from this spot.

You're looking for a black pill bottle hidden on one side of the lake. There's houses nearby so try and be stealthy.

This is one of my first caches so please let me know if you have any problems.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a nano-sized cache placed at the not-new-now-but-it-is-still-new YMCA in Moncton. I've been  looking for a good place to hide a cache in this area and this place seemed like a good spot. The whole area is really starting to grow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where this is a nano, please try and keep your sig small,&lt;br/&gt;there's no pen or pencil, and bring a paperclip. It may help you in getting the log sheet out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a HIGH muggle area so stealth is definitely required and you may want to wait until after hours to attempt it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of my first caches so please let me know if you have any problems.

The Y had a few cars sitting out front, but there was nobody around, so I made a daring daytime grab, signing the log in my van and replacing it un-observed.
Great spot for a cache.

the odd hockey game. There used to be a time when this area wasn't
much of anything. It is nice to see that the city did something
with that old property and now the kids and adults alike have a
good place to enjoy some physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're looking for a black duct-taped peanut butter jar behind
the hockey arena and the sports dome. There's a few small traders,
log book, pencil, and a new TB I did up just for this cache. You'll
also find a gift card which may or may not have money left on
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Hunting!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I spooked some kind of small animal as I entered the woods (the hard way) from the road.  Don't know what it was, but it shook a few small bushes as it lumbered away through the thick underbrush.
Now I mentioned underbrush, well there was that, as well as a lot of tall grasses and fern like plants.
Of course, you never really can tell that you've taken the hard way in until you reach the cache and see the easy way out. 
I didn't run into the little animal again, which I suspect was a skunk, but I did notice that had I parked a few meters further down the road, there was a clear short grassed field like area which ran along the tree line, offering me just a couple meters of bushwhacking before getting to the cache.
Unfortunately, I failed to sign the log, as I left my pen in the van, but in lieu of that, I took a photo of me and the cache as a visual log entry.
Thanks for placing this one here.

I met the man years ago back in high school and thought since I have now started hiding my own caches, I'd tag one with his name on it. This cache is located very near to where Funky used to live back in the day.

You are looking for a nano container with logsheet only. Please place the cache back exactly where it was. There is a school nearby so be stealthy if the little ones are around.

This is one of my first caches so please let me know if you have any problems.

Good hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Was leaving the December breakfast event and decided to try and find a spot in Dieppe to hide a cache. Wandered into the area near the airport and found this side road. The road comes to a stop sign at an intersection where you can only go left or right. When I stopped the car, I realized that I was actually stopped on rail road tracks, hence the name of cache.

The cache itself is far away from the tracks and the stop sign and should not be an issue to find. It's a small plastic container with the usuals.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In May of 2000, the United States government officially removed
“selective availability” to the Global Positioning System
satellites. This meant that civilian GPS units now possessed
greater accuracy than they previously were allowed to have. 
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that, the American Hamster Council (AHC) announced
an overstock of hamsters and the rampant problem of
hamster-homelessness . Shortly after, some guy in Pennsylvania
headed out in to the woods with a pocket full of hamsters, some
Tupperware and a can of Vienna sausages. The rest is
history..except for the Vienna sausages...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new hamstercache, the first in the area, is a regular sized
camo'd lock-n-lock that contains log book, pencils, trading items,
and one small hamster. Please be kind as this cache is his
home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE HAMSTER AS THIS CACHE IS HIS
HOME!
&lt;br/&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Please think of safety first and use the nearby trail to access
this cache.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a 2 stage multi in Caledonia Industrial Park. The first stage will be the more difficult of the two. Once you arrive at ground zero, you will need to use keen observational skills to determine the coords for the 2nd stage. Stealth may be required in the daytime as the industrial park always has people and cars around.

The 2nd stage cache is a 50cal ammo container with all the regulars.

Stage 1 is definitely winter friendly but I've listed the cache as non-winter friendly because of the location of the final. You still might be able to get to it in the winter depending on the amount of snow.

There's a very special FTF prize in the container. &quot;The Complete Guide to Geocaching&quot; DVD. I bought this recently and since I've now watched it and got what I want out of it, I'm putting it out as an FTF prize. My only request is that once you've watched it, you place it in another cache for someone else to enjoy.

Hope you enjoy this multi!

You are looking for a 2L cammo'd ice cream container located near one of the walking trails in Caledonia industrial park. There's a nice stream that goes by this area and the walking trail goes on for a little while. It's a great place to get away from the office on days where I've been pulling my hair out. Hopefully you'll enjoy the trail as I did.

The cache can be accessed both via the trail, or through the back of one of the local businesses. If doing the cache at night, the latter would be the easiest. Otherwise, you may have a small bushwhack to get to it.

a puzzle cache for a long time and I am finally taking the time out

&lt;p&gt;The coordinates above will take you to a location where you will
find a container that contains the puzzle element of this cache.
Once you find the container, the contents can be used to find the
final coordinates for this cache. Please return the contents to the
container once you have learned the coordinates for the final and
return the container to it's original location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not remove the &quot;flat&quot; piece within the container as it
is meant to make solving the puzzle a bit easier. I would also ask
that you please do not attempt this cache in the rain. When you
find the initial container, you'll understand why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be stealthy when you approach the final as there is a
business located very near to the final location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term &quot;vodcache&quot; comes from the term &quot;podcache&quot; which is a
geocache that requires you to listen to an audio file (podcast)
that gives you directions to a cache location. Instead of using
audio to receive your directions, this cache is using video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to correctly find this cache, you will need to watch
this video
which I created specifically for this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to obtain the coordinates, you will have to use some
very keen observational skills when you watch the above video. The
video itself contains everything you need in order to figure out
the final location. There are no additional clues or pieces of
information required. The only thing you need to do is watch the
video, and pay close attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache itself is a 50cal ammo container filled with the
regular items including log book and writing materials. The cache
itself is not hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on

The cache size is not listed as micro as the container itself is unique. You should have no problem spotting it.

You are looking for container inspired by a 35mm film canister. Log book and writing instrument are in the container. Please be VERY careful with this cache and replace it back where you found it. The lid is attached in a special fashion so please take care to remove and place back on carefully.

This cache started with a pile of swag including some blank DVD/CDR's, a Sony PSP game, and a bunch of other little trinkets.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Back in early 2008, I attended my first geocaching event which was all about the software GSAK. I met some local cachers and was fortunate enough to win the door prize. The prize was a 30cal ammo can fully stocked and ready to go. I needed a place to hide it so I came out this way to find some of Jim52 &amp; markirene's caches and decided to hide this cache here. All was well for two years.

Earlier this year (2010), critter431 logged a find on this cache but as it turns out, it wasn't my cache he found. In fact, he found a cache that had been hidden by Zonker years ago (GCT8PY) but had been archived awhile back. My log book was beside the old container but the container was Zonker's and had his log book.

I went out to check it for myself and sure enough, no sign of the ammo can but my log and bag were sitting right beside Zonker's cache. After talking to Zonker, I have sort of adopted this cache since I am the one with the active listing and his is long archived. 

You are looking for a small lock-n-lock container with the regulars in it. The terrain is set high for a reason. PLEASE be very careful when going to the cache area. Your best bet is to make use of the thick wire as a handhold. Take the terrain level seriously.</groundspeak:long_description>

Community forestry has become a popular movement, challenging foresters to change their thinking. A community forest can be described as any forestry operation managed by a local government or community group for the benefit of the entire community. Community forestry involves the three pillars of sustainable development: social, ecological, and economic sustainability.

You may see samples of community forestry in Irishtown Nature Park through the use of selective cutting. Selective cutting, also known as selective felling, is a more ecologically sustainable practice than clearcutting. As a silviculture system it is designed to maintain an uneven or all-aged forest of trees varying not only in age, but in size and species as well.

The staggering of light cuttings in a forest stand as the trees grow and mature also lessens the ecological and visual impact harvesting has on a forest and provides an opportunity to create gaps in the forest canopy to encourage natural regeneration. It is also beneficial to remove dry, dead trees which are prone to forest fires.

At its core, community forestry is about local control over and enjoyment of the benefits offered by local forest resources. Community forests support local livelihoods, promote community participation and foster long-term environmental stewardship.

&lt;p&gt;How long can a Hemlock tree live? Up to 800 years old! How about
a Red Spruce or White Pine? The oldest Red Spruce tree was found
here in New Brunswick along the Fundy coast, it was 445 years old.
The Acadian Forest has many different trees at many different ages;
seedlings, young trees, old trees and dead trees. The forest needs
many different ages of trees to be healthy. Dead trees provide
habitat and a source of food for many different species and are a
vital part of the food chain. Dead trees also decompose and make
rich soil. When a tree falls it creates a hole in the canopy to
allow sunlight in to help the new young trees to grow. Through
selective cutting and community forestry the park can help control
the forest and keep it diverse. The Acadian forest also plays a key
role in keeping our rivers cool, providing shade along the streams
and river banks. This increases the oxygen level that fish and
water plants need to live.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The diversity of the Acadian Forest provides a great habitat for
many different species of plants and animals. There are over 30,000
different species in New Brunswick, including 32 native tree
species and 225 different bird species!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Acadian Forest stretches from New York State to northern New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia. It contains alpine areas, coniferous
forest, northern hardwoods forest and wetlands with no clear
boundaries between them.&lt;/p&gt;
Combien longtemps que la pruche du
Canada peut elle vivre? Jusqu’à 800 ans! Et les épinettes rouges ou
les pins blancs? L’épinette rouge le plus ancien fut trouvé au
Nouveau Brunswick sur la côte Fundy. Il datait de 445 ans. La Forêt
Acadienne consiste de plusieurs différents arbres à tous les stages
de croissance jusqu’aux arbres morts. Pour que la forêt soit de
bonne santé, elle à besoin d’arbres de tous les âges. Les arbres
morts fourni des habitats et de la nourriture pour plusieurs
espèces et joue un rôle très important dans la chaîne alimentaire.
Avec le temps, les arbres morts se décompose, produisant un sol
très riche. Quand un arbre tombe, un trou est créé dans le
feuillage de la forêt, ainsi permettant le soleil de pénétrer pour
aider les jeunes arbres à grandir. Avec la récolte sélective et la
foresterie communautaire, le parc aide à contrôler la diversité de
la forêt. De plus, la forêt Acadienne joue un rôle clef pour tenir
l’eau fraiche en fournissant de l’ombre pour les ruisseaux et les
bords des rivières. Ceci augments le niveau de l’oxygène que les
poissons et plantes ont besoin pour survivre.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
La diversité de la foret Acadienne fournie un excellant
habitat pour un grand nombre d’espèces de plantes et animaux. Il y
a plus de 30,000 différentes espèces au Nouveau Brunswick, y
incluant 32 espèces d’arbres natifs et 225 espèces d’oiseaux!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
La foret Acadienne part de l’État de New York jusqu’au nord du
Nouveau Brunswick et aussi la Nouvelle Ecosse. Elle contient des
espaces alpines, foret conifères, foret feuillus nordique d’ombre
et les zones humides et ceux-ci existe sans frontières net entre
eux.

&lt;p&gt;Moncton, NB. My home town. Although I was not born here, I've
been here long enough that I am proud to call this my home town.
Most people who were born in Moncton have an affinity for it and
can't seem to stay away for very long. Eventually, those who leave
come back and wonder why they ever left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After putting the &quot;Greater Moncton Bus Tour&quot; series together, I
decided I wanted to do another series that involved the city. This
time, I literally looked at a map of the Moncton area and pinned
off four corners on the map and decided that those four spots would
receive caches. Thusly the Four Corners of Moncton cache series was
born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series will take you over several km's of terrain and
you'll see all of the city from one far end, all the way to the
next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located just past Magnetic Hill School near Indian
Mountain. There's a golf course nearby, plus all of the usual
tourist stuff long before you hit this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a large ammo container filled with the usual
goodies. The cache is not hard to find and should be easy to even
the greenest cacher. Happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Found lots of areas there to place a cache, but had to let GPS settle to find it. Took about 15 minutes. No worries about muggles there, and surprisingly few mosquitos.
Took pin, left about 15 glow sticks and a large carabiner.

This cache is part of the
Irishtown Nature Park Geo-coin challange. Print you passport and
get all four caches with the punches to collect the coin. This is
also a letterbox, bring your stamp if you have one.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This cache was hidden by the Atlantic Canada Geocaching Association
in conjuction with the City of Moncton, who provided the 250 coins
for this challange. You can download the passport
&lt;a href=&quot;http://atlanticgeocaching.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;amp;task=cat_view&amp;amp;gid=77&amp;amp;Itemid=175&quot;&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Irishtown Nature Park is unique in that it offers a wide
variety of habitats to explore from Acadian forests to wetlands,
aquatic/terrestrial environments and much more. This picturesque
nature park consists of 2,200 acres of forest and 250 acres of
water.&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
The park boasts a spectacular system of trails that make an
excellent venue for one of the city's favourite pastimes: bird
watching. Birds are excellent natural indicators of the health of
many ecosystems. They are the literal canary in the coalmine--when
birds disappear from an area, it normally signals the deteriorating
health of the entire ecosystem&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Feeders&lt;br/&gt;
Feeding stations along the trails attract a wide variety of birds
and allow amateur ornithologists an opportunity rarely seen in
these parts. St. Michaels Scout Troop maintains bird feeders
throughout the winter months in cooperation with the City of
Moncton. At the feeders, chickadees are most commonly seen, but
nuthatches, yellow and purple finches, hairy and downy woodpeckers
and many other species can be viewed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Owls&lt;br/&gt;
Although nocturnal by nature, owls are also an integral part of the
Irishtown Nature Park ecosystem. Great Horned, Saw-whet and Barred
Owls all live within the park although are more often heard than
seen, each with distinctive calls.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Waterfowl&lt;br/&gt;
With such a large aquatic section, Irishtown Nature Park attracts
many varieties of waterfowl for feeding, nesting and breeding.
Several species of ducks, geese and loons are all commonly seen in
the water, as well as herons, grebes and others.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Raptors&lt;br/&gt;
With the biodiversity within the park, visitors may also see any
number of birds soaring high above before diving down to suddenly
snatch a meal from the ground or water. Bald eagles, osprey and
broad winged hawks are among the raptors that call the park
home.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Le Parc naturel d’Irishtown
est unique en ce qu'il offre une grande variété d'habitats à
explorer à partir de forêts acadiennes, de zones humides, et
milieux aquatiques/terrestres et bien plus encore.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Le parc se vante d’un système spectaculaire de sentiers qui font un
lieu de réunion excellent pour un des passe-temps préférés en ville
: l’observations des oiseaux. Les oiseaux sont des indicateurs
naturels excellents de la santé de beaucoup d'écosystèmes. Ils sont
littérallement le canari dans la mine de charbon - quand les
oiseaux disparaissent d'une région, il indique normalement la santé
se détériorant de l'écosystème entier.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Mangeoires&lt;br/&gt;
Les stations d’alimentations le long des pistes attirent une grande
variété d'oiseaux et fournissent aux ornithologues amateurs une
opportunité rarement vue dans ces parties. La Troupe scout St
Michaels Scout maintient des mangeoires d'oiseau tout au long des
mois d'hiver en coopération avec la Ville de Moncton. Les mésanges
sont les plus fréquemment observées, mais des sittelles, des
chardonnerets jaunes, des roselins pourprés, des pics chevelus et
mineurs et de nombreuses autres espèces peuvent être
observés.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Hibous&lt;br/&gt;
Bien que nocturne par nature, les hibous sont aussi une partie
intégrale de l'écosystème du Parc naturel d’Irishtown. Le Grand
Duc, la Chouette rayés et la Petite Nyctale tous vivent dans le
parc bien qu’ils soient plus fréquemment entendus que vu, chacun
avec son appel distinctif.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Oiseau aquatique&lt;br/&gt;
Avec une si grande section aquatique, le Parc naturel d'Irishtown
attire beaucoup de variétés d'oiseau aquatique pour l'alimentation,
la nidification et la reproduction. Plusieurs espèces de canards,
oies et plongeons (huards) ainsi que des hérons, des grèbes et
d'autres sont tous communément vus dans l'eau.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Rapaces&lt;br/&gt;
Avec la diversité biologique dans le parc, les visiteurs peuvent
aussi voir un grand nombre d'oiseaux montant haut avant de plonger
en bas pour subitement attraper un repas par terre ou dans l'eau.
Certains aigles et faucons et le balbuzard pêcheur sont parmi les
rapaces qui habitent le parc. </groundspeak:long_description>

Just off the Red Trail which is a hiking and biking trail with winter maintainence. 

The seven principals of Leave No Trace Geocaching

1. Plan Ahead and Prepare

Read the cache description, know the area regulations and special concerns
Be prepared for the weather
Try to plan your route in and out ahead of time
Try to go paperless
Let someone know where you are going and when you will be back
Use a well stocked backpack withdrinks, snacks and first aid kit


2. Travel on durable surfaces and established trails.

Always travel on the trail as much as possible
Hide caches in areas that avoid leaving the trail
Avoid creating  a “geo-trail” take another way in to diminish creating a path to the cache in wilderness areas
If there is already a well established geo-trail, use it.
Respect private property
Don’t place a cache where it will cause damage to nature by being there or by other cachers seeking it

 
3. Cache in, trash out.

Pack it in, Pack it out
Do not leave human waste near the cache
Deposit human waste at least 70 meters from any cache, water source or trail.
Dig a “cathole” 6-8 inches deep to deposit solid human waste in, bury any paper used and cover.
Do not throw out food waste such as; apple cores, orange or banana peels where they don’t belong, pack it out.
Remove any swag that doesn’t belong in the cache or area, including wet or damaged log-books and email the owner if there are issues with the cache becoming litter.

 

4. Leave what you find.

Leave plants, rocks, tress and historical items as you founds them
Do not damage trees to place a cache
Leave gates as you found them
Do not place clues on rocks, trees or any natural structures
Take “swag” home not nature



5. Be careful with fire

Be careful not to start any fires or leave flammable or combustible materials in a cache
If you have a fire keep it small and use an established fire pit
Use only small pieces of wood, smaller than your arm that you can break by hand
Do not use bark or braches from standing tress, collect it from the ground.


6. Respect Wildlife

Observe wildlife from a distance. Do not follow or approach them
Remember we are visiting their home, treat it as you would a friend or neighbour’s house.
Never feed animals, our food is not healthy for them
Control your pets at all times
Avoid wildlife especially during mating, nesting, when raising young or winter.
Do not hide a cache that would interfere with any wildlife nesting areas travel routes, food source or water source.


7. Be considerate of others

Respect other cachers and protect the quality of their experience
Be courteous, yield to others on the trails
Do not approach other cachers at a cache site, stay back and talk after they leave the cache area
Avoid loud noises, let nature’s sounds prevail

&lt;p&gt;Moncton, NB. My home town. Although I was not born here, I've
been here long enough that I am proud to call this my home town.
Most people who were born in Moncton have an affinity for it and
can't seem to stay away for very long. Eventually, those who leave
come back and wonder why they ever left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After putting the &quot;Greater Moncton Bus Tour&quot; series together, I
decided I wanted to do another series that involved the city. This
time, I literally looked at a map of the Moncton area and pinned
off four corners on the map and decided that those four spots would
receive caches. Thusly the Four Corners of Moncton cache series was
born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series will take you over many kilometers of terrain and
you'll see all of the city from one far end, all the way to the
next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located near Lakeside Estates which also
represents the upper right hand corner of Greater Moncton. While
you're out here, you might stop at the local golf course, or even
go skating on the homemade rink during the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a large ammo container filled with the usual
goodies. The cache is well hidden so please rehide in the same spot
as well or better than it was before. Happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



Not that far out of Moncton, I found this little spot which is just
off the Cape Breton road. I drive by here often on my lunch hours
when I need to get away from the office and I always enjoy the
scenery in the area. It seemed like a ripe location for a cache. I
hope you enjoy it as much as I did. 
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for micro with log book only. This cache was
originally an ammo can placed under the bridge but was muggled and
therefore I moved it and changed containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please rehide this as well as you found it. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

You're looking for a large ammo can with all the regulars. 

I named this cache after Ron's Indy series which is in that area. Had a great time doing the caches so I thought Indy could use a crayon.
