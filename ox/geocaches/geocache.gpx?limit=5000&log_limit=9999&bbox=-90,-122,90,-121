            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The other day, the GeoRetrievers and I were out for a walk at Gav, and noticed a couple of cross country runners go straight where we usually take a right (no, it wasn't in Albuquerque!). I thought we'd follow them, and we ended up in a pretty cool area, able to check out the nearby farm (not to mention all the cows!) , and we had a good view out onto a slice of the valley. &lt;br /&gt;On the way back, I scouted out a spot for a cache, and found a great hiding place! Went back today with a container, and alas... too big for my great hiding place... so it's in an OK hiding place ;-&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTF prize is an unregistered TB tag.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodlife recently placed a cache near the Old Gilroy Library, which&lt;br /&gt;is now the Gilroy Museum (GC1XX5V). This inspired me to place a&lt;br /&gt;cache near the New Gilroy Library. New being relative, as the&lt;br /&gt;library moved into this building in the late 60's. I didn't place&lt;br /&gt;the cache on the grounds however, because the new library is soon&lt;br /&gt;to be demolished and rebuilt (see the drawing above)... perhaps&lt;br /&gt;you'll see some of this when you are searching for this cache. You&lt;br /&gt;can read a bit about the new library project here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Library Project PDF. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to being near the library, the cache is also near the&lt;br /&gt;new Gilroy Police Station (looks like a fortress not a station!),&lt;br /&gt;the Gilroy Senior Community Center (check out their gift shop) as&lt;br /&gt;well as the back of the Gilroy City Hall and administrative&lt;br /&gt;offices.

They are all in a very good shape and at really nice spots.

If you want to see it in real life, you&lt;br /&gt;had better hurry because I doubt it will last long between the&lt;br /&gt;teenagers that like to hang out here or the next rain storm!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I set the terrain level to two because you have to cross a small&lt;br /&gt;creek several times, balancing on rocks.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is near the parking lot for our Veterinarian. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We had an awesome dog a few years ago (pre-GeoRetrievers), named Sienna.  She was half Mastiff and half German Shepherd. We almost called her Blue, because her parent's owners used a different color of nail polish on the top of their heads to tell the puppies apart, and Sienna's color was blue! When we got her at 8 weeks old, she fit in my two cupped hands.  She eventually grew into a 130 pound dog! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She was an avid frisbee and tennis ball catcher/chaser (she didn't actually like to give it back though). She was a really great companion and protector.  Assuming you were human, she'd love you, especially little kids (but it WAS pretty common people would cross the street if they saw us coming on a walk!). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, if you were a small animal (cat, &quot;rat dog&quot;, or whatever) you were fair game, which cost us a few vet bills for other peoples pets :-(.  We learned to keep her on-leash! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, at about age 6, she developed bone cancer, and after seeing her in a lot of pain, and the options (amputation, radio/chemo therapy) weren't really too promising, after some really tough decision making,  we decided we had to let her go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think our awesome vets at this location were nearly as upset about this as we were, and they made this as easy as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm sorry to get so &quot;verklempt&quot; in this cache description, but we still miss her, even a few years later!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, this cache has been placed in her honor. She really enjoyed her visits to her vets (they really liked her, and of course there were the ever present treats), and we really appreciate all the time and effort they put into trying to cure her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our thanks to them!!! &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This one is a reminder of how good life can be when you spend part of your days off to become one with the caches. If you plan to retrieve this cache come well prepared. Believe difficulty rating is correct. If you've picked up on my hints you'll probably find it quickly. Even if you've done the hide that inspired this one you might find too many choices of location.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is a monument on the west side of Monterey just north of here if you would like to pay your respects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sinaloa Restaurant eventually reopened in a new downtown location where they still serve the best Mexican food around.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a sign only micro.  &lt;br/&gt;No need to go to the other side of fence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is close by parking.&lt;br/&gt;It is close to a major road, so be careful.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">If you have ever noticed the big anchor while driving down Monterey Highway, here it the story behind it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the mid 1800's, Alviso was the major shipping port for the San Francisco Bay, especially for agricultural cargo from the fertile Santa Clara Valley.  Ships would even travel up some of local rivers to pick up their shipments.  You can still see the remains of the town of Drawbridge near Alviso that allowed ships to travel up the rivers while still providing for the land routes that eventually made the port of Alviso obsolete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ships even used to travel up the Coyote River, long before Anderson Dam, highway bridges, and rerouting of the river bed created all the silt that made the river impassable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last ship to travel up the Coyote River to the town of Madrone to pick up a load of cherries was the SS Boole.  Unfortunately the river was already nearly impassable and after loading the cherries onto the ship it could no longer make it back down the river.  It had to unload all non-essential supplies, including one of its anchors, to make the trip back to Alviso.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's the anchor you still see on the Monterey Highway at the northern end of Madrone (now part of Morgan Hill).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the next time you see the Boole's anchor, remember this Boole Ship story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache placed here with permission of the manager of the RV storage lot.  Please respect the area, CITO and stay clear of the fence.  Certainly no need to go on the other side of the fence or near any of the RVs in the storage area.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">An RV on the way to this RV park was struck by a Caltrain going over 70 MPH just south of here at Palm Avenue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The elderly driver ignored the RV park recommended directions to take 101 to Cochrane to Monterey.  Instead he got hung up when he tried to drive a long and low RV over the high railroad tracks at Palm and Monterey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the Morgan Hill Times:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nov 25, 2009&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Into every motorist's life, there comes a moment when the paved road turns unexpectedly to dirt, streetlights give way to starlight, and regardless of where you thought you were going, where you have arrived is the middle of nowhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Roger Scott, that moment came as darkness fell Wednesday, as he was nosing his 28-foot Winnebago over a railroad crossing on Palm Avenue in Morgan Hill, not far from the Coyote Creek Golf Club. The only direction that made sense to Scott at the time was to go back the way he came, but because he was towing a 15-foot SUV, backing up was not an option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then Scott, 88, and Betty Nelson, his 81-year-old girlfriend, heard metal grinding on metal and felt their RV suddenly shudder to a stop. Scott stood on the tracks trying to see what had beached his vehicle. &quot;That's when I saw the headlight of a train coming,&quot; he said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nelson had dialed 911 from the passenger's seat of the RV while Scott poked around outside, but she spent several minutes explaining how they had arrived at their current predicament. At least five minutes went by before Nelson mentioned she was marooned on train tracks in a 43-foot metal barricade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;The 911 lady kept saying 'What's the emergency?' &quot; Scott explained later. &quot;That went on for a little while. Finally, she said, 'Get out of the motor home and get way away from the tracks.' &quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scott retreated from the tracks, but Nelson was not inclined to abandon ship so easily and stood on the tracks talking to a man who had stopped to see if anything was wrong. &lt;br/&gt;&quot;I kept yelling at her to get off the tracks and get back with me,&quot; Scott said. &quot;And she finally did.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By that time, the engineer of Caltrain's No. 270 train — which had pulled out of San Jose's Diridon Station at 6:16 p.m., bound for Gilroy — was frantically blowing the horn from the locomotive of the million-pound train. The maximum speed the train is allowed to travel on that portion of the old Union Pacific tracks is 79 mph, and it was probably doing close to that as it plowed into the Winnebago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;As I heard the thing tooting and coming down the road, I realized it was going to be a huge wreck,&quot; Nelson said. &quot;I thought, 'I don't need to see this.' I was holding onto Roger looking the other way when it hit.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collision sounded like a bomb detonating and brought farmworkers running from nearby fields. &quot;It was like something you'd see in the movies,&quot; Scott said. The couple was standing 150 yards clear of the explosion and were not struck by flying debris.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-----&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do not cross the fence or enter the RV park.  &lt;br/&gt;Not recommended at night since flashlights could disturb local residents.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">5:07PM - Started the long ride back north after finding 17 caches along the Coyote Creek Trail and 3 more fairly new caches off Ogier Road. Now I needed one more for the day for  personal best. I saw this cache on my GPS getting closer as I rode up Monterey HiWay. I'd been to nearby Caltrain meets a Truck before so this area looked familiar. Got to the right spot and spotted something that looked new and it was the cache. Probably my tiniest find of the day. SL and headed home after a perfect 21/21 day. No DNFs. Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

This it where Caltrain hit a Coca-cola semi-truck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In August 1999, a Coca-cola truck got caught on the rise where Richmond Avenue used to go over the train tracks.  The truck driver couldn't move his vehicle, and he was unable to call in time to stop the high-speed Caltrain approaching.  The train was &quot;backing up&quot; on the morning run, so the passenger car struck the truck first.  37 people were injured in what one passenger described as a tidal wave of Coke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're looking for a small silver bison tube.

It was a fairly evil cache that was camoed very well by ample plant growth and shadows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then Caltrans came by and cut away, then poisoned, all the plant life here.  It must have been a very effective poison since it's a year later and absolutely nothing is growing on the shoulder or on the embankment.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It reminds me of a very toxic chemical called Agent Orange that the U.S. used in Viet Nam during the war to kill the jungle growth and provide clear fields of view.  I served in the Viet Nam war and from where I was stationed you couldn't see a living bush or tree for miles.  Of course, that may have been because I  was stationed on the USS Enterprise out in the South China Sea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  USS Enterprise (CVN-65) is the only warship from the Viet Nam war still on active duty.  The Big E is the oldest ship still serving on active duty and the second oldest ship still commissioned in the U.S. Navy after the wooden hulled USS Constituion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the original cache was left exposed and I wanted to get it off the ground and away from whatever chemical they used, I've replaced it in a more traditional hide style.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK31ZQE - GC31ZQE Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 37° 12.375 W 121° 43.777</groundspeak:long_description>

It was raining the whole week and trails was muddy as they can be. The wash pit stop for my geo dog was unavoidable. To celebrate this rare washing occasion and milestone the cache was placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the tradition of the park caches I hide ammo can next to the dog wash. You will find plenty of parking near by, but be aware of muggles and muggle dogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulation jetta395 with FTF and 1000 milestone. Time to get a 1000 cache coin ;-). Bumping difficulty to 3 star per suggestion and due to heavy tree cover.</groundspeak:long_description>

Depending on the time of the day and day of the week there could be loads of muggles about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carolyn Norris Park named for longtime San Jose neighborhood activist.&lt;br/&gt;Longtime Cambrian activist Carolyn Norris will be posthumously acknowledged on May 14 when a new public park will be named for her on Samaritan Drive.&lt;br/&gt;Carolyn Norris Park spans 1.3 acres at 2133 Samaritan Drive, and it has a large lawn, two children's play structures and a gazebo with game tables. Vice Mayor Judy Chirco spoke about Norris' life at the park's opening ceremony.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;This is a park that would make Carolyn proud. It is for her community and children—two interests that were near and dear to Carolyn's heart,&quot; Chirco said in a statement.&lt;br/&gt;Norris was involved in traffic calming efforts for years, and she was responsible for many road safety improvements in the Cambrian area. During the Highway 85 project, she also kept close tabs on the installation of its soundwalls and landscaping, a stone's throw from the park.&lt;br/&gt;Norris also advocated to save the Camden Community Center when it was threatened by development.&lt;br/&gt;A dedicated maker of jams and jellies with her husband, Norris won blue ribbons at Santa Clara County and California State fairs for her recipes. Norris died in 2006 of a brain aneurysm.&lt;br/&gt;Dennis Norris, her husband, said his wife would be &quot;embarrassed but very happy&quot; with a public park named in her honor.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Her fingerprints are on a number of things in the Cambrian area and beyond,&quot; Dennis Norris said in a statement.&lt;br/&gt;The event on May 14 will include a ceremony celebrating&lt;br/&gt;her life, and it will have light refreshments, free face painting and balloon animals for children.&lt;br/&gt;Just down the road from Good Samaritan Hospital, the triangular park is between a new SummerHill Homes development and Highway 85, but it is built on a hill above the highway between Union and Clydelle avenues.&lt;br/&gt;City officials held two meetings with neighbors to gather input on what amenities neighbors wanted in the park, and planners said they hope the shaded tables for chess and checkers will draw passersby. </groundspeak:long_description>

Found a scuffed up baseball, several key lock boxes, and an empty water bottle dangling from a tree. We didn't know what we were looking for, so we looked for anything... Looked in cones, over &amp; under tables, in &amp; out of trash cans, &amp; in &amp; around the trees, shrubs,&amp; play structures. It is truly a cute park, however, and if you have kids, it's worth the trip... But I believe this cache must have been found by muggles...

A cache near the Shark Tank for exchanging small items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Location is by the Arena Green area of Guadalupe River Park.  Initial stock was small, Shark-themed swag items. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a small lok-n-lok style container hidden with natural cover.  GZ is within 10 feet of paved walkway, you don't need to go all the way down to the river. Stealth will be required at certain times as arena events draw muggle traffic. Sometimes the area will be blocked off with orange fence due to events on the arena green, if this is the case come back in a few days. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are caching after dark, be aware there are overnight sleepers in the park and vicinity. The city will try to shoo them away every few months but they come back. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is easy access by bicycle or foot from the Guadalupe River Trail.  Free parking is available nearby on Autumn Street (except when blocked for arena events). Metered parking is available along St John Street a few blocks away under the Route 87 overpass, just past Henry's. Difficulty is two because of the ground slope and the need for stealth.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A cache honoring Mexico’s Cinco de Mayo (Fifth of May)
holiday, the anniversary of the victory over an invading French
army in 1862 at Puebla.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the Mexican Civil War of 1858-1860 and the election of
Benito Juarez as President of the Republic of Mexico, French troops
landed in Veracruz in 1861 as part of a joint French, Spanish and
British force. The incursion was originally to secure payment of
debt owed by the Mexican government but disagreement arose among
the three nations as to how to proceed. Spanish and British forces
withdrew but the French emperor Napoleon III sought to exploit
turmoil in Mexico by launching an invasion supported by
conservative elements in Mexican society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 5th, Mexican forces under General Ignacio Zaragoza
defeated a superior French force at the city of Puebla, a strategic
point on the route to the capital in Mexico City. This stalled the
invasion effort for the time being. The next year, the French sent
a much larger army down the same route and after a long siege, took
Puebla and then Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French forces installed Archduke Maximilian of Austria (possibly
Napoleon III’s cousin) as the emperor of a puppet Mexican
government. But the initial Mexican resistance inspired the people
to join guerillas led by Juarez, who was determined to fight on to
restore the republic. President Abraham Lincoln of the United
States also gave support to the Mexicans but this was limited at
the time due to the Civil War in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Civil War ended in 1865, and arms and supplies flowed
south to the Mexicans. Meanwhile, Maximilian inflamed American
sentiments by openly inviting defeated Confederates to settle in
Mexican territory. Under pressure from the US, the French withdrew
in 1866 and Maximilian’s remaining supporters were defeated
in 1867.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cinco de Mayo is one of two major holidays in Mexico celebrating
the unity of their nation, the other being Independence Day on
September 16th. Here in the United States, it’s a day for
Mexican-Americans to share their culture with others in the typical
American way with parades, parties and lots of good food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is magnetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update with new co-ordinates&lt;/b&gt;
The old location had a problem with muggles and liquids. The new
spot requires different stealth techniques but should be better.
Cache is now a magnetic nano, hidden in a conventional manner.
Difficulty is now 2.5, two for being a nano, another 1/2 point for
the stealth required at certain times.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A cache at Santa Clara's &quot;little&quot; library- the Mission Branch.  Not the first at this location...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here we are at the City Plaza Park, a pleasant spot close to Santa Clara University and the &quot;Old Quad&quot; neighborhood.  The small branch library is almost a secret.  It is a very friendly place to help a child become accustomed to a library and provides adult literacy services as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large gazebo is a place to enjoy a sandwich on a warm day and watch the squirrels scamper about.  On Saturday morning there is a farmers' market a few blocks away by the post office.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many caches have been placed in this park over the years, some around this very spot.  This container is a small mint tin. It is magnetic and concealed, but you don't need to crawl through any vegetation to find it. This is intended as an easy find, just note that GPS signals are bothered by the trees.  Also, some stealth is required at GZ. The hint is still a give-away to make it easy for kids, and keep cachers from attracting attention. On-street parking is free and very easy.</groundspeak:long_description>

Lieutenant Jose Joaquin Moraga, with 14 settlers and their families arrived in the Santa Clara Valley to found El Pueblo de San Jose de Guadalupe on November 29, 1777.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When California became a state in 1850, San Jose served as its first capital.  San Jose is the 3d largest city in California, the 10th largest city in the US and is the county seat for the County of Santa Clara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Busy area on weekdays, so watch for muggles. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A cache hide off El Camino Real in Santa Clara
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Change comes and chains go, and most of the old retail landmarks
along El Camino Real in Santa Clara have fallen. But the Moonlight
Shopping Center still soldiers on, though with some changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cinema 150, where I saw “The Empire Strikes
Back” way back, is gone and replaced by a medical building.
The Moonlight Drive-In theater was bulldozed for condos. An office
superstore replaced the S. H. Kress where my sister bought
goldfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other 1960‘s shopping centers on El Camino were remodeled,
demolished, or sit largely abandoned. But Moonlight is still
recognizable and hopping with a supermarket, major drug chain,
service shops and restaurants for a variety of tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located near the Moonlight Lanes bowling alley;
which seems to be hiding itself behind the center to escape the
view of the 21st century. The rear lot is normally pretty quiet
except for the bowlers and snack bar customers. If you come here at
lunch you may smell the burgers and fries. Stealth may be required
at times, shoe rental is optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Updated 6/15/2011.&lt;/b&gt;The cache is
now a small container with room for trade items. It’s not on
the ground, definitely not in ivy at time of hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to kdka94086 for the
FTF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Sandstone and shale were deposited here in the
ocean
during the Mesozoic period. These rocks make up the bulk of the
coastal range in California. At the location, you can easily make
out the many layers of the sedimentary shale deposit. The tilt and
dip is also very visible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There have been many geological events that have molded that area
as we see today. Tectonics and erosion have played a big part in
the sculpture of most of California and here is more
evidence.&lt;br /&gt;

He wrote this article published in the July 9, 2006 San Jose Mercury News about our bet (copied with permission):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Roadshow stunt hurt -- both pride and wallet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I forked over $31.43 at a Shell station on Bernal Road on Friday, filling up Arlen Stone's thirsty silver Mazda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By more than a 5-1 ratio, readers decided I lost my bet with Stone on when construction would end at Central Expressway and Lafayette Street, one of those roadway projects that is small in scale but seems to take forever to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wrote a few weeks ago that work would be finished July 4. My prediction drew this challenge from Stone, a quality assurance engineer who commutes from Morgan Hill to this Santa Clara intersection each day:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;''I'm so confident it won't be done by then that I'm willing to bet big bucks -- a tank of gas -- that work isn't done by July 4.''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pshaw. I know roads. The new lanes were almost in, most of the wiring was completed, paving was about to begin. Finish by July 4? Easy money.  You've got a bet, Arlen. Prepare to fill up the guzzlin' Richards minivan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, a few minor details remained. Crews had yet to install the final lane markers. Manhole covers needed to be fitted. Signals needed testing. Sidewalks weren't in.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ticky, tacky. Nothing to it.  County deputy roads director Dan Collen began sending constant updates. He sounded so hopeful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, an ominous e-mail two weeks ago: Striping is going slowly. If it's not completed, Collen suggested, ''You might want to call it a draw.''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A draw? No way. If the lanes are open, as they were when July 4 rolled around, then the project is complete -- striping or no striping. I decided to conduct a little poll. Readers, surely, would agree that I had won.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was calling in my chits. Remember those potholes I've filled for you, readers? Remember the long red lights I've shortened and the murky rules of the road I've explained? Now it's time to help me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was ugly. Of 79 votes, 66 slapped me down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;''You must pay up, Roadman,'' said Del Barrett of Auburn, adding that ''anyone who is willing to believe that a government project will be completed on time or within budget deserved to lose.''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And . . .  ''Work is not done until it's done,'' said John Lebya of San Jose. ''Striping is part of the work. So I say you owe this chap a tank of gas. And why is it that if you win, he has to fill up your minivan? What happened to that Prius?''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The clincher? ''A Porta Potti is still set up'' at the intersection, said Bruce Lang of Sunnyvale. Yet another vote against Mr. Roadshow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In desperation, I turned to Roadshow contacts like Sean Comey of AAA, Lauren Wonder of Caltrans, John Pilger with the city of Sunnyvale and Jim Helmer, head of San Jose's department of transportation. Maybe I could pad the final count.  Turncoats, all of 'em.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;''Sorry on this one, Gary,'' Helmer said, so coldly. ''I vote for the reader.''  Even Collen chided me.  ''I tried to give you an out when I became concerned about the contractor meeting the schedule,'' Collen said. ''But nooooo. 'I want to win. I want to win.' ''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Help me, someone.  ''I say you win -- hands down!'' said Helen Wong of Los Altos. ''Temporary lane markers work, and that counts. I don't know why people can't get that.''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there weren't enough Helens. So I marched out the door Friday morning, telling Mrs. Roadshow that I was about to spend our cash to fill up a stranger's car. ''The paper is paying for this, right?'' she said.  Well, dear, nope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stone proved to be a good guy. He could have run his gas tank to empty, but didn't. No surprise. After all, he grew up on an Iowa farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;''You're the biggest celebrity I've met since I talked to Dustin Hoffman at a party in L.A.,'' he said, adding: ''As a fellow Iowan . . . I like you, despite your support of carpool lanes and hybrids.''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stone began driving through the Central Expressway intersection in October and saw the torn-up islands, sidewalks and lanes, all at a time completion was promised for March. But what really got his attention is what he didn't see -- workers.  A subcontractor didn't show, causing a four-month delay. Fines could reach $20,000.  Heavy winter rains caused more trouble. The opening became July 4. Almost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stone smiled -- wouldn't you if someone filled up your gas tank? -- as I fumbled with the pump for $3.17 a gallon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;''Maybe,'' he mused, eyeing the $3.39 tag for premium, ''I should go with the Super V-6.''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ah, no!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Off Target&quot; really was. We felt some target practice was
needed, and found a good place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is dedicated to a well-known local puzzle cacher. It's
somewhat related to the wrong &quot;track&quot; approach that we took towards
solution of one of his puzzles, but was adjusted slightly. &lt;b&gt;Cache
location is within two miles of the posted co-ordinates.&lt;/b&gt; Puzzle
clues now follow:&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Geocachers enjoy using accurate co-ordinates in out-of-the way
spots that allow a target cache to be stealthily located and
grabbed. But there are other even more covert types who are less
fussy about co-ordinates. When they go out to have a blast, being a
few feet off is not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These folks pretty much follow their own rules and don't care
about making lots of noise or leaving a mess behind. But like
geocachers, they use some funny names for their Operations and
prefer out of the way Sites away from muggles. (This is just as
well since sometimes things go wrong.) Some of these exercises are
now well known, making their localities easy to find; but some
sites may surprise you. If you need a hint, just ask.&lt;/p&gt;

sidewalk in Santa Clara. Like all the &quot;Lunch&quot; hides, this is
intended to be a quick find on a break in your day.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;For many years, Don Von Raesfeld was the city manager of Santa
Clara, as well as a strong advocate for the city's publicly owned
electric system, now called &quot;Silicon Valley Power&quot;. It's fitting
that the electric generation plant at the intersection of Duane
Avenue and Lafayette Street was named after him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located along a little known and seldom used
section of sidewalk. It is above ground level. Note that tree cover
and walls will interfere with GPSr reception somewhat, these
coordinates were averaged from readings taken at different times
over a few days. Parking is not allowed on Lafayette St. The
waypoint given is a spot on Duane where street parking is legal,
though the posted signs are trying very hard to discourage you.
Traffic backs up from the intersection at Central, so proper
stealth is advised. Ground cover is NOT PO, probably not a good
vintage either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6/23/11- Adjusting difficulty down. Sun angle can help or hurt
your search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to kablooey for the
FTF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There is no need to bend over or crawl into anyplace dark to reach this cache.

Be careful if small children are along for the hunt.  Some small items for the FTF and STF.</groundspeak:long_description>

Laurel Wood&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The legendary days of knights are long past. When we hear of
&quot;knights&quot; now, it is merely a name, not a vocation. Knights of
Pythias and Knights of Columbus are fraternal groups. Knights Inns
are budget motels. Keira Knightley isn't a knight at all, but a
pirate; not that there's anything wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, here in Santa Clara, a knightly order has returned, with
knightly games and knightly arts. If you come by here on
weekknights, err, weeknights, you may actually get a glimpse of
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is a match holder, hidden beneath one of the stone
pennants. You stay on the sidewalk for this one, and there is no
need to disturb shrubbery or climb into the landscaping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to bearterritory for the FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

times.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;At many workplaces, the lunch hour truly starts when the food
truck pulls up and sounds its distinctive horn. In the past truck
menus were mainly high calorie fast food and snacks. Now many of
them are mini-restaurants with various tasty cuisines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is placed in tribute to lunch trucks. If you come by
at night, you'll see them sleeping. There's an FTF pathtag for the
first finder, we'll figure out later how to get it to you.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've worked at two different places that were around this
corner. They're no longer here, but the lunch spot lives on (a
lesson there, hmm..).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, when you look at the businesses that took their place,
you see that that change is good and the innovative spirit that
powers high tech industry in this valley lives on.&lt;/p&gt;

CarlottaP was ready to go while I was looking at the darkness and the rain.  I agreed to go and we found the very nice camo relatively quickly.  As we signed the cache in the dryness of the car, we saw TheFogHeads and Rachell pull up and start the search.  We quickly replaced the cache, then had a nice, although damp greeting with them, then back home.  Thanks for the fun!</groundspeak:text>

revealed his total to be only 2997; he came out of retirement to
achieve his goal and restore his nickname.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cachers we can identify with the pursuit of odd goals and
numeric totals. Even if they are goals that only we ourselves find
meaningful, they are still achievements. Also, like Stan in the
movie, what we find along the way in our quests is more valuable
than a number.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is an echo of one we liked in Hawaii- Pulehu Coin
Exchange (GC1427) and in the sincerest form of geocache flattery
we're stealing the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache is for trading coins. This includes Geocoins, foreign
coins, swag coins, wooden nickels and so on. You are very welcome
to come and sign the log even if you don't bring a coin to trade.
Geocoins are to be kept moving; so if you find one feel free to
take it and move it along like any trackable in a cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location is along the Guadalupe River trail on the east side
of the river. The trail itself on this side runs from downtown San
Jose to join the Bay Trail in Alviso. It crosses the Route 237
trail as well. The surface is hard pack gravel suitable for hybrid
or mountain bikes but skinny tire road bikes are not advised. There
are several caches along the trail on both sides, and west on the
237 trail will take you to the Sunnyvale Baylands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public access points nearest the cache are at Trimble Road 0.5
miles south and Montague Expressway 0.6 miles north. The closest
legal parking spots are at VTA River Oaks and at Rivermark shopping
center, it's about a half mile walk to the cache from either one.
There is also limited parking at Trimble Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunchtime walkers will find access to the trail through fence
gaps behind the industrial buildings on Orchard Drive and Orchard
Parkway but these are posted as restricted parking. Parking and
trail access are both available at the River Oaks VTA park and ride
about a mile north of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container is now a medium lock-and-lock container. Original
contents included a pen and logbook and several coins from five
continents; including an Eisenhower dollar for the FTF, an English
penny, and some old wheat cents and Buffalo nickels. Plus a Cyprus
coin brought from the Pulehu cache. Terrain difficulty rating is
high since the final 10-15 feet is steep, below the trail away from
the river. The cache itself is concealed with natural material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;TR26ZRC - Trail entrance from Trimble Road&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 22.865 W 121° 56.253</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Residence Inn is a quiet spot, who'd think that it was the scene of a murder back in 1993. But there's always something beneath the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even with the Bayshore Freeway a few steps away this place is calm. You'll see ducks in a man-made lake, squirrels scampering around the trees, and buildings fairly well kept even though many are now vacant. Not the spot you'd imagine for a high-profile, at least for Sunnyvale, murder case. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back in August 1993 Silicon Valley was flying high and high tech around the world was following. The sky was the limit and nobody checked resumes too closely. The middle-aged Korean operations director of a major firm was in town for meetings with management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There weren't the number of four-star full service hotels as there are now so he was booked into a room at the Residence Inn, just a few blocks from headquarters. As you'll see, the Sunnyvale Residence Inn is a spread of two-story buildings looking like small suburban apartments. Not the sort of place for many intrigues. But boys will be boys; our director was often away from home with a respectable expense account for entertainment. On a previous visit he'd been introduced to a 21-year old Korean-American woman in San Francisco, and he gave her a call on Thursday when he arrived on this trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His friend had a history of problems with drinking and bad checks and may have relished her role of her family's black sheep. She came down from San Francisco to meet with the director Thursday night and spent the day Friday in the Residence Inn while he attended company meetings. He returned Friday night after a late dinner with business (real business, not monkey business!)associates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sequence of events after that isn't exactly known, but its been pieced together that other guests complained about a ruckus or two in the room late Friday or in the wee hours of Saturday. Sometime after midnight the young woman left the room and spent Saturday running up large charges on the director's credit cards in San Francisco stores and hotels, followed up with a plane ticket to the East Coast. Back at the hotel, the front desk received calls from a woman requesting the staff not to clean the room because of sensitive documents about; which makes sense when you consider the secrecy craziness that envelops high-tech marketing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By Monday morning, suspicions arose since nobody had seen the director since late Friday, and he did not check out as scheduled. Police were called and found him dead from multiple stab wounds and the ladyís bloody fingerprints in the room.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She was tracked across the country with extravagant credit card bills to Philadelphia, where the trail ended as the cards hit their limit. That stalled the case until February 1994 when the Bedford, N.Y police were called to investigate a nanny suspected of stealing money from a previous employer. A quick check showed the suspect nanny was the same woman wanted for the Sunnyvale murder.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extradition was quick but not the trial. Grand jury indictment on robbery and first-degree murder charges took place in September 1994 but proceedings kept being postponed. Meanwhile, the country was enthralled with another murder case involving some guy named O.J. Finally in June 1996 the former nanny agreed to plea guilty to second-degree murder and received a sentence of 16 years-to-life. She was up for parole in May 2009, I donít know how that went.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more info on the case, check out: http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/09.05.96/cover/murder-9636.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EKF/is_n2001_v40/ai_15031903/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small lock and lock container with space for some swag. Be careful reaching around crevices here, yellowjackets like to build nests in structures and they are very active between March and November. Parking is restricted at the Residence Inn and the nearby Lakeside Plaza office park, but you can walk a block from the Oakmead Terrace complex at the end of Lakeway.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A friend received a big bag of cache containers at the 11-11-11
event and he generously gave us one. Here it is, released for
action beside the Guadalupe River trail and suitably camouflaged.
It's big enough for a golf pencil and small swag items, or 100
aspirin tablets. There's a FTF pathtag for the first finder, some
miscellaneous coins and a lanyard for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AND, the FTF is the generous donor of the cache container ...
OAKNEST&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The east side Guadalupe River Trail goes from downtown San Jose
to join the Bay Trail in Alviso. This cache is just off the trail
about 0.4 mile (650 m) south of the crossing and trailhead at
Montague Expressway. Be careful as the sides of the trail are
steep, as indicated by the terrain rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest public parking spots are at VTA River Oaks and at
Rivermark shopping center to the north and at Trimble Road to the
south, it's about a mile (1600 m) walk to the cache from either
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunchtime walkers from nearby offices find access to the trail
through the gaps in fences behind the industrial buildings along
Orchard Drive and Orchard Parkway, but parking near these spots may
be restricted. VTA light rail runs parallel to the trail along
First St.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail is a great route for walking, running, cycling,
waterfowl viewing and of course, geocaching. There are numerous
caches along the route from downtown, and the airport TB hotel is
close to it. Be advised that north of the airport the surface is
hard pack dirt; suitable for cruiser, hybrid or mountain bikes but
not recommended for skinny tire road bikes.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOISY DOG ALERT - There is an obnoxious dog in the yard NE of
GZ. If you walk close to the pool area and along the pool fence
until you're 20 feet from GZ, you'll hopefully avoid getting the
dog's attention. GZ is out of sight of the dog so if he doesn't see
you going there, he will hopefully stay quiet. Coords are pretty
good, so don't search too far east of GZ.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Obey park hours: Sunrise to Sunset - no nightime caching
allowed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since Montague is an Expressway, do NOT park on Montague or
the connector ramps. I recommend parking at the Rivermark Shopping
Center on Agnew and walking over on the public sidewalk while
picking up a few of my other caches. Cache is reachable from the
sidewalk along Montague, so no need to do anything that will
require talking to Oracle security.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Say good-bye to whatever frustrations
may be left from 2010 and greet 2011 refreshed!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did you have some difficulties caching in 2010? Simple caches
that you couldn't find? Puzzles that made no sense AT ALL! Enduring
thorns, mosquitoes, poison oak and a skunk or two on a hike, only
to find the cache muggled or destroyed? TB's stolen or misplaced?
Cache hides denied by strict reviewers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can relate to all those experiences from 2010, so for 2011
our first hide is placed to bury them; figuratively speaking of
course. The cache is a micro tube placed along the west side of the
Guadalupe River trail with easy access and a nice walk. You'll see
or hear ducks, geese, and maybe a heron or egret. Depending on the
time of day and season, raccoons and jackrabbits may be found along
the trail; and yes, maybe a skunk or two. The perfect place to
walk, settle your mind, and start caching fresh in the New
Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hide is a simple one. No bushwhacking needed and you don't
need to go down the steep bank. You will need to bring a pen or
pencil. Happy Caching in 2011!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to leelelee and
bearterritory for the FTF honors!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A small cache on the east side of the Guadalupe River trail. There
is room for geocoins and small TB's.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spend your lunchtime walking along the trail in the sunshine,
then have a seat on a rock to peek inside and sign the log. The
geese and egrets are in on the deal, but stealth is advisable
around the turkey vultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is just south of the crossing and trailhead at
Montague Expressway. This could be a PNG if there was public
parking along Orchard or Montague. The closest legal parking spots
are at VTA River Oaks and at Rivermark shopping center, it's about
a half mile walk to the cache from either one. Lunchtime walkers
find easy access through the gaps in fences behind the industrial
buildings along Orchard, but parking is restricted. VTA light rail
runs parallel to the trail along First St.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail itself on this side runs from downtown San Jose to
Alviso where it joins the Bay Trail. It crosses the route 237 trail
as well, and that makes it also a good route to Sunnyvale baylands.
The surface is hard pack gravel suitable for hybrid or mountain
bikes but skinny tire road bikes are not advised. There are several
caches along the trail on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is a small lock-and-lock a few feet off the trail
towards the river, but not down the slope. A previous cache
disappeared into the rocks; this one is at their edge but not in
them. Be careful with small children around here, they may also
disappear into the rocks. There's an unregistered FTF geocoin as a
prize for the first finder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;** Congratulations to n9jim for
FTF!**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Depending on when you arrive, parking will range from plenty
(weekdays non-lunchtime) to non-existent (weekdays
lunchtime).&lt;br /&gt;
I recommend parking on the upper level.&lt;br /&gt;
Use the hint for a quick find if muggles are in the area (which
they probably are).</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A small cache in the Ulistac area of Santa Clara. This park is a small bit of the 2217 acre Rancho Ulistac land grant made by Governor Pío Pico in 1845, supposedly named after an Ohlone chief. A micro here would be just plain mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ulistac Natural Area is a popular place for bird watching, wildlife observation; and of course, geocaching. The 41 acre (16.6 hectare) park is just east of the west side Guadalupe River Trail and is bordered on the west by Lick Mill Blvd, on the north by Tasman Drive and on the south by housing developments. Most recently part of a golf course, it's being restored as an exhibit site for native plants and animals; assisted by irrigation with recycled water. Hours are from sunrise to one-half hour after sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coyote brush is becoming more plentiful in the park as non-native trees are cleared. it is attractive to small insects of all sorts, and acts as a &quot;nurse&quot; species that helps in the growth of larger trees. Natives used its leaves for medicinal purposes, including relief of poison oak rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can enter from Lick Mill Blvd where there is on-street parking or from the west-side river trail. The west-side trail is packed gravel suitable for mountain or hybrid bikes. The east-side trail is being paved from Alviso to downtown San Jose. Cross the river from the east-side trail at Tasman Drive or the bike/pedestrian bridge further south near the River Oaks VTA light rail station and park-and-ride lot. Both sides of the river trail are quite flat aside from street underpasses and are easy hikes or rides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial stock included some overflow swag from &quot;Ulistac Returns&quot; and the FTF prize, plus a pen and some other goodies.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Both sides of the trail are quite flat aside from street underpasses and are easy hikes or rides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a camo'd plastic jar big enough for small trade goods and a trackable or two. The present location is in coyote brush adjacent to the trail. Be warned that this park is also an informal doggy walk spot and that you should watch your step. Curious dogs possibly contributed to the demise of previous caches, so this one is hanging above ground about five feet (1.5m) high in leafy cover.&lt;/p&gt;

honors!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

retail complex located there is a good place to park but is not
related to the solution, except that you might find inspiration at
waymark WMABX5, while picking out a slice.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;One problem shared by puzzle solution and target practice is
that one becomes fixated on a form for the solution or target.
Targets with concentric circles can be especially hypnotic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puzzle solvers need to resist this trap. When things are going
nowhere and frustration builds it's important to step back and cut
the problem apart in a different way. Possibly relax and have a
byte. Otherwise you may follow circles with no result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;All 12 targets are needed for 15 coordinate digits&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

When a cache is published, you quickly download the coordinates into your GPSr, look at the map so you have an idea where you are going and rush out the door.  You then follow the GPSr directions down the main highway to a dirt road.  You drive down the dirt road for a mile, turn around and go back to the highway.  Then drive down the highway 100 yards to the correct dirt road, drive to the end of that dirt road, notice that your GPSr is blank, and go back home for fresh batteries.  On the way back to the correct dirt road, you stop for gas since your car is on E.  After you hike for two hours down a remote trail, you then wait an hour for the only other hikers within 5 miles to finish their rest break at Ground Zero.  Then you do a quick search and find the ammo box hidden inside a tree trunk.  You pull out the log sheet, see that nobody else has signed it, then wish you had brought the pen sitting at home on your dresser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;----------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why did the chicken cross the road?&lt;br/&gt;To find a geocache!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-----------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But seriously folks,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This small series of mostly easy caches is meant to complement the Ca$he series on the other side of the freeway.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A cache along the Guadalupe River Trail in Alviso. This is placed
in honor of the bicentennial of Mexico's independence.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just before midnight on September 15th 1810, Father Miguel
Hidalgo rang the bell of his church in Dolores to gather the people
and called for the people of Mexico to free themselves from Spanish
rule. The next day the revolutionary army marched on the mining
center Guanajuato and so began the Mexican War for Independence;
which ended finally in 1821.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2010 marks the 200th anniversary of El Grito de Independencia
(The Cry for Independence). By custom on the night of September
15th, people will gather in the plaza of every town, often in
traditional costume. At 11 PM the mayor or other civic leader will
stand and read Hidalgo’s words in a patriotic reenactment of
the call that led to the nation’s independence. The president
will give the cry in Mexico City from the National Palace
overlooking the Zócalo (Plaza de la Constitución) before a crowd of
more than 100,000. Before he does, however; he will ring the same
bell used by Hidalgo in 1810.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is a small camo-painted container about twice the volume
of a film can. It is placed alongside the Guadalupe River trail on
the river side. It is NOT on the property of the mobile home park,
please respect the residents there and enter the trail from public
access points. Parking is available on Gold Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Oaknest for FTF!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Just sitting at my desk at work looking at the Geocaching.com web site seeing if there's any caches I can pick up on the way home when this pops up 700 feet away.  Grabbed my GPSr and off I went.  My first FTF reached just by walking.

Nice container and cache.  Thanks for the fun and the good timing!!!</groundspeak:text>

From the summit, you should be able to see all the way from the Don Edwards Wildlife Refuge to the Alviso skyline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you're not into hill climbing, you can probably get away with parking at the summit.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are reports of wasps in the area, but keep your feet on the road and the hard surface path and you should be OK.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a large camoed micro hanging at the center of a bush near the road.

The site is beautiful and I would have never gone there if it wasn't for this cache. I was distrubed by the amount of trash left in the area. I must say this is a good way to bring attention to sites that could use community service projects to clean up areas like this. I hope someone else has better luck finding this, or maybe with all of the restoration it's gone. It was fun seeing such a nice park like setting in the Fremont area.</groundspeak:text>

This was my partner (r3adyornot) and I's very first find and we thoroughly enjoyed searching around the area, it was located right next to a small brook and was really quite beautiful and actually a bit ominous at the same time because of the fact that there was a pile of broken-up tombstones scattered nearby. There were also other strange artifacts including broken bits of ceramic plates and old glass bottles, and some very out of place flowers growing nearby that we believe may be the descendants of flowers once planted by the graves of their deceased loved ones, but who knows. And oddly enough right as we were leaving two other cachers showed up searching for the same exact cache! What a coincidence! But they were too late since we were FTF in this new location. We left a few of our favorite toys and took a toy compass as a token of the beginning of our caching days!

Thanks Roach for replacing the cache, well done! =D</groundspeak:text>

Bring your own pen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FTF Geocasual confirmed my thoughts on this one. NOT recommended between 9:00 a.m. and 10:30 P.M. I wouldn't put any Trackables in this one as it may dissapear.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Sign only cache you will need to bring your own pen or pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not on under or in or any way attached to the electical box, please stay away from it. I'm not really sure what this location is. I think it's some kind of sewage transfer point because there is an odd smell there. Don't worry it's not that bad and you won't be there that long. The reason I'm bringing you here is I think it's a great spot to Photograph your car for internet ad's. I've seen several people do this as I am driving by. They just park their car and shoot a picture with the nice rock wall backdrop. You can park your car within 10 feet of the cache. There is no need to go bushwacking . Please take care to put cache back for next cacher. </groundspeak:long_description>

Approach stealthily. It is 497 feet above sea level, and is in an un-camo'd Altoids tin. Helping this cache by replacing logs, giving it shelter or camo, would be greatly appreciated, so come with some items to help the cache. The cache will supply you with the variable &quot;x&quot;. This variable will be used sometime later in a Mystery cache I'm working on (I'll tell you later once I've hidden the mystery cache). You can easily reach the cache from the asphalt or sidewalk, and it's fairly obvious to a regular geocacher. For some reason, my GPSr is acting strange, so if I have incorrect coords, please post the actual coords into your log and i will update this cache listing.</groundspeak:long_description>

Went up today to get the last of the Bishop Ranch Open Space caches I hadn't found. After my last one found a spot and dropped one of my own off. Should be easy to find pretty standard placement. Nice view from up here at night, probably isn't too bad during the day either. It's not to far from the path/road I was on. Please try to hide it as well or better than you found.

Great coordinates, the GPS only showed eight feet off.  The cache is still well stocked with many McToys left inside.  Left a green alien, took a used lottery ticket. - TFTC   </groundspeak:text>

You may need to reach or climb a tree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is pretty big, and extremely easy to find. It is found of a well-known trail, with many bikers and joggers going through. San Ramon is a fairly nice urban city, and this trail is also near a good school, Montevideo Elementary School. The container is a big chocolate macadamia container, originally holding a couple of lollipops, some hard candy, some sparkly pipe cleaners, etc.</groundspeak:long_description>

They have the Art and Wind Festival here every year. The park has Tennis Courts, BB Courts, Baseball fields, a really nice playground area, and lots of other activities. This park and the Cache are both accesable via the Iron Horse Trail. At the time of this posting there were 2 other caches located in/near the park. So if you haven't been here before you could make it a three-for-one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lots of parking. I didn't notice any posted hours. This park is quite busy during the day so evenings and early mornings are probably your best bet to avoid the muggles. And there will be muggles all around this cache depending on when you arrive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container is small and can hold VERY SMALL trade Items.&lt;br/&gt;Original contents:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.)Log&lt;br/&gt;2.)Golf Pencil&lt;br/&gt;3.) 5 Miniature Star Wars Characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The gate that lets you into the trail system is about 275 ft. west of the cache. There are some no parking signs, but I didn't see any in the Cul-de-sac where I parked. Cache is about 75 feet from the street fairly obvious placement. Lots of tree cover, by GPSr was giving me 26ft. accuracy. There are two other Caches in the area also, Relay for life GCRK1V and Is Anybody Home? GCMKZ4. Gate to trails is at N 37 46.053 W 121 59.901. I'm thinking the neighbors may get curious about this cache since it's a dead end and there really is no reason to be there.

As you come, you'll see tons of names and letters etched into the rocks with knives. The cache is a 35mm film canister. If you're going for this d5 t5 cache, look at these requirements:&lt;br/&gt;1. Must be fit enough to climb&lt;br/&gt;2. Must be able to walk a couple miles or so&lt;br/&gt;3. Bring tools in case (that's kind of a clue)&lt;br/&gt;4. Hiking boots&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache location is a nice place to rest, and many mini muggles like to try and climb up into there and play a bit. In fact, you should bring your children. The cache location is pretty hard to get in if you're tall, so use your children to get in there. Try camping at this place, there are plenty of geocaches around. If you still can't find the cache, then consider that it's +1709ft above sea level.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">100 yards east of this location--in the trees next to the onramp to southbound 99--sits one of the most unappreciated and important sites in California’s colorful history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In early 1846--weary of an all-out invasion from the east--the Mexican government had ordered all immigrants who had lived in California for less than a year to leave the territory. Incensed by this decree, and emboldened by the presence of John C Fremont and a US military force of 60 at the north end of the valley, thirteen local settlers decided to take matters into their own hands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the dawn of June 10th, 1846, those settlers--led by Ezekiel “Stuttering” Merritt--crept up on Murphy’s Rancho (AKA Murphy’s Corral) which once stood on the seemingly benign farmland you seek now. There, they surprised and overwhelmed a small Mexican force who were camped for the night while transporting 200 horses from Sonoma to Monterey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although no shots were fired and no lives were lost--this incursion is considered by historians to be the first battle in the Mexican-American war. Four days later, the same men would capture General Mariano G Vallejo and several other high-ranking Mexican officials near Sonoma. Together, these actions would become known as “The Bear Flag Revolt”--the very genesis of the great state of California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, most would have no idea such a significant event occurred here. When construction on the now abandoned Lent Ranch Mall project and related freeway “improvements” began to the north and east respectively, this historic location was obscured even more than it already was. There used to be a landmark south of Grantline where the old onramp began, but it has since been uprooted and discarded on West Stockton Blvd with a “No Trespassing” sign posted nearby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This hide--my first--represents my respect for the history that took place here, and my dismay at how it was disrespected in the name of “progress.” I hope you enjoy learning about this site, and will share its story with others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Congrats Geofungi for FTF!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-This is a quick grab just off the road--please do not enter any private property (including the historic site).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Room for small tradeables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Please make sure the target is resealed and re-hidden securely upon retrieval!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Thing is, Boras never made the major leagues. What he did make, was millions upon millions of dollars for himself and his clients--guys like Alex Rodriguez, Barry Bonds, Greg Maddux, Keith Hernandez, and Barry Zito. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his 26 years as super agent to baseball’s biggest stars (and a few of its biggest flops), Boras has negotiated some of the biggest deals in professional sports history--including the first baseball contracts to breach the $50 and $100 million barriers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here’s to our native son and his contribution to skyrocketing ticket prices! ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Please bring a pen/pencil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Depending on the time of day and/or season, this GZ can be an extremely high muggle traffic area--sometimes even impossible to access (thus the higher difficulty rating).

Please be stealthy and replace exactly as found to keep it safe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &quot;River Walk&quot; in West Sacramento is actually a really nice place. I've placed this cache and it's sibling to entice you to take the short, flat walk from the Tower Bridge, to the &quot;I&quot; St. Bridge along the waterfront. There are signs along the way describing the flora, fauna and history of the area. From this side, you can look across the river to Old Sacramento through some nice old trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is near one of Sacramento's more unique buildings.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have only walked the waterfront during daylight hours, but there are a few transients in the area, so a keep this in mind if you decide to walk over at night.</groundspeak:long_description>

1. There is a final stage of a geocaching.com letterbox it generally the same location/same general hiding area and
2. The object that I found was empty but is obviously a cache container. Also, there was a log sheet down on the bikepath so this was muggled (or the letterbox was muggled)

Extremely confusing when there are two caches in the same area and having be muggled. This needs to be check and should consider moving since the gc.com cache was here first.

Not sure I am going to continue doing opencaching caches if this is what happens and having multiple caches in the same spot.</groundspeak:text>

I've placed this cache to entice you to take the short, flat walk from the Tower Bridge, to the &quot;I&quot; St. Bridge along the waterfront.  There are signs along the way describing the flora, fauna and history of the area.  From this side, you can look across the river to Old Sacramento through some nice old trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I work in the new blue building on this side of the river, and thought it would be a good place for a cache.  I have only walked around during daylight hours, but there are a few transients in the area, so a keep this in mind if you decide to walk over at night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one is now a nano cache because it was muggled.  Keep those muggles in mind when searching!</groundspeak:long_description>

The hardest thing about this find may be avoiding people walking if it's a nice sunny weekday!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As buildings pop up in the business park, it's hard to imagine that this was once just a huge grassy ranchland. From the location of this cache you can still see undeveloped land across the road which is wonderfully green during Springtime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is easily accessible from the road, but you'll have to keep an eye out for muggles taking an afternoon walking break. Please watch for snakes! There are Rattlesnakes in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a round film.</groundspeak:long_description>

I had a tough time with the exact location since the satellite maps are not updated since all the construction has been completed.  So I looked in the wrong places at first, but as I was leaving spotted something and it was a new container with a blank log!  I'm not sure if the location will last once we get a few large rainstorms in the fall/winter, but I happily signed FTF and kept going on the new trail!  Thanks for the FTF!</groundspeak:text>

I knew the way up so getting to GZ was easy but the cache wasn't there. However, I did find the cache at these coords - N 38° 38.465 W 121° 13.060 . Luckily I had the GC listing also since there isn't a hint on this site that would have help find it.

For the punk story. I listed to the following in the late 70's and early 80's: The Ramones, The Clash, The Sex Pistols - the originasl and still the best punkers out there.

A lot of people love the lady bug for its appearance, the colors, and also it happens to feature in many comics and children’s books and cartoons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lady bugs are also loved by agriculturists and farmers because they bring about a lot of benefits for them. The lady bugs tend to feed on aphids, small insects and eggs of other insects. This way they keep the insect population under control and also prevent damage to the crop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MOVED from the rocks adorned with stickers to same level 3 feet north. Look for brown rock amid the blue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stop and enjoy the view.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Waist high. Walk along the path next to the rock wall. You'll see a large arrowhead shaped rock partially blocking your path. Go back 3 or 4 paces (north) from there and look for a brown rock amid the blue-gray ones.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I logged in to this site a few days ago and was pleasantly surprised to see a few new caches around Folsom area (last time the closest one is around Davis area).  I immediately had to go find this one, but there were just lots of muggles around.  Dang, I wish I had a bucket of chicken wings or something so I could have an excuse to just sit down and scour a little bit.  So, I saved it for another time.  That time was today.  There's no problem finding this one as I have an idea where, just need to look for the exact location.  Inked my name on the FTF spot.  The log says geocaching, but who cares :)

Thanks for the hide, FTF, and new one in Folsom.

Here's your chance to get even.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are only a few ways to slay a vampire; with a silver bullet, with bright sunshine, or with a wooden stake through the heart. A silver stake is even better, so I’ve started off this cache with a small number of (not so) gen-yoo-wine silver stakes for the first few vampire-pestered visitors. This cache is located off a lonely stretch of walkway, so there just might be blood-sucking parasites lurking around there somewhere. Beware: Don’t go at night. A vampire theme is appropriate for this site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please replace the cover. You shouldn't need to trample any plants to get to the site.

Planned to take my baby for a walk along the bike path after work, but she mommy took the stroller away, had to wait for her to come back and when she did, my baby was already asleep ... so, drove the car instead and parked close to GZ, ... coords are superb and got the cache right away as we've seen one of those.  I looked at the cache and thought about another cache from the same CO and tried to remember if I've seen the same thing lying around ... while I was doing that, 40 joined me and we signed the CO-FTF on this one.

They hike the trails, climb the trees, and crawl into the bushes, never worrying about dirt under the fingernails, thorns in the clothing, or thistles in the hair. Way to go!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is on a remote trail, slippery slope, and thorny underbrush, but once there it’s easy to spot.&lt;br/&gt;There is both a bike trail and a dirt hiking trail.&lt;br/&gt;It's MUCH easier to approach the cache from the dirt hiking trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Short hike: Park on Mountain Oak Ct. (Folsom-Auburn road to south on Oak Ave Parkway, left on Deerwood, right on Mountain Oak) then hike down the American River Bike Trail. Under ¼ mile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long hike:  Park at the free garage at Leidesdorff Street at Reading, then hike north-east over the Trestle Bridge, turn right onto the American River bike trail, then bear left where it rises into the woods. About 6000 feet one way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Mapdork &amp; (in spirit) Twinklewink for FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Ghost of Natoma Road is a simple off-set cache on a remnant of E. Natoma Street that was closed for construction of the new Folsom Lake Crossing Bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ghost of Natoma Road. An Ammo Box Cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A very EASY Multi-cache.&lt;br/&gt;GOOD for children. GOOD for first timers.&lt;br/&gt;Not Good if you hate spider, bugs and thistles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;START: &lt;br/&gt;   N 38 41.512&lt;br/&gt;   W 121 08.723&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: Cache is NOT at the listed coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INSTRUCTIONS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. LOOK for the telephone pole near Ground Zero. Getting there you'll see an abandoned road. This is the “Ghost” of Natoma Road. In fact you will be standing on the ghost road, because the pole is in a gully, approximately to the north.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. On the utility pole you’ll see a vertical METAL BAND with the pole ID numbers starting with 1272XX. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. The last two digits are the number of steps you are from the cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Standing on the ghost road, facing the POLE you are looking at the 12-O'Clock position The last (bottom) digit is the clock position to travel to. Example: 3 O’clock would be to your right,  6 O’clock directly behind you, etc. Walk towards the clock position indicated by the last digit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. It's near a tree. Very easy to find. Replace as found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HISTORY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Natomas&quot; is a Maidu Indian word meaning north place or upstream people. The Maidu branch of the Nisenan tribe has been living in the area for an estimated 8000 years prior to the coming of the Europeans. Natoma Street is one of the oldest thoroughfares in Folsom. It served the miners during the Gold Rush. When the Folsom Lake Crossing Bridge construction was completed in 2009, a new interchange was created for bridge traffic, and some of the old roadway was abandoned. This is the “Ghost” of Natoma Road. It is short stretch of crumbling concrete and persistent weeds. With its long history of foot and vehicle traffic, who’s to say whether or not any discarnate entities still linger in the area?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning: There are lots of weeds, ticks and other bugs in the area. Wear protective clothing and bug spray.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: P22Z0W1 - Cache location&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Final cache location.&lt;br/&gt;PL2Z0W1 - Pole 1&lt;br/&gt;N 38° 41.519 W 121° 08.728&lt;br/&gt;From this point you can determine the final cache location from the clues in the description.</groundspeak:long_description>

I printed out the sheet since it had the directions and headed out. I entered the coords on the way and as I pulled up I saw an easy (but maybe not legal) parking spot so I took it. I was only 40 feet away from the poll, so I did the math, made the walk and found the cache. I was rewarded with a FTF and as a special prize I grabbed the FTF award package - Thanks for That! Now I'm only 3 FTF away from 100 so watch out . Thanks for the FTF and the fun! -40- </groundspeak:text>

No need to go down the hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fun place to watch birds, especially in the Fall and Winter.  When we placed the cache we saw Canadian Geese, Ringnecked Pheasents, Coots,Redtail Hawks, Hummingbirds, American Kites and Mallard Ducks.  Beavers created the swamp, so if you get lucky....  There can be (slippery in winter)short steep hills involved. I suggest parking at either N38-48.605 W121-16.995 to enjoy a hot drink, or N38-48.815 W121-16.737.  From the second spot, you can enjoy the birds from a hill across the street for a spell before going for the cache.  Please note: This used to be a regular sized cache but it was muggled twice, so it is now  a well hidden micro.  PLEASE REPLACE EXACTLY AS FOUND! &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is placed in a new and unique section of Rocklin..
Approach is important, and there is no need to go over walls,inside
fences or hike over grassy fields. Assume that your car GPSr will
not have these new streets on it, but Google maps does. Keep in
mind that while I've listed the cache as small, to keep the log
dry, it is inside a film canister, which is inside the camouflage.
There really isn't room for travel bugs or coins. Please replace
exactly as found. Enjoy!

Huge mature Oaks, fine examples of Buckeye trees and in this case, a few small cliffs. (No need to climb them to get to the cache) As it had just rained when we placed this one, the moss was green and water was dripping down the face like a hesitant waterfall. On our visit we saw a Barn Owl, Rabbits, Hawks, Turkeys, Red Wing Blackbirds, Canadian Geese, Ruddy Ducks and Killdeer. &lt;br/&gt;Please make a sensible approach by parking at the the listed coordinates, walking around the pond nearly halfway before heading up.  The last couple hundred feet are quite steep, and in the winter it can be quite slippery as well. Until then it's great for kids of all ages.&lt;br/&gt;The entire area is quite spectacular, so once you find the cache, walk around and explore! &lt;br/&gt;We did not encounter any Poison Oak on our approach, but it IS in the area.  As this cache is under tree cover, the coordinates may be off a bit, so please update if needed.  Also, PLEASE replace the cache &quot;cover&quot; as found.&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Kalikokat for FTF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK24DBB - Coyote Pond Park&lt;br/&gt;N 38° 50.797 W 121° 15.581</groundspeak:long_description>

Being the first county opencache placement, I wanted it as central as I could get it. This I felt was that spot.&lt;br/&gt;If you look due south of ground zero, there once was a Cal-Skate less than fifty feet in front of you.&lt;br/&gt;I remember the good old days when roller skating was the &quot;hip&quot; thing to do and all of us got together on Friday and Saturday nights and skate with our sweeties and so on. The days of Angels Flight, long pointed collars, bell bottoms &amp; plaid slacks. :-)&lt;br/&gt;You may have to use stealth at times as things get busy at times. If your lucky, your vehicle can be used as a muggle block. Bring your own writing utensil. As always, happy caching! </groundspeak:long_description>

What great timing to knock these out on a lunch break. Way to go! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area I see is still frequented by the younger generation by the graffiti on the road.&lt;br/&gt;As a late teen, the local kids from school dubbed this area as &quot;Hawaii&quot;. &lt;br/&gt;How it got it's name, I'll never know. It was basically a code word for where to meet and drink cold beverages instead of sitting in town doing so.&lt;br/&gt;I also learned in these years from the loss of life due to juvenile alcohol abuse and drunk driving can lead to serious injury and death from areas such as this. Some good memories, some bad. I am glad to have made it through those dumb years of my life. Remember, don't drink and drive and report that potential drunk driver.&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the cache!</groundspeak:long_description>

To answer the question of what the cache is: It is a retired snake bite kit out of my late step-fathers tackle box. ;-)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After scanning the area for other caches, there is already one where I wanted to actually place a cache, the Granite Finger. All came out well as I found another view of the property that is my focus.&lt;br/&gt;To the N/E of this location, my great grandparents once had a dairy smack dab in the middle of this what now is a rice paddy. They were immigrants from Germany in the early 30's. My step dad and uncle both grew up on this dairy as well. The old house and barn are all but a faded memory.&lt;br/&gt;Shortly before my step father passed from leukemia, he had the opportunity to duck hunt this area a few more times. I am sure he got to reminisce about his growing up here.  &lt;br/&gt;This is dedicated to a family that spent many years in the District Ten area, farming, hunting, and helped build some great hunting clubs that are renowned for being great hunting clubs in their time. This my dedication to them and my step father whom taught me how to be a good shot gunner and hunter/fisherman. I also learned how to drive on these roads.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">After a series of twisters that broke loose here in recent days, I decided to scout the area for any signs of destruction. Because of no high points to get the right angle of the view I was seeing, I was able to see from my point of view. There was about a 50' plus swath that run about three rice checks across as far as I could see from a N/E direction. I could see the suction from the approx F1 waterspout/tornado that had passed through. It looked like a herd of water buffalo passed though the rice checks leaving a muddy/cloudy water path. About 36 hours or so had passed since I place this opencache here and it was an amazing view to see. BYOP and 1$ for the FTF! Keep on caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

Developed for the quik cachers and families.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats goes to whitetail39&amp;travler13 for the FTF and Chante68 for the close STF. &lt;br/&gt;While out hunting Danger, Danger (Which I did not locate yet),&lt;br/&gt;I found this sweet spot on the way out. I thought it would be nice for those who want a quick grab or families out on the hunt. The only reason I gave this a 2 is because you have to amble over some loose rock, and possibly potiential of snakes in warmer months. Though you you not have to travel more than 30-40 feet from the roadway. This is only open for day use and you may have to watch for rolling muggles at times. This is a small pill size container. BYOP. Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

I brought along a newbie to geocaching overall and let him boggle his brain on this one. Besides, I had found this while out with rock of rock&amp;crystal. rock was pretty amazed for me bein a newb to find this right outta the gate.
My friend who logged it as ~!~ for now as he was unsure of what his better half used for a login name.
My friend was ready to give up when I had to give three different hints no less. lol
Thanks for a wonderful hide and great to see you here on opencaching.com as well!
Hope to see you on the trail or at an event sometime.Thanks for adding your caches to opencaching.com for the newbs on here as well! SL TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a drive up cache. It is a camo waterproof container. A FTF congrats goes out to whitetail39&amp;travler13. You guys are truly on it when it come to FTF's on the ridge! Again, congrats!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I placed this cache, I realized I did not place the FTF certificate. If you feel inclined, I can send it to a P.O. Box, and etc. Let me know, and I'll shoot it to you. &lt;br/&gt;I have been driving home this way for years. As geologic as it looks, I finally stopped to take a gander. &lt;br/&gt;I am not sure of the history of this site. My assumption is that they must have had a find here that sparked some dredging.&lt;br/&gt;The cache is on the street side of the easement, so fence crossing is not needed. Though, there are no signs posted and the fence line has been trampled over the years. I had to step in and take a peek. Attached is a view of the area, so it gives you a visual peek. People work this for fishing a lot and I often see vehicles parked in the area. &lt;br/&gt;There was some trash and fishing line strewn everywhere. I filled my Chico bag as full as I could get it. &lt;br/&gt;This is also a reminder that fishing line is also pollution. Tell those whom do not know that there are area recyclers, sport shops, and etc. that will take old line. Please do not leave it lying around in the environment. My assumption is inexperienced fisher people. But there was a lot of line present that is how this cache got it's name.&lt;br/&gt;I almost planted my face in some rocks a few years ago due to strong line tripping me up. Geocachers become more environmentally aware as we go out caching in areas where dumping happens frequently. It has sparked a fire that I decided to become more involved in environmental awareness, primarily dumping and pollution. This is why I became a director for the Clean World Movement. And was happy to see the CITO program when I became a member.&lt;br/&gt;The more I look, the more frustrating it is. If you find any dumpsites, please send me the coords to sites in the Paradise ridge area.&lt;br/&gt;When pulling up to the coords, there are two pullouts. One is good for most all vehicles. The other almost took my car out, so choose wisely. Enjoy and happy caching.</groundspeak:long_description>

The man was identified as David Rollins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Butte County Sheriffs Deputy Jay Freeman said, judging by evidence at the scene, he suspected Rollins slipped and fell from the bridge or possibly had a medical condition which caused him to fall. Rollins had been in court with his wife for a traffic ticket that morning and was riding his road bicycle home when he stopped, presumably to rest, at the bridge about two miles from home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A passerby reported seeing the red road bike and a water bottle sitting alone at the bridge at 10 a.m., Freeman said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rollins wife began to look for him after he didn't come home, Freeman said. Upon finding the bike and being unable to locate her husband, Rollins' wife called police from a friend's nearby home. She met with a Sheriff's captain who, together, found the body below the bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fall from the bridge was about 10 feet. Rollins' helmet was not on his head when he was found. California Highway Patrol originally responded to the scene as a hit and run but later turned the scene over to the Sheriff/Coroner office. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Article compliments of the Paradise Post</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Congrats to whitetail39&amp;travler for the FTF!&lt;br/&gt;This is near the Clear Creek Cemetery in Butte Co., CA. It is a pretty simple find, but you have to walk up a gully about ten feet deep. Some small slopes to enter, otherwise easy walking. Watch out in the dry season, wet season may be tricky at times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park in the cemetery parking lot. This cemetery has a unique history. I do not like to plant caches inside cemeteries. I find it disrespectful. Read the plaque as you enter about the history of this area. It will take you back to the old west and the hardships that occurred back then. This was a tragedy. You will not be disappointed to look at the headstones and familar names you may see in the area. Look to the left as you are in the parking lot. You will see some oak trees lining a small gully/ravine. It is seasonal, so you may get your feet wet. In the dry season, watch for SNAKES! This zone seems to be prime for rattlers, so please be careful. Leave the littlins at the car, unless they are nimble and agile. Rocks in the creek bed may be loose, so watch your step as well.&lt;br/&gt;This has only a log, so BYOP.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Once you head up this ravine about some 250 feet or so, you will run into a barrier. There is a little pine tree there as a marker point just above you. It is in the nooks and crannies in this barrier. A rock is wedging it in so it will not come loose very easy. Please do the same. Thanks!</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

There is a small turn-out near cache.&lt;br/&gt;This is one of those sad roadside memorials. I believe this involved a Paradise High teenage girl who did not make it home to Paradise. This is also a reminder not to let our GPSr's distract us from operating a motor vehicle. :-)&lt;br/&gt;If anyone has the story on this, please let me know.

My apologies) A lot of my geocaches vary. Will be back for update.This one I looked high and low for a good spot to hide. Between the swimmers, fisherman, and possibly campers (bridge trolls about 150 due east of GZ) I chose this location. As it would seem to get the lesser of traffic. This is a waterproof fishing bait box with some swag, fishing lure, hot wheel, kids swag, and etc.&lt;br/&gt;Watch out for the typical spiders, stickers, bugs, and skeeters during certain times of year. BYOP as I am unsure if I placed one inside the cache.&lt;br/&gt;I hope you enjoy opencaching as much as I am starting to. Just need more participants and placements out there. I used to place for the&quot;other guys&quot;, but I found it's clicks and decided to move on over. Hope you enjoy opencaching as much as I do. Time for change anyhow.

The FTF on this cache and for each successive cache is requested to follow one simple rule. Each First Finder, by logging in as the FTF, will hopefully agree to continue the series. The FTF is requested to place a cache in the Chico area within two weeks of logging the FTF. This way we can all play and try for the FTF. (List each cache &quot;Quad's FTF curse #2...#3 etc.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By way of clarification, there is no requirement besides the standard signing of the cache log to prevent you from logging this cache when found. Everyone should log their find, and hopefully the FTF person will play along and place another cache, but it is in no way a requirement for logging your find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The curse will be broken after the 20th cache is found. At that point the person with the most FTF's in the series will be awarded a renewal of their premium membership (by Quad), in the case of a tie - Quad will have to make a desicion based upon the creativity of the tied parties' caches. (so my goal is to find the most and renew my OWN membership - but let's make a competition out of it) Again, play only if you want to. Nobody is under any obligation to play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current Score:&lt;br/&gt;#1 Muniman 1&lt;br/&gt;#2 Thrak 1 (Co-FTF)&lt;br/&gt;#2 QuadMFT24 1 (Co-FTF)&lt;br/&gt;#3 Hexrider 1 (congrats on this FTF)&lt;br/&gt;#4 Bishoptakesqueen 1</groundspeak:long_description>

Mud may be an issue certain times of year here, but can be wheelchair accessible. This is a short drive up Honey Run Rd., near Chico, CA.  &lt;br/&gt;The cache is placed near the trail head of the preserve so there is no disturbance of wildlife or habitat inside the preserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A wonderful place to visit and do photo shoots or just absorb the peace and tranquility. Please respect the wildlife in the area and enjoy some of the beauty of Butte County.&lt;br/&gt;The Butte Creek Ecological Preserve is a 93-acre site along the middle section of Butte Creek. The property contains more than a mile of creek frontage, which is critical salmon habitat and spawning grounds, as well as habitat for many species of special status, including hawks, beaver, and burrowing owls. &lt;br/&gt;In December 1998 the University Research Foundation purchased this site with grants from the US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Fish and Wildlife Federation, CALFED, and the Wildlife Conservation Board. The goal of the preserve is to work in conjunction with other programs towards achieving a reasonable balance among the diverse demands on the resource base of the Butte Creek watershed. The research foundation will provide an adaptive management approach to managing the property for salmon habitat, watershed research-especially channel and floodplain management, and as a living laboratory and field classroom. The reserve is open to the public 24/7 and provides the following facilities: greenhouse, storage shed, portable toilet.</groundspeak:long_description>

Just requires the avid hiker to seek this one out.&lt;br/&gt;Take water with you and watch for snakes, wildlife, roller rocks on path, and etc. I do not suggest doing this alone. I do only because I am familiar with the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is good going downhill, going up can be rough on some. For the more avid hiker. This is a steep fire access road into the Feather River Canyon below Paradise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can park near this area here @: N 39 44.917'&lt;br/&gt;W 121 34.259' &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The access gate is located @: N 39 44.937'&lt;br/&gt;W 121 34.199'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fire access road that switches back a lot. Use your geosenses here and remember to stay right on the dirt road when it splits twice. If you hit the flume. Do not go any further down. There is no need.&lt;br/&gt;After a distance on the road look close to your left: &lt;br/&gt;N 39  44.460'&lt;br/&gt;W  121  33.872'&lt;br/&gt;Look for the game trail that will lead you to the flume.&lt;br/&gt;This is located on (or is it under?) the flume.&lt;br/&gt;This cache has been upgraded to a large cache. Has some cool swag, pen and log. Please replace as you found it. Happy hunting. :-)</groundspeak:long_description>

BYOP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Town of Paradise &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paradise is nestled in the foothills of Northern California's Sierra Nevada Mountains.  The Butte County community sits astride a ridge top with elevations ranging from 2,000 to 2,800 feet above the valley floor.  Our climate and location allows residents and visitors to enjoy an array of tall pines and majestic oaks, cooler summertime temperatures, occasional winter snowfalls, and an engaging environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paradise is the second largest city in Butte County, and is part of the Chico-Paradise metropolitan area.  Paradise was incorporated in 1979, and it is home to nearly 27,000 residents.  The neighboring communities of Magalia, Paradise Pines, Lovelock, Stirling City, and Inskip add nearly another 25,000 residents, as well as a colorful Gold Rush history and even more awesome natural beauty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chico, the county's largest city, is a short scenic drive from Paradise.  The 10-mile jaunt offers panoramic views of Butte Creek Canyon - known to the locals as Little Grand Canyon - and sweeping vistas from the foothills to the Coast Range to the west and Mt. Lassen to the North.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your way to Paradise from the nearby City of Oroville, you can drop the boat at Lime Saddle Marina and cruise Lake Oroville or wet your line in the Feather River.  You can also meander along Riverbend Park or marvel at the cultural beauty of the Chinese Temple Garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paradise is a short drive from the Bay Area and the Sacramento region.  The drive takes you along historic and scenic highways 70 and 99, and past the orchards and rice fields.  A spring time drive along the Blossom Tour is a must see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rich in history, innate beauty, and friendly people, Paradise is a fantastic place to raise a family, build a business, or just relax for a weekend in the pines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Taken from the TOP website)</groundspeak:long_description>

It is suggested to park at these coordinates: N 39' 45.419- W 121' 34.116'.&lt;br/&gt;A helpful hint to find this trail: Look for the picnic table and walk almost due north. &lt;br/&gt;When we found this area, we were wondering why this had not been found by fellow geocachers yet.&lt;br/&gt;This area was stripped of vegetation after the Butte Complex fires in 2008 leaving this trail more exposed. A wonderful canyon view stroll without taking too much life out of you, guaranteed to be a nice, short excursion. Some who do not like creepy crawleys may want to bring a &quot;grabber&quot;. More brave peeps could make the grab, just be alert for spiders and snakes. Both of which I doubt would be very prevalent @ this spot. But! You never know!

Please be safe in the warmer months, though this is a city park, it fringes the Butte creek canyon edge. So there may be a possibility of snakes (rarely, but can be present). The trail is well maintained, but be safe! Also plan on a fifteen minute walk to the cache location. The reward is great between the view and the cool air of the mossy nearby grotto!  Park hours are from 7 am to dusk. Back gate signs say the gate closes at 3 pm. Best entry is front parking as back gate has been known to be locked down at odd times. Cache is a small container with a little toy alien and 2$ for the FTF! Enjoy and welcome to Butte's first OC placement!  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I found this area to be a habitat for feral and stray cats. Someone cares for these kitties from what I see of GZ.&lt;br/&gt;Please be kind to any kitties that may be present. If you choose to leave a staple or water, please do so.&lt;br/&gt;Small camo container with log and 1$ for the FTF. BYOP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feral cats get such a bum wrap. It is not their fault for the living condition they thrive in. As a young man, I was paid to shoot feral cat populations on private hunting clubs. Today, I mostly shoot with a camera unless I am hunting for food for my family, not trophies to hang on a wall. &lt;br/&gt;___________________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feral cats are descended from domestic cats but are born and live without human contact. Any environment that sustains people can sustain feral cats, who are known to have thrived in urban, suburban, and rural areas in all parts of the civilized world. They are not to be confused with wild cats or with stray cats (alley cats). Wild cats are descendants of wild species. Stray cats are homeless descendants of domestic cats, but unlike feral cats, have had prior contact with humans and therefore exhibit temperament similar to that of a domestic cat.&lt;br/&gt;Feral cats may live alone but are usually found in large groups called feral colonies. These colonies tend to meet two essential criteria: a good hiding place (often a small wooded area, or abandoned buildings or cars) and a food source. This is why they are often seen near restaurant dumpsters. The average life span of a feral cat that survives beyond kittenhood is about two years for individual cats and five years for cats in a managed colony.[2] An indoor domestic house cat lives an average of 12 to 18 years, though not uncommonly, indoor-only cats have been known to live to their early 20's[citation needed] (12-14 in UK 16+ in USA but stats are incomplete).&lt;br/&gt;Cats are extremely adaptable, and feral felines have been found in conditions of extreme cold and heat.&lt;br/&gt;The environmental impact of feral and free-ranging cats is a subject of debate. Part of this stems from humane concern for the cats, and part stems from concerns about cat predation on endangered species. The domestic cat was distributed throughout the world by human travelers and is not native to many parts of the world. The amount of ecological damage done by cats depends on local conditions, with the most severe effect occurring to island ecologies. Environmental concerns may be minimal in places such as the UK where cats are an established species and few to none of the local prey species are endangered. In Australia, New Zealand and parts of North America they are considered pests due to their threat to endangered species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information compliments of Wikipedia.</groundspeak:long_description>

We enjoyed viewing the nice home that sits down in there all by itself. We both thought my wife's great Aunt Tiny would have enjoyed this area. She would have been 90 this weekend. Unfortunately, she was cut five days short. So this is placed in memory of Aunt Tiny. Your GPSr will spin in this area. Happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

I have driven by and wondered where the green gate went to.&lt;br/&gt;I found it to be a nice little short walk for the dog to play in the water, read a book, and etc. I also found it hard to grade this ones difficulty.

I'm sure I may get a few comment about ground zero from some. That's all in the fun of opencaching!&lt;br/&gt;This area is actually the crossroads of a small guage railroad crossing which started up the hill from Chico, CA to the Diamond Match mill that had all been a passing of time. But these muggles sure enjoy this area. Just watch for speeders!!! Cache on!</groundspeak:long_description>

Please be safe while hiking in this area. Remember to bring water, food, and skeeter repellent.&lt;br/&gt;~My son and I stumbled on this lake a couple of years ago. Yes, it does have fish, but from the side your on, good luck caching one. Do not cross the spill way or leave the side of the lake you are on. The east side is private. Stay on current path to reconnect with the main trail. Happy caching~</groundspeak:long_description>

This is just accross the street from Lake DeSabla. &lt;br/&gt;We have been to a couple of events here and it is quite a place that goes unseen by many. There is a nearby parking area that is the safest bet for parking your vehicle for this short hike/cardio workout to the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I decided to place a few caches for those those short and sweet hikes. And maybe somtimes, a little harder to challenge others. These tougher ones are coming very soon. &lt;br/&gt;Some of these I will be placing are going to have multiple types of difficulties and terrain levels. Enough to get the heart pumping. And you cannot drive your car up to these.&lt;br/&gt;Today, I decided to each lunch here and place a cache,&lt;br/&gt;This area is great for a nice little short walk for the dog to play in the water, read a book, and etc.This is one of the easier cardio series. Enjoy it, The next few are going up in difficulty. Enjoy and happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

A drive up that requires a little work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats goes out to whitetail39&amp;travler13 for the FTF. Great job!&lt;br/&gt;My boys enjoyed this stretch for that roller coaster effect when coming down the hill. This all depends on how fast you are going. Speeding is not recommended as some of these hills have blind spots and can be dangerous!!!&lt;br/&gt;Terrain is OK, but lots of brush. Watch your eyes for sticks and skewers. A small person could almost crouch and walk in. An larger person may break back a lot of branches to get to it. If this happens, it may open a direct gateway for a potential muggle. Please go easy on the geotrail. &lt;br/&gt;(9/9/09: Cache swapped for an ammo can as a bear had chewed the old cache. I assume bears like just about anything. Mmmmmmm....Coffee! LOL&lt;br/&gt;Same old log, new cache and lots o swag to enjoy!!!&lt;br/&gt;1$ in quarters for the FTF.</groundspeak:long_description>

THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. Can be risky extracting this cache. BE CAREFUL! GPS is intermittant in this area. Let me know if coords are ok. Thanks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being a newbie and excited about geocatching, I learned a valuable lesson doing this cache. I am no longer a stuntman. Though the cache is only a matter of feet away from parking spot, the terrain changes dramatically. Steep, pine needles, and shoes with no traction will not be good. By far the scariest cache I have placed thus far. Of course, I did it backwards. I figured, well, I did not keep on rolling down the hill and caught myself by grabbing a sapling, so that must be a good thing. &lt;br/&gt;There is a log, necklace, goofy pin, pencil, Gregarious Greg - Super Cacher! TB, and my son says I placed a dollar. After all the excitment and near mishap, I do not remember what all I left. I am going to have to print up FTF certs for the FTF's. Again, BE CAREFUL!

Consider checking out GCJPWD just a short hike up this road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A congrats to whitetail39&amp;travler13 for the FTF. Way to hustle out there!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had to place this one here as my wife and I enjoyed the hike and to let others know of such a historical hike to the Inskip Pioneer Cemetery. See below. It is about a fifteen minute hike or 4WD in. Camoed decon container with usual stuff, and 1$ for the FTF.&lt;br/&gt;The Way To Inskip Pioneer Cemetery&lt;br/&gt;A very interesting trek back in time. I tip my hat to Red Buggy for placing this one. &lt;br/&gt;Not only was it my 200th find, but the most challenging. &lt;br/&gt;My wife had given up and headed back to the car. I was persistant and decided to continue my search. I finally found it with a little labor into extracting it. A tree had fallen on the cache over last winter. It is now dug out and ready to go again.&lt;br/&gt;There is also the recently placed memorial placed by E. Clampus Vitus 7-11. Looks nice. Go ECV! Yes, I am a clamper too. :-)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GCJPWD- Lost Souls cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NAME: Inskip&lt;br/&gt;COUNTY: Butte&lt;br/&gt;ROADS: 2WD&lt;br/&gt;GRID #(see map): 1&lt;br/&gt;CLIMATE: Cool winter, mild summer.&lt;br/&gt;BEST TIME TO VISIT: Anytime. COMMENTS: On SR 191 off SR 70 North of Sacramento, current residents.&lt;br/&gt;REMAINS: The hotel and a few small buildings. &lt;br/&gt; Inskip was developed as a stage stop along a heavily traveled route used by miners. P.M. Kelly took interest and began to develop Inskip with a store and hotel. Within a year, many stores, hotels, saloons, and other businesses sprang up. Today, only the Inskip Hotel and a few smaller buildings remain of this prosperous mining community. &lt;br/&gt;John Stokes purchased the hotel in 1866 and renamed it Stokes Hotel. John moved his family to Inskip where it was home for more than 65 years. &quot;The hotel was destroyed by fire in 1868 and later rebuilt. It was probably then that it was renamed Inskip. Legend says the fire was arson and that a resident ghost named Charley is still looking for the arsonist. It has operated almost continuously as a hotel. Bob and Kathy Duffey are its current owners having purchased the hotel in 1968. In 1975 it was approved and listed in the National Register of Historical Places.&quot; - www.paradisedirect.com. &lt;br/&gt;They also failed to mention that this hotel was shown on TV's &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; as a haunted location as well.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a great view of the valley floor surrounding Burney.  My Mom introduced me to the area while hiking nearby.  It is very breath taking as you get to see the whole area.  You are also rather close to another cache site listed on geocaching.com.  I do think this area has the Best Views though.  The hike and views have become a favorite of my family.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please post a log note concerning the creatures and sights that you see while you wonder at the nature of the Mount Lassen area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WildBunch 3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; ** Congratulations to MTLassen of Geocaching.com for the First to Find!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Fort Rock View&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the &quot;Road less traveled&quot; cacher. This is an area I found deer&lt;br/&gt;hunting in 1981. The area blessed me with a huge 4 point buck that&lt;br/&gt;year but the part that I really remember is the view and solitude.&lt;br/&gt;You look over Flat Top Butte and at the north-west side of Fort&lt;br/&gt;Rock. I returned today while out hunting, no deer, but the solitude&lt;br/&gt;and view remains. This cache is a long way out and for that reason&lt;br/&gt;I am providing driving directions. Take Finley Butte road&lt;br/&gt;(FS22)from La Pine, OR. about 19 miles east to FS24, travel south&lt;br/&gt;approximately 4 miles to FS2233 turn left and proceed approximately&lt;br/&gt;3/4 of a mile to FS550 (the sign is hard to find) it is the second&lt;br/&gt;road on the right. Take the right fork about 1/4 of a mile up and&lt;br/&gt;follow your GPS up the hill. You can park within 100 feet of the&lt;br/&gt;cache if you are in something with a little ground clearance. I&lt;br/&gt;drove our pickup all the way up in 2wd. You are looking for a camo&lt;br/&gt;(black and gray) plastic peanut butter jar. Please put the blue lid&lt;br/&gt;down to hide it a little. Best attempted on a nice NO SNOW day. Log&lt;br/&gt;book, pen and three swag items. Enjoy the view!! (Alternate&lt;br/&gt;route-Hwy 31 to FS24 to FS2233 then same as above)</groundspeak:long_description>

Short walk to stretch your legs and cover if you really need it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn east off of 97, then approx. 1/4 mile to open area near cache.  There is plenty of room down there for even large rigs or those pulling a trailer to turn around and park.  Spring 2011, the BSR road sign at the HWY 97 intersection is gone.  You will see reference to it being the BSR road near the parking area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is meant to be a spot where you can turn the dog loose and not have to worry about the highway.  This is an ammo box a short walk into the brush from the parking area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, I know what BSR stands for, do you? Oh, okay, it stands for Brookes Scanlon Resources, the original owner and logger of the area.  It's BLM now. </groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The 2nd of my La Pine Parks and Recreation caches. The Finley Butte
Community Park has a long local history. At one time Frontier Days
and the Rodeo were held here. The Community building was built by
the original La Pine Lions Club that at one time was the largest
Lions Club in the state of Oregon with 140 members. Alas, the club
membership dropped for a variety of reasons and the club dissolved
after donating the park and facilities to La Pine Parks and
Recreation.&lt;br /&gt;
I needed to move this cache and rename it, landscaping removed the prior area. You may park your vehicle in the parking lot and make the short walk to this one. Log and pen in container, please reseal and face the blue lid into the hide so it doesn't show. Enjoy our parks! **Note if there is a ball game going on you should come back to this one at another time.**

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is located in what I believe is La Pines smallest park.
Leona Park was donated to the La Pine Lions Club many years ago and
when the old Lions Club ceased to be was given to La Pine Parks and
Recreation. I placed this cache here in hopes more people would
find and use this little park on the Little Deschutes River. Watch
for &quot;Muggles&quot; here... Please re-hide well.&lt;br /&gt;
Today I needed lots of mosquito repellent so come prepared, also
bring your own writing stick....&lt;br /&gt;
FTF has a &quot;Trekks&quot; Pathtag coin waiting.&lt;br /&gt;

shortened writing pen!**</groundspeak:long_description>

This one is at Rosland Park&lt;br/&gt;Day Use and Campground. You are searching for a cammo painted&lt;br/&gt;plastic peanut butter container with a log, writing stick, and a&lt;br/&gt;few swag items. Please re-hide well so blue cap doesn't show. This&lt;br/&gt;hide is just a few paces off the trail. Park in the day use parking&lt;br/&gt;area and not in a campsite, respect the campers and their areas. If&lt;br/&gt;you have time, stop and say &quot;HI&quot; to the camp host, he wasn't sure&lt;br/&gt;about Geocacheing folks and I told him what super people we are!&lt;br/&gt;Remember the 5mph speed for dust control. Have fun in our La Pine&lt;br/&gt;Parks! #####Another FTF for &quot;ddjt&quot; of one of my&lt;br/&gt;caches-Congrats##### ******The campground is closed for the season,&lt;br/&gt;you may park at the gate and make the short walk to the cache******</groundspeak:long_description>

A little searching you will find a path in that does not require bushwhacking the manzanita.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While looking for a good spot to hide the cache, Bay Li, my Rat Terrier flushed a rabbit from the brush.  That got Jack the Jack Terrier and Sarah the Labrador interested and while they didn't catch any rabbits, they did flush 5 of them out of the brush.  My, oh my, hunts on!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you arrive at this spot on a cloudy day, you may wonder why I chose it, but if you arrive on a clear sunny day, you'll understand.  While not very high in elevation, you will see to the south Wickiup Reservoir, Davis Butte and one of the nicest views of Diamond Peak from this area.  To the north you'll see Bachelor Butte and a piece of the South Sister.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not meant to be a hard find, rather, a nice trip out for some fresh air and great scenery.  Room for some swag and bugs.  Hope you enjoy!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If after you park, you find yourself going uphill, you've chosen the long, calf burner way which will get you there.  If it's level/down hill, it's only a few feet away. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the way, you may see me out on my horse with some friends, so please, slow down, enjoy the area and say hi as you go by. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A nature walkers dream.  A river, an old growth forest and a road closed to motorized vehicles.  A multi with several Bad Dog traditional caches nearby. You will have to walk or ride a horse or bike a minimum of 6 miles round trip, but, it is flat and the scenery and wildlife make it worth every step.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever since they closed 3 miles of road to motorized vehicles, this portion of the upper Deschutes has become one of my favorite places to walk the dogs, ride my horse or ride my fat tire bike.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What birds and wildlife you see will depend on the season and time of day you arrive.  During migration you will see every duck variety known to man, cranes and who knows what else down on the river but don't neglect the sky, you may see a Bald Eagle or summer of 2010 an Osprey watching over her nest or fishing.  Elk abound in here, you'll see signs every where but you will have to have you're timing just right to see them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best place to start is at Wyeth Campground.  Day parking, toilet and campgrounds (first come, first serve) all available.  Wyeth is where floating devices of choice must be taken out to portage around Pringle Falls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 3 miles of closed road with a small section, a little over a mile in, open to allow access to Bull Bend Campground. If you camp, Bull Bend is fairly popular.  Both of these campgrounds are fairly primitive, this isn't KOA. I did notice that Hoodoo appears to be handling reservations for 2010 at the campgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multi consists of 2 waypoints and the cache, a total of 3 stops.  The starting waypoint is not far from the closed gate at Wyeth Campground. On your way to the second waypoint you will pass some traditional caches placed by Bad Dogs. The second way point will force you off the road where you will follow a bend in the river.  The final cache is also in the area created by the bend in the river.  After the cache you can continue following the river back out to the road to get 2011 hides by Bad Dog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since there were several large trees at the first waypoint, a hint should help you if your gps has trouble.  Mine got me there fine, but I know tree cover can cause problems for some.  HINT - Hanging like a necklace on the youngster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are going to do 6 flat miles if you do the road where available.  If you choose to follow the trail, you will come closer to 7 miles round trip. This is an afternoon out.  Enjoy it.  Stroll, power walk, ride a horse, ride a bike and be sure to look up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's my gps track of the hide. Don't think it will help you much, but it's cool.  http://connect.garmin.com/activity/37636072&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FC2AJCE - Final Cache&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Final waypoint with cache container.&lt;br/&gt;PK2AJCE - Wyeth Campground&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 44.276 W 121° 37.016&lt;br/&gt;Wyeth Campground parking and start point&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S22AJCE - Stage Two&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Second Waypoint</groundspeak:long_description>

Here's a geocachers bypass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dogs and I were headed to Twin Lakes only to find construction on South Century between Burgess and Twin Lakes.  So, we headed up the 4258 road across from Burgess made a left onto the old Upper Deschutes Rd, aka 4040 and ended up back onto S. Century just before Twin Lakes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Much more scenic and the road was in good to very good condition the whole way.  Found a really nice view spot looking down on Wickiup Res. and out towards the Buttes surrounding the area.  Oh, and on the way up, saw a Golden Eagle.  Yes, any thing that big and gold and beautiful is an Eagle, not a Hawk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classic ammo can hide, no tricks here, just a pretty view. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Deschutes National Forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This looks down on the river where it makes two tight turns.  Logs tend to come down here and jam, unable to make both turns.  Some times there are so many logs, if you were a brave soul, you could walk across the river.  Other times, it gets cleaned out and there are only a few.  Either way, it's a pretty view of the river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Compression Station #12: GTN Sunriver &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; These compressor stations are spaced about 50-60 miles apart along the GTN transmission pipeline, from the Canadian gas field source to the final distribution in Southern California.  Line pressures can be adjusted to control the velocity of the gas in the pipeline.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typical line velocity is 30 miles per hour and gas can be &quot;parked&quot; in segments of the pipeline to adjust for demand.  The gas in a segment of pipe between two compression stations is called a &quot;linepack&quot; and can be adjusted in velocity remotely to account for fluctuations in demand.  Line pressures range from 200 PSI to 1,500 PSI, with the steel transmission pipes ranging 20-42 inches in diameter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jet engines are used to compress the gas, using bleed gas as fuel for the jet.  A similar station (#11) is located alongside Hwy 26, east of Pine Ridge.  Some stations have small landing strips for servicing the station. Both this station and #11 have such landing strips for STOL aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ladder-like array in the center of this complex is likely a heat-exchanger, designed to extract heat from the gas once it is compressed.  The plastic tubs in the service yard are for storage of the oil used in the compression process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.aga.org/Kc/aboutnaturalgas/consumerinfo/NGDeliverySystem.htm</groundspeak:long_description>

Allow about 2 hours.  This area overlooks the Badlands and has plenty of interesting rock formations and a few rock sheets that have been polished by glaciers.  Notice this feature especially after leaving the Outcrop on your way to the Bone Waypoint.  Waypoints 2 – 4 require recording the elevation number on the roadside sign as you approach the first waypoint, and also the OHV number at the first waypoint.

comes from the CCIO 2007 Cache Exchange Event and is camouflaged
and EXTREMELY well-hidden. Please replace as found. Park at the end
of Osage in DRW.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;BC had a chat with Bailey last week, while they were out
chasing sticks in the Juniper Forest.  Having completed
Chapter 1 of Pingala in the code book, BC suggested that a
truly determined Central Oregon geocacher or geopup could really
enjoy this piece of code: 
0011000100110000010101000011000000110110001100110011000100110010001110010011010000110100001110000011011000111000001101100011010000110110.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailey took on this challenge for 160.412 meters at a bearing of
030o 01.324' True from the resolved 1s and 0s encoded
position.  She searched and searched, knowing that WGS84 was
the correct datum for all Geocache.com mapping applications. 
Ahhhh...she finally said to BC, now I like these boulders with
their tight passages, but perhaps some clues are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love that Golden Basin east of Ford Road, but Osage is Best!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: AA10TDR - Offset&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;If the binary is copied and pasted into a Binary-to-text converter, the result is 10T06312944868646.  This converts into the above lat/long.

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Hint #1: Pingala is noted as developing what numerical system?  http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=44e8ed34-55e1-4fdd-8649-c9a7c7670d43 
Hint #2: Low-and-behold, amongst the rocky passages.
Hint #3: Consider doing a Direct Vincenty to derive the final lat/long.  WGS84 is the datum</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The posted coordinates are the start of your search, so you will
need to number-crunch for the solution. Bailey and BC begged for an
evening walk in the forest and were pleased to find a bubbling
spring at the end of their journey. The cache area is unique, but
shows some wear from illegal OHV use, so the CacheCollies hope the
presence of visiting geocachers will make the area more visible in
the public eye. &lt;br /&gt; The
      CacheCollies have passed nearby this beautiful oasis on their
      many journies into the high country of the Oregon Cascades,
      but never had taken time to stop and enjoy the giant
      Ponderosa Pines, rocky features, and Big Spring.  Soon
      there will be a new mountain bike trail punched through this
      area and on towards Mt. Bachelor, so you will notice numerous
      &quot;TRAIL&quot; flags designating the eventual path. 
      &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At
the posted coordinates, N43o
58.965',
W121o
29.709', look
for a man-made object bearing numbers.  Take the first digit
in the three digit number as &quot;A&quot;, second digit as &quot;B&quot;, third digit
as &quot;C&quot;.  Solve for the second waypoint as follows:
N43o
58.DEF',
W121o

30.GHI'&lt;br /&gt;
D =
9-B+4; E = 6-A-3; F = 5+C; G = 7-B; H = 0+C+2; I =
9+B-6&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hike
to this second waypoint and follow an azimuth of TRUE
JKLo
for
280 feet, requiring you to use your magnetic compass AND GPS for
bearing and distance.  J = 8-B; K = A+B; L =
6-B&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You
are looking for a 4.5 x 6.25 x 3.5 inch plastic camo
container.  Please exchange only small items, rehide using
local organic stuff and have fun exploring the
area.&lt;br /&gt;

This is BLM property with adjoining private land the first 0.4 miles.  Stay on the BLM road and continue past the canal and over the rocky trace to good parking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Cache contains the usual trade items and a TB.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The areas bordering Bend to the south and southeast still offer stunning vistas of the Cascades and a vantage point to observe the rapid and somewhat chaotic growth of the metropolitan region.  Part of this walk (northern most waypoint) will be nearby an old irrigation canal, part by the Skeleton Fire Complex and another part near robust trees that escaped the fires.  Perhaps a land swap will one day convert this area into 3,000 sq ft homes on 4,000 sq ft lots, so enjoy the natural setting while you are able.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;If you like, this cache
can be a warmup for the nearby TZI Wedding March Cache. 
Vertical gain on the Tumalo Mtn. trek is 1,200 feet.  The
cache is available 4-season, and will make a nice winter ski trip
with excellent views.  Our CacheCollies enjoy the terrain, a
quick 25 minutes drive from Bend downtown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison purposes, the vertical gain for the TZI GCXK3C is
nearly 5,000 feet over 13 miles round trip.  Vertical gain on
the Tumalo Mtn. trek is 1,200 feet over about 3.2 miles round trip.
If you do this Bailey Treasure Box trek to the top in under an
hour, KUDOS for you, and good prep for the South Sister WMC effort.
Parking by Forest Permit is located at N44o00.030,
W121o39.850  From these coordinates, you will hike
or ski to N43o59.938, W121o39.058 where there
is located a sign containing a 13 word message.  The Cache is
located at N44o00.ABC, W121o3D.EFG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = number of letters in sixth word; B = number of letters in
nineth word; C = number of letters in eighth word minus 2; D =
number of letters in thirteenth word plus 2; E = sum of the four
digits for the summit elevation (Open the
MyTopo Link below and use that value for the elevation) of
Tumalo Mountain MINUS 21; F = number of letters in the twelfth word
divided by 2; G = number of letters in the fourth word times 2 and
then add 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a standard ammo box containing a FTF button,
Jeep TB, GeoCoin, SkyShark Airplane, Parrot, Oriental Doll, Rabbit
Toy, and Blue Beads.  Please try to
trade like items, geocoin for geocoin or TB for TB,
etc.  Enjoy the views and be sure to post your
pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TUMALO benchmark and RMs are now missing, but you can still
see the foundation remains of the 1930s two story L-4 cab lookout
on the SE portion of the summit area. A July 2003 Nearby Benchmark
Report said that this TUMALO disk and attached rod were vandalized
and located in a hollow tree at N 44° 00.303 W 121° 38.587

posted coodinates and will require the Google Earth application or
searching at Wikimapia.org to solve the puzzle. By completing this
cache, you will visit some interesting point-sources of atmospheric
pollution that are now the topics of numerous research projects.
There are two intermediate waypoints, in camo pill
bottles. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on 
Geochecker.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific evidence suggests
that Earth is rapidly warming and some recent studies indicate that
there is a direct relationship to Global
Warming and the gases (particularly CO2) we have emitted into
the atmosphere.  PBS featured a
   NOVA/Frontline Report April
   24, 2007 that offers an excellent overview to the immediate
   threats brought on by Global Warming.  The 
Report offers facts that can help us thread-the-needle
in the efforts to reverse the trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 
&quot;Over a 40 year period, scientist Charles Keeling measured the
amount of carbon dioxide (CO
2
) in the atmosphere. The above &quot;Keeling Curve&quot; shows the increase
in total concentrations of CO
2
in the atmosphere from 1957-1997. This unbroken record of the
carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere shows how it's gone up, in
round numbers, from around 315 parts per million to around 370
parts per million on average today. This data is widely accepted by
everyone. (Nova/Frontline Report)&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good downloadable tool, Google Earth, can be
used fly around the globe and visit some of the past and current
point-sources of pollution. As an alternative, you can go to
http://www.wikimapia.org and search against the names listed in the
Fly To sites  You will be visiting the
tallest smoke
stacks in the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Magna, UT  Kennecott Copper Smelter
Stack,  370.4 meters (#4 world highest
     stack) 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Earth has a “Fly To”
tab.  You will copy a location from the
list below, paste it into the tab field and hit the ENTER key on
your computer.  Google Earth will fly
you to the vicinity of a stack, where you can pan around to observe
some interesting features, in addition to the gigantic
stacks.  Remember, these stacks are TALL
so as to disperse the toxic gases and CO2 downwind from the
worksite, but all of the gases then mix into the
atmosphere.  The smelter stacks you will
visit have vented mega tonnage of toxic metal waste into the
atmosphere during their operational history, along with carbon
oxides.  Some of these facilities, such as Kennecott at Magna
UT, have been made to be very efficient and even capture the
sulfuric acid gases as a commercial byproduct.  To identify
the stack site, float your mouse over the small Google Earth icons
you see on the satellite hybrid maps. If you don't have Google
Earth freeware installed on your computer, just visit the link
http://www.wikimapia.org and use the search engine to locate the
target stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; INCO Nickel Smelter Stack,  381
meters (#2 highest stack in the World) (Brazilian
Ownership)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example of this acid fallout is the
jet-black granite around Greater Sudbury Ontario, where the
sulfuric acid rain has penetrated the pink-gray granite to a depth
of 3 inches and permanently dyed the granite jet black.
       The INCO Superstack is the
      tallest freestanding chimney in the Western hemisphere, with
      a height of 381 m (1,257 ft).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each “Fly To” 
location, zoom down to where you can see the stack opening and
float your mouse to the center of the stack.  Record the minutes for both latitude and longitude
of the stack for some later number crunching.  Of course, because we are looking down on the
stack from above but at an angle, not straight down the stack hole,
the number you record is not the actual location of this stack, but
that is not our objective in this exercise.  Any reading 30 or more seconds is rounded to the
next minute of reading, ie. N44*16’30” gives 17 for the minutes
value and adding the two digits (1+7) gives 8.  N44*16’29.9” gives 16 minutes or a sum of
7.  Got it, OK!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Another cache is nearby this old trail.  There are also several good approaches from Todd Lake Trailhead, either by the Green Lakes Trail or the lakeside trail from the west side of the lake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some cross-country travel is required from any approach and the hiking trail to Green Lakes from Todd Lake will take about as much time as driving up 370 to the listed waypoint and hiking on from there.  Either of these two approaches takes you very close to another recent cache.  Springs and meadows abound, and also enjoy the sound of Soda Creek waterfalls far below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small items, pencil, log, TB, DigitalFish in the original setup</groundspeak:long_description>

successful recuperation from the rodent hole and sharp lava rock
encounter of last Saturday. One might say he is a base-10 Border
Collie, when all of the front and rear toes are on the ground. This
cache is his thank-you to all the geocachers who have written to
wish him well in his recovery. Thanks also to Dr. Abraham at the
Animal Emergency Center at Scandia Plaza for the excellent repair
work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the coordinates
1100100000111001011000000110011100010110101010111, the cache is
located on a bearing of 111 degrees True and 0.143 miles (230.625
meters). You are looking for a camo egg with a sign-in sheet and
short pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ski ticket scanners at Mt. Bachelor are now digital and the
ticket scanning details are transmitted wirelessly to West Village
operations. Wireless Internet access was available earlier in the
season and may still be accessible by suitably configured laptops.
In setting up this cache, we wondered the age of the Hawthorne
tree, and if the old Shevlin-Hixon Mill cast a shadow upon it in
years past. The vacant land was once part of the Shevlin-Hixon Mill
and an elevated rail system connected the mill operations west and
east of the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Gang!!  I am good again!!  BC&lt;/p&gt;

barrel, Bailey is investigating alternative means of reaching some
of the local Bend caches. Join her on this puzzle journey as she
investigates the local BAT system. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;The cache is NOT at the posted coordinates, so
you will need to solve a puzzle for the starting point of your
journey.  You have read
about these monster buses and their
reputation.  They have
been replaced and are now in storage; look carefully and you may
see them on your
journey.  Click

HERE to visit the transit website and search for some
solutions to the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Transit
Routes are numbered
1-11.
  The total number of routes is
M.
  The second digit of the BAT 4 digit office address is
N (ie. xNqr in the four digit address).
(use Absolute
Value). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting point is
N44°03.(2xN)(M)(N),
W121°18.(M-N-5)(M-N)(M+N-1). 
For example, if N
= 1, and M
= 9, your solution is
N44°03.291,
W121°18.389
[bogus
location]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for the STARTING POINT on

Geochecker.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit this starting point and begin your
search for details to the second part of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second waypoint is
N44
°03.XYZ, W121°17.PQR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XYZ = 472 – 2x(the
2 digit number of Type ID) – 28&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PQR =
058 
+ (year of manufacture) – 2000 + (sum of last two numbers in
the serial number); see hint and be sure to record the complete
serial number for future reference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located at this site,
N44°03.DEF,
W121°17.JKL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEF = (total number of ornamental [non-linear]
objects associated with the second lowest attachment to the
vertical support) + XYZ + 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JKL = 10x(first two
numbers in the serial number at WPT1) + PQR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a
micro.  Bring your own
writing stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Checksum
for total number of objects in
DEF is 4,
&lt;b&gt;adding
the two digit total of
ornaments&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Night cache. Start at the posted coordinates and look west with your flashlight for the first marker, a &quot;FireTack&quot; on a tree. There will be roughly 30 of these scattered along your route to the cache. Most are set from 6' to 8' high and at varying distances (10' to 100') depending on the trees. The final cache location is at ground level and should be apparent when you get to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FireTacks are small, retro-reflective markers. To see them you have to hold your light at eye level so that the reflection comes back to you. You may also need to hit one of the flat surfaces head on. In other words, these can be tricky to spot and you may need to move a step this way or that to catch it just right. Use a good, medium-strength flashlight or headlamp. Don't use a powerful spot light for several reasons: it will wash out the markers and make them harder to see; it will blind you; and it will attract attention in this stolid residential neighborhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The terrain is off-trail and on a hillside with moderate brush and trees, so wear reasonable shoes and probably long pants. There are many tripping obstacles so please watch your step. It is easy to get disoriented when concentrating on the markers. And, oh yes, watch for other species in the night. You will see the deer droppings and critter tracks. A cougar has been spotted here. And, of course, this &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; Area 51... There is no parking lot at this park and you may not park on 9th/12th Street, but any of the nearby side streets are fine. The closest parking to the start is NW Sonora Drive at N 44° 04.207 W 121° 19.436. </groundspeak:long_description>

Head south, up hill and to the west of the chain link fence. Avoid nearby residences. The site is usually accessible except during heavy snow. For a longer stroll (about a half mile), park to the east at Summit Park (N 44° 04.522' W 121° 19.662') and take the trail from the parking lot around the north side of the butte. Follow the trail along the chain link fence to near Sylvan Park and continue up hill. Do not approach from the south up the paved access road because a fence will block your way to the cache. There is no way around the fence without trespassing on private property. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Service to the Bend – Redmond - Sisters – Madras – Prineville area (88.1 FM) has improved with the installation of a 5 kW transmitter (KLBR) at the Jack Pine Ridge radio consortium sharing a 300 ft. high antenna (blinking red tower light seen at night 10 miles west of Bend), NE of Tumalo Falls.  See the pictures in the gallery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The signal feed to the Jack Pine Ridge KLBR transmitter comes by microwave from the summit of Mt. Bachelor at the Summit Lift Terminal, where the 89.7 FM signal is received from the Eugene transmitter, converted to microwave and relayed to the Jack Pine facility.  Final commissioning was completed January 26, 2006 after hauling equipment up Mt.

She read that small scale irrigation began in Oregon by 1852.  The Cline Falls Power Company filed the earliest water rights on the Deschutes River in 18ZR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By 1904, the Pilot Butte Canal was completed and at the same time the Arnold Irrigation Company was incorporated.  That year, the Deschutes Irrigation and Power Company purchased two steam boilers to operate the drills.  The 20 horsepower boiler drove S drills; the 6 horsepower boiler drove T drill.

I included the first waypoint in the puzzle.  Cachers will go to the Internet link and see the barcode for Wikipedia: 87654 32109.  They will use that number to locate the first waypoint.&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: FF25WH8 - Bailey's EcoChallenge Pit&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;44*06.4th, 8th, 1st
121*16.10th minus 1, 10th, 5th

bar code reads: 3338325002
reading left to right, 4th = 8, 8th = 0, 1st = 3 (for longitude)
hence, 44*06.803
reading left to right 10 minus 1 = 2 - 1 = 1, 10th = 2, 5th = 3
hence 121*16.123

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Be careful and watch your step.  Ignore the start &quot;0&quot; and end &quot;1&quot; in the code sequence at the intermediate waypoint.  Focus on the 10 digit code number.  For example

some background research on the Sutong Bridge, the world's longest
span cable-stayed bridge to date. The bridge is in Jiangsu Province
and spans the Yangtze River, the longest river in Asia. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sutong Bridge Project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longest cable-stayed bridge in the world is
currently under construction (June 2003 and open to traffic end of
2008)  to link the
ancient Chinese city of Suzhou to the industrial center of Nantong,
spanning the Changjiang River (a tributary of the Yangtze River),
108 km upstream of the Yangtze estuary leading to the Yellow
Sea.  Currently,
vehicle  traffic
between these two cities takes the hour drive around the Chengong
watercourse from the 

 Hangzhou Airport to Ningbo, or a longer ferry
ride.  By the end
of 2008, the bridge will speed the journey to 5
minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once completed, the bridge will create four new
world records for cable-stayed bridges: its (ABCD)m central span
will be the longest; the (EFG)m-high main bridge tower will be the
highest; the two foundation piers of the main bridge will be the
deepest; and the longest stay of the main bridge will also the
longest in the world, so far, at (HIJ)m.  The total length of the bridge
will be (KLMN)m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checksums:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABCD = 17; EFG = 9; HIJ = 13; KLMN =
16;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a metal tag with a True
bearing and distance to the cache, nearby a local Central Oregon
bridge.  This tag is located at Canal Rock Waypoint:
N44*PQ.RST, W121*UV.WXY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calculation:  Do the math below, substutiting
the numbers you find on the Internet search in the four
measurements above.  For example, if Z = (D + K)/4, then Z =
(8 + 8)/4 = 16/4 = 4 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P = J; Q = C + 1; R = H; S = D; T = (G –
E)/3;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U = (I – H)/3; V = M; W = (K – N + L); X = I – H;
Y = K - L&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Bailey and BC like this canyon walk, with the awesome mountain and&lt;br/&gt;canyon views. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Bailey thought this south end of Fryrear Canyon resembled terrain&lt;br/&gt;from some of her adventures down in the Sierra Madre south of Creel&lt;br/&gt;where the real Copper Canyon resides. Could not locate any&lt;br/&gt;Tarahumara natives today.&lt;br/&gt;http://www.galenfrysinger.com/copper_canyon_mexico.htm &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best approach is to take the dirt road east from Fryrear Rd at&lt;br/&gt;N44*14.018, W121*25.367 and travel east until the GPSr bearing is&lt;br/&gt;perpendicular to this track. Look around for a likely access point,&lt;br/&gt;park the rig and find a trail into the Canyon. This is also an&lt;br/&gt;excellent starting point to complete the GeoGolf south end caches.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Topside and no need to climb down.  Good views.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

The posted
coordinates are not the cache site, but will allow easy access to
this interesting canyon. Cache is a small cylinder
(camo tape), large enough for small
TBs,
GeoCoins, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We found this
interesting viewpoint after completing the
Tulpa Cache. This little canyon
(
section 14 on this map:) is best accessed from Lower Bridge
Market Road and thence on the dirt road to the listed coordinates.
Perhaps millennia ago, this canyon was
part of the Deschutes River, but it is now high and dry. I included
a view using Google Earth, and you can grab the nearby
Tulpa Cache during your
journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Watch out for
unspent paintballs during your hike, and be cautious when on the
overlook. If enough of us complain to the Prineville BLM about the
paint ball wars being conducted in this canyon, they might just
close it off to these activities, including the motorized vehicles
driving on the canyon floor. Find the BLM at this reference:
mailto:Molly_Brown@blm.gov&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You will need to
visit the website listed at
the TOP of this page to solve the puzzle, and there are some
links below that take you directly to the necessary
details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From the listed
latitude, N44° 21.637, solve the puzzle for N44° 21.PQR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
PQR =
Jack’s National Number
(minus) year that Mt.
Bachelor NSP was organized (plus) 241&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From the listed
longitude, W121°15.382, solve the puzzle for W121°15.XYZ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
XYZ =
[number
of people in the avalanche training probe line picture (times)
number
of regions in Pacific Northwest Division (times)
types
of NSP Membership ] plus 326&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the GeoChecker
to test your solution and then go fill-up the
CacheMobile to grab this cache.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Best approach is to start at the Mt. Washington View Point pull-out and head east to the SECOND of the smaller pull-outs east of this BIG pull-out.  Park on the cinders and hop to the east side of the guard rail, thence uphill about 60 ft.  USE EXTREME CAUTION ON YOUR APPROACH, DUE TO HIGH SPEED VEHICLES!!  Keep the pooch and kids in the rig for this quick grab. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We noticed this fruit-bearing apple tree about 15 years ago along Santiam Pass HWY.  Likely the old tree was started from an apple core tossed by a passer-by...early vehicle traffic, horse person, hiker, Indian, alien?  Oregon Geographic Names indicates that pioneer settler Andrew Wiley made his way with two others from the Willamette Valley to Central Oregon in 1859, when this route was a trail.  Originally, Santiam Pass was known as Hogg Pass, after Col. T. Egenton Hogg who attempted to build a railroad in the area. The current highway was mapped and constructed in the 1928-29 timeframe, so the apple tree started from a discarded apple around 80 years ago or sooner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the views and consider the hard time this old tree has endured.  Do not eat the apples, since the tree is probably stuffed with lead from the earlier fuel additives.  We grabbed a ripe apple and hope to plant it in Bend</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Eye-level when facing east from the roadway shoulder, 2 feet below the dangling bird house found in central part of the tree.  The local footing is loose, so take care.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I have had the privilege of &lt;br/&gt;standing on top of Mt Hood, Mt Adams, Mt Shasta, Mt Rainier, Mt St Helens and &lt;br/&gt;Mt Washington. In 2001 We did the Pacific Crest Trail. In the end I had logged &lt;br/&gt;12,364 miles. I loved every minuet of it.&lt;br/&gt;I have rated this cache with summer in mind. During the winter this could be up to an 8 hour snowshoe trip just to get there. The road is passable to a regular car but I would encourage at least a high ground clearance vehicle. There are also several hiking trails up to Flag Point and Badger creek Wilderness has some amazing trails.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">THE CACHE IS NOT IN THE YARD! A nice little walk along Avalon Way where you can say hello to some others joggers or dog-walkers along the way. The cache is placed just outside our house where we might say hello if we are around and the dog may bark but he is contained. If there is a car in the driveway try not to get in there way, also watch the kids because there are cars driving down Avalon.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This a slightly sad place because this is where my dog got hit by a car which is the reason he now has 3 legs, you may see him in the yard. The cache is camo painted plastic box that has lots of room for goodies. I started the box full of a log book, pen and pencils, goofy glasses, toy turtles, plastic primate and few trackables. There is also a glass thermometer that you may NOT TAKE, read the temperature inside the cache and put it in the with your log. When your looking around you may get some tree sap on you, also you may have to dig around in snow during the winter. Again no need to go in the yard, just stay in the drive way by the gate. Congrats to the Galloways for FTF! Don't forget to log the temperature with the thermometer in the box, just don't take the thermometer! There is a new thermometer and a new rope to make it impossible to remove! the only thing is that the new thermometer is digital so it uses batteries. If the screen is not on try pressing the red button on the back just tell me it needs new batteries.&lt;br /&gt;
People have been getting confused and not feeling comfortable about searching the area, So to clear things up it is not near the mailboxes and the area is doesn't mind people walking around near the houses.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache is in an underground tunnel so the coordinates are off. Water goes up to shin level, rubber boots works just fine. You will definitely need a flashlight and maybe a headlamp. I recommend going downstream from the college side.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Very few people know about this spot, I think the only ones are small group of teenagers and spiders. To get to the entrance look for concrete blocks just off of the trail. I tied the container so nobody could take it. First things put in the cache is an army guy, binder clip, a dollar, and a geocoin along with a pencil and logbook. Cache is a simple lock 'n lock just sitting there. I chose a spot that has a place to set your flashlight down, I wish we could of found a better place to hide it but the walls are pretty smooth.

&lt;p&gt;It might scare really young kids, along with the chance of deadly spiders, But you might get lucky find a spider that will give you superpowers. Whatever happens, be sure log it online. This cache might not last long due to the few that walk down aren't don't always leave things the way they were found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, The GPS signal is not great but if you walk downstream your bound to find it.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is near one of the baseball fields, if there is a game try not to look suspicious. Could be thorns, actually there is thorns. Hopefully bushwhacking won't happen but there is a chance.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I whipped this box together with some camo spray paint an old plastic bin along with a note pad for a log plus some goofy toys and I stuck some of favorite Japanese stickers to the box. You can walk around near the practice areas but please stay out the little forest that is blocked off by the barb wire fence, there is an opening but there is absolutely no need to go there.The cache is not there, please stay out.&lt;br /&gt;
If you know your baseball lingo then you can use the name as a hint and then from there use the encrypted hint for extra help.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bring some of your stickers and put it on the box to give the box personality, please nothing offensive or political. Place stickers all over the cache but remember to rehide well. When your signing the log write which one is yours.&lt;/h3&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I had a cache here before but it got 1 find and then got stolen. bummer. This is is a little better than that archived failure. I was hanging out reading FTF magazine and then all of a sudden I decided to make this one fun. It'll be hard for short people and those that don't like heights. You can park at the church and be sure to bring the youngsters because they'll like the swings. Once your at GZ of the decrypted spot check the hint. I used wingdings 3 as a font, you be able to find a decoder online or there are lots of writing programs that most computers have. Check the gallery of images to see encryption of coordinates.

Now this container has been all over because every time I place it somewhere there is another cache to close to it. Not exactly hidden but try to rehide well and please coil up the rope nicely when your done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is in the yard of the green house and the log fence with a dried up garden. This is our yard and our property so if we see you we might come over and say hello but there are a lot of muggles that walk by so don't announce to the world that there is a geocache. I do ask that try not to untie the rope from the cache and fully snap the lid back. It should lower fairly easily because Of the nice rope I have added along with a bit hose so you won't raise it to high and get it stuck. Raise the container until the hose touches the tree. Please only visit between hours 6am to 10pm. THE FTF GOES TO... Galloways for being just flat out awesome and cooler then anyone I know! (October 1st 2012) people have been scared by the condition of the yard, there can be large obstacles that may seem intimidating. You can walk around. For extra spoilers I have put some duck tape arrows pointing near the area but not showing how to receive. GOOD LUCK!</groundspeak:long_description>

The container is a film canister hanging on a string. The mechanism a bit more obvious. Don't read the hint if your a die-hard geocacher. If your tall it could be even more tricky, but don't get annoyed when it takes a long time to open. Bring a pen and/or pencil! Do not go in actual yard of owners, stay in the park area! So far 30% of all finds come with a favorite point!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">My first puzzle cache to commemorate Tsuruta, Japan and the beautiful park that is Tsuruta park. Sandals that can get wet are reccomended but you may also lay on your stomach to grab the container. You bring a calculator or just use you brain but this does go into the thousands  so its your choice. Make sure you now how enter coordinates into your GPSr because it will come in handy.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The coordinates given will lead you to a monument in the park, once the next coordinates are solved it will lead to a place still in the park.

&lt;p&gt;Take the year when hood river and Tsuruta, Japan's relantionship was established and subtract 2464 which will equal the last three digits to the lattitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the year Kenji Nakano had The monument for Tsuruta made for the park and subtract 2495, this will give you the last three digits to the longitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your at the place use the hint to find this orange waterproof container with a logbook and a few small things like coins and paperclips. Please reseal the container correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
I would ask that you take the all of the container off, not just the cap; This is to keep the log and other things getting lost.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">My first multi- cache and a fun one two.  No math skills needed, just an aposable thumb. There is two stages and a final. Fun for kids just keep an eye on them for cars and skateboarders. I please beg of you to return the keys to the original containers. Not recomended at night because the homeless may make a home in these parks.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Stage 1: Beware of muggles when looking, this size is a micro-ish and farely camoed. &lt;br /&gt;
It has a key that you'll need for the final that you HAVE TO &lt;strong&gt;BRING BACK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stage 2: A camoflauged sunglasses case that again is slightly micro. Very high muggle rate and you may have to get on your knees. Another key that may come in handy just please return to the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final: Regular plastic box with A LOT of goodies log book. No keys necesarry. Rehide well&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache was placed in memory of the 2 other caches that are know MIA. I chose this spot because of the wind shadow cast by the island, the current can be treacherous so be sure to plan how to get back correctly without getting blown down the river. Securely tied on to a live tree in a high tech waterproof box so there is a slim chance of the box going away but there could be over growth. YOU NEED WATERCRAFT! 

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few years ago my older brother took my dad's dingy and just beached the boat so 30 minutes later while he was disturbing the wildlife the boat had floated away and he swam back to the shore while the boat was long gone. My dad retrieved the boat in the Dalles the next day and payed for knot tying classes for my brother. Sorry I went on and on but I just want to remind you to tie your boat! I don't recommend swimming here because of the current could take you away along with getting hit by windsurfers in the water. Water can have drop offs that go from 3 feet to 40 feet within an inch, so be careful. Bushwhacking will happen but while your at the spot for the container knock some of the thorns out of the way. You will have to get on your knees so be prepared. Be sure to reseal the container well.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cache is a larger ammo can in the trees, make sure and cover it up. You can park within 70' feet of the cache, but you will have to do some easy climbing up a rock to a great view point. The Cache is Located 6 miles up a gravel/dirt road, a half mile before the Summit Lake Trail Head Parking lot. Although it is possible to drive a passenger car up this road, it's not recommended. Drive your car on unimproved roads at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">After visiting &quot;On the Way to Oz&quot; I felt inspired to put a cache out in an area that really did not have many caches. Besides, isn't the Emerald City worthy of more than one cache! So, after surveying some nice spots along a very wide trail (which is actually a gated dirt road), a new cache was born.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get to this cache head on out on I-90 past the pass. Take the Cabin Creek exit and go to the north side of the freeway along a dirt road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located about 30 feet off of the established road/trail. Its located in some prime cross country skiing area. I would advise against this doing this during the winter as the cache will likely be buried by several feet of snow. If you decide to go for this during the winter, you are on your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please rehide the cache IN THE EXACT SPOT you found this. Also be warned, there are muggles who routinely walk the trails. After placing the cache, we ran into an elderly couple who stated that the frequently walk the trails in the area several times a week and love to cross country ski in the area in the winter. With this in mind, please keep your stealth guard up!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache it REAL!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to KC Geo Clue! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this cache series you will find extra large bison caches that will give you clues to find the final puzzle cache. If you have ever played the game Clue, you shouldn't have any problem with this cache series. Thanks to California Cacher &quot;Winkster&quot; for allowing me to steal heavily from his idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King County will serve as the &quot;board&quot; for this game. There will be a series of 6 caches representing each of the Clue suspects spread throughout King County as well as the final puzzle cache. You, are the star Medina Police Detective. You have been summoned to a large mansion on the Medina waterfront  to investigate the death of Mr. Boddy, a local multi-millionaire who suddenly and tragically passed away during a dinner party. Your job as the detective will be to &quot;investigate&quot; each of the &quot;suspects&quot; (caches) when you visit the cache and log the find. Inside each suspect cache you will find information that will help you narrow down who done it, with what weapon and in what room the evil act took place. Each cache will have a laminated card with SWR numbers as well as a separate three digit number. These SWR numbers correspond to the numbers on the Detective Note Pad that is attached to each cache. The &quot;S&quot; numbers are the suspects, numbers S1 - S6 which represent the all of the game characters. On the Detective Note Pad, Ms. Scarlet, for instance is S1. The &quot;W&quot; numbers will be for the weapons, W1 - W6. The knife is W1 on the Detective Note Pad. The &quot;R&quot; numbers are the rooms, R1 - R9. The Hall is R9 on the note pad.  During your &quot;investigation&quot; of the &quot;suspect&quot;, you will want to write done the SWR and three digit numbers you find in each cache on your detective note pad there by eliminating the suspects, weapons and rooms. Please note that you will need ALL THE NUMBERS on the laminated card to find the final puzzle cache! Also, PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE LAMINATED CARD THAT HAS THE SWR NUMBER PRINTED ON IT! The final puzzle cache will give you instructions as to what to do with the information you obtained from each suspect (cache).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Col. Mustard  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you arrive to interrogate Col. Mustard, you notice that he is wearing a dark gold colored jacket. In your discussions with Col. Mustard, you find that Col. Mustard is a war hero and severed in a couple of wars. Col. Mustard, now a retired military veteran and avid gun collector. He met Mr. Boddy at a gun show and found that he and Mr. Boddy had similar tastes as gun collecting goes. He found out that Mr. Boddy has a highly coveted collection of civil war Colts that the good Colonel would love to have as his own. The Colonel's confidence oozes as you would expect from any military veteran and its not too far fetched to see the good Colonel using the revolver on Mr. Boddy to obtain the coveted Colt collection!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Col. Mustard, using military tactics of cover and concealment, is located......next to a very large rock and an aptly colored gate. The colonel claims theres a lot of buzzing nearby!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy sleuthing!&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This area really needed another cache, so I dropped a fairly
easy one.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When you approach GZ you will understand why I named it Off
Ramp.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Many awesome trails and caches on Snoqualmie.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When hiking back down we smelled smoke, and not from a
campsite. We&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;soon found the smoldering ground that soon would have gotten
out of hand.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We managed to get it out and then hiked down to attain cell
coverage and&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;called DNR and Forestry to let them know and give them saved
Lat/Long.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please be careful, it doesnt take much to start a
fire.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A cache to commemorate Mc3cats, Welljointed, Terrible Ts and Tobias and Petronella's (AKA Team LPH) triumphant hike up to GCD on 9/12/10.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the &quot;short description&quot; you can guess that this little hide is on the Mt. Margaret trail on the way to GCD. There is a bit of a story about this cache which I will try to keep it brief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name Team LPH was a name we jokingly and collectively gave ourselves which stands not for &quot;Lamp Post Hide&quot; but rather Lame, Pathetic and Hopeless. We were discussing putting a cache along this trail when Welljointed thought it would be a fun idea to &quot;strewn caches every tenth of a mile&quot; turning this beautiful trail into a cache highway. I (Mc3cats) indicated that this was a bad idea as certain local cachers would not take too kindly to us doing that. WE laughed a bit and then I suggested that we put a cache out at the spot where we stopped for a breather and had a laugh about a cache highway. Hence the cache was born!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now for the cache. Its a small lock N lock container in proper &quot;clothing&quot; hidden in a spot where ones feet never need to leave the trail to find. This container has been beta tested by Welljointed and Terrible Ts as well as myself. Our coordinates from three different units came out almost identical. So, you will have as close to dead on coords without spending 30K for a high end GPS unit! You will see the beta testers signatures, but rest assured the betas are not and will not claim FTF. Speaking of FTFs, the prize consists of two &quot;Georges&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One quick note about parking. It is located 100 yards from the trailhead at the Mt. Margaret parking area. You will need either a National Forest Day Pass OR a Forest Pass Annual Pass. These can be obtained online at the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest website or at some local retailers like REI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From all of the members of Team LPH, enjoy the hike and good luck on the find!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to KC Geo Clue!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this cache series you will find extra large bison caches that will give you clues to find the final puzzle cache. If you have ever played the game Clue, you shouldn't have any problem with this cache series. Thanks to California Cacher &quot;Winkster&quot; for allowing me to steal heavily from his idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;King County will serve as the &quot;board&quot; for this game. There will be a series of 6 caches representing each of the Clue suspects spread throughout King County as well as the final puzzle cache. You, are the star Medina Police Detective. You have been summoned to a large mansion on the Medina waterfront  to investigate the death of Mr. Boddy, a local multi-millionaire who suddenly and tragically passed away during a dinner party. Your job as the detective will be to &quot;investigate&quot; each of the &quot;suspects&quot; (caches) when you visit the cache and log the find. Inside each suspect cache you will find information that will help you narrow down who done it, with what weapon and in what room the evil act took place. Each cache will have a laminated card with SWR numbers as well as a separate three digit number. These SWR numbers correspond to the numbers on the Detective Note Pad that is attached to each cache. The &quot;S&quot; numbers are the suspects, numbers S1 - S6 which represent the all of the game characters. On the Detective Note Pad, Ms. Scarlet, for instance is S1. The &quot;W&quot; numbers will be for the weapons, W1 - W6. The knife is W1 on the Detective Note Pad. The &quot;R&quot; numbers are the rooms, R1 - R9. The Hall is R9 on the note pad.  During your &quot;investigation&quot; of the &quot;suspect&quot;, you will want to write down the SWR and three digit numbers you find in each cache on your detective note pad there by eliminating the suspects, weapons and rooms. Please note that you will need ALL THE NUMBERS on the laminated card to find the final puzzle cache! Also, PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE LAMINATED CARD THAT HAS THE SWR NUMBER PRINTED ON IT! The final puzzle cache will give you instructions as to what to do with the information you obtained from each suspect (cache). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KC GEO CLUE - THE FINAL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THIS CACHE IS NOT LOCATED AT THE LISTED COORDINATES!  To find this cache, super geo sleuth, you will need to obtain all of the SWR numbers and three digit numbers from all 6 of the caches in this series (listed below). Then figure out who the murderer is, what weapon was used and in what room via the process of elimination using your detective note pad. If completed correctly, the note pad will show the final SWR numbers that you need. Once you have found all 6 suspect caches in the series:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add all of the three-digit numbers found in each of the suspect caches. Add the SWR numbers that you found as a process of elimination (SWR#s NOT FOUND IN ANY OF THE SUSPECT CACHES) to the sum of all of the 3-digit numbers you found in the suspect caches. Take that number and put it in the blank below to complete the web address which will reveal the final coordinates for this cache:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://s1185.photobucket.com/albums/z350/mc3cats/?action=view&amp;current=_____.jpg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: You will need a Northwest Forest Pass to park at the trailhead. Passes can be obtained at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest- Offices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HAPPY HUNTING!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just oustide the town of Snoqualmie, a historic
section of railway lies hidden. Once occupied by the Northern
Pacific Railway, these tracks were primarily used for transporting
lumber. Long since abandoned, these Ghost Rails are no longer in
service, but they are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Original cache [v1.0] was a .30 caliber ammo can, and went missing after only a couple days. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Second cache [v2.0] was considerably smaller and well camouflaged. It lasted a couple weeks before verification of being muggled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The current cache [v3.0] is in place and much more difficult to stumble across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You do not need to walk on the trestle to log this cache. Please place exactly as found. We want the next cacher to enjoy the find just as much as you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Logging Etiquette:&lt;/b&gt; Geocache hiders sometimes go through a
great deal of planning to place their caches. As a result, they'd
like to hear your feedback on whether you liked or disliked any
aspect of the hide, or if you feel that some cache maintenance is
required. Single word, acronym, or emoticon logs may be easier when
you have a lot of caches to log, but it doesn't tell the hider or
other finders anything about your adventure (or lack thereof) in
finding the cache. Please keep this in mind when entering your log.
Thank you, and Happy Caching!&lt;/p&gt;             </groundspeak:long_description>

-- Thumbnail History&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;www.HistoryLink.org&quot;&gt;HistoryLink.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Essay 391&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carnation (previously Tolt), a rural community along the
Snoqualmie River in&lt;br /&gt;
eastern King County, was founded early in the settlement of the
county. The town&lt;br /&gt;
was named after the world-famous Carnation Dairy, a dairy operation
that located&lt;br /&gt;
in Tolt in 1910.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Carnation has seen many changes over the years, not
the least of&lt;br /&gt;
which is its own name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confluence of the Tolt and Snoqualmie rivers has been the
main village&lt;br /&gt;
site for the Snoqualmie tribe for thousands of years. When white
settlers&lt;br /&gt;
arrived in the 1850s, the tribe greeted them in a friendly manner,
so much so&lt;br /&gt;
that in 1855, Chief Patkanim ceded the valley and tribal sites to
the United&lt;br /&gt;
States, opening the way for many homesteaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Deserter to Respected Citizen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first white settler, James Entwistle, had deserted the Union
Army at Fort&lt;br /&gt;
Steilacoom (located along Puget Sound, just south of present-day
Tacoma).&lt;br /&gt;
Entwistle took up 169 acres of land at the confluence of the
rivers, established&lt;br /&gt;
a trading post, and later became successful in hop farming. At the
time of his&lt;br /&gt;
death in 1902, he was very well respected in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after Entwistle arrived, many others came to the valley to
work the&lt;br /&gt;
land. Once the heavy underbrush was cleared in the valley, small
logging camps&lt;br /&gt;
began dotting the hillsides. Skid roads (roads made of greased
logs)were built&lt;br /&gt;
from the hills to the Snoqualmie River, and they were used to get
the logs down&lt;br /&gt;
to the water. With the valley cleared of brush, the fertile land
beneath was&lt;br /&gt;
ready for farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting to Tolt from Seattle was no easy task, but many
prospective farmers&lt;br /&gt;
did. W. A. Templeton, writing in 1953, remembered as a child taking
the ferry&lt;br /&gt;
across Lake Washington, riding pack horses to Redmond, and then
following 20&lt;br /&gt;
miles of trails to Tolt. Once at the river, goods were transported
across in a&lt;br /&gt;
large Indian canoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1879, enough families were living in Tolt to necessitate the
construction&lt;br /&gt;
of a school, which was no more than a log shack. In 1882,
schoolchildren moved&lt;br /&gt;
to a larger building. In 1895, a proper schoolhouse was built. This
grammar&lt;br /&gt;
school would serve Tolt children for almost 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the nineteenth century, the community of Tolt
mainly consisted&lt;br /&gt;
of cabins, the school, a church, and a social club. On May 6, 1902,
the town was&lt;br /&gt;
platted and soon more businesses and services became available to
the loggers,&lt;br /&gt;
farmers, and their families. On New Years' Eve, 1912, the town of
Tolt was&lt;br /&gt;
incorporated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Railroad Arrives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many events, but especially the introduction of railroads to the
area, led to&lt;br /&gt;
the incorporation of Tolt. The Great Northern Railroad had reached
Tolt from the&lt;br /&gt;
north in 1910. In 1911, the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul
Railroad built a&lt;br /&gt;
branch line from the South. The Milwaukee would later take over the
Great&lt;br /&gt;
Northern tracks up to Monroe, 15 miles to the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Milwaukee Railroad also built a railyard and depot in Tolt.
The railroad&lt;br /&gt;
introduced a fast and reliable method of transportation and
permitted Tolt to&lt;br /&gt;
become a boomtown. Before the railroad, logs and dairy goods had
been shipped on&lt;br /&gt;
the unreliable river, with its heavy flooding in the early spring
and low water&lt;br /&gt;
levels at the end of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home of Contented Cows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dairy farming was an economic staple for Tolt ever since the
brush had been&lt;br /&gt;
cleared, but Carnation Dairy put the town on the map. In 1910,
Elbridge Amos&lt;br /&gt;
Stuart cleared 350 acres of timber and brush and brought in a
purebred bull and&lt;br /&gt;
86 registered Holstein cows to form a research herd. Two years
later, he cleared&lt;br /&gt;
400 more acres, and today the farm rests on some 1,200 acres of
land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The valley became world-famous as the &quot;Home for Contented
Cows.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
One cow from the herd, nicknamed &quot;Possum Sweetheart,&quot; produced
more&lt;br /&gt;
than 37,000 pounds of milk in one year -- a world record. Over the
years many&lt;br /&gt;
famous people visited the farm to see her, including boxer Jack
Dempsey, who&lt;br /&gt;
tried his hand at milking her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's In a Name?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1917, the town of Tolt changed its name to Carnation, in
honor of the&lt;br /&gt;
farms. Unfortunately this did not sit well with the Indians and
early settlers.&lt;br /&gt;
The area had always been known as Tolt, even before white settlers
arrived. The&lt;br /&gt;
Snoqualmie name &quot;Tolthue&quot; (river of swift waters) had been in use
for&lt;br /&gt;
more than 10,000 years. To the Indians and pioneers, the use of the
name Tolt&lt;br /&gt;
over a few millennia of seemed like a good test of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few years, as resources dwindled, the logging
camps ceased&lt;br /&gt;
operations and the town's heyday was over. The swift changes that
brought the&lt;br /&gt;
community into being had reached a plateau, and since then the
local farms have&lt;br /&gt;
provided a steady economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confusion, Maybe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy over the name change continued, though, and in
1928 the town&lt;br /&gt;
decided to change the name back to Tolt. Unfortunately, the train
depot and the&lt;br /&gt;
post office names remained as Carnation, and for the next two
decades, confusion&lt;br /&gt;
reigned. Some maps showed the town as Tolt, some as Carnation. Some
maps showed&lt;br /&gt;
both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in 1951, the city changed its name back to Carnation to
end the&lt;br /&gt;
discrepancies once and for all. In the late 1990s, with an
estimated population&lt;br /&gt;
of about 1,500 (U.S. Census Bureau, 1996), the town was officially
named&lt;br /&gt;
Carnation, but there are those who still call it Tolt. Some things

Despite the hair pulling that ensued while looking for the nasty evil that was once here I have always loved this small area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have always enjoyed walking these paths, and have returned many times despite having found the caches here. Time to return the favor and add one of my own. Nothing hard here, just a straight forward ammo can in the woods in a typical PNW hide. Just keep in mind that the easiest path to a place most certainly is not a straight line off the main path.</groundspeak:long_description>

I found a large plastic poinsettia.  I was wondering if someone might have taken the ammo box and replaced it with the poinsettia.  Let me know.  Thanks.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Three Billy Goats Gruff (Norwegian: De tre bukkene Bruse) is a Norwegian fairy tale.[1] The fairy tale was collected by Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe in their Norske Folkeeventyr, first published around 1919.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first version of the story in English appeared in 1859, in George Webbe Dasent's translation of some of the Norske Folkeeventyr, published as Popular Tales from the Norse.[3]&lt;br/&gt;A version of the story written and performed by Frank Luther was often played on the BBC radio programme Children's Favourites in the 1950s and early 1960s.[4]&lt;br/&gt;The story was adapted by Gwen Edwards into a popular children's musical at Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, in the summer of 2007. It was called Billy, Goat, Gruff: The Musical.[5] A chamber music setting for string quintet and narrator was composed by James Scott Balentine for the Cactus Pear Music Festival Kinderkonzerts, with the text adapted by Stephanie Sant’Ambrogio, published by Guildhian Music.&lt;br/&gt;In 2008, the BBC created a modern adaptation for its Fairy Tales season. In this, the story was given a twist in that the troll was presented as a tragic, cruelly maligned victim:&lt;br/&gt;The troll character is dirty and smelly and everybody is frightened of him, and I think that heightens the pathos of the ending, because it’s a witch hunt, without any evidence.&lt;br/&gt;—Mathew Horne, Daily Telegraph[6]&lt;br/&gt;Neil Gaiman adapted the story for Snow White, Blood Red, an anthology of children's fairy tales retold for adults. In Gaiman's version (entitled &quot;Troll Bridge&quot;), the troll approaches a young boy who has crossed his bridge and demands to &quot;eat his life.&quot; The boy eventually persuades the troll to wait until he has lived a little more, after which he will return to the bridge. The goats in this adaptation are represented by the protagonist as a child, a teenager and finally a middle-aged man. The story was nominated for a 1994 World Fantasy Award.[7]&lt;br/&gt;In the Norwegian film The Troll Hunter, the titular character attempts to bait a troll by placing three goats on a bridge. </groundspeak:long_description>

Lake Bosworth covers 105 surface acres with it's deepest point at
79 feet. There is a nice Dept. of Fish &amp; Wildlife boatramp
&amp; fisherman's access at the north end of the lake. There are a
few nice spots to throw in a fishing line from shore there too. The
fish inhabiting the lake are rainbow, cutthroat trout and bass. No
combustion engines are allowed on the lake - so leave yours at
home. 
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a standard ammo can. Please take the time to
re-hide it well. The area is only open during daylight hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO NOT HUNT FOR THIS AT NIGHT!!&lt;/b&gt; - the area cab be extremely
treacherous in low light and you will need light and good footing to prevent
serious injury to yourself. I wouldn't recommend taking the kids
out of the car for this one. Have fun &amp; good hunting.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

CCC Camp opens on Bacon Creek in May 1933. &lt;br /&gt;
In May 1933, Camp Skagit, F-13, opens on Bacon Creek in Skagit
County six weeks after Congress passes the Emergency Conservation
Work Act. The Act creates the program later called the Civilian
Conservation Corps (CCC). The CCC was a part of President Franklin
D. Roosevelt's vision of putting the nation back to work. Young men
aged 18-25 could earn $30.00 a month, $25.00 of which went back to
their families. While providing employment and housing for men out
of work, the &quot;3 C’s&quot; created a lasting legacy of beautiful parks,
buildings, trails, bridges, and fire lookouts. &lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just before the bridge that crosses Bacon creek you will find a
spot to pull over.  You aren't far from the cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">If you have ever owned a boat which required backing the trailer down a ramp in order to launch, then you will appreciate the fun it can be to sit near a boat launch and watch the antics of less experienced drivers trying to back down a boat ramp. One of my favorites is a boat launch near Campbell River on Vancouver Island, it, and others have provided hours of entertainment, at least for us viewing. For those launching it is an entirely different matter as you watch the &quot;guide&quot; waving their arms, pointing first this way, then that way, and generally making hand motions that obviously the driver does not understand. I am sure the beginnings of a vacation are often started on a bad note as the attempts to launch the boat are made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So take a while and just sit and watch, you will see an interesting variety of launching techniques employed here. I would caution you not to offer to help when you see things obviously going wrong, and don't get caught laughing or logging this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

This one belongs to my 5 year old and she named it The Chick Cache because she misses our pet chickens.  These caches are a way for my husband to combine our hobbies.. Geocaching, history and the KVR!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is just off the trail.  It is well hidden.  The trail is level with a few muddy areas.  Strollers should be ok, but wheelchairs might have trouble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We spent the long weekend in Hope exploring and barely spent any time in our hotel room thanks to all the wonderful trails.  Even our 3 girls trecked along with us with hardly any complaining. :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully the GPS isn't too far off, but it was a little jumpy.  Took 3 readings and found the midpoint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Catchers in the Wry (and geopoodle) for the FTF!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK2EP24 - GC2EP24 Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 49° 22.284 W 121° 24.384&lt;br/&gt;Parking for The Chick Cache</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Welcome to Hope, BC!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope is strategically located at the junction of Hwy 1, 3, 5 and
7 at the confluence of the Fraser and Coquihalla Rivers where the
Fraser Valley and Fraser Canyon meet. The area is thus blessed with
easily accessible mountainous terrain as well as lakes and rivers
that offer outdoor activites that range from camping, hiking,
fishing, golf, river rafting, soaring and mountain biking to
boating, gold-panning, rockhounding and winter sports (Nordic and
downhill skiing, snowboarding and snowshoeing in nearby Manning
Park).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors to the area will also enjoy attractions that include
the large downtown wood sculptures that make Hope the Chainsaw
Carving Capital; the Coquihalla Canyon Provincial Park (featuring
the spactacular Othello-Quintette Tunnels of the abandoned Kettle
Valley Railway); the Hope slide; various museums/art galleries; and
Hell's Gate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;





&lt;h3&gt;Hope Visitor Centre &amp; Museum Complex&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visitor centre is your one stop shop for everything Hope.
Their professionally trained visitor information counselors can
help you with anything from local activities, attractions and
accommodations to highway routes, hiking trails and anything else
that might interest you about Hope. You'll also find souvenirs, a
&quot;First Blood&quot; Rambo display, postcards, local made gifts and
more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hope Museum shows the history, culture and heritage of Hope.
Many Exhibits including First Nations culture, early Fort Hope, the
Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, the Kettle Valley Railway, pioneer life,
logging, and mining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;





&lt;h3&gt;The Geocache&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a 2 stage multi-cache. The posted coordinates will bring
you to Stage 1 (a small sized container). Once you find that, there
are instructions for finding the Final (a regular sized
container).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note that this geocache is only
available during the regular visitor centre hours of operation
shown below. You cannot log a find on this cache if you visit
outside of these hours.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Cariboo Wagon Road&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Built from 1861 to 1863, the CWR was the first road capable of
making freight economical to transport to the interior of British
Columbia from the coast. A distribution point was needed, and
Lytton's location made it a natural choice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Freight was moved by large, heavy wagons. Both oxen and horse teams
were used to pull the wagons, and road houses were built at regular
intervals to allow team changes for faster travel and also for
overnight stays.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a major stopping point and a freight distribution center, Lytton
boomed during the wagon days.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Take some time to walk and reflect on the strength and ruggedness
of the individuals who made their way along this historic
provincial wagon road.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is placed, a few hundred feet off the trail where you can
view the railway, river and mountains.  And in the stillness

&lt;p&gt;BC Parks is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. The
first BC Park was Strathcona Park on Vancouver Island which was
officially created on March 1, 1911.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the parks system in British Columbia is one of our
greatest resources. Currently 14.26% (13.5 million hectares) of
British Columbia's land base is protected. There are more than 340
campgrounds, 6000 km of hiking trails, 118 boat launches and 263
day-use areas in B.C.'s provincial park system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BC Parks and the BC Geocaching Association are partnered along
with the Year of Science to invite you to explore BC Parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of 100 caches placed in parks throughout BC. Each
cache will have a unique trackable geocoin available for the first
3 finders. There are also BC Parks trade items, BC Geocaching
Association buttons, and Year of Science pins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a maximum of one coin per Geocaching account. Please
trade fairly for all items in the cache. If you have a coin from
another cache, please leave it for another cacher - you would want
them to do the same for you.&lt;/p&gt;

Purden Lake Provincial Park&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestled in the rolling mountains east of Prince George, Purden
Lake Provincial Park, on the north shore of Purden Lake, is
dominated by the Cariboo Mountains to the south and the McGregor
range of the Rockies to the north. Densely forested upland with
open areas near the lakefront provide pleasant surroundings for a
shoreline stroll, swimming or angling for the lake's resident
rainbow trout.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;There are activities going on in BC Parks all year to celebrate
this wonderful anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2011 is also the Year of Science in BC.&lt;br /&gt;
There are events and a collection of interesting stories about
people who chose Science.&lt;/p&gt;
Here is the list of all the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/bookmarks/view.aspx?guid=ed6ac827-f22b-401a-8f87-e65ef1560a9e&quot;&gt;
