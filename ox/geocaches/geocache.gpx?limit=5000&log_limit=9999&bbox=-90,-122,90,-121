I thought we'd follow them, and we ended up in a pretty cool area, able to check out the nearby farm (not to mention all the cows!) , and we had a good view out onto a slice of the valley. &lt;br/&gt;On the way back, I scouted out a spot for a cache, and found a great hiding place! Went back today with a container, and alas... too big for my great hiding place... so it's in an OK hiding place ;-&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF prize is an unregistered TB tag.

This inspired me to place a&lt;br/&gt;cache near the New Gilroy Library. New being relative, as the&lt;br/&gt;library moved into this building in the late 60's. I didn't place&lt;br/&gt;the cache on the grounds however, because the new library is soon&lt;br/&gt;to be demolished and rebuilt (see the drawing above)... perhaps&lt;br/&gt;you'll see some of this when you are searching for this cache. You&lt;br/&gt;can read a bit about the new library project here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Library Project PDF. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to being near the library, the cache is also near the&lt;br/&gt;new Gilroy Police Station (looks like a fortress not a station!),&lt;br/&gt;the Gilroy Senior Community Center (check out their gift shop) as&lt;br/&gt;well as the back of the Gilroy City Hall and administrative&lt;br/&gt;offices.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is near the parking lot for our Veterinarian. 

We had an awesome dog a few years ago (pre-GeoRetrievers), named Sienna.  She was half Mastiff and half German Shepherd. We almost called her Blue, because her parent's owners used a different color of nail polish on the top of their heads to tell the puppies apart, and Sienna's color was blue! When we got her at 8 weeks old, she fit in my two cupped hands.  She eventually grew into a 130 pound dog! 

She was an avid frisbee and tennis ball catcher/chaser (she didn't actually like to give it back though). She was a really great companion and protector.  Assuming you were human, she'd love you, especially little kids (but it WAS pretty common people would cross the street if they saw us coming on a walk!). 

However, if you were a small animal (cat, &quot;rat dog&quot;, or whatever) you were fair game, which cost us a few vet bills for other peoples pets :-(.  We learned to keep her on-leash! 

Unfortunately, at about age 6, she developed bone cancer, and after seeing her in a lot of pain, and the options (amputation, radio/chemo therapy) weren't really too promising, after some really tough decision making,  we decided we had to let her go.

I think our awesome vets at this location were nearly as upset about this as we were, and they made this as easy as possible.

I'm sorry to get so &quot;verklempt&quot; in this cache description, but we still miss her, even a few years later!

So, this cache has been placed in her honor. She really enjoyed her visits to her vets (they really liked her, and of course there were the ever present treats), and we really appreciate all the time and effort they put into trying to cure her.

Our thanks to them!!!

As for the cache, I'm trying to beef up the caches along one of the main routes through Gilroy, and I haven't put out one like this yet, so here goes! I gave this a 1.5 difficulty because it is a nano, but I don't think you will have any problems finding it! I hope it lasts!

FTF has their choice of the swag I stocked it with, no trade needed.

There are some other caches up and down the path from this one, and the views are great, so if you haven't gotten them yet, take a hike! The wildflowers are great right now! If you have a dog or dogs, bring them! This is the GeoRetrievers favorite spot for a walk!

Some caches just stick in your head for any number of reasons. Sometimes it's good, and other times not so good. This one is a reminder of how good life can be when you spend part of your days off to become one with the caches. If you plan to retrieve this cache come well prepared. Believe difficulty rating is correct. If you've picked up on my hints you'll probably find it quickly. Even if you've done the hide that inspired this one you might find too many choices of location.</groundspeak:long_description>

Geokashers has to be the king of the Morgan Hill FTF hounds with well over 500 FTFs.

Then there's the newest member of the Morgan Hill FTF club with his first FTF yesterday, Bricon.

The star in the center of the FTF pack is the glorious Seek2FindMe that I've had the pleasure to run into on the occasional FTF hunt.  She's also the star of the pajama-clad police-enhanced FTF hunt (GC228VW), but that's another story ;-)  

I'm also somewhere in the middle, although I have certainly been known to put in a good effort when an FTF opportunity presents itself. 

So I dedicate this cache to those who enjoy the extra adrenaline rush of finding a fresh, clean logsheet.

The Sinaloa Restaurant was a landmark of Morgan Hill's Madrone region.  It was a great loss when it burned down in June 2002.

Efforts to rebuild on this location were abandoned in August 2003 when a beloved member of the Pena family, Rosalie, was killed just northwest of this site in a tragic auto accident.  There is a monument on the west side of Monterey just north of here if you would like to pay your respects.

Sinaloa Restaurant eventually reopened in a new downtown location where they still serve the best Mexican food around.  

The cache is a sign only micro.  
No need to go to the other side of fence.

There is close by parking.
It is close to a major road, so be careful.

Since there is a clear view of the sky here, there's no big power lines overhead and there's nothing around here except the normal strip mall stores, I've always wondered why my satellite radio doesn't work on this road.

Maybe the electronics store here sells satellite Jammers??

If you have satellite radio, please include in your logs whether or not you lost satellite radio reception driving up to GZ.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">If you have ever noticed the big anchor while driving down Monterey Highway, here it the story behind it.

In the mid 1800's, Alviso was the major shipping port for the San Francisco Bay, especially for agricultural cargo from the fertile Santa Clara Valley.  Ships would even travel up some of local rivers to pick up their shipments.  You can still see the remains of the town of Drawbridge near Alviso that allowed ships to travel up the rivers while still providing for the land routes that eventually made the port of Alviso obsolete.

Ships even used to travel up the Coyote River, long before Anderson Dam, highway bridges, and rerouting of the river bed created all the silt that made the river impassable.

The last ship to travel up the Coyote River to the town of Madrone to pick up a load of cherries was the SS Boole.  Unfortunately the river was already nearly impassable and after loading the cherries onto the ship it could no longer make it back down the river.  It had to unload all non-essential supplies, including one of its anchors, to make the trip back to Alviso.

That's the anchor you still see on the Monterey Highway at the northern end of Madrone (now part of Morgan Hill).

So the next time you see the Boole's anchor, remember this Boole Ship story.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">An RV on the way to this RV park was struck by a Caltrain going over 70 MPH just south of here at Palm Avenue.

The elderly driver ignored the RV park recommended directions to take 101 to Cochrane to Monterey.  Instead he got hung up when he tried to drive a long and low RV over the high railroad tracks at Palm and Monterey. 

From the Morgan Hill Times:

Nov 25, 2009

Into every motorist's life, there comes a moment when the paved road turns unexpectedly to dirt, streetlights give way to starlight, and regardless of where you thought you were going, where you have arrived is the middle of nowhere.

For Roger Scott, that moment came as darkness fell Wednesday, as he was nosing his 28-foot Winnebago over a railroad crossing on Palm Avenue in Morgan Hill, not far from the Coyote Creek Golf Club. The only direction that made sense to Scott at the time was to go back the way he came, but because he was towing a 15-foot SUV, backing up was not an option.

Then Scott, 88, and Betty Nelson, his 81-year-old girlfriend, heard metal grinding on metal and felt their RV suddenly shudder to a stop. Scott stood on the tracks trying to see what had beached his vehicle. &quot;That's when I saw the headlight of a train coming,&quot; he said.

Nelson had dialed 911 from the passenger's seat of the RV while Scott poked around outside, but she spent several minutes explaining how they had arrived at their current predicament. At least five minutes went by before Nelson mentioned she was marooned on train tracks in a 43-foot metal barricade.

&quot;The 911 lady kept saying 'What's the emergency?' &quot; Scott explained later. &quot;That went on for a little while. Finally, she said, 'Get out of the motor home and get way away from the tracks.' &quot;

Scott retreated from the tracks, but Nelson was not inclined to abandon ship so easily and stood on the tracks talking to a man who had stopped to see if anything was wrong. 
&quot;I kept yelling at her to get off the tracks and get back with me,&quot; Scott said. &quot;And she finally did.&quot;

By that time, the engineer of Caltrain's No. 270 train — which had pulled out of San Jose's Diridon Station at 6:16 p.m., bound for Gilroy — was frantically blowing the horn from the locomotive of the million-pound train. The maximum speed the train is allowed to travel on that portion of the old Union Pacific tracks is 79 mph, and it was probably doing close to that as it plowed into the Winnebago.

&quot;As I heard the thing tooting and coming down the road, I realized it was going to be a huge wreck,&quot; Nelson said. &quot;I thought, 'I don't need to see this.' I was holding onto Roger looking the other way when it hit.&quot;

The collision sounded like a bomb detonating and brought farmworkers running from nearby fields. &quot;It was like something you'd see in the movies,&quot; Scott said. The couple was standing 150 yards clear of the explosion and were not struck by flying debris.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">If you'll look to the northwest, you'll see a small silver/white building.  This it where Caltrain hit a Coca-cola semi-truck.

In August 1999, a Coca-cola truck got caught on the rise where Richmond Avenue used to go over the train tracks.  The truck driver couldn't move his vehicle, and he was unable to call in time to stop the high-speed Caltrain approaching.  The train was &quot;backing up&quot; on the morning run, so the passenger car struck the truck first.  37 people were injured in what one passenger described as a tidal wave of Coke.

You're looking for a small silver bison tube.  Do not go inside the fence or enter the RV park.  Not recommended at night since flashlights could disturb local residents.

I assume Mr. Roadshow also wouldn't appreciate speeding down the road on an FTF run while you're punching in the coordinates on your GPSr.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache replaces the Mr. Roadshow and Bailey Avenue cache which used to be at this spot.  It was a fairly evil cache that was camoed very well by ample plant growth and shadows.

Then Caltrans came by and cut away, then poisoned, all the plant life here.  It must have been a very effective poison since it's a year later and absolutely nothing is growing on the shoulder or on the embankment.   

It reminds me of a very toxic chemical called Agent Orange that the U.S. used in Viet Nam during the war to kill the jungle growth and provide clear fields of view.  I served in the Viet Nam war and from where I was stationed you couldn't see a living bush or tree for miles.  Of course, that may have been because I  was stationed on the USS Enterprise out in the South China Sea.

The  USS Enterprise (CVN-65) is the only warship from the Viet Nam war still on active duty.  The Big E is the oldest ship still serving on active duty and the second oldest ship still commissioned in the U.S. Navy after the wooden hulled USS Constituion.

Since the original cache was left exposed and I wanted to get it off the ground and away from whatever chemical they used, I've replaced it in a more traditional hide style.

If you take the offramp from southbound Monterey, you can park right next to the cache.

If you're on northbound Monterey, you're going to have to park in Coyote and walk.

It's not anywhere near the train tracks, so don't try to get near them.

But let me point out that this is (obviously) my house. If you are unsure which house, look for the trebuchet on the driveway or the &quot;Geo Car&quot; Prius. The neighbors are quite used to people wandering in my yard, and may stare, just wave and smile. Stealth is NOT required or even recommended. It used to have a sign pointing to it, but the snails ate it.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Park off of Samaritan Drive. Not a Micro, nor is it a Nano. Depending on the time of the day and day of the week there could be loads of muggles about.

Carolyn Norris Park named for longtime San Jose neighborhood activist.
Longtime Cambrian activist Carolyn Norris will be posthumously acknowledged on May 14 when a new public park will be named for her on Samaritan Drive.
Carolyn Norris Park spans 1.3 acres at 2133 Samaritan Drive, and it has a large lawn, two children's play structures and a gazebo with game tables. Vice Mayor Judy Chirco spoke about Norris' life at the park's opening ceremony.
&quot;This is a park that would make Carolyn proud. It is for her community and children—two interests that were near and dear to Carolyn's heart,&quot; Chirco said in a statement.
Norris was involved in traffic calming efforts for years, and she was responsible for many road safety improvements in the Cambrian area. During the Highway 85 project, she also kept close tabs on the installation of its soundwalls and landscaping, a stone's throw from the park.
Norris also advocated to save the Camden Community Center when it was threatened by development.
A dedicated maker of jams and jellies with her husband, Norris won blue ribbons at Santa Clara County and California State fairs for her recipes. Norris died in 2006 of a brain aneurysm.
Dennis Norris, her husband, said his wife would be &quot;embarrassed but very happy&quot; with a public park named in her honor.
&quot;Her fingerprints are on a number of things in the Cambrian area and beyond,&quot; Dennis Norris said in a statement.
The event on May 14 will include a ceremony celebrating
her life, and it will have light refreshments, free face painting and balloon animals for children.
Just down the road from Good Samaritan Hospital, the triangular park is between a new SummerHill Homes development and Highway 85, but it is built on a hill above the highway between Union and Clydelle avenues.
City officials held two meetings with neighbors to gather input on what amenities neighbors wanted in the park, and planners said they hope the shaded tables for chess and checkers will draw passersby. </groundspeak:long_description>

Found a scuffed up baseball, several key lock boxes, and an empty water bottle dangling from a tree. We didn't know what we were looking for, so we looked for anything... Looked in cones, over &amp; under tables, in &amp; out of trash cans, &amp; in &amp; around the trees, shrubs,&amp; play structures. It is truly a cute park, however, and if you have kids, it's worth the trip... But I believe this cache must have been found by muggles...

Be sure to stop and read the historical marker near the cache which states:

&quot;FIRST SITE OF EL PUEBLO DE SAN JOSE DE GUADALUPE
Within a year after the opening of the first overland route from Mexico to Alta California, Governor Felipe de Neve authorized the establishment of the first civil settlement in the state on lands including and surrounding the present Civic Center.  Lieutenant Jose Joaquin Moraga, with 14 settlers and their families arrived in the Santa Clara Valley to found El Pueblo de San Jose de Guadalupe on November 29, 1777.&quot;

When California became a state in 1850, San Jose served as its first capital.  San Jose is the 3d largest city in California, the 10th largest city in the US and is the county seat for the County of Santa Clara.

Busy area on weekdays, so watch for muggles. </groundspeak:long_description>

As you may recall from Seinfeld, Festivus for the rest of us is celebrated on December 23 around a silver pole.  

When this silver pole was installed last year, I assumed it would be another cell tower.  But since the expected antenna never got installed, the only other explanation is that this must be a Festivus Pole. 

See you all here next December 23rd!

I come to the Credit Union here periodically and noticed a spot that's crying out for a cache.  

There are lots of feral cats near the north parking lot.  I was here one evening and saw a lady feeding them. 

You're looking for a Black Nano on this White Road cache.  This is an area with lots of cameras and muggles, but cache is in a spot that's camera free and above the eyes of most muggles.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I've placed this cache on the corner of Lafayette and Central Expressway because a seemingly never ending construction project on this corner led to a bet between me and Mr. Roadshow on when this construction would end.  I won the bet and Mr. Roadshow filled up my car with gas.

This is a busy corner, so don't try parking on the street.  

Cache is a small container which can hold small trade items.  No need to unscrew or unbolt anything.  Cache is on a public walkway.

Gary Richards (Mr. Roadshow) is my favorite columnist in the San Jose Mercury News.  He wrote this article published in the July 9, 2006 San Jose Mercury News about our bet (copied with permission):

This Roadshow stunt hurt -- both pride and wallet.

I forked over $31.43 at a Shell station on Bernal Road on Friday, filling up Arlen Stone's thirsty silver Mazda.

By more than a 5-1 ratio, readers decided I lost my bet with Stone on when construction would end at Central Expressway and Lafayette Street, one of those roadway projects that is small in scale but seems to take forever to complete.

I wrote a few weeks ago that work would be finished July 4. My prediction drew this challenge from Stone, a quality assurance engineer who commutes from Morgan Hill to this Santa Clara intersection each day:

''I'm so confident it won't be done by then that I'm willing to bet big bucks -- a tank of gas -- that work isn't done by July 4.''

Pshaw. I know roads. The new lanes were almost in, most of the wiring was completed, paving was about to begin. Finish by July 4? Easy money.  You've got a bet, Arlen. Prepare to fill up the guzzlin' Richards minivan.

Oh, a few minor details remained. Crews had yet to install the final lane markers. Manhole covers needed to be fitted. Signals needed testing. Sidewalks weren't in.  

Ticky, tacky. Nothing to it.  County deputy roads director Dan Collen began sending constant updates. He sounded so hopeful.

Then, an ominous e-mail two weeks ago: Striping is going slowly. If it's not completed, Collen suggested, ''You might want to call it a draw.''

A draw? No way. If the lanes are open, as they were when July 4 rolled around, then the project is complete -- striping or no striping. I decided to conduct a little poll. Readers, surely, would agree that I had won.

I was calling in my chits. Remember those potholes I've filled for you, readers? Remember the long red lights I've shortened and the murky rules of the road I've explained? Now it's time to help me.

It was ugly. Of 79 votes, 66 slapped me down.

''You must pay up, Roadman,'' said Del Barrett of Auburn, adding that ''anyone who is willing to believe that a government project will be completed on time or within budget deserved to lose.''

And . . .  ''Work is not done until it's done,'' said John Lebya of San Jose. ''Striping is part of the work. So I say you owe this chap a tank of gas. And why is it that if you win, he has to fill up your minivan? What happened to that Prius?''

The clincher? ''A Porta Potti is still set up'' at the intersection, said Bruce Lang of Sunnyvale. Yet another vote against Mr. Roadshow.

In desperation, I turned to Roadshow contacts like Sean Comey of AAA, Lauren Wonder of Caltrans, John Pilger with the city of Sunnyvale and Jim Helmer, head of San Jose's department of transportation. Maybe I could pad the final count.  Turncoats, all of 'em.

''Sorry on this one, Gary,'' Helmer said, so coldly. ''I vote for the reader.''  Even Collen chided me.  ''I tried to give you an out when I became concerned about the contractor meeting the schedule,'' Collen said. ''But nooooo. 'I want to win. I want to win.' ''

Help me, someone.  ''I say you win -- hands down!'' said Helen Wong of Los Altos. ''Temporary lane markers work, and that counts. I don't know why people can't get that.''

But there weren't enough Helens. So I marched out the door Friday morning, telling Mrs. Roadshow that I was about to spend our cash to fill up a stranger's car. ''The paper is paying for this, right?'' she said.  Well, dear, nope.

Stone proved to be a good guy. He could have run his gas tank to empty, but didn't. No surprise. After all, he grew up on an Iowa farm.

''You're the biggest celebrity I've met since I talked to Dustin Hoffman at a party in L.A.,'' he said, adding: ''As a fellow Iowan . . . I like you, despite your support of carpool lanes and hybrids.''

Stone began driving through the Central Expressway intersection in October and saw the torn-up islands, sidewalks and lanes, all at a time completion was promised for March. But what really got his attention is what he didn't see -- workers.  A subcontractor didn't show, causing a four-month delay. Fines could reach $20,000.  Heavy winter rains caused more trouble. The opening became July 4. Almost.

Stone smiled -- wouldn't you if someone filled up your gas tank? -- as I fumbled with the pump for $3.17 a gallon.

''Maybe,'' he mused, eyeing the $3.39 tag for premium, ''I should go with the Super V-6.''

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOISY DOG ALERT - There is an obnoxious dog in the yard NE of
GZ. If you walk close to the pool area and along the pool fence
until you're 20 feet from GZ, you'll hopefully avoid getting the
dog's attention. GZ is out of sight of the dog so if he doesn't see
you going there, he will hopefully stay quiet. Coords are pretty
good, so don't search too far east of GZ.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since Montague is an Expressway, do NOT park on Montague or
the connector ramps. I recommend parking at the Rivermark Shopping
Center on Agnew and walking over on the public sidewalk while
picking up a few of my other caches. Cache is reachable from the
sidewalk along Montague, so no need to do anything that will
require talking to Oracle security.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Depending on when you arrive, parking will range from plenty
(weekdays non-lunchtime) to non-existent (weekdays
lunchtime).&lt;br/&gt;
I recommend parking on the upper level.&lt;br/&gt;

they probably are).</groundspeak:long_description>

You have to sign the paper log to claim a find!!

BE SAFE!! - Use an appropriate tool - don't try climbing the pole!!

And PLEASE place cache back how you found it.

And:
-  Don't unscrew or unbolt anything
-  Don't open any electric or sprinkler control boxes
-  Don't go on the other side of the fence
-  Don't do anything dangerous

I think it's legal to park on Lafayette, but I'm not sure it's recommended since it's a busy road with fast traffic.

Be careful.

The track is built on top of a beautiful hill formerly known as the Santa Clara Landfill.

It's legal to park on Lafayette Street at the cache, but it's a busy road with lots of fast cars, so be careful.  The nearby driveway may be a safer alternative.

Turn on Notifications on geocaching.com and watch your email.  When a cache is published, you quickly download the coordinates into your GPSr, look at the map so you have an idea where you are going and rush out the door.  You then follow the GPSr directions down the main highway to a dirt road.  You drive down the dirt road for a mile, turn around and go back to the highway.  Then drive down the highway 100 yards to the correct dirt road, drive to the end of that dirt road, notice that your GPSr is blank, and go back home for fresh batteries.  On the way back to the correct dirt road, you stop for gas since your car is on E.  After you hike for two hours down a remote trail, you then wait an hour for the only other hikers within 5 miles to finish their rest break at Ground Zero.  Then you do a quick search and find the ammo box hidden inside a tree trunk.  You pull out the log sheet, see that nobody else has signed it, then wish you had brought the pen sitting at home on your dresser.

Why did the chicken cross the road?
To find a geocache!

But seriously folks,

I have spent a lot of time waiting at the metering light just west of this cache.  I think metering lights are mostly a nuisance.

Do not try to access from the freeway.  

There is no need to go on the other side of any fencing.

Cache is reachable from the bicycle trail that goes from Lafayette Street (closest parking) to First Street along the south side of the 237.  Easy access from either side of the Guadalupe River Trails.

In that spirit, I’ve placed a cache only reachable from the bicycle path paralleling the 237 freeway.  

This bike trail can be reached from Lafayette Street, First Street or from the Guadalupe River trails.  Coordinates are included for suggested parking on Lafayette for a little under half mile journey to the cache.

Be safe.  Don’t try to access from the freeway, don’t open the control panel box, and don’t stick hands or fingers inside the utility access hole on the pole.  There are spiders around, but there's no need to stick your fingers into anything dark or scary.

Although some girls prefer to Ca$he Up and get hold of some Nifty Ca$he.  And the girls my Mom warned me about that prefer Easy Ca$he and Fast Ca$he.

Cache container is a nano size container.  Tweezers would be helpful getting the log out.

Do NOT remove the bolts on the diamonds, or otherwise try to remove the diamonds.  These diamonds would not look good on a ring.

Thanks to Hogwild Stuff for providing the fun series that inspired this cache.  The location of this cache was discovered while trying to &quot;brute force&quot; find some Ca$hes before they were published.

If you're not into hill climbing, you can probably get away with parking at the summit.  

There are reports of wasps in the area, but keep your feet on the road and the hard surface path and you should be OK.

Cache is a large camoed micro hanging at the center of a bush near the road.  It should be an easy grab.</groundspeak:long_description>

The site is beautiful and I would have never gone there if it wasn't for this cache. I was distrubed by the amount of trash left in the area. I must say this is a good way to bring attention to sites that could use community service projects to clean up areas like this. I hope someone else has better luck finding this, or maybe with all of the restoration it's gone. It was fun seeing such a nice park like setting in the Fremont area.</groundspeak:text>

This was my partner (r3adyornot) and I's very first find and we thoroughly enjoyed searching around the area, it was located right next to a small brook and was really quite beautiful and actually a bit ominous at the same time because of the fact that there was a pile of broken-up tombstones scattered nearby. There were also other strange artifacts including broken bits of ceramic plates and old glass bottles, and some very out of place flowers growing nearby that we believe may be the descendants of flowers once planted by the graves of their deceased loved ones, but who knows. And oddly enough right as we were leaving two other cachers showed up searching for the same exact cache! What a coincidence! But they were too late since we were FTF in this new location. We left a few of our favorite toys and took a toy compass as a token of the beginning of our caching days!

Thanks Roach for replacing the cache, well done! =D</groundspeak:text>

Local neighborhood water way (that you do not need to enter), right off the sidewalk path. Nano Cache which may require a little searching to find.
Great walk around the neighborhood with the kids, dogs, etc. or cycling or park n' grab.
Easy street parking next to the cache. GPS coords should be good and have been averaged several times.

This is a local neighborhood park cache. It has a nice playground, tennis courts and plenty of walking paths on a greenway. 
You can park on the street and do a quick grab n' go.

It's a nano cache so please BYOP - re-camo when done.

Been meaning to do one of these hides for awhile. finally found a good spot for one. Early morning and night are the best times for this one for sure. I don't think this hide will last long, but we will see. Contains a few trinkets and a log book. Bring your own pen.

The FTF Geocasual confirmed my thoughts on this one. NOT recommended between 9:00 a.m. and 10:30 P.M. I wouldn't put any Trackables in this one as it may dissapear.

It's not on under or in or any way attached to the electical box, please stay away from it. I'm not really sure what this location is. I think it's some kind of sewage transfer point because there is an odd smell there. Don't worry it's not that bad and you won't be there that long. The reason I'm bringing you here is I think it's a great spot to Photograph your car for internet ad's. I've seen several people do this as I am driving by. They just park their car and shoot a picture with the nice rock wall backdrop. You can park your car within 10 feet of the cache. There is no need to go bushwacking . Please take care to put cache back for next cacher. </groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is located near a parking lot of a church. Approach stealthily. It is 497 feet above sea level, and is in an un-camo'd Altoids tin. Helping this cache by replacing logs, giving it shelter or camo, would be greatly appreciated, so come with some items to help the cache. The cache will supply you with the variable &quot;x&quot;. This variable will be used sometime later in a Mystery cache I'm working on (I'll tell you later once I've hidden the mystery cache). You can easily reach the cache from the asphalt or sidewalk, and it's fairly obvious to a regular geocacher. For some reason, my GPSr is acting strange, so if I have incorrect coords, please post the actual coords into your log and i will update this cache listing.</groundspeak:long_description>

NOTE: The cache is NOT located in a person's backyard or front yard, it is in the playground.
This is a playground near a nice and peaceful neighborhood. Beware of the muggles, there are plenty and this is a major &quot;hang-out&quot; for teenagers. Make sure to be stealthy when approaching cache. Cache is in concealed part of playground, so it's hard for nearby muggles to see you when you're near the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

My other two caches were both urban, so I decided to do an &quot;regular&quot; cache. Went up today to get the last of the Bishop Ranch Open Space caches I hadn't found. After my last one found a spot and dropped one of my own off. Should be easy to find pretty standard placement. Nice view from up here at night, probably isn't too bad during the day either. It's not to far from the path/road I was on. Please try to hide it as well or better than you found. Thanks.

This cache is pretty big, and extremely easy to find. It is found of a well-known trail, with many bikers and joggers going through. San Ramon is a fairly nice urban city, and this trail is also near a good school, Montevideo Elementary School. The container is a big chocolate macadamia container, originally holding a couple of lollipops, some hard candy, some sparkly pipe cleaners, etc.</groundspeak:long_description>

Happy Caching!

This cache is located in San Ramon's Central Park. They have the Art and Wind Festival here every year. The park has Tennis Courts, BB Courts, Baseball fields, a really nice playground area, and lots of other activities. This park and the Cache are both accesable via the Iron Horse Trail. At the time of this posting there were 2 other caches located in/near the park. So if you haven't been here before you could make it a three-for-one.

Lots of parking. I didn't notice any posted hours. This park is quite busy during the day so evenings and early mornings are probably your best bet to avoid the muggles. And there will be muggles all around this cache depending on when you arrive.

The container is small and can hold VERY SMALL trade Items.
Original contents:

1.)Log
2.)Golf Pencil
3.) 5 Miniature Star Wars Characters.

Have fun.

Left this ammo can where I parked to go for my second attempt at County Line GCMKZ8. The gate that lets you into the trail system is about 275 ft. west of the cache. There are some no parking signs, but I didn't see any in the Cul-de-sac where I parked. Cache is about 75 feet from the street fairly obvious placement. Lots of tree cover, by GPSr was giving me 26ft. accuracy. There are two other Caches in the area also, Relay for life GCRK1V and Is Anybody Home? GCMKZ4. Gate to trails is at N 37 46.053 W 121 59.901. I'm thinking the neighbors may get curious about this cache since it's a dead end and there really is no reason to be there. PLEASE BE AWARE THERE HAVE BEEN MANY REPORTS OF POISON OAK IN THE AREA.

Cache Contents: Log, pen, sampler music CD, '06 mickey antennae ball, iGuy, and various McToys.

As you come, you'll see tons of names and letters etched into the rocks with knives. The cache is a 35mm film canister. If you're going for this d5 t5 cache, look at these requirements:
1. Must be fit enough to climb
2. Must be able to walk a couple miles or so
3. Bring tools in case (that's kind of a clue)
4. Hiking boots

The cache location is a nice place to rest, and many mini muggles like to try and climb up into there and play a bit. In fact, you should bring your children. The cache location is pretty hard to get in if you're tall, so use your children to get in there. Try camping at this place, there are plenty of geocaches around. If you still can't find the cache, then consider that it's +1709ft above sea level.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">100 yards east of this location--in the trees next to the onramp to southbound 99--sits one of the most unappreciated and important sites in California’s colorful history.

In early 1846--weary of an all-out invasion from the east--the Mexican government had ordered all immigrants who had lived in California for less than a year to leave the territory. Incensed by this decree, and emboldened by the presence of John C Fremont and a US military force of 60 at the north end of the valley, thirteen local settlers decided to take matters into their own hands. 

In the dawn of June 10th, 1846, those settlers--led by Ezekiel “Stuttering” Merritt--crept up on Murphy’s Rancho (AKA Murphy’s Corral) which once stood on the seemingly benign farmland you seek now. There, they surprised and overwhelmed a small Mexican force who were camped for the night while transporting 200 horses from Sonoma to Monterey.

Although no shots were fired and no lives were lost--this incursion is considered by historians to be the first battle in the Mexican-American war. Four days later, the same men would capture General Mariano G Vallejo and several other high-ranking Mexican officials near Sonoma. Together, these actions would become known as “The Bear Flag Revolt”--the very genesis of the great state of California.

Unfortunately, most would have no idea such a significant event occurred here. When construction on the now abandoned Lent Ranch Mall project and related freeway “improvements” began to the north and east respectively, this historic location was obscured even more than it already was. There used to be a landmark south of Grantline where the old onramp began, but it has since been uprooted and discarded on West Stockton Blvd with a “No Trespassing” sign posted nearby.

This hide--my first--represents my respect for the history that took place here, and my dismay at how it was disrespected in the name of “progress.” I hope you enjoy learning about this site, and will share its story with others.

-Congrats Geofungi for FTF!

-This is a quick grab just off the road--please do not enter any private property (including the historic site).

-Room for small tradeables.

-Please make sure the target is resealed and re-hidden securely upon retrieval!

Enjoy!

While many talented players have displayed their wares on these fields for the illustrious EGHS baseball program over the years, none of them is more accomplished than alumnus Scott Boras (class of 1970). Thing is, Boras never made the major leagues. What he did make, was millions upon millions of dollars for himself and his clients--guys like Alex Rodriguez, Barry Bonds, Greg Maddux, Keith Hernandez, and Barry Zito. 


In his 26 years as super agent to baseball’s biggest stars (and a few of its biggest flops), Boras has negotiated some of the biggest deals in professional sports history--including the first baseball contracts to breach the $50 and $100 million barriers. 

Here’s to our native son and his contribution to skyrocketing ticket prices! ;)

-Please bring a pen/pencil

-Depending on the time of day and/or season, this GZ can be an extremely high muggle traffic area--sometimes even impossible to access (thus the higher difficulty rating). Use stealth and discretion!

-No need to enter the field or related buildings.

-Please make sure container is resecured and concealed from passers by.

-FTF gets a cool treat!

As buildings pop up in the business park, it's hard to imagine that this was once just a huge grassy ranchland. From the location of this cache you can still see undeveloped land across the road which is wonderfully green during Springtime.

This cache is easily accessible from the road, but you'll have to keep an eye out for muggles taking an afternoon walking break. Please watch for snakes! There are Rattlesnakes in this area.

Cache is a round film.</groundspeak:long_description>

For the third cache in this series you'll visit another feature which is quite common in the business park if you look around a bit.

During the winter and spring there is a surprising amount of water flowing through various ditches in and around the business park, especially in the areas that are not (yet) developed. Many of them aren't easily visible from the road, but you won't have to go far from the pavement for this one.
Please watch for snakes! There are Rattlesnakes in this area.

Cache is an Altoids container with a log. Please bring your own pen.</groundspeak:long_description>

I had a tough time with the exact location since the satellite maps are not updated since all the construction has been completed.  So I looked in the wrong places at first, but as I was leaving spotted something and it was a new container with a blank log!  I'm not sure if the location will last once we get a few large rainstorms in the fall/winter, but I happily signed FTF and kept going on the new trail!  Thanks for the FTF!</groundspeak:text>

I knew the way up so getting to GZ was easy but the cache wasn't there. However, I did find the cache at these coords - N 38° 38.465 W 121° 13.060 . Luckily I had the GC listing also since there isn't a hint on this site that would have help find it.

For the punk story. I listed to the following in the late 70's and early 80's: The Ramones, The Clash, The Sex Pistols - the originasl and still the best punkers out there.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I logged in to this site a few days ago and was pleasantly surprised to see a few new caches around Folsom area (last time the closest one is around Davis area).  I immediately had to go find this one, but there were just lots of muggles around.  Dang, I wish I had a bucket of chicken wings or something so I could have an excuse to just sit down and scour a little bit.  So, I saved it for another time.  That time was today.  There's no problem finding this one as I have an idea where, just need to look for the exact location.  Inked my name on the FTF spot.  The log says geocaching, but who cares :)

Thanks for the hide, FTF, and new one in Folsom.

The Story of Tùkwsitàk,tulpehakink and òkwës! A story of mystery stealth and hidden meanings. Or how to find hidden treasure with out being all wet....
Never did like tulpehakink,òkwës said. Gonna have to watch it some times Kwèkunilunkònachik comes out to ahkanshihëla. Give it a try òkwës, Tùkwsitàk responded. You might not have to worry this trip. Up until now òsëlànte. Never had they thought it would be any different.Gonna head that way and see what is there òkwës told them. Let màxkw  know I will be going. You better be careful òkwës,Tùkwsitàk said. Down mèxhanèk  I heard that Kwèkunilunkònachik turned over a canoe. At that moment as they both sat talking along the road Kwèkunilunkònachik swooped down!! Alas it was too late sukëlanhe!!!! so my friends the morals in this story will guide you to your quest. Kwèkunilunkònachik can be found here if you are brave..luwàneyunk xintxke xash xintxke pèshkunk nishash txapxki pèshkunk txinxke xash...èhèliwsikànk kwëtapxki nishinxke kwëti pèshkunk kwëtapxki xintxke ! !!! ntalënixsi!!ntalënixsi!!

Planned to take my baby for a walk along the bike path after work, but she mommy took the stroller away, had to wait for her to come back and when she did, my baby was already asleep ... so, drove the car instead and parked close to GZ, ... coords are superb and got the cache right away as we've seen one of those.  I looked at the cache and thought about another cache from the same CO and tried to remember if I've seen the same thing lying around ... while I was doing that, 40 joined me and we signed the CO-FTF on this one.  Thanks for the nice puzzle and cache.</groundspeak:text>

Being the first county opencache placement, I wanted it as central as I could get it. This I felt was that spot.
If you look due south of ground zero, there once was a Cal-Skate less than fifty feet in front of you.
I remember the good old days when roller skating was the &quot;hip&quot; thing to do and all of us got together on Friday and Saturday nights and skate with our sweeties and so on. The days of Angels Flight, long pointed collars, bell bottoms &amp; plaid slacks. :-)
You may have to use stealth at times as things get busy at times. If your lucky, your vehicle can be used as a muggle block. Bring your own writing utensil. As always, happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

Another congrats for the Co-FTF goes out to cbarrett85 and teamcounty. What great timing to knock these out on a lunch break. Way to go! 

This area I see is still frequented by the younger generation by the graffiti on the road.
As a late teen, the local kids from school dubbed this area as &quot;Hawaii&quot;. 
How it got it's name, I'll never know. It was basically a code word for where to meet and drink cold beverages instead of sitting in town doing so.
I also learned in these years from the loss of life due to juvenile alcohol abuse and drunk driving can lead to serious injury and death from areas such as this. Some good memories, some bad. I am glad to have made it through those dumb years of my life. Remember, don't drink and drive and report that potential drunk driver.
Enjoy the cache!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Small rubberized cache on a quiet country road north of Marysville, CA.

A congrats to teamcounty and cbarrett85 for the Co-FTF! To answer the question of what the cache is: It is a retired snake bite kit out of my late step-fathers tackle box. ;-)

After scanning the area for other caches, there is already one where I wanted to actually place a cache, the Granite Finger. All came out well as I found another view of the property that is my focus.
To the N/E of this location, my great grandparents once had a dairy smack dab in the middle of this what now is a rice paddy. They were immigrants from Germany in the early 30's. My step dad and uncle both grew up on this dairy as well. The old house and barn are all but a faded memory.
Shortly before my step father passed from leukemia, he had the opportunity to duck hunt this area a few more times. I am sure he got to reminisce about his growing up here.  
This is dedicated to a family that spent many years in the District Ten area, farming, hunting, and helped build some great hunting clubs that are renowned for being great hunting clubs in their time. This my dedication to them and my step father whom taught me how to be a good shot gunner and hunter/fisherman. I also learned how to drive on these roads.</groundspeak:long_description>

Because of no high points to get the right angle of the view I was seeing, I was able to see from my point of view. There was about a 50' plus swath that run about three rice checks across as far as I could see from a N/E direction. I could see the suction from the approx F1 waterspout/tornado that had passed through. It looked like a herd of water buffalo passed though the rice checks leaving a muddy/cloudy water path. About 36 hours or so had passed since I place this opencache here and it was an amazing view to see. BYOP and 1$ for the FTF! Keep on caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

Congrats goes to whitetail39&amp;travler13 for the FTF and Chante68 for the close STF. 
While out hunting Danger, Danger (Which I did not locate yet),
I found this sweet spot on the way out. I thought it would be nice for those who want a quick grab or families out on the hunt. The only reason I gave this a 2 is because you have to amble over some loose rock, and possibly potiential of snakes in warmer months. Though you you not have to travel more than 30-40 feet from the roadway. This is only open for day use and you may have to watch for rolling muggles at times. This is a small pill size container. BYOP. Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

Congrats to whitetail39&amp;travler13 for the FTF.

I was clueless as to what to name this cache. Then up popped a bird out of the reeds. Hence the name. This takes me back to the days of growing up in the rice fields. Not the best for wheelchairs. Watch your children as cars can blow by from time to time. Bring a pair of tweezers and BYOP. A cert for the FTF. I did not remove it to fill it out as it was stuck inside pretty good. I figured the lucky cacher could do that anyhow. Enjoy!


 Red-winged blackbird Agelaius phoeniceus 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Identification Tips:
Length: 7.25 inches 
Sharply-pointed bill 
Frequents marshy habitats in summer, open habitats at other times of year 
Often flocks with other species of blackbirds 
Adult male: 
Bright red patch on wings bordered by yellow (border missing in some races) 
Black plumage 
Immature male similar to adult male but has pale supercilium and brown edges to black feathers 
Adult female: 
Pale supercilium 
Heavily streaked underparts 
Upperparts brown and white 
Sometimes has yellow tinge to face and throat 
Females very dark in some races 
Juveniles similar to adult females 
Similar species: 
The male Red-winged Blackbird can be told from the male Tricolored Blackbird by its yellowish, not white, border to the red shoulder patch. Females are quite similar but Tricoloreds typically have darker bellies. Tricolored Blackbirds are only found in Oregon and California. Other species of blackbirds lack the red shoulder patch of the male and the streaked underparts of the female.</groundspeak:long_description>

A congrats goes out to hexrider for the FTF. Way to go!

This is an area with great veiws of the hills and bluffs of Butte County. I was going to name this the po po spot as this was the first time I have been rolled up on by law enforcement. When I explained that I was geocaching, he smiled and said thats great. He wanted to make sure I was not broke down and he went on his way. This is a camo pill bottle with small trade items and stickers. Please replace as you found it. There is 1$ for the FTF. Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

I gotta get my oc #'s up anyhow. Besides, being selected as an ambassador for oc.com, I thought I'd better get my game on.
I brought along a newbie to geocaching overall and let him boggle his brain on this one. Besides, I had found this while out with rock of rock&amp;crystal. rock was pretty amazed for me bein a newb to find this right outta the gate.
My friend who logged it as ~!~ for now as he was unsure of what his better half used for a login name.
My friend was ready to give up when I had to give three different hints no less. lol
Thanks for a wonderful hide and great to see you here on opencaching.com as well!
Hope to see you on the trail or at an event sometime.Thanks for adding your caches to opencaching.com for the newbs on here as well! SL TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

When I placed this cache, I realized I did not place the FTF certificate. If you feel inclined, I can send it to a P.O. Box, and etc. Let me know, and I'll shoot it to you. 
I have been driving home this way for years. As geologic as it looks, I finally stopped to take a gander. 
I am not sure of the history of this site. My assumption is that they must have had a find here that sparked some dredging.
The cache is on the street side of the easement, so fence crossing is not needed. Though, there are no signs posted and the fence line has been trampled over the years. I had to step in and take a peek. Attached is a view of the area, so it gives you a visual peek. People work this for fishing a lot and I often see vehicles parked in the area. 
There was some trash and fishing line strewn everywhere. I filled my Chico bag as full as I could get it. 
This is also a reminder that fishing line is also pollution. Tell those whom do not know that there are area recyclers, sport shops, and etc. that will take old line. Please do not leave it lying around in the environment. My assumption is inexperienced fisher people. But there was a lot of line present that is how this cache got it's name.
I almost planted my face in some rocks a few years ago due to strong line tripping me up. Geocachers become more environmentally aware as we go out caching in areas where dumping happens frequently. It has sparked a fire that I decided to become more involved in environmental awareness, primarily dumping and pollution. This is why I became a director for the Clean World Movement. And was happy to see the CITO program when I became a member.
The more I look, the more frustrating it is. If you find any dumpsites, please send me the coords to sites in the Paradise ridge area.
When pulling up to the coords, there are two pullouts. One is good for most all vehicles. The other almost took my car out, so choose wisely. Enjoy and happy caching.</groundspeak:long_description>

Man found dead under Clear Creek Bridge
By Paul Wellersdick Staff Writer
Posted: 07/28/2009 01:00:00 AM PDT

A 56-year-old Butte Valley man was found dead around 2 p.m. Monday under the Clear Creek Bridge at Clark Road where officers suspect the man had been since 10 a.m. that morning. The man was identified as David Rollins.

Butte County Sheriffs Deputy Jay Freeman said, judging by evidence at the scene, he suspected Rollins slipped and fell from the bridge or possibly had a medical condition which caused him to fall. Rollins had been in court with his wife for a traffic ticket that morning and was riding his road bicycle home when he stopped, presumably to rest, at the bridge about two miles from home.

A passerby reported seeing the red road bike and a water bottle sitting alone at the bridge at 10 a.m., Freeman said.

Rollins wife began to look for him after he didn't come home, Freeman said. Upon finding the bike and being unable to locate her husband, Rollins' wife called police from a friend's nearby home. She met with a Sheriff's captain who, together, found the body below the bridge.

The fall from the bridge was about 10 feet. Rollins' helmet was not on his head when he was found. California Highway Patrol originally responded to the scene as a hit and run but later turned the scene over to the Sheriff/Coroner office.

This is near the Clear Creek Cemetery in Butte Co., CA. It is a pretty simple find, but you have to walk up a gully about ten feet deep. Some small slopes to enter, otherwise easy walking. Watch out in the dry season, wet season may be tricky at times.

Park in the cemetery parking lot. This cemetery has a unique history. I do not like to plant caches inside cemeteries. I find it disrespectful. Read the plaque as you enter about the history of this area. It will take you back to the old west and the hardships that occurred back then. This was a tragedy. You will not be disappointed to look at the headstones and familar names you may see in the area. Look to the left as you are in the parking lot. You will see some oak trees lining a small gully/ravine. It is seasonal, so you may get your feet wet. In the dry season, watch for SNAKES! This zone seems to be prime for rattlers, so please be careful. Leave the littlins at the car, unless they are nimble and agile. Rocks in the creek bed may be loose, so watch your step as well.
This has only a log, so BYOP.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Once you head up this ravine about some 250 feet or so, you will run into a barrier. There is a little pine tree there as a marker point just above you. It is in the nooks and crannies in this barrier. A rock is wedging it in so it will not come loose very easy. Please do the same. Thanks!</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

This part of the series is gated. The cost is free, but the hours are 8am-Sunset.

Congrats goes out to 1whitevette for the FTF. Way to go!

This is the final in this mini series of caches. Hope you enjoyed the hunt. This was graded a 1.5 due to the fact that a wheelchair can roll up, but may be unable to reach.
This site was founded and named after Benjamin Nelson. Nelson discovered gold here in 1850 which established the name for nearby settlement. The settlement was situated on both sides of the N. Fork of the Feather River. See the nearby plaque.</groundspeak:long_description>

A congrats goes out to 1whitevette  for the FTF. Way to go!

As a celebration for my 500th find, I decided to place a &quot;just because&quot; cache. 
I have continually have had a ball since March, 1 doing this activity and realized that I am not going to lose interest in geocaching anytime soon. 
I have met a few on the trail along and lot at events. I found new friends, and met a community that all share the same passion for hunting plastic in the park. I tip my hat to all of those in the geocaching community and thank you for all your hard work in your cache placements. Without you, we would be pretty bored and run out of caches to find real quick. :-)
There is a small turnout. Watch traffic as some will show no mercy when pulling out. It is safe, but a few hundred feet from a small curve in the road. Enjoy the view and cache on!</groundspeak:long_description>

PLEASE! Watch for rattlesnakes. Habitat is perfect for one in this zone. Watch your children is this area. Traffic is heavy. There is a small turn-out near cache.
This is one of those sad roadside memorials. I believe this involved a Paradise High teenage girl who did not make it home to Paradise. This is also a reminder not to let our GPSr's distract us from operating a motor vehicle. :-)
If anyone has the story on this, please let me know. I would like to post it more as a memorial cache site.</groundspeak:long_description>

I will double check its position and the vegetation as I would not want anyone to get poison oak. On the other hand,there is reason for it's listed difficulty. I noticed I do not have one listed. My apologies) A lot of my geocaches vary. Will be back for update.This one I looked high and low for a good spot to hide. Between the swimmers, fisherman, and possibly campers (bridge trolls about 150 due east of GZ) I chose this location. As it would seem to get the lesser of traffic. This is a waterproof fishing bait box with some swag, fishing lure, hot wheel, kids swag, and etc.
Watch out for the typical spiders, stickers, bugs, and skeeters during certain times of year. BYOP as I am unsure if I placed one inside the cache.
I hope you enjoy opencaching as much as I am starting to. Just need more participants and placements out there. I used to place for the&quot;other guys&quot;, but I found it's clicks and decided to move on over. Hope you enjoy opencaching as much as I do. Time for change anyhow. Happy opencaching!  </groundspeak:long_description>

(COPY THIS PARAGRAPH FOR FUTURE CACHES)
This is a continual cache. The FTF on this cache and for each successive cache is requested to follow one simple rule. Each First Finder, by logging in as the FTF, will hopefully agree to continue the series. The FTF is requested to place a cache in the Chico area within two weeks of logging the FTF. This way we can all play and try for the FTF. (List each cache &quot;Quad's FTF curse #2...#3 etc.)

By way of clarification, there is no requirement besides the standard signing of the cache log to prevent you from logging this cache when found. Everyone should log their find, and hopefully the FTF person will play along and place another cache, but it is in no way a requirement for logging your find.

The curse will be broken after the 20th cache is found. At that point the person with the most FTF's in the series will be awarded a renewal of their premium membership (by Quad), in the case of a tie - Quad will have to make a desicion based upon the creativity of the tied parties' caches. (so my goal is to find the most and renew my OWN membership - but let's make a competition out of it) Again, play only if you want to. Nobody is under any obligation to play.

Current Score:
#1 Muniman 1
#2 Thrak 1 (Co-FTF)
#2 QuadMFT24 1 (Co-FTF)
#3 Hexrider 1 (congrats on this FTF)
#4 Bishoptakesqueen 1</groundspeak:long_description>

Terrain is a 1.5 due to this is a dirt surface. Mud may be an issue certain times of year here, but can be wheelchair accessible. This is a short drive up Honey Run Rd., near Chico, CA.  
The cache is placed near the trail head of the preserve so there is no disturbance of wildlife or habitat inside the preserve.

A wonderful place to visit and do photo shoots or just absorb the peace and tranquility. Please respect the wildlife in the area and enjoy some of the beauty of Butte County.
The Butte Creek Ecological Preserve is a 93-acre site along the middle section of Butte Creek. The property contains more than a mile of creek frontage, which is critical salmon habitat and spawning grounds, as well as habitat for many species of special status, including hawks, beaver, and burrowing owls. 
In December 1998 the University Research Foundation purchased this site with grants from the US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Fish and Wildlife Federation, CALFED, and the Wildlife Conservation Board. The goal of the preserve is to work in conjunction with other programs towards achieving a reasonable balance among the diverse demands on the resource base of the Butte Creek watershed. The research foundation will provide an adaptive management approach to managing the property for salmon habitat, watershed research-especially channel and floodplain management, and as a living laboratory and field classroom. The reserve is open to the public 24/7 and provides the following facilities: greenhouse, storage shed, portable toilet.</groundspeak:long_description>

Take water with you and watch for snakes, wildlife, roller rocks on path, and etc. I do not suggest doing this alone. I do only because I am familiar with the area.

This is good going downhill, going up can be rough on some. For the more avid hiker. This is a steep fire access road into the Feather River Canyon below Paradise. 

You can park near this area here @: N 39 44.917'
W 121 34.259' 

The access gate is located @: N 39 44.937'
W 121 34.199'

This is a fire access road that switches back a lot. Use your geosenses here and remember to stay right on the dirt road when it splits twice. If you hit the flume. Do not go any further down. There is no need.
After a distance on the road look close to your left: 
N 39  44.460'
W  121  33.872'
Look for the game trail that will lead you to the flume.
This is located on (or is it under?) the flume.
This cache has been upgraded to a large cache. Has some cool swag, pen and log. Please replace as you found it. Happy hunting. :-)</groundspeak:long_description>

Welcome to the Town of Paradise 

Paradise is nestled in the foothills of Northern California's Sierra Nevada Mountains.  The Butte County community sits astride a ridge top with elevations ranging from 2,000 to 2,800 feet above the valley floor.  Our climate and location allows residents and visitors to enjoy an array of tall pines and majestic oaks, cooler summertime temperatures, occasional winter snowfalls, and an engaging environment.

Paradise is the second largest city in Butte County, and is part of the Chico-Paradise metropolitan area.  Paradise was incorporated in 1979, and it is home to nearly 27,000 residents.  The neighboring communities of Magalia, Paradise Pines, Lovelock, Stirling City, and Inskip add nearly another 25,000 residents, as well as a colorful Gold Rush history and even more awesome natural beauty.

Chico, the county's largest city, is a short scenic drive from Paradise.  The 10-mile jaunt offers panoramic views of Butte Creek Canyon - known to the locals as Little Grand Canyon - and sweeping vistas from the foothills to the Coast Range to the west and Mt. Lassen to the North.

On your way to Paradise from the nearby City of Oroville, you can drop the boat at Lime Saddle Marina and cruise Lake Oroville or wet your line in the Feather River.  You can also meander along Riverbend Park or marvel at the cultural beauty of the Chinese Temple Garden.

Paradise is a short drive from the Bay Area and the Sacramento region.  The drive takes you along historic and scenic highways 70 and 99, and past the orchards and rice fields.  A spring time drive along the Blossom Tour is a must see.

Rich in history, innate beauty, and friendly people, Paradise is a fantastic place to raise a family, build a business, or just relax for a weekend in the pines.

Welcome!

Sloping gravel road that has lots of roller rocks. The access gate indicates a lot of signs that say no access, but this leads to public lands/national forest. Stay on road for a few hundred feet below the homes and you are good to go

This is part one of my hiker series to Yarp#1. This is a camoed flash card container so BYOP.
I felt I needed to beef up the area a little more as it is dry down there when it come to caches. I will be adding more and encourage others to do the same. Mountain bikes would do well here, but is recommended for the more advanced rider.
This one is not far down for those that cannot make the full hike to the flume. Please leave as you found it. Thanks

Our first hide as a team and couple. This is a wonderful area for a nice solitary break from the world without being too far off the beaten path. Enjoy the view! My hubby and I sure do. Please respect the nearby facility and please keep on the path and stay in parking area nearby. There is a De Lorme trail map posted near the trail head. ALSO! Pay attention for the potential rattlesnakes. There is great cover for them in the area. Enjoy the hunt! </groundspeak:long_description>

California ambassador for opencaching.com.:-)
We take a stroll pretty regular in this area. It is suggested to park at these coordinates: N 39' 45.419- W 121' 34.116'.
A helpful hint to find this trail: Look for the picnic table and walk almost due north. 
When we found this area, we were wondering why this had not been found by fellow geocachers yet.
This area was stripped of vegetation after the Butte Complex fires in 2008 leaving this trail more exposed. A wonderful canyon view stroll without taking too much life out of you, guaranteed to be a nice, short excursion. Some who do not like creepy crawleys may want to bring a &quot;grabber&quot;. More brave peeps could make the grab, just be alert for spiders and snakes. Both of which I doubt would be very prevalent @ this spot. But! You never know! Happy caching!     </groundspeak:long_description>

Feral cats get such a bum wrap. It is not their fault for the living condition they thrive in. As a young man, I was paid to shoot feral cat populations on private hunting clubs. Today, I mostly shoot with a camera unless I am hunting for food for my family, not trophies to hang on a wall. 
___________________________________________________

Feral cats are descended from domestic cats but are born and live without human contact. Any environment that sustains people can sustain feral cats, who are known to have thrived in urban, suburban, and rural areas in all parts of the civilized world. They are not to be confused with wild cats or with stray cats (alley cats). Wild cats are descendants of wild species. Stray cats are homeless descendants of domestic cats, but unlike feral cats, have had prior contact with humans and therefore exhibit temperament similar to that of a domestic cat.
Feral cats may live alone but are usually found in large groups called feral colonies. These colonies tend to meet two essential criteria: a good hiding place (often a small wooded area, or abandoned buildings or cars) and a food source. This is why they are often seen near restaurant dumpsters. The average life span of a feral cat that survives beyond kittenhood is about two years for individual cats and five years for cats in a managed colony.[2] An indoor domestic house cat lives an average of 12 to 18 years, though not uncommonly, indoor-only cats have been known to live to their early 20's[citation needed] (12-14 in UK 16+ in USA but stats are incomplete).
Cats are extremely adaptable, and feral felines have been found in conditions of extreme cold and heat.
The environmental impact of feral and free-ranging cats is a subject of debate. Part of this stems from humane concern for the cats, and part stems from concerns about cat predation on endangered species. The domestic cat was distributed throughout the world by human travelers and is not native to many parts of the world. The amount of ecological damage done by cats depends on local conditions, with the most severe effect occurring to island ecologies. Environmental concerns may be minimal in places such as the UK where cats are an established species and few to none of the local prey species are endangered. In Australia, New Zealand and parts of North America they are considered pests due to their threat to endangered species.

My wife and I took a southerly stroll, away from the regular flow of traffic on the flume. We enjoyed viewing the nice home that sits down in there all by itself. We both thought my wife's great Aunt Tiny would have enjoyed this area. She would have been 90 this weekend. Unfortunately, she was cut five days short. So this is placed in memory of Aunt Tiny. Your GPSr will spin in this area. Happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

~Congrats to hexrider for the FTF! Way to go! I was starting to worry about this one! ;-)

I decided to place a few caches for those those short and sweet hikes. Some of these I will be placing are going to have multiple types of difficulties and terrain levels. Enough to get the heart pumping. And you cannot drive your car up to (most) of these.
This cache is for sure a workout.And be careful! GPSr may spin and you have your work cut out for you. Happy caching</groundspeak:long_description>

Disclaimer! If you are nimble, balanced, and agile, then this cache is for you! If not, beware! I do not want to see a horrible post about someone getting injured attempting this cache.
This is a gentle flume stroll until you get to GZ. Then, this is where things get tricky. If you have a trained chimp, you may have it do your dirty work. All I know is, I broke a little sweat placing it. Not much though. This may not be as hard as I am making it out to be.
From the wear and looks of things, I think something enjoys this area as a roost or hang-out. As always, be safe, watch your step, and happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

You can park near GC#: GCRFFH- N 39° 48.887 W 121° 35.075. There is a nearby parking area that is the safest bet for parking your vehicle for this short hike/cardio workout.

I decided to place a few caches for those those short and sweet hikes. Some of these I will be placing are going to have multiple types of difficulties and terrain levels. Enough to get the heart pumping. And you cannot drive your car up to these.
After all there years, I had to make a quick hike down into this part of the Little Butte Creek ravine. I have driven by and wondered where the green gate went to.
I found it to be a nice little short walk for the dog to play in the water, read a book, and etc. I also found it hard to grade this ones difficulty. The terrain was chosen due to the walk out. Watch out for roller rocks when stepping.  Enjoy and happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

This is for the intermediate hiker. This hill knocked the wind out of me coming out. Nice, steep access road.

While out in search of GC1YCF8 and GC1MBG5, I stopped in this area for a breather. I thought that this was a lot of work for only two geocaches in the surrounding area. While taking a break here, I planted another for fun. Happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

This area is actually the crossroads of a small guage railroad crossing which started up the hill from Chico, CA to the Diamond Match mill that had all been a passing of time. But these muggles sure enjoy this area. Just watch for speeders!!! Cache on!</groundspeak:long_description>

~Heads up all!
In some areas, this is a steep ravine. Between the cover and limited access to satellites, your GPSr is guaranteed to spin. I am leveling up the difficulty because of this.~
This series was developed with the hiker in mind. The entire hike has trails, waterfalls, geological sites, and etc. One is the well maintained trail, while others break off to sites along the creek bed and etc. Some of these caches will require you to break off the trail, but all keep you in close proximity from the main trail. Please be safe while hiking in this area. Remember to bring water, food, and skeeter repellent.

~Heads up all!
In some areas, this is a steep ravine. Between the cover and limited access to satellites, your GPSr is guaranteed to spin. I am leveling up the difficulty because of this.~
This series was developed with the hiker in mind. The entire hike has trails, waterfalls, geological sites, and etc. One is the well maintained trail, while others break off to sites along the creek bed and etc. Some of these caches will require you to break off the trail, but all keep you in close proximity from the main trail. Please be safe while hiking in this area. Remember to bring water, food, and skeeter repellent.
~My son and I stumbled on this lake a couple of years ago. Yes, it does have fish, but from the side your on, good luck caching one. Do not cross the spill way or leave the side of the lake you are on. The east side is private. Stay on current path to reconnect with the main trail. Happy caching~</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is located in the DeSabla group Picnic area. This is just accross the street from Lake DeSabla. 
We have been to a couple of events here and it is quite a place that goes unseen by many. There is a nearby parking area that is the safest bet for parking your vehicle for this short hike/cardio workout to the cache.

I decided to place a few caches for those those short and sweet hikes. And maybe somtimes, a little harder to challenge others. These tougher ones are coming very soon. 
Some of these I will be placing are going to have multiple types of difficulties and terrain levels. Enough to get the heart pumping. And you cannot drive your car up to these.
Today, I decided to each lunch here and place a cache,
This area is great for a nice little short walk for the dog to play in the water, read a book, and etc.This is one of the easier cardio series. Enjoy it, The next few are going up in difficulty. Enjoy and happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is flat and yet a little jaunt.
The only reason this is graded as such is due to the gravel and the condition of ground zero.

Congrats goes out to whitetail39&amp;travler13 for the FTF. Great job!
My boys enjoyed this stretch for that roller coaster effect when coming down the hill. This all depends on how fast you are going. Speeding is not recommended as some of these hills have blind spots and can be dangerous!!!
Terrain is OK, but lots of brush. Watch your eyes for sticks and skewers. A small person could almost crouch and walk in. An larger person may break back a lot of branches to get to it. If this happens, it may open a direct gateway for a potential muggle. Please go easy on the geotrail. 
(9/9/09: Cache swapped for an ammo can as a bear had chewed the old cache. I assume bears like just about anything. Mmmmmmm....Coffee! LOL
Same old log, new cache and lots o swag to enjoy!!!
1$ in quarters for the FTF.</groundspeak:long_description>

After the owie incident, I decided to place an easy cache. This is a large pill bottle with a log and a dollar for the FTF. BYOP. Your GPS may jump or drop out on you. Let me know if coords are good.
Pretty easy cache. Hollow stumps and trees abound. Which one can this cache be in? Just take a look around. I promise it is not that hard. Watch the kids and for snakes. Happy hunting!</groundspeak:long_description>

THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. Can be risky extracting this cache. BE CAREFUL! GPS is intermittant in this area. Let me know if coords are ok. Thanks

Being a newbie and excited about geocatching, I learned a valuable lesson doing this cache. I am no longer a stuntman. Though the cache is only a matter of feet away from parking spot, the terrain changes dramatically. Steep, pine needles, and shoes with no traction will not be good. By far the scariest cache I have placed thus far. Of course, I did it backwards. I figured, well, I did not keep on rolling down the hill and caught myself by grabbing a sapling, so that must be a good thing. 
There is a log, necklace, goofy pin, pencil, Gregarious Greg - Super Cacher! TB, and my son says I placed a dollar. After all the excitment and near mishap, I do not remember what all I left. I am going to have to print up FTF certs for the FTF's. Again, BE CAREFUL! Please replace as you found it.</groundspeak:long_description>

A congrats to whitetail39&amp;travler13 for the FTF. Way to hustle out there!

I had to place this one here as my wife and I enjoyed the hike and to let others know of such a historical hike to the Inskip Pioneer Cemetery. See below. It is about a fifteen minute hike or 4WD in. Camoed decon container with usual stuff, and 1$ for the FTF.
The Way To Inskip Pioneer Cemetery
A very interesting trek back in time. I tip my hat to Red Buggy for placing this one. 
Not only was it my 200th find, but the most challenging. 
My wife had given up and headed back to the car. I was persistant and decided to continue my search. I finally found it with a little labor into extracting it. A tree had fallen on the cache over last winter. It is now dug out and ready to go again.
There is also the recently placed memorial placed by E. Clampus Vitus 7-11. Looks nice. Go ECV! Yes, I am a clamper too. :-)

GCJPWD- Lost Souls cache. 


NAME: Inskip
COUNTY: Butte
ROADS: 2WD
GRID #(see map): 1
CLIMATE: Cool winter, mild summer.
BEST TIME TO VISIT: Anytime. COMMENTS: On SR 191 off SR 70 North of Sacramento, current residents.
REMAINS: The hotel and a few small buildings. 
 Inskip was developed as a stage stop along a heavily traveled route used by miners. P.M. Kelly took interest and began to develop Inskip with a store and hotel. Within a year, many stores, hotels, saloons, and other businesses sprang up. Today, only the Inskip Hotel and a few smaller buildings remain of this prosperous mining community. 
John Stokes purchased the hotel in 1866 and renamed it Stokes Hotel. John moved his family to Inskip where it was home for more than 65 years. &quot;The hotel was destroyed by fire in 1868 and later rebuilt. It was probably then that it was renamed Inskip. Legend says the fire was arson and that a resident ghost named Charley is still looking for the arsonist. It has operated almost continuously as a hotel. Bob and Kathy Duffey are its current owners having purchased the hotel in 1968. In 1975 it was approved and listed in the National Register of Historical Places.&quot; - www.paradisedirect.com. 
They also failed to mention that this hotel was shown on TV's &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; as a haunted location as well.</groundspeak:long_description>

Congrats to 1whitevette for the FTF!
I had to make a few more challenging caches for the experienced geocachers, yet still achievable for the beginners as well. I planted way too many easy ones along the way. 
Again, this area needs more caches and I am doing the best I can to improve those numbers.
When found, please place cache in lid to aid easier replacement of the log. Enjoy and happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Compression Station #12: GTN Sunriver 

 These compressor stations are spaced about 50-60 miles apart along the GTN transmission pipeline, from the Canadian gas field source to the final distribution in Southern California.  Line pressures can be adjusted to control the velocity of the gas in the pipeline.  

Typical line velocity is 30 miles per hour and gas can be &quot;parked&quot; in segments of the pipeline to adjust for demand.  The gas in a segment of pipe between two compression stations is called a &quot;linepack&quot; and can be adjusted in velocity remotely to account for fluctuations in demand.  Line pressures range from 200 PSI to 1,500 PSI, with the steel transmission pipes ranging 20-42 inches in diameter.

Jet engines are used to compress the gas, using bleed gas as fuel for the jet.  A similar station (#11) is located alongside Hwy 26, east of Pine Ridge.  Some stations have small landing strips for servicing the station. Both this station and #11 have such landing strips for STOL aircraft.



The ladder-like array in the center of this complex is likely a heat-exchanger, designed to extract heat from the gas once it is compressed.  The plastic tubs in the service yard are for storage of the oil used in the compression process.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This site is east of the Horse Ridge Natural Area at about 4550 ft elevation.  A brief 15 minutes climb will take you to the top of the ridge and the multi waypoints.  Distance to the cache is 1.6 miles with six GPS waypoints and a final offset True north bearing, not magnetic.

Take your magnetic compass as well as the GPS, as the cache is an offset bearing True from the final GPS waypoint (18E declination was used).  Allow about 2 hours.  This area overlooks the Badlands and has plenty of interesting rock formations and a few rock sheets that have been polished by glaciers.  Notice this feature especially after leaving the Outcrop on your way to the Bone Waypoint.  Waypoints 2 – 4 require recording the elevation number on the roadside sign as you approach the first waypoint, and also the OHV number at the first waypoint.  Record the number you find at the second waypoint for use to find the Bone Waypoint.  An afternoon visit is best for the lighting on the  Dry River Canyon walls.  A nearby mountain bike path leads west and into the Horse Ridge Natural Area.

Car Park:
N43*54.767
W121*00.440
 (OHV#) = the two numbers on this sign at the site
Horse Ridge Elevation Sign = KLMN (put in the numbers)
Sum = K + L + M + N = (HRES)

Number on Wall:
N43*54.[(HRES)x(OHV#) + 52]
W121*00.[238 + (OHV#)x(HRES)]
Checksum:
[238 + (OHV#)x(HRES)] - [(HRES)x(OHV#) + 52]= 169 + (HRES)
Save the Number on the Wall for the Bone in Tree waypoint details

Outcrop:
N43*54.[(HRES)x(OHV#) + 96)]
W121*00.[338 + (OHV#)x(HRES)]
Checksum:
[338 + (OHV#)x(HRES)] – [(HRES)x(OHV#) + 96)] = 242
The three buttes to the south are (clockwise)  Firestone, East and China Hat.
Enjoy the view.

Bone Waypoint:
Wall Number = ABCD.EF
N43*54.[(A + B) x 111)]
W121*01.[(C + D) x 37) – (D – C)]
Checksum: [(A + B) x 111)] - [(C + D) x 37) – (D – C)] = 544 + (HRES)
Hint: Coordinates for the next waypoint are on a bone.
On a clear day, you can see all the way to Mt. Hood.

chasing sticks in the Juniper Forest.  Having completed
Chapter 1 of Pingala in the code book, BC suggested that a
truly determined Central Oregon geocacher or geopup could really
enjoy this piece of code:

&lt;p&gt;Bailey took on this challenge for 160.412 meters at a bearing of
030o 01.324' True from the resolved 1s and 0s encoded
position.  She searched and searched, knowing that WGS84 was
the correct datum for all Geocache.com mapping applications. 
Ahhhh...she finally said to BC, now I like these boulders with
their tight passages, but perhaps some clues are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love that Golden Basin east of Ford Road, but Osage is Best!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: AA10TDR - Offset&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;If the binary is copied and pasted into a Binary-to-text converter, the result is 10T06312944868646.

need to number-crunch for the solution. Bailey and BC begged for an
evening walk in the forest and were pleased to find a bubbling
spring at the end of their journey. The cache area is unique, but
shows some wear from illegal OHV use, so the CacheCollies hope the
presence of visiting geocachers will make the area more visible in
the public eye. &lt;br/&gt; The
      CacheCollies have passed nearby this beautiful oasis on their
      many journies into the high country of the Oregon Cascades,
      but never had taken time to stop and enjoy the giant
      Ponderosa Pines, rocky features, and Big Spring.  Soon
      there will be a new mountain bike trail punched through this
      area and on towards Mt. Bachelor, so you will notice numerous
      &quot;TRAIL&quot; flags designating the eventual path. 
      &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
At
the posted coordinates, N43o
58.965',

29.709', look
for a man-made object bearing numbers.  Take the first digit
in the three digit number as &quot;A&quot;, second digit as &quot;B&quot;, third digit
as &quot;C&quot;.  Solve for the second waypoint as follows:
N43o
58.DEF',

D =
9-B+4; E = 6-A-3; F = 5+C; G = 7-B; H = 0+C+2; I =
9+B-6&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Hike
to this second waypoint and follow an azimuth of TRUE
JKLo
for
280 feet, requiring you to use your magnetic compass AND GPS for
bearing and distance.  J = 8-B; K = A+B; L =
6-B&lt;br/&gt;

This is BLM property with adjoining private land the first 0.4 miles.  Stay on the BLM road and continue past the canal and over the rocky trace to good parking. 

 Cache contains the usual trade items and a TB.

The areas bordering Bend to the south and southeast still offer stunning vistas of the Cascades and a vantage point to observe the rapid and somewhat chaotic growth of the metropolitan region.  Part of this walk (northern most waypoint) will be nearby an old irrigation canal, part by the Skeleton Fire Complex and another part near robust trees that escaped the fires.  Perhaps a land swap will one day convert this area into 3,000 sq ft homes on 4,000 sq ft lots, so enjoy the natural setting while you are able.  Be wary of the cheat grass in the late springtime and summer months, and protect those doggie ears with some coverings.

Benchmarks PB0569 and PB0606 are in the area as well.

posted coodinates and will require the Google Earth application or
searching at Wikimapia.org to solve the puzzle. By completing this
cache, you will visit some interesting point-sources of atmospheric
pollution that are now the topics of numerous research projects.
There are two intermediate waypoints, in camo pill
bottles. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on 
Geochecker.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific evidence suggests
that Earth is rapidly warming and some recent studies indicate that
there is a direct relationship to Global
Warming and the gases (particularly CO2) we have emitted into
the atmosphere.  PBS featured a
   NOVA/Frontline Report April
   24, 2007 that offers an excellent overview to the immediate
   threats brought on by Global Warming.  The 
Report offers facts that can help us thread-the-needle
in the efforts to reverse the trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 
&quot;Over a 40 year period, scientist Charles Keeling measured the
amount of carbon dioxide (CO
2
) in the atmosphere. The above &quot;Keeling Curve&quot; shows the increase
in total concentrations of CO
2
in the atmosphere from 1957-1997. This unbroken record of the
carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere shows how it's gone up, in
round numbers, from around 315 parts per million to around 370
parts per million on average today. This data is widely accepted by
everyone. (Nova/Frontline Report)&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good downloadable tool, Google Earth, can be
used fly around the globe and visit some of the past and current
point-sources of pollution. As an alternative, you can go to
http://www.wikimapia.org and search against the names listed in the
Fly To sites  You will be visiting the
tallest smoke
stacks in the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Magna, UT  Kennecott Copper Smelter
Stack,  370.4 meters (#4 world highest
     stack) 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Earth has a “Fly To”
tab.  You will copy a location from the
list below, paste it into the tab field and hit the ENTER key on
your computer.  Google Earth will fly
you to the vicinity of a stack, where you can pan around to observe
some interesting features, in addition to the gigantic
stacks.  Remember, these stacks are TALL
so as to disperse the toxic gases and CO2 downwind from the
worksite, but all of the gases then mix into the
atmosphere.  The smelter stacks you will
visit have vented mega tonnage of toxic metal waste into the
atmosphere during their operational history, along with carbon
oxides.  Some of these facilities, such as Kennecott at Magna
UT, have been made to be very efficient and even capture the
sulfuric acid gases as a commercial byproduct.  To identify
the stack site, float your mouse over the small Google Earth icons
you see on the satellite hybrid maps. If you don't have Google
Earth freeware installed on your computer, just visit the link
http://www.wikimapia.org and use the search engine to locate the
target stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; INCO Nickel Smelter Stack,  381
meters (#2 highest stack in the World) (Brazilian
Ownership)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example of this acid fallout is the
jet-black granite around Greater Sudbury Ontario, where the
sulfuric acid rain has penetrated the pink-gray granite to a depth
of 3 inches and permanently dyed the granite jet black.
       The INCO Superstack is the
      tallest freestanding chimney in the Western hemisphere, with
      a height of 381 m (1,257 ft).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each “Fly To” 
location, zoom down to where you can see the stack opening and
float your mouse to the center of the stack.  Record the minutes for both latitude and longitude
of the stack for some later number crunching.  Of course, because we are looking down on the
stack from above but at an angle, not straight down the stack hole,
the number you record is not the actual location of this stack, but
that is not our objective in this exercise.  Any reading 30 or more seconds is rounded to the
next minute of reading, ie. N44*16’30” gives 17 for the minutes
value and adding the two digits (1+7) gives 8.  N44*16’29.9” gives 16 minutes or a sum of
7.  Got it, OK!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is not located at the posted coordinates.  You need to visit two waypoints to locate the final cache. 

 The posted coordinates are within the Three Sisters Wilderness, setup to help you locate the cache which is outside the Wilderness.  At the two waypoints cited below, you will find interesting views and physical clues to locating the final cache.  The cache is located at N44*01.XYZ, W121*41.PQR.   Solve this puzzle cache by visiting the two waypoints and getting values for the letters X, Y, Z, P, Q, R.

WP1:  See the several (dead) snags with multiple trunks atop the several single snag trunks.  By definition herein, if you locate one main trunk attached to the ground, with 4 dead trees atop, you have one snag trunk and 4 tree trunks atop.  Total trunks would be (1+4) or 5 trunks.

Do not count the nearby LIVE trunks with multiple trees atop! 
 
At the first Waypoint:  Z  = [(snag trunks attached to the ground + total dead trees atop) - 4]
R = (snag trunks attached to the ground - 1)


WP2: Q = (total trunks + tree tops of WP1) + Root Wads w/rocks - 3
Y = root wad w/rocks + Lodge Pole Pine w/red needles on the cliff (ready for the plunge) + tree tops of WP1 - 4
X =[tree tops of WP1 - Root Wad w/rocks of WP2 + number of tall (standing) snags at WP2 with base diameter of one foot or more]  - 1
P = [number of tall snags of WP2 with base diameter of one foot or more + root wads w/rocks + trunks at WP1 attached to ground]    Divide this figure by 3 for &quot;P&quot;

(Look carefully down the face of this cliff and notice the small trees and trees bearing scars on their bark.  Winter snows accumulate on the cliff topside and avalanche down this gully, into the hemlock forest below.)
Checksum: sum of all objects you have counted = 12

Additional Waypoints
B01YJE2 - Parking
N 44° 02.120 W 121° 40.545
Park here off the 370 Road on the turnout or hike up the Green Lakes Trail from Todd Lake.  This start point will save you about 200 vertical gain and allow ready access to two nearby caches in route to WP1 and WP2.  The cache is somewhere down there in the Todd Lake Basin, so eventually you will return to the lake and your search.  Best plan for 2 hrs to complete this cache, so do take a lunch, water and your camera.
B11YJE2 - View1
N 44° 01.920 W 121° 41.864
count number of trunks attached to the ground and total number of trees atop these dead trunks
B21YJE2 - View2
N 44° 02.000 W 121° 41.982
Count the number of root wads with roots surrounding large rock or rocks; Count the number of tall snags with base diameter 1 ft or more; Count the number of Lodge Pole Pines (red needles) ready to take the plunge from the cliff, or have fallen from the cliff.

 We parked at N44*02.030, W121*40.621 on 370 for a 30 minute hike to the cache over gentle terrain, traveling on the old access trail to the Green Lakes Trail.  Another cache is nearby this old trail.  There are also several good approaches from Todd Lake Trailhead, either by the Green Lakes Trail or the lakeside trail from the west side of the lake.

Some cross-country travel is required from any approach and the hiking trail to Green Lakes from Todd Lake will take about as much time as driving up 370 to the listed waypoint and hiking on from there.  Either of these two approaches takes you very close to another recent cache.  Springs and meadows abound, and also enjoy the sound of Soda Creek waterfalls far below.

1100100000111001011000000110011100010110101010111, the cache is
located on a bearing of 111 degrees True and 0.143 miles (230.625
meters). You are looking for a camo egg with a sign-in sheet and
short pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ski ticket scanners at Mt. Bachelor are now digital and the
ticket scanning details are transmitted wirelessly to West Village
operations. Wireless Internet access was available earlier in the
season and may still be accessible by suitably configured laptops.
In setting up this cache, we wondered the age of the Hawthorne
tree, and if the old Shevlin-Hixon Mill cast a shadow upon it in
years past. The vacant land was once part of the Shevlin-Hixon Mill
and an elevated rail system connected the mill operations west and
east of the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

barrel, Bailey is investigating alternative means of reaching some
of the local Bend caches. Join her on this puzzle journey as she
investigates the local BAT system. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;
   
http://www.ci.bend.or.us/bend_area_transit/bat_ridership.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 

&lt;p&gt;The cache is NOT at the posted coordinates, so
you will need to solve a puzzle for the starting point of your
journey.  You have read
about these monster buses and their
reputation.  They have
been replaced and are now in storage; look carefully and you may
see them on your
journey.  Click

HERE to visit the transit website and search for some
solutions to the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Transit
Routes are numbered
1-11.
  The total number of routes is
M.
  The second digit of the BAT 4 digit office address is
N (ie. xNqr in the four digit address).
(use Absolute
Value). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting point is
N44°03.(2xN)(M)(N),
W121°18.(M-N-5)(M-N)(M+N-1). 
For example, if N
= 1, and M
= 9, your solution is
N44°03.291,
W121°18.389
[bogus
location]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for the STARTING POINT on

Geochecker.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit this starting point and begin your
search for details to the second part of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second waypoint is
N44
°03.XYZ, W121°17.PQR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XYZ = 472 – 2x(the
2 digit number of Type ID) – 28&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PQR =
058 
+ (year of manufacture) – 2000 + (sum of last two numbers in
the serial number); see hint and be sure to record the complete
serial number for future reference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located at this site,
N44°03.DEF,
W121°17.JKL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEF = (total number of ornamental [non-linear]
objects associated with the second lowest attachment to the
vertical support) + XYZ + 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JKL = 10x(first two
numbers in the serial number at WPT1) + PQR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a
micro.  Bring your own
writing stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Checksum
for total number of objects in
DEF is 4,
&lt;b&gt;adding
the two digit total of
ornaments&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

The second lowest branch has a total of 31 leaves, or non-linear ornaments.  Non-linear is used so the cacher will not count the attachment limbs.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Night cache. Start at the posted coordinates and look west with your flashlight for the first marker, a &quot;FireTack&quot; on a tree. There will be roughly 30 of these scattered along your route to the cache. Most are set from 6' to 8' high and at varying distances (10' to 100') depending on the trees. The final cache location is at ground level and should be apparent when you get to it.

FireTacks are small, retro-reflective markers. To see them you have to hold your light at eye level so that the reflection comes back to you. You may also need to hit one of the flat surfaces head on. In other words, these can be tricky to spot and you may need to move a step this way or that to catch it just right. Use a good, medium-strength flashlight or headlamp. Don't use a powerful spot light for several reasons: it will wash out the markers and make them harder to see; it will blind you; and it will attract attention in this stolid residential neighborhood.

The terrain is off-trail and on a hillside with moderate brush and trees, so wear reasonable shoes and probably long pants. There are many tripping obstacles so please watch your step. It is easy to get disoriented when concentrating on the markers. And, oh yes, watch for other species in the night. You will see the deer droppings and critter tracks. A cougar has been spotted here. And, of course, this &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; Area 51... There is no parking lot at this park and you may not park on 9th/12th Street, but any of the nearby side streets are fine. The closest parking to the start is NW Sonora Drive at N 44° 04.207 W 121° 19.436. </groundspeak:long_description>

Head south, up hill and to the west of the chain link fence. Avoid nearby residences. The site is usually accessible except during heavy snow. For a longer stroll (about a half mile), park to the east at Summit Park (N 44° 04.522' W 121° 19.662') and take the trail from the parking lot around the north side of the butte. Follow the trail along the chain link fence to near Sylvan Park and continue up hill. Do not approach from the south up the paved access road because a fence will block your way to the cache. There is no way around the fence without trespassing on private property.

 The puzzle uses the coordinates of the Mt. Bachelor Summit Terminal, because this is the strategic site for receiving the FM signal from Eugene and relaying on from the shadow of Mt. Bachelor.

N43° 58.717,
W121° 41.234

This is a Mystery Cache with one projection from the Start.  You will need to visit the KLCC website to research and calculate the first set of coordinates before starting your search:

KLCC is the Public FM radio station at Lane Community College and soon to move to their new studio in downtown Eugene.  Service to the Bend – Redmond - Sisters – Madras – Prineville area (88.1 FM) has improved with the installation of a 5 kW transmitter (KLBR) at the Jack Pine Ridge radio consortium sharing a 300 ft. high antenna (blinking red tower light seen at night 10 miles west of Bend), NE of Tumalo Falls.  See the pictures in the gallery.

The signal feed to the Jack Pine Ridge KLBR transmitter comes by microwave from the summit of Mt. Bachelor at the Summit Lift Terminal, where the 89.7 FM signal is received from the Eugene transmitter, converted to microwave and relayed to the Jack Pine facility.  Final commissioning was completed January 26, 2006 after hauling equipment up Mt. Bachelor on Summit Lift, and to the transmitter at Jack Pine via snowmobile, helicopter, and snowcat.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Bailey says the cache is not located at these coordinates.  You must go to the posted associated website URL on this page header and learn some details about early irrigation in Deschutes County. 

 Bailey found that the Carey Act of 18XY was established to allow the Federal Government to contract with states for land reclamation.  She read that small scale irrigation began in Oregon by 1852.  The Cline Falls Power Company filed the earliest water rights on the Deschutes River in 18ZR

By 1904, the Pilot Butte Canal was completed and at the same time the Arnold Irrigation Company was incorporated.  That year, the Deschutes Irrigation and Power Company purchased two steam boilers to operate the drills.  The 20 horsepower boiler drove S drills; the 6 horsepower boiler drove T drill.  Together, they could bore through 400 feet a day in lava rock, where previously a rock crew of 3 men could bore only 18 to 20 feet a day.

Cache is located at N44*06.[X-Y][Y][Z], W121*16.[R-2][S+1][R+S+T+1]

 BC has been romping through the Juniper Ridge area with Bailey recently.  He decided to place this cache and included a True projection from the starting point to an intermediate waypoint.  At the Start waypoint, record the final Latitude.  At the projection waypoint, record the Longitude.

Additional Waypoints
HIDDEN: BA253N4 - Pressure Ridge

BC253N4 - Start
N 44° 07.189 W 121° 16.651
Begin your quest here, by finding a small container with True Bearing and Distance (miles) to the second waypoint.  Record the North Latitude from the slip of paper.  Make your projection and head off to the next waypoint.  Bracket your projection.  For example, if range was 0.444 mile, project for 0.44 mile and another projection for 0.45 and take 40% of the distance from the 0.44 to the 0.45 waypoint.  This is called Interpolation in the &quot;old school&quot; slide-rule jargon.

some background research on the Sutong Bridge, the world's longest
span cable-stayed bridge to date. The bridge is in Jiangsu Province
and spans the Yangtze River, the longest river in Asia. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sutong Bridge Project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longest cable-stayed bridge in the world is
currently under construction (June 2003 and open to traffic end of
2008)  to link the
ancient Chinese city of Suzhou to the industrial center of Nantong,
spanning the Changjiang River (a tributary of the Yangtze River),
108 km upstream of the Yangtze estuary leading to the Yellow
Sea.  Currently,
vehicle  traffic
between these two cities takes the hour drive around the Chengong
watercourse from the 

 Hangzhou Airport to Ningbo, or a longer ferry
ride.  By the end
of 2008, the bridge will speed the journey to 5
minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once completed, the bridge will create four new
world records for cable-stayed bridges: its (ABCD)m central span
will be the longest; the (EFG)m-high main bridge tower will be the
highest; the two foundation piers of the main bridge will be the
deepest; and the longest stay of the main bridge will also the
longest in the world, so far, at (HIJ)m.  The total length of the bridge
will be (KLMN)m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checksums:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABCD = 17; EFG = 9; HIJ = 13; KLMN =
16;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a metal tag with a True
bearing and distance to the cache, nearby a local Central Oregon
bridge.  This tag is located at Canal Rock Waypoint:
N44*PQ.RST, W121*UV.WXY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calculation:  Do the math below, substutiting
the numbers you find on the Internet search in the four
measurements above.  For example, if Z = (D + K)/4, then Z =
(8 + 8)/4 = 16/4 = 4 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P = J; Q = C + 1; R = H; S = D; T = (G –
E)/3;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U = (I – H)/3; V = M; W = (K – N + L); X = I – H;
Y = K - L&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">BC thought this was an interesting structure for sheltering livestock.  Bring your own writing stick and careful not to lose the lid on the extraction. 

 BC got lost in June of 2008 for 9 days after being separated from his pal Bailey, while geocaching on the Powell Butte series.  True to his Border Collie smartness, he took good care during his travels and was successfully recovered at Roberts Bay CG some 45 miles from last seen on Powell Butte.  He stays close to the family these days.  He had lost 8 pounds in weight, had some thorny seeds in his fur but otherwise unhurt.

Take caution with the water hazard nearby and don't get too hung up on the nearby barbed wire fencing.  Please secure the lid tightly when you are replacing the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

canyon views. 

 Bailey thought this south end of Fryrear Canyon resembled terrain
from some of her adventures down in the Sierra Madre south of Creel
where the real Copper Canyon resides. Could not locate any
Tarahumara natives today.
http://www.galenfrysinger.com/copper_canyon_mexico.htm 

Best approach is to take the dirt road east from Fryrear Rd at
N44*14.018, W121*25.367 and travel east until the GPSr bearing is
perpendicular to this track. Look around for a likely access point,
park the rig and find a trail into the Canyon. This is also an
excellent starting point to complete the GeoGolf south end caches.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We found this
interesting viewpoint after completing the
Tulpa Cache. This little canyon
(
section 14 on this map:) is best accessed from Lower Bridge
Market Road and thence on the dirt road to the listed coordinates.
Perhaps millennia ago, this canyon was
part of the Deschutes River, but it is now high and dry. I included
a view using Google Earth, and you can grab the nearby
Tulpa Cache during your
journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Watch out for
unspent paintballs during your hike, and be cautious when on the
overlook. If enough of us complain to the Prineville BLM about the
paint ball wars being conducted in this canyon, they might just
close it off to these activities, including the motorized vehicles
driving on the canyon floor. Find the BLM at this reference:
mailto:Molly_Brown@blm.gov&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You will need to
visit the website listed at
the TOP of this page to solve the puzzle, and there are some
links below that take you directly to the necessary
details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From the listed
latitude, N44° 21.637, solve the puzzle for N44° 21.PQR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
PQR =
Jack’s National Number
(minus) year that Mt.
Bachelor NSP was organized (plus) 241&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From the listed
longitude, W121°15.382, solve the puzzle for W121°15.XYZ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
XYZ =
[number
of people in the avalanche training probe line picture (times)
number
of regions in Pacific Northwest Division (times)
types
of NSP Membership ] plus 326&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Washington View Point pull-out and head east to the SECOND of the smaller pull-outs east of this BIG pull-out.  Park on the cinders and hop to the east side of the guard rail, thence uphill about 60 ft.  USE EXTREME CAUTION ON YOUR APPROACH, DUE TO HIGH SPEED VEHICLES!!  Keep the pooch and kids in the rig for this quick grab. 

 We noticed this fruit-bearing apple tree about 15 years ago along Santiam Pass HWY.  Likely the old tree was started from an apple core tossed by a passer-by...early vehicle traffic, horse person, hiker, Indian, alien?  Oregon Geographic Names indicates that pioneer settler Andrew Wiley made his way with two others from the Willamette Valley to Central Oregon in 1859, when this route was a trail.  Originally, Santiam Pass was known as Hogg Pass, after Col. T. Egenton Hogg who attempted to build a railroad in the area. The current highway was mapped and constructed in the 1928-29 timeframe, so the apple tree started from a discarded apple around 80 years ago or sooner.

Enjoy the views and consider the hard time this old tree has endured.  Do not eat the apples, since the tree is probably stuffed with lead from the earlier fuel additives.  We grabbed a ripe apple and hope to plant it in Bend</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a simple and quick cache in a magnetic key box.  Bring your own signature tool, please, and try to repackage without breaking the lid. 

 Apprentice Sculptor Dick Schwenk assisted with this artwork.  The plaque on the north side of the pole cites Bend as the workshop, but no date is offered.

Since muggles have given legs to this logbook on several occasions, to log this cache, please post a group picture on the website along with your &quot;found&quot; entry and comments.  The logbook had been kept beneath the wooden column, on top of the concrete pad.

Have fun!  KR</groundspeak:long_description>

June 5th 2010. I was 12 years old when I went missing. For 10 years my buddy 
would take me backpacking and mountain climbing. I have had the privilege of 
standing on top of Mt Hood, Mt Adams, Mt Shasta, Mt Rainier, Mt St Helens and 
Mt Washington. In 2001 We did the Pacific Crest Trail. In the end I had logged 
12,364 miles. I loved every minuet of it.
I have rated this cache with summer in mind. During the winter this could be up to an 8 hour snowshoe trip just to get there. The road is passable to a regular car but I would encourage at least a high ground clearance vehicle. There are also several hiking trails up to Flag Point and Badger creek Wilderness has some amazing trails.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">After visiting &quot;On the Way to Oz&quot; I felt inspired to put a cache out in an area that really did not have many caches. Besides, isn't the Emerald City worthy of more than one cache! So, after surveying some nice spots along a very wide trail (which is actually a gated dirt road), a new cache was born.

To get to this cache head on out on I-90 past the pass. Take the Cabin Creek exit and go to the north side of the freeway along a dirt road.

The cache is located about 30 feet off of the established road/trail. Its located in some prime cross country skiing area. I would advise against this doing this during the winter as the cache will likely be buried by several feet of snow. If you decide to go for this during the winter, you are on your own.

Please rehide the cache IN THE EXACT SPOT you found this. Also be warned, there are muggles who routinely walk the trails. After placing the cache, we ran into an elderly couple who stated that the frequently walk the trails in the area several times a week and love to cross country ski in the area in the winter. With this in mind, please keep your stealth guard up!

Cache it REAL!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to KC Geo Clue! 

In this cache series you will find extra large bison caches that will give you clues to find the final puzzle cache. If you have ever played the game Clue, you shouldn't have any problem with this cache series. Thanks to California Cacher &quot;Winkster&quot; for allowing me to steal heavily from his idea.

King County will serve as the &quot;board&quot; for this game. There will be a series of 6 caches representing each of the Clue suspects spread throughout King County as well as the final puzzle cache. You, are the star Medina Police Detective. You have been summoned to a large mansion on the Medina waterfront  to investigate the death of Mr. Boddy, a local multi-millionaire who suddenly and tragically passed away during a dinner party. Your job as the detective will be to &quot;investigate&quot; each of the &quot;suspects&quot; (caches) when you visit the cache and log the find. Inside each suspect cache you will find information that will help you narrow down who done it, with what weapon and in what room the evil act took place. Each cache will have a laminated card with SWR numbers as well as a separate three digit number. These SWR numbers correspond to the numbers on the Detective Note Pad that is attached to each cache. The &quot;S&quot; numbers are the suspects, numbers S1 - S6 which represent the all of the game characters. On the Detective Note Pad, Ms. Scarlet, for instance is S1. The &quot;W&quot; numbers will be for the weapons, W1 - W6. The knife is W1 on the Detective Note Pad. The &quot;R&quot; numbers are the rooms, R1 - R9. The Hall is R9 on the note pad.  During your &quot;investigation&quot; of the &quot;suspect&quot;, you will want to write done the SWR and three digit numbers you find in each cache on your detective note pad there by eliminating the suspects, weapons and rooms. Please note that you will need ALL THE NUMBERS on the laminated card to find the final puzzle cache! Also, PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE LAMINATED CARD THAT HAS THE SWR NUMBER PRINTED ON IT! The final puzzle cache will give you instructions as to what to do with the information you obtained from each suspect (cache).  

Col. Mustard  

When you arrive to interrogate Col. Mustard, you notice that he is wearing a dark gold colored jacket. In your discussions with Col. Mustard, you find that Col. Mustard is a war hero and severed in a couple of wars. Col. Mustard, now a retired military veteran and avid gun collector. He met Mr. Boddy at a gun show and found that he and Mr. Boddy had similar tastes as gun collecting goes. He found out that Mr. Boddy has a highly coveted collection of civil war Colts that the good Colonel would love to have as his own. The Colonel's confidence oozes as you would expect from any military veteran and its not too far fetched to see the good Colonel using the revolver on Mr. Boddy to obtain the coveted Colt collection!

Col. Mustard, using military tactics of cover and concealment, is located......next to a very large rock and an aptly colored gate. The colonel claims theres a lot of buzzing nearby!

Happy sleuthing!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This area really needed another cache, so I dropped a fairly
easy one.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When you approach GZ you will understand why I named it Off
Ramp.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Many awesome trails and caches on Snoqualmie.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When hiking back down we smelled smoke, and not from a
campsite. We&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;soon found the smoldering ground that soon would have gotten
out of hand.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We managed to get it out and then hiked down to attain cell
coverage and&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;called DNR and Forestry to let them know and give them saved
Lat/Long.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please be careful, it doesnt take much to start a
fire.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Given the &quot;short description&quot; you can guess that this little hide is on the Mt. Margaret trail on the way to GCD. There is a bit of a story about this cache which I will try to keep it brief.

The name Team LPH was a name we jokingly and collectively gave ourselves which stands not for &quot;Lamp Post Hide&quot; but rather Lame, Pathetic and Hopeless. We were discussing putting a cache along this trail when Welljointed thought it would be a fun idea to &quot;strewn caches every tenth of a mile&quot; turning this beautiful trail into a cache highway. I (Mc3cats) indicated that this was a bad idea as certain local cachers would not take too kindly to us doing that. WE laughed a bit and then I suggested that we put a cache out at the spot where we stopped for a breather and had a laugh about a cache highway. Hence the cache was born!

Now for the cache. Its a small lock N lock container in proper &quot;clothing&quot; hidden in a spot where ones feet never need to leave the trail to find. This container has been beta tested by Welljointed and Terrible Ts as well as myself. Our coordinates from three different units came out almost identical. So, you will have as close to dead on coords without spending 30K for a high end GPS unit! You will see the beta testers signatures, but rest assured the betas are not and will not claim FTF. Speaking of FTFs, the prize consists of two &quot;Georges&quot;.

One quick note about parking. It is located 100 yards from the trailhead at the Mt. Margaret parking area. You will need either a National Forest Day Pass OR a Forest Pass Annual Pass. These can be obtained online at the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest website or at some local retailers like REI.

From all of the members of Team LPH, enjoy the hike and good luck on the find!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to KC Geo Clue!

In this cache series you will find extra large bison caches that will give you clues to find the final puzzle cache. If you have ever played the game Clue, you shouldn't have any problem with this cache series. Thanks to California Cacher &quot;Winkster&quot; for allowing me to steal heavily from his idea.

King County will serve as the &quot;board&quot; for this game. There will be a series of 6 caches representing each of the Clue suspects spread throughout King County as well as the final puzzle cache. You, are the star Medina Police Detective. You have been summoned to a large mansion on the Medina waterfront  to investigate the death of Mr. Boddy, a local multi-millionaire who suddenly and tragically passed away during a dinner party. Your job as the detective will be to &quot;investigate&quot; each of the &quot;suspects&quot; (caches) when you visit the cache and log the find. Inside each suspect cache you will find information that will help you narrow down who done it, with what weapon and in what room the evil act took place. Each cache will have a laminated card with SWR numbers as well as a separate three digit number. These SWR numbers correspond to the numbers on the Detective Note Pad that is attached to each cache. The &quot;S&quot; numbers are the suspects, numbers S1 - S6 which represent the all of the game characters. On the Detective Note Pad, Ms. Scarlet, for instance is S1. The &quot;W&quot; numbers will be for the weapons, W1 - W6. The knife is W1 on the Detective Note Pad. The &quot;R&quot; numbers are the rooms, R1 - R9. The Hall is R9 on the note pad.  During your &quot;investigation&quot; of the &quot;suspect&quot;, you will want to write down the SWR and three digit numbers you find in each cache on your detective note pad there by eliminating the suspects, weapons and rooms. Please note that you will need ALL THE NUMBERS on the laminated card to find the final puzzle cache! Also, PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE LAMINATED CARD THAT HAS THE SWR NUMBER PRINTED ON IT! The final puzzle cache will give you instructions as to what to do with the information you obtained from each suspect (cache). 

KC GEO CLUE - THE FINAL

THIS CACHE IS NOT LOCATED AT THE LISTED COORDINATES!  To find this cache, super geo sleuth, you will need to obtain all of the SWR numbers and three digit numbers from all 6 of the caches in this series (listed below). Then figure out who the murderer is, what weapon was used and in what room via the process of elimination using your detective note pad. If completed correctly, the note pad will show the final SWR numbers that you need. Once you have found all 6 suspect caches in the series:

Add all of the three-digit numbers found in each of the suspect caches. Add the SWR numbers that you found as a process of elimination (SWR#s NOT FOUND IN ANY OF THE SUSPECT CACHES) to the sum of all of the 3-digit numbers you found in the suspect caches. Take that number and put it in the blank below to complete the web address which will reveal the final coordinates for this cache:

HAPPY HUNTING!

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carnation/Tolt
-- Thumbnail History&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;www.HistoryLink.org&quot;&gt;HistoryLink.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Essay 391&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carnation (previously Tolt), a rural community along the
Snoqualmie River in&lt;br/&gt;
eastern King County, was founded early in the settlement of the
county. The town&lt;br/&gt;
was named after the world-famous Carnation Dairy, a dairy operation
that located&lt;br/&gt;
in Tolt in 1910.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Carnation has seen many changes over the years, not
the least of&lt;br/&gt;
which is its own name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confluence of the Tolt and Snoqualmie rivers has been the
main village&lt;br/&gt;
site for the Snoqualmie tribe for thousands of years. When white
settlers&lt;br/&gt;
arrived in the 1850s, the tribe greeted them in a friendly manner,
so much so&lt;br/&gt;
that in 1855, Chief Patkanim ceded the valley and tribal sites to
the United&lt;br/&gt;
States, opening the way for many homesteaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Deserter to Respected Citizen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first white settler, James Entwistle, had deserted the Union
Army at Fort&lt;br/&gt;
Steilacoom (located along Puget Sound, just south of present-day
Tacoma).&lt;br/&gt;
Entwistle took up 169 acres of land at the confluence of the
rivers, established&lt;br/&gt;
a trading post, and later became successful in hop farming. At the
time of his&lt;br/&gt;
death in 1902, he was very well respected in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after Entwistle arrived, many others came to the valley to
work the&lt;br/&gt;
land. Once the heavy underbrush was cleared in the valley, small
logging camps&lt;br/&gt;
began dotting the hillsides. Skid roads (roads made of greased
logs)were built&lt;br/&gt;
from the hills to the Snoqualmie River, and they were used to get
the logs down&lt;br/&gt;
to the water. With the valley cleared of brush, the fertile land
beneath was&lt;br/&gt;
ready for farming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting to Tolt from Seattle was no easy task, but many
prospective farmers&lt;br/&gt;
did. W. A. Templeton, writing in 1953, remembered as a child taking
the ferry&lt;br/&gt;
across Lake Washington, riding pack horses to Redmond, and then
following 20&lt;br/&gt;
miles of trails to Tolt. Once at the river, goods were transported
across in a&lt;br/&gt;
large Indian canoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1879, enough families were living in Tolt to necessitate the
construction&lt;br/&gt;
of a school, which was no more than a log shack. In 1882,
schoolchildren moved&lt;br/&gt;
to a larger building. In 1895, a proper schoolhouse was built. This
grammar&lt;br/&gt;
school would serve Tolt children for almost 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the nineteenth century, the community of Tolt
mainly consisted&lt;br/&gt;
of cabins, the school, a church, and a social club. On May 6, 1902,
the town was&lt;br/&gt;
platted and soon more businesses and services became available to
the loggers,&lt;br/&gt;
farmers, and their families. On New Years' Eve, 1912, the town of
Tolt was&lt;br/&gt;
incorporated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Railroad Arrives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many events, but especially the introduction of railroads to the
area, led to&lt;br/&gt;
the incorporation of Tolt. The Great Northern Railroad had reached
Tolt from the&lt;br/&gt;
north in 1910. In 1911, the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul
Railroad built a&lt;br/&gt;
branch line from the South. The Milwaukee would later take over the
Great&lt;br/&gt;
Northern tracks up to Monroe, 15 miles to the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Milwaukee Railroad also built a railyard and depot in Tolt.
The railroad&lt;br/&gt;
introduced a fast and reliable method of transportation and
permitted Tolt to&lt;br/&gt;
become a boomtown. Before the railroad, logs and dairy goods had
been shipped on&lt;br/&gt;
the unreliable river, with its heavy flooding in the early spring
and low water&lt;br/&gt;
levels at the end of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home of Contented Cows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dairy farming was an economic staple for Tolt ever since the
brush had been&lt;br/&gt;
cleared, but Carnation Dairy put the town on the map. In 1910,
Elbridge Amos&lt;br/&gt;
Stuart cleared 350 acres of timber and brush and brought in a
purebred bull and&lt;br/&gt;
86 registered Holstein cows to form a research herd. Two years
later, he cleared&lt;br/&gt;
400 more acres, and today the farm rests on some 1,200 acres of
land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The valley became world-famous as the &quot;Home for Contented
Cows.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
One cow from the herd, nicknamed &quot;Possum Sweetheart,&quot; produced
more&lt;br/&gt;
than 37,000 pounds of milk in one year -- a world record. Over the
years many&lt;br/&gt;
famous people visited the farm to see her, including boxer Jack
Dempsey, who&lt;br/&gt;
tried his hand at milking her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's In a Name?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1917, the town of Tolt changed its name to Carnation, in
honor of the&lt;br/&gt;
farms. Unfortunately this did not sit well with the Indians and
early settlers.&lt;br/&gt;
The area had always been known as Tolt, even before white settlers
arrived. The&lt;br/&gt;
Snoqualmie name &quot;Tolthue&quot; (river of swift waters) had been in use
for&lt;br/&gt;
more than 10,000 years. To the Indians and pioneers, the use of the
name Tolt&lt;br/&gt;
over a few millennia of seemed like a good test of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few years, as resources dwindled, the logging
camps ceased&lt;br/&gt;
operations and the town's heyday was over. The swift changes that
brought the&lt;br/&gt;
community into being had reached a plateau, and since then the
local farms have&lt;br/&gt;
provided a steady economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confusion, Maybe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy over the name change continued, though, and in
1928 the town&lt;br/&gt;
decided to change the name back to Tolt. Unfortunately, the train
depot and the&lt;br/&gt;
post office names remained as Carnation, and for the next two
decades, confusion&lt;br/&gt;
reigned. Some maps showed the town as Tolt, some as Carnation. Some
maps showed&lt;br/&gt;
both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in 1951, the city changed its name back to Carnation to
end the&lt;br/&gt;
discrepancies once and for all. In the late 1990s, with an
estimated population&lt;br/&gt;
of about 1,500 (U.S. Census Bureau, 1996), the town was officially
named&lt;br/&gt;
Carnation, but there are those who still call it Tolt. Some things

Got to GZ with 10 plus cachers and to our surprise we couldn't locate the cache [:0].  We went off after a nearby traditional cache then returned.  After some head scratching because some of them found a traditional there earlier we agreed it would be a good idea to drop a replacement since it was going to be a popular find for the day.

This under utilized area is always quiet and peaceful, Time is slowly erasing the evil that once lurked in these woods. Despite the hair pulling that ensued while looking for the nasty evil that was once here I have always loved this small area.

I have always enjoyed walking these paths, and have returned many times despite having found the caches here. Time to return the favor and add one of my own. Nothing hard here, just a straight forward ammo can in the woods in a typical PNW hide. Just keep in mind that the easiest path to a place most certainly is not a straight line off the main path.</groundspeak:long_description>

Parking Pull-out nearby.  After you find the cache, take the little trail down from the pullout to the creek &amp; enjoy!  That is, if the primitive campsite is not already occupied.  

While you're in the area, drive on up the road and check out the views.  Better bring the camera!

Lake Bosworth covers 105 surface acres with it's deepest point at
79 feet. There is a nice Dept. of Fish &amp; Wildlife boatramp
&amp; fisherman's access at the north end of the lake. There are a
few nice spots to throw in a fishing line from shore there too. The
fish inhabiting the lake are rainbow, cutthroat trout and bass. No
combustion engines are allowed on the lake - so leave yours at
home. 
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a standard ammo can. Please take the time to
re-hide it well. The area is only open during daylight hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO NOT HUNT FOR THIS AT NIGHT!!&lt;/b&gt; - the area cab be extremely
treacherous in low light and you will need light and good footing to prevent
serious injury to yourself. I wouldn't recommend taking the kids
out of the car for this one. Have fun &amp; good hunting.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

CCC Camp opens on Bacon Creek in May 1933. &lt;br/&gt;
In May 1933, Camp Skagit, F-13, opens on Bacon Creek in Skagit
County six weeks after Congress passes the Emergency Conservation
Work Act. The Act creates the program later called the Civilian
Conservation Corps (CCC). The CCC was a part of President Franklin
D. Roosevelt's vision of putting the nation back to work. Young men
aged 18-25 could earn $30.00 a month, $25.00 of which went back to
their families. While providing employment and housing for men out
of work, the &quot;3 C’s&quot; created a lasting legacy of beautiful parks,
buildings, trails, bridges, and fire lookouts. &lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Just before the bridge that crosses Bacon creek you will find a
spot to pull over.  You aren't far from the cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">If you have ever owned a boat which required backing the trailer down a ramp in order to launch, then you will appreciate the fun it can be to sit near a boat launch and watch the antics of less experienced drivers trying to back down a boat ramp. One of my favorites is a boat launch near Campbell River on Vancouver Island, it, and others have provided hours of entertainment, at least for us viewing. For those launching it is an entirely different matter as you watch the &quot;guide&quot; waving their arms, pointing first this way, then that way, and generally making hand motions that obviously the driver does not understand. I am sure the beginnings of a vacation are often started on a bad note as the attempts to launch the boat are made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So take a while and just sit and watch, you will see an interesting variety of launching techniques employed here. I would caution you not to offer to help when you see things obviously going wrong, and don't get caught laughing or logging this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

This one belongs to my 5 year old and she named it The Chick Cache because she misses our pet chickens.  These caches are a way for my husband to combine our hobbies.. Geocaching, history and the KVR!

The cache is just off the trail.  It is well hidden.  The trail is level with a few muddy areas.  Strollers should be ok, but wheelchairs might have trouble.

We spent the long weekend in Hope exploring and barely spent any time in our hotel room thanks to all the wonderful trails.  Even our 3 girls trecked along with us with hardly any complaining. :)

Hopefully the GPS isn't too far off, but it was a little jumpy.  Took 3 readings and found the midpoint.

Congrats to Catchers in the Wry (and geopoodle) for the FTF!

Centre.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Welcome to Hope, BC!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope is strategically located at the junction of Hwy 1, 3, 5 and
7 at the confluence of the Fraser and Coquihalla Rivers where the
Fraser Valley and Fraser Canyon meet. The area is thus blessed with
easily accessible mountainous terrain as well as lakes and rivers
that offer outdoor activites that range from camping, hiking,
fishing, golf, river rafting, soaring and mountain biking to
boating, gold-panning, rockhounding and winter sports (Nordic and
downhill skiing, snowboarding and snowshoeing in nearby Manning
Park).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors to the area will also enjoy attractions that include
the large downtown wood sculptures that make Hope the Chainsaw
Carving Capital; the Coquihalla Canyon Provincial Park (featuring
the spactacular Othello-Quintette Tunnels of the abandoned Kettle
Valley Railway); the Hope slide; various museums/art galleries; and
Hell's Gate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visitor centre is your one stop shop for everything Hope.
Their professionally trained visitor information counselors can
help you with anything from local activities, attractions and
accommodations to highway routes, hiking trails and anything else
that might interest you about Hope. You'll also find souvenirs, a

more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hope Museum shows the history, culture and heritage of Hope.

&lt;h3&gt;The Geocache&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a 2 stage multi-cache. The posted coordinates will bring

are instructions for finding the Final (a regular sized
container).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note that this geocache is only
available during the regular visitor centre hours of operation
shown below. You cannot log a find on this cache if you visit
outside of these hours.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

This cache is placed by my 9 year old.  The GPS was bouncing around, so we recorded 4 and took an average.  Its a lock n lock filled with toys and a log book/pen.  We found this to be a great way for my husband's love of history and the KVR and my love of geocaching :)

Congrats to Catchers in the Wry (and geopoodle) for the FTF!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the 1st of 3 caches we've placed along the KVR railbed in Hope.  Parking is just off of Union Bar Road, or you can also reach the trail from Kettle Valley Railway Road, but its a steep climb from that end.

This is our first cache ever placed!  The name has nothing to do with the cache itself, its just what my 6 year old decided to name it. :)  Its a medium sized lock n lock.

My husband has been modeling the KVR and so we've spent a lot of time in Hope exploring anything to do with the KVR and I love geocaching, so we are trying to combine our hobbies :)

Its an easy walk on a flat trail and the cache is right off the trail.

Contains log book and pen and a bunch of toys for trade.

Thank you SO much to Catchers in the Wry for the FTF and all the help!
