 The Tou Ke Mountain located the eastern border place of Taichung City.
There are five hiking paths on reach the Tou Ke Mountaintop
I proposed hiking path V

Hiking Path V
It is about 2130 meters long and between 595 and 859 meters above sea level. The path mainly goes along the crest line between Tou Ke Mountain and Er Ke Mountain and the main cre st of the Tou Ke Mountain System. It connects Hiking Paths I, II, III, and IV as it winds along the top of each mountain. Along the way are several great viewing points, such as Heisong Pavilion, Gaofong Pavilion, Tou Ke Ridge, and Mu Ta. The Tou Ke Ridge's elevation is 859 meters, the highest point of Taichung City.

After the end of the Japanese colonial period in Taiwan, the first magistrate of Hsin-chu County ordered to reconstruct the dam, resulting in a 30 square kilometer area for storing water. It was the first large-scaled construction in Hsin-chu since the establishment of the local government.</groundspeak:long_description>

The landscape and interior design had an atmosphere of leisure residency and matched the subtle character of glass art. After Taiwan’s restoration, the building was occupied by the Takeover Committee, American army consultant allegation, and military police station, consequently. Since the function of the building was changing according to the needs of the residents, the interior compartment had changed dramatically. The two stories concrete building annex to the north eastern corner of the main building had evolved from the horizontal court building of European style to the vertical development official building. Nevertheless, this museum still maintains European style with contemporary Oriental architecture by the brick wall erected on the south western side and the classic image of the lobby. It also next to many leisure resorts such as Confucius Temple, Zoo, gymnasium, and holiday market of flower.</groundspeak:long_description>
