            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Starting your trip along the Dyea Road you will get a great view down the inlet towards Skagway. Continuee on your journey up the Dyea Road towards the Chilkoot Trail and West Creek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dyea (pronounced /da?.'i?/ dye-ee) is a former town in the U.S. state of Alaska. A few people live on individual small homesteads in the valley; however, it is largely abandoned. It is located at the convergence of the Taiya River and Taiya Inlet on the south side of the Chilkoot Pass within the limits of the Municipality of Skagway Borough, Alaska. During the Klondike Gold Rush prospectors disembarked at its port and used the Chilkoot Trail, a Tlingit trade route over the Coast Mountains, to begin their journey to the gold fields around Dawson City, Yukon, about 800 km (500 miles) away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The port at Dyea had shallow water, while neighboring Skagway had deep water. Dyea was abandoned when the White Pass and Yukon Route railroad chose the White Pass Trail (instead of the alternative Chilkoot Trail), which began at Skagway, for its route.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chilkoot Trail and Dyea Site is a U.S. National Historic Landmark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dyea is now within the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park. All that remains are a number of foundations surrounded by scraps of lumber and metal, 3 cemeteries, including one where almost every person buried died on the same date in an avalanche on the gold rush trail, and the ruins of the wharf.[1] Visitors can usually spot brown bears, black bears, caribou, and eagles. Brown bears tend to use the Dyea inlets to feed during salmon spawning season (July-August).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK2EHH0 - Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 59째 28.745 W 135째 20.316&lt;br/&gt;Downhill from the cache but a safe place to park </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This entire area is rich with history and loaded with artifacts
dating back to the original Klondike gold rush of 1898. The 33 mile
route along the Taiya river, over the famous &quot;Golden Staircase&quot; and
finishing along some of the most beautiful Canadian lakes god
created will literally seem like a walk in the park&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Park Service maintains a ranger station and
campground just up the street from this cache location. The
official start of the Chilkoot trail is about .4 miles in the other
direction, at a well marked trailhead on your right, just before
you cross over the Taiya river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; My wife and I
completed this epic trek along with good friends OMGcrew &amp;
hixfromthestix during the Summer of 2010. I would encourage everyone to retrace the steps of
the gold rush miners of 1898, it should be on everyones &quot;bucket
list&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache is placed with the property owners permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to stop in and say hello after visiting the cache
location. Fred and Kathy Hosford are both cacher friendly.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congrats to 1Queenand4Jokers on the FTFBP (before publishing) I
have to assume someone tipped you off about this one. More Congrats
to the Pirates of the Yukon for the more traditional and authentic
FTF.&lt;/p&gt;
