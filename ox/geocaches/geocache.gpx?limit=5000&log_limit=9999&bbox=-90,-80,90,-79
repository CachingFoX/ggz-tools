WARNING:  This cache involves some dangerous activities, do not even attempt this cache if:

1:  You are afraid of heights
2:  You can't swim
3:  You are alone


Also, this area is used by hunters and the military, so it is not unusual to see people with rifles in this area.  If you happen to come across some soldiers training here in the woods, please do not bother them, just leave for awhile and come back later.

Like I said earlier, this cache involves some dangerous activities, so do not do this by yourself, have a buddy with you.  The buddy does not need to do the dangerous activities, they can just watch.  And if you can't find someone to come with you, just send me a message, I work out in this area and we can find a time to meet up.

Have fun.

No Moore (county) Micros aka NM(c)m: Within one mile of this location are 28 caches. Of the 28 caches, 20 of them are micros. I am not against micro caches, they have there places, but Moore county has an abundance of them! Geocaching is often described as &quot;modern day treasure hunting&quot; when did signing a piece of paper become a treasure?!? Please hide a micro when there is no way to hide something bigger. Don't hide a micro just because you finished a roll of film or took all your medicine. It is tough to get new people into Geocaching when all I can show them is pill bottles and film canisters.  </groundspeak:long_description>

The rancor is deadly and one of the most hideous beasts I have ever
encountered, best described as a walking collection of fangs and
claws, with no thought other than to kill and eat.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You are looking for another green pill bottle with a geocaching&lt;br/&gt;label on it. Parking for this cache should be obvious. It is a&lt;br/&gt;short hike back to the hiding location, and should be easy for kids&lt;br/&gt;and possibly wheelchair accessible. This is an old beautiful&lt;br/&gt;church, and we recently just found that their is a recreation area&lt;br/&gt;behind the church. You will see a sign, and I wonder if it will&lt;br/&gt;stump you as much as it did me? It just sits there and I can see no&lt;br/&gt;purpose to it. Anyway, the cache is hidden just inside the woods.&lt;br/&gt;There are few muggles on Monday thru Saturday, but Sunday's are a&lt;br/&gt;whole other story. Hope you enjoy the search. **Congrats to&lt;br/&gt;3Cbasskids for being FTF**

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a small camouflaged square rubbermaid lock box. It has a&lt;br/&gt;few small items for trading. Please re-hide this one like you found&lt;br/&gt;it, or better if you can. I bought my motorcycle a few years back,&lt;br/&gt;and I had just brought it home from the dealership, and I had to&lt;br/&gt;get out and ride. It looked like rain, but I thought it would just&lt;br/&gt;be a quick summer shower. As soon I left Trace it got dark, and&lt;br/&gt;started to drizzle. I pulled into a cemetery and darted off into&lt;br/&gt;the woods to stay dry. 45 minutes later it was still&lt;br/&gt;raining...hard! Sucked it up and drove the bike back home. Even&lt;br/&gt;when I was sitting there in the woods I thought this would be a&lt;br/&gt;great place for a hide. So today I went out and hid one there. The&lt;br/&gt;terrain is not difficult, but definitely not handicap friendly.&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to TEAM YO MAMA for FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

It is a short walk from the parking lot, and the cache sits right on the trail.  No need to bushwhack since there is a trail directly behind the fenced in area on the backside of the church.  Please park in the church parking lot so you do not attract the attention of the residents living around the church.  You are looking for a camouflaged 35mm film canister.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you remove canister, please put it back exactly as you found it.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the search.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to TEAM YO MAMA for being the FTF!

Difficulty may go up after a good rain. Stay low and&lt;br/&gt;this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;should &lt;br/&gt;be an easy grab!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True"> In 1982 the University of North Carolina baseball team was locked in a tie with ECU in an early season matchup. The score was 5-5 in the bottom of the 12th when Jeff Hubbard hit a two run walk-off home run. The ball sailed into the dark over the left field fence as UNC celebrated their victory. A fan ran to retrieve the ball and came across a drainage tunnel in the woods behind Boshamer Field. The student had found the Ehaus tunnels and thus tunneling had been born. Thus goes the legend of tunneling at UNC.

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in a nice
little park located near downtown Greensboro. I've been coming here
for years and decided that it would be an ideal first hide
location. Its a great place to take a stroll, enjoy a bit of nature
and maybe catch a cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need to
trample the ivy floor, tear up or destroy any part of the nature
around the cache.. You should be able to get to it from the
trail.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is small
Lock-n-Lock container.&lt;br/&gt;
Original contents include
a FTF 2006 GeoCache pin.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a small container that can accept coins or Geo pins, so bring your own writing tool.

Please re-hide the cache just as you found it so as not to compromise the location and so that the next finder will have the same enjoyment/frustration as you did.

Congratulations to BearOakDruid for FTF!!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Not your standard park-n-grab. This is the first hide for Mrs. TarheelTracker and the name includes both her favorite color and cartoon. The homemade container is one she got at the Cache-a-Latte event in Martinsville and it does have just a small splash of pink showing you where to open it. The hide is an easy walk from the parking lot and is perfect for the significant other who does not like to cache much. Use your brain to find this easy cache, but don't over think it. If you are a &quot;Pinky and The Brain&quot; fan then share your favorite quote, episode or plot in your log this cache. Narf!</groundspeak:long_description>

Another year, another birthday, another
cache&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Yep, another year older, and in
keeping with tradition, the old TrailDawg placed a cache to mark
the event.  There are no trails leading to this puppy,
bushwhack all the way.&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is just your basic camo'd plastic container.  As
always, remember that this is the woods and is inhabited by furry
critters, multi-legged,blood sucking varmints, and flora that will
make you scratch and itch.  &lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is near the Franklin Town Park, which is where you should park. There is only one road that leads to this area, so just watch out for the sign. You do not need to cross any fences to get to this cache. I repeat, you do not need to cross any fences to get to this cache! During certain events and times of day, you will be in total view of everyone around you, so please use the utmost stealth to find this cache!

This is Franklin's very first cache. The town is very small, but it has some great history and beautiful historical buildings. If you don't enjoy seeing old, historical towns, it doesn't offer much else in the way of entertainment unless you like to go bowling.

This cache is set to be published during the one gem this town does offer: The Treasure Mountain Festival, which is the third weekend of September every year. In fall 2010, it will be held during September 17-19. The festival has a few things to offer, including arts and crafts, a reenactment of the burning of Fort Seybert, and lots of great food.

The story behind the festival, taken directly from the website:

&quot;Our story begins closely after 1758, the year in which a band of Shawnee Indians attacked and burned Fort Seybert. Those settlers who escaped the massacre gave the following account of their captivity:

After leaving the site of the fort, the Indians, along with their prisoners, went northward across the mountain into Greenawalt Gap. From there, they journeyed through Germany Valley, Seneca, and on to their destination in the Ohio River Valley.

The valued possessions and treasures belonging to the settlers were collected in an iron kettle, a pole was inserted through the handle, and two braves carried the treasure. As trudging up the eastern slope of South Fork Mountain became more and more burdensome and the fear of pursuit made faster travel advisable, the two Indians fell behind the traveling group.

When they joined the captives and Indians, they were empty-handed; apparently they had hidden the treasure in the mountain. That they later returned to claim the treasure is doubtful , as this was their last known visit to the area.

In the years since, many locals inhabitants have believed so strongly in the treasure's existence, that they searched the still-visible mountain trail.

While no one has succeeded in uncovering this ancient &quot;pot of gold&quot;, treasures far more valuable and bounteous have been discovered. Underlying the natural beauty of the landscape, man can find virtually anything he is seeking. The farmer has cultivated acres and acres of fertile soil; the geologist has found in the rock a story of formation and a source of income; the biologist has encountered rare species of birds and plants; the spelunker has explored numerous caves and caverns; the sportsman has found a paradise amidst dense forests and sparkling streams; the vacationer has found camping areas complete with swimming and picnicking facilities; and the pleasure seeker has found peaceful surroundings and scenic attractions.&quot;

We would love to have you join us in celebration!</groundspeak:long_description>

There is a parking area very close to the cache. This one isn't very hard to find and there is another opencache just down the road. Close to the interstate and behind the hotel for out-of-towners. Enjoy!

Then bush wack the last little bit to the cache area.  In all it is about .16 away from the parking lot.  Around the cache area there are a lot of rocks where you can have some fun climbing. 


Congratulations to wvmtnbikerz for a great FTF.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Nice hide.  Took a little looking to find it.  Today my gpsr was a little bouncy around the large rocks.  Accuracy kept going from 28' to 45'.   Found the cache and at first my GPSr was indicating 42' at GZ with 45' accuracy.  After a few moments it indicated 20' with 28' accuracy.  That is about what I see on almost all of the caches I have found.  Short off trail walk to this one.  LN.  TFTC.  


Boy was I surprised when I opened the cache and the log book.  On line (opencachingcom) there are only two log entries for this cache.  In the paper log book within the cache container there are a number of logs.

I found within the cache container 23 of my older style Dukemartin tokens that someone felt the need to collect from caches listed on the geocaching.com web site and to dump into this cache.  I never received any notice from anyone over on the geocaching.com web site that these tokens were collected and dumped here. 

Thanks to who ever dumped them here because now I can upgrade them to my latest version and put them back out again.

I wonder why people take the time to lookup the coords on opencaching.com, go find this cache, dump my older tokens and then not take the time to make a proper log on this site as to what they have done?</groundspeak:text>

This is a micro cache:
My grandparents came to the USA from Calabria Italy in the 1920s. My grandfather built a split rail fence around their property. This cache container was made out of the wood from one of those fence posts by my brother. 
This Cache is located at the edge of the WVU Core Arboretum. There is a tree guide near the road at the beginning of the park, and a large variety of trees to explore.

Lots of great activities for you and your family. And now an open cache! This cache is a lock and lock box with log, pen, and small trade items. Please rehide like you find it. Use the clue to help you find it. Don't get wet. Stealth Required! Also please note there are a couple other geocaches (from the other site) in this park but none are close enough to this one to cause any confusion.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This should be a fairly quick grab just off Point Marion Road. Some stealth is required. Park in the gravel at the bottom - there is no need to drive up into the parking lot. This is a medium sized lock-n-lock box with a log book, pen, and small trade items. Please rehide it like you find it and walk carefully!

There is a monument in the park to read why it is named this. Park across the street on Collins Ferry Road at the Laborers Union or nearby shop. Some stealth is required and watch out for poison ivy. Please rehide like you find it. Has log book, pen, and small trade items.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You won't find a banana split here, but you will find a nice view of the back of the WVU Science Farms. The best way to get to this cache is to park near the blue and gold gate on West Run Road and follow the correct trails up the hill to the cache (use your GPS). Get Arcturus first as this is the second open cache up the trail. This is a great place for biking and hiking. The cache is a medium sized lock-n-lock box containing a log book, pen, and small trade items.. Please rehide it like you find it. Thanks!

This is the third open cache along this trail so be sure to get Arcturus and Banana Split first. This cache is not up top of the hill - if you got Banana Split already, keep heading up that trail staying right. It is at the end of the rock hill. Be careful climbing the rocks. Please replace as you find it. Use the hint to help you find this one.

 If you look back in the woods, you can see the remains of Washington's Spring.  It's on posted private property, so don't trespass!  

As the old, rusty marker states, the spring is located on what was once known as Nemacolin's Trail, then later Braddock's Road.  George Washington stopped here several times and camped with General Braddock here on their march toward Fort Duquesne.  

The other nearby sign marks &quot;Washington-Braddock Road 1754-1756&quot;.

Take a moment to imagine on what it must've been like here so long ago.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Caution: This cache is near high ledges, please use extreme caution when approaching the cache area. Children should be closely supervised.

Rock Climbers Hide-a-Way is located on State Game Lands 51 in Fayette County. You can access this cache from two different parking areas. The first is located on SGL 51 at the following coordinates: N39 56.549, W079 31.293. Hiking to the cache from this parking area will involve quite an uphill climb and approximately a five mile hike round trip. If approaching from this parking area you can also find Elk Rock Playground cache as you head towards Rock Climbers Hide-a-Way. You will be following game land road for all but the last few hundred yards where you will turn right at a large rock cairn (N39 56.352, W079 32.856) onto a path with marked blazes.

The second parking area can be accessed from Kingan Hill Road at these coordinates: N39 55.904, W079 32.702. You will be parking at a small pull off with a gate. Please do not block the gate. The hike from this parking area will be approximately 1.5 miles round trip, mostly level. However this entrance is not on game land property. While hunters frequently park at this location, we have not received permission for parking here. Following the road from this parking area you will see a large rock cairn on your left (N39 56.352, W079 32.856). Follow the blazed trail from there.

Once on the blazed trail you will come to a three way split (N39 56.336, W079 32.893). You many choose to take the left trail to explore the rock base, straight to access the top of the ledge or continue on to your right to reach the cache. You will approach the rock ledges as you near the cache. Please use extreme caution around the ledges as there are deep crevices and hazardous drop offs. The cache is not located near the ledge. Enjoy the view! You may be lucky enough to see some rock climbers on the ledges while you are visiting.

Note: This cache is located on Pennsylvania State Gamelands. Please familiarize yourself with all of Pennsylvania's hunting seasons and their respective regulations. During the peak deer season (November 15 - December 15, except Sundays), you must &quot;wear a minimum of 250 square inches of daylight fluorescent orange-colored material on the head, chest and back combined or, in lieu thereof, a hat of the same colored material. The material shall be worn so it is visible in a 360° arc&quot;.


    * Parking is available.
    * Dogs allowed.
    * Use EXTREME CAUTION near the rock ledges.
    * We recommend daylight hours to avoid injury.
    * Beautiful view.
    * You may encounter poison plants, snakes, ticks, bears, and/or          kamikaze chipmunks…it’s an SGL cache.
    * Some very minor bushwhacking may be required depending on the season
    * Please re-hide the cache as good or better than found.
    * Please post a note if you have any concerns about this cache.

      WE HOPE YOU HAVE FUN WITH THIS CACHE!!

FTF....on Open Caching that is!!Hitting Fayette County caches today. Was fortunate to run into the CO at the boat launch.......on the wrong side of the lake! (Think we'd know better by now!!) Had a nice visit and was directed to the correct parking area! Got to ground zero pretty quickly. It took us a few minutes to find the cache. Our GPS said it was 50 feet off...but that could have been from the heavy foliage. Swapped out travel bugs. Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">At Round Hill Park in Elizabeth township in the southeast corner of
the county there is a modern working farm that supplements the park
itself. The exhibit farm is open every day of the year and affords
tens of thousands of school students on field trips, and daily
visitors, an interpretive program that revolves around the farm,
and the water and food cycles of life. The 17 picnic groves reflect
the life of a farm with names like Alfalfa, Timothy, Wagon Wheel
and Quiet Acres. Bring the family and some &quot;Duck Food&quot;! Take some
time to tour the farm, there is no charge to tour the grounds on
your own. 
&lt;p&gt;Here is

a map to get to the farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will enjoy this park. There are plenty of picnic tables and
playgrounds. Cachers should start at the top of the hill in the
park. The cache is in a camo'd 50 cal. ammo can. The hints below
are very specific, and should only be used if you are having
trouble. Please take a little time and do a first class camo job
when replacing the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

It is never crowded so you don't have to fight for turns on the rides. There is also a walking trail, filled with wood chips, for your walking pleasure. My kids which are 3 and 4, were able to help hide this one so the terrain isn't bad. There is plenty of parking available and a Port-O-John on site. There are also several picnic tables so make a lunch date for this one.

Had a blast picking up one micro after another today. And just felt
compelled to drop this. Had it in my trunk, prepped and all ready
to go. It was planned for somewhere else, but I just gravitated to
this spot somehow. I think this turned out to be just the place for
this. Depending on the time of day, traffic can be busy through

Enough room for the log sheet and the sawed-off pen contained inside... maybe room for teeny teeny trades?

This is the first hide from me and my kids (they picked the spot)

Should be a nice easy find.. almost a Park &amp; Grab!

Rated 1.5 because a wheel chair may NOT be able to get there :(

Here's one for those handy folk who like to 'Do It Yourself.'
Never mind that it never looks quite like the one on TV, never
quite gets finished, and you wind up with a bunch of expensive
tools, and left over parts, that you'll never use again.

Ah! But It's amazing what you can do with Duct Tape, &quot;The handyman's secret weapon&quot;. The only other comparable wondrous substance is WD40.
If it won't stay together...Duct Tape!
If it won't come apart..... WD40!
No dis assembly required. No tools necessary, but who leaves home without tools?.

And remember guys &quot;If the women don't find you handsome, they
should at least find ya handy.&quot;  ---Red Green

lamp post near you!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

I've maxed out already. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's not been lab tested but I'm willing to bet this hide is
99.9% muggle proof. Two cachers with way more finds than me took
one look and said, &quot;That's a 4 at least!&quot; &quot;Maybe even a 5&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that increases your odds of finding above the
0.1% is that since it's 99.9% muggle proof, you know it's there!
Right? So get out there and sign that log. BYOP of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... I originally rated this a 3.5 but I have been told I
consistently under rate my hides and this one in particular. So,
upon that advice I've bumped it up a half point. Hope that makes it
easier to find now. : )&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Trafford's B.Y. Park Very short hike but a bit steep at the end.
Nearby are some dangerous cliffs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a great little park. They really did a good job fixing
it up. About thirty years ago I remember a friend bringing me here
and all I remember was a swamp and some dead fish. Now there is a
beautiful little lake where a lot of people come and fish. Mostly
large carp but there are also some nice catfish and I'm told there
are some bass and a few other varieties. All fishing is catch and
release only. I've seen turtles, and frogs in the swamp that feeds
the pond. The garter snakes were abundant when I did the hide. Oh
yea! There's a huge black snake near the cache. There are also
ducks and geese galore. Facilities include several pavilions, rest
rooms, a water fountain that sometimes works, a walking/jogging
track around the lake as well as some hiking trails on either side
of the park. It's up in the woods near one of these trails that
I've placed the stash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the parking circle is a foot bridge that marks the start of
a trail at N40° 23.195 W79° 45.041 This trail circles to
the left past a park bench up towards the streets above and back
down. There is also a well hidden game trail at the top of the
circle that takes you to a path across the cliff tops. This cliff
path exits the park where 8th street makes a dogleg at N40°
23.234 W79° 45.154. This is an alternate starting point but
there is no parking near here. The cache is a medium sized, flat,
camouflaged, Lock &amp; Lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial content is mostly puzzles. There is also what seems to
be an alien artifact reputed to have been stolen from a secret
government project. But don't tell anyone about that. Your GPS is
going to lie to you. The closer you get to the cliffs, the more
unreliable the readings are. I took dozens of fixes and plotted
them on Google Earth then averaged them visually so the coordinates
should be pretty close to real.&lt;/p&gt;

Creek in Wilmerding. But probably won't be. This one has turned out
to be harder than I expected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK sorry, there isn't a whole lot of concealment for the grabber
on this one, but I made at least 5 stops here sizing things up
before I made the actual placement and didn't draw much attention.
Once finding Ground Zero You should put your hands in your pockets
and observe for a while, then decide on a spot and check it. I did
have to drive by once because someone was using the swings, and
another time, a couple of kids were sitting on the concrete near
GZ. This one should be fairly obvious... although there is
something about it that may fool you if you are lazy. SCPO Rich
will probably like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So! Welcome to Wilmerding. Home of George Westinghouse inventor
of the air brake. The town proper is on the other side of Turtle
Creek. You might want to go over and check out the Castle. And
remember... There's no Winky's in Wilmerding. (Or anywhere else
nowadays for that matter.)&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Suburban Park. Trail areas were once asphalt but now badly
maintained, crumbling and overgrown in places.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;I decided to scout this Monroeville park out and see what kind
of trails it might have. At first, I was a bit disappointed. My
first start point NE of the parking revealed a few game trails and
a hole in the fence into the future archaeological digs to the
North. Near this point I spotted signs below that invited further
exploration. I proceeded South toward the ball field and pavilion.
I followed some faint game trails which led to a walking trail but
it’s been a long time since it’s been maintained.
Subsequent exploration proved that suburban wilderness has
it’s attractions. This trail starts near a cluster of pines
at N40° 23.944 W79° 47.770 and ends at the turn around
where Quarry road dead ends. N40° 23.938 W79° 47.680 I
started at N40° 23.988 W79° 47.770 which is near the
pavilion by the ball field. It didn’t take long for me to
find some ancient ruins near the gathering place of a local
indigenous tribe. Primitive art adorned the secret park bench and
the cliffs here. Nocturnal visits to this location might find the
members of this tribe gathered around the fire, engaged in rituals
which anthropologists (and the authorities) would undoubtedly have
great interest. I also found numerous signs that humans once had a
long vanished settlement here. At one point, a spring and
overgrowth has forced a detour around the original paving, I found
that going off trail here yielded the discovery of an antique glass
bottle. All in all it was a satisfying excursion and I placed this
stash for any who come after me to explore this rich deposit of
human history. Best approach in summer, is probably indirectly from
below halfway down to Quarry road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial Contents: A hand made puzzle. Matchbox car, mini slinky,
compass-thermometer-whistle, magnifier, rubber chicken,
teleidoscope , 4 laminated micro cache notes. And more…&lt;/p&gt;

completely original. Contains log only, bring your own pencil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;I drive past here nearly every day either to work or church.
Pitcairn is a train town and always has been. The creek was
diverted and part of the valley filled in, to make room for the
rail yard which is one of the major transportation hubs in the
area. Other than that, there’s not much to say except that if
you cruse through here on a warm summer night, you may spot some of
the many different examples of colorful and exotic wildlife…
at least until after 2:00AM There is a park in mid town with ball
fields, a playground, and a train car that I believe can be
examined up close. Anyway, if/when you find this cache, handle it
carefully so as not to damage the camouflage. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you like it. After a recent bad experience with some
so-called “park and grabs” I decided to challenge
myself to see if I can lay down a bunch of them but in places where
the finder is able to search discretely even if it is a public
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules for these are; Walk around carefully, and be
observant. You may often be able to say ‘Ah Hah!’
without touching anything. I will try to leave a visible clue. No
need to trample or damage anything. You will usually be able to
take and replace the cache without being seen. When you leave,
there should be no trace you were there.&lt;/p&gt;

near Turtle Creek.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;My gun club, Pitcairn Monroeville, and Trafford gun club,
usually assist in stocking this creek every year. The fish are
brought in on the short line Turtle Creek Rail Road. Park in the
designated lot. The trailhead coordinates are N40° 24.535 W79°
43.664. I’m not sure where I’ll wind up hiding this,
there are so many possibilities, but make sure you explore all the
way down to N40° 24.555 W79° 43.345. Once you come out the other
side of the turnpike tunnel you’ll be in sight of the
companion cache to this one “Whizards Rock”.
You’ll understand why I planted that one first but waited
till this one was placed to have them published together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creek along here is beautiful and the hillsides and cliffs
are too. While exploring and searching for this cache, an
interesting thing to look for are numerous charcoal ingots
scattered about. I found dozens of them all over the area. I can
only assume they washed down, perhaps from the sewage treatment
plant upstream. I expected to find marsh areas and swamp but the
whole area was reasonably dry when I scouted it. Even so, this
whole area floods after heavy rains, so there will be times when
this cache will be difficult to approach, perhaps even dangerous.
But don’t worry about the cache, it’s high and dry.
There is a main path that follows the edge of the creek, and a maze
of game trails through the rest of the valley. I placed this in
early spring. During full summer, there is Knot Weed everywhere.
Despite that, there are few obstructions. If you lose a trail, head
toward the creek and pick up the main trail again. You will have to
negotiate off trail to get to this, please try to follow game
trails and move like an Indian through the brush rather than
mashing it down, or you may make it too easy for the next
person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final requirement. Bring a fishing pole, even if you
don’t plan to fish.&lt;/p&gt;

wasteland below. A small wooded hillside somewhat exposed to houses
and the ball field. Stealth recommended. Leave no trace. Re hide
exactly as found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is kind of a sad one for me. Turtle Creek has a few
playgrounds but no park. When I was a kid, this valley was known as
HEP park. HEP stood for “Help Establish a Park”. It
never happened. Back then it was a wild area; rocks, woods, weeds,
and beer cans. If our town elders had done their job, this would be
a nice bit of green space. Instead it was sold off and a developer
built an apartment complex, and the rest is wasteland. From the
Texaco the path led down and back up to the top of “Killer
Hill” a favorite sled riding track. It was called Killer Hill
because at the bottom you had to guide your sled carefully or else
you’d go off a small cliff and into the creek. The creek is
gone now. It’s about twenty or thirty feet down, under
thousands of tons of fill. It used to issue from a four foot
corrugated pipe pointing toward the ball fields above. We always
had plans to crawl inside and see where it went. We never did get
the courage to try it. There was a path that followed the creek
down toward where the apartment complex is now. On the left were
huge boulders nearly the size of a house. Down there still though,
on the hillside, before you get to the swing sets are some large
crumbly rocks full of fossils. I would recommend you stay away from
Valley Park Drive and it’s apartments though, they
won’t hesitate to call the cops if they see strangers lurking
about. Suggested parking is at the Hamilton Avenue Playground.
There are at least two paths down to the cache area depending on
whether or not the ball field is in use. The best is behind the
building closest to the road. The other is behind the dugout. I
would suggest stealth mode in all aspects of approaching this
cache. Perhaps though you could leave some flowers at the parks
gravestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a small, flat, camouflaged Lock &amp; Lock. FTF
prize is a hand forged puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

The original trail entrance here has been filled in and requires climbing down and over obstacles then walking up one side of Killer Hill and down the other.  Once past the first twenty feet or so, a well defined path takes you the rest of the way.</groundspeak:long_description>

If I hadn't been alert for the park sign, I would have missed it. The 2.5 terrain means it's a bit steep or rough for the really young kids.  The cache itself is concealed in such a way that no thrashing or trashing of the hide area should be necessary. 

 Did a drive by on a near by cache. Couldn't stop because of a rather embarrassing LEO encounter while trying to find a place to park.  Wound up heading down a side street and kept going. Saw the park sign and had to explore.

Every Park Needs a Cache!

This park  is way down in, and just keeps going back further.  I saw several courts, basketball, and maybe tennis, a ball field, and a pavilion.  Not much in the way of woods but there is a trail.  Since the entrance is not obvious, navigate to the parking way point. From that entrance, drive back as far as you can to the second lot. The easiest trail starts from the rock in the corner of the parking lot.

This cache is meant to be hard to please re-hide well and tread lightly. Also the container has a very tight seal and needs to be resealed tightly to be water tight.

&lt;b&gt;This is Adams Twp Community Park is my first cache. It was a
nano near the ballfield but had to move this one and changed the
container to something a little larger BYOP.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

scenery is very beautiful. It must have been a real joy to ride
this line on the rails, strung in cars behind a powerful
locomotive. We may not have that opportunity, but we can still
capture some of the experience by biking the trails. That's part of
why I love these rail-trails so much. They cut through back woods
areas that you'd have never seen otherwise. Take some time and
enjoy the view.

this resource. I also have found the trails to be a great place to
practice my photography. I especially like to stop on the bridges,
watch the water flow past for a bit, and maybe try and frame up a
nice shot. Here's a bridge. Why don't you stop for a few and enjoy
the view? Watch the water, relax from your exercise, and maybe even
find a quick cache!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is across the road from Northpointe I.
There is a wooded area that goes down over the hill. I think the
best approach is to park in IUP's parking lot and head down
Armstrong Drive. After a short walk, you'll spot a bit of an
entrance into the wooded area. Then just weave around all of the
fallen trees to GZ. Alternatively, you can follow a narrow road
that leads down to a backup generator and a drainage pond. Then
head back up the hill into the wooded area. It's narrow and steep,
so I wouldn't attempt to drive down.
If you are quiet, you'll probably see all sorts
of birds and possibly other wildlife. I heard a lot of things while
hiding the cache. Be careful, though, because I picked up a couple
of ticks on the way.
The container is a small square locking style
box. It's big enough for small trade items and travel bugs. I
didn't have much swag handy, so I just started off a couple of my
new travel bugs. Hopefully I'll stock it with a few more items
soon.

walking trail in Northpointe Park. This is a great spot to stop and
take a break during a busy workday. You'll probably see a few frogs
or geese near the pond. There's a bench nearby. You can sit and
read, eat your lunch, or take a nap. Yeah, go ahead: curl up on the
bench and saw some logs.

I had bigger plans for this cache, but the camo
didn't cooperate and I had to downsize to a micro. Well, you'll see
when you get there. So, bring your own pencil and unfortunately it
won't fit anything for trade.

is mostly in the open, just camouflaged. Thank you for minding the
landscaping.

Hollobaugh
February 3, 1984 - January 12, 2010

Jeremy was born in Kittanning and lived in Ford
City. He was employed as a technician at Optical Systems Technology
in Slate Lick. Jeremy was a member of Cadogan Union Church and the
Cadogan Sportsman's Club. He enjoyed hunting and trout fishing, and
loved helping people in any way he could. Jeremy also enjoyed
spending time with his wife and family, his cats, and his turtle,
Bam.

During the few years that I knew him, I couldn't
have asked for a better friend and coworker. Known around the
office as &quot;Hollywood,&quot; he loved to make people laugh and smile. He
cared about everybody and always offered to help out. He also
livened up the hacky sack circle that would form during break
times. We had a lot of good times and all of the fun definitely
made the work day go faster. He is missed by all and will never be
forgotten.
Shortly before he passed away, Jeremy and I
discussed geocaching. His friend had found one and told him about
it, piquing his interest. He asked me about it and I explained to
him the basics. He wanted to borrow my GPS sometime and try it out.
I was going to take him out and show him a few when spring came and
the weather was nicer. Sadly, that day never came and I lost a
friend too soon.
I placed this cache in memory of Jeremy and
filled it with hacky sacks. You can trade hacks or leave other
items. If you knew Jeremy, feel free to share a memory.

This cache is listed on multiple listing services.  Congratulations to the spydermunkees for finding it first.

Our idea was to give geocoins a boost to get them started.  We have caching buddies in several countries and big cities, mostly in Scandinavia or Washington DC area, so if you want your coins or bugs to go there, drop them in this cache.  This is a small container, but it will be monitored very frequently. It will be fun to watch where your geocoin end up!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun discovering the coins in the cache, but please leave them to their destinations; remember they were left here to travel long-distance! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be sure to re-hide the container well and to be very careful of muggles that might be lurking about, as this is a busy area at times!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: Only geocoins will travel long-distance. If you drop a travelbug in the cache it will just travel in a normal fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Safety alert....beware of the poision ivy near the cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is placed as a part of the Armstrong County Cache Avalanche of 2008 or NACCA 2008. During ACCA 2008 some 15 or more caches was placed in mostly the northern part of the county in an initiative to introduce several new and sometimes challenging caches in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will have to bring your own writing instrument as it IS a micro and will only have a log sheet in it.  I hope this will prove to be an interesting and different cache from the normal micro and I DO hope you enjoy the hunt!  Have fun and let me hear what 'ya think about it!  On August 24, 2008, I replaced the container with a newer model because the log was getting wet.  This is still a very unique and interesting hunt!  It goes without saying that this is a sacred place and PLEASE use proper conduct while searching for the cache.  It is not in the actual &quot;cemetery proper&quot;, but close by.  No need to trespass anywhere or overturn anything.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Because let’s face it: where there is a Wally-world there must be a micro. After the one that was around here for years was terminated we decided that this cannot stand, because what is better than being able to swipe a cache or two while your better half is doing some grocery shopping. Or vice versa? Sure, there are some other caches nearby but since at least one of them might possibly tick you off and one may, well, just tick you, here’s an easy one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one you can gladly bring Aunt Greta from Wisconsin along on, she may even be able to do it from the car. Then again, maybe not. At any rate it’s pretty much what you expect, only smaller and not as traditional as you first might think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a FTF prize for this one (after all, IF you do go after one of these diligently you deserve a reward). The prize is a brand new lrosell path tag. Unfortunately I was unable to squeeze it down in the container, but if you email us we’ll make sure you get it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to HBOWSER for FTF!

I need your help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few weeks ago I was on a mission to retrieve 3 artifacts that had&lt;br/&gt;previously been hidden on Earth when my vessel was attacked by&lt;br/&gt;Cylog forces. I bailed out just before my ship was hit and&lt;br/&gt;disintegrated but I’m afraid that when returning fire I may&lt;br/&gt;have accidently hit a nearby large structure. Sorry about that. At&lt;br/&gt;any rate, as I landed I hurt my current host body and was unable to&lt;br/&gt;travel for several days. I found a cylindrical, yet wet, hiding&lt;br/&gt;place where I could go through the process of healing my host, as&lt;br/&gt;well as hide from the pursuing Cylogs. It became clear to me that I&lt;br/&gt;would not be able to rescue the artifacts but instead hide them&lt;br/&gt;here on Earth and luckily I had packed some of my belongings in a&lt;br/&gt;50cal ammo box, handily borrowed from an undisclosed air force base&lt;br/&gt;somewhere outside Cleveland, Ohio. Long story, don’t ask.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I placed the artifacts in the box and hid it nearby my&lt;br/&gt;location and immediately thereafter I set my escape plan into&lt;br/&gt;motion. I had to reach an open field for my rescue locator beacon&lt;br/&gt;device to work properly, I remembered seeing one just north of some&lt;br/&gt;type of large market place that seem to sell inexpensive products&lt;br/&gt;mostly manufactured in countries far away. Very strange. On my&lt;br/&gt;journey to the field, traveling east at first, I placed clues along&lt;br/&gt;the way to provide a means to retrieve the sacred artifacts. For&lt;br/&gt;the final leg of my journey I turned north, placed the first hint&lt;br/&gt;and managed to reach the field and activate my beacon; the rescue&lt;br/&gt;ship beamed me up within minutes. The artifacts are however still&lt;br/&gt;in great peril and this is where you come in; I have learned that&lt;br/&gt;Geocachers, a previously unknown race to us, are men and women of&lt;br/&gt;great honor and integrity and can be trusted to guard these&lt;br/&gt;artifacts. These items may look trivial but the future of the&lt;br/&gt;planet may depend on them being kept out of the hands of the evil&lt;br/&gt;Cylogs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now pay attention: if you decided to pick up the artifacts&lt;br/&gt;they may only be retrieved by three different Geocachers or groups&lt;br/&gt;of Geocachers. To speak Geocachingese, see them as FTF prize, STF&lt;br/&gt;prize and TTF price. Each must be retrieved by different finders&lt;br/&gt;and whether you are alone or in a group, not more than one artifact&lt;br/&gt;can be taken at one given time. Failure to comply with these rules&lt;br/&gt;will render the artifacts reach nuclear critical mass and bad&lt;br/&gt;things will happen. Capiche?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;FTF prize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first artifact dramatically resembles a 2Gb USB drive and will&lt;br/&gt;actually work as such. I contain encrypted information vital to&lt;br/&gt;your planets survival and can only be viewed or decrypted using a&lt;br/&gt;512 core bio-dynamic CPU. Last time I checked that have not been&lt;br/&gt;invented yet so don’t bother, just use it as a regular USB&lt;br/&gt;drive. But keep it secret, and keep it safe!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;STF Prize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second artifact resembles what you may identify as a Geocoin.&lt;br/&gt;As far as I understand these are not legal tender on your planet&lt;br/&gt;but should rather be kept for its beauty or even better activated&lt;br/&gt;and put into circulation, hidden in plain sight or cache, if you&lt;br/&gt;like. I would strongly recommend the latter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;TTF prize&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The third artifact resembles a travelbug dog tag with a very&lt;br/&gt;special device connected. However, together with the information on&lt;br/&gt;the bug barcode and the attached device it can be used to gain&lt;br/&gt;entrance and operation to a Class 3 Interstellar Blockade Runner,&lt;br/&gt;should need be. You should activate this ‘bug’ and put&lt;br/&gt;it into circulation among the remarkable Geocaching&lt;br/&gt;community!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember, the future of your planet relies on You, Dear Geocacher.&lt;br/&gt;You must find the hidden artifacts and keep them out of the hands&lt;br/&gt;of the Cylogs, many galaxies depends on you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Live long and prosperous and May the Force be with you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;//IC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note from I.C.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I just got word that all artifacts have been picked up! Thanks you!&lt;br/&gt;You may have helped save the galaxy! I do not foresee coming back&lt;br/&gt;to this part of the galaxy soon, so keep the items safe!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May the force be with you in a long and prosperous life!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;//IC&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* * *&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;- D I S C L A I M E R -&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLEASE NOTE THAT THE TERRAIN RATING IS VERY ACCURATE!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the stages are very easy; other stages could under certain&lt;br/&gt;circumstances be harmful or even fatal.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I really like the rock formations along this
section of the trail. I think they look cool. So it seemed right to
hide a cache here. Be careful. The hill is kinda steep and some of
the rocks might be loose. I used a short stick to help climb and I
think you'll also find that tree to be your friend...

This cache is listed on multiple listing services.  Congratulations to Geotekie for finding it first.

During ACCA 2008 some 15 or more caches was placed in mostly the northern part of the county in an initiative to introduce several new and sometimes challenging caches in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The side road where the cache is located is usually only used by the Amish so it should be relatively muggler safe. Then again, some critters reside just next to the area but we are pretty sure they won’t rat you out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the cache is just a few feet of the road some bushwhacking may be required here, depending on what time of year you go for this one. Then again, during the summer you should be able to pick up some raspberry on your way in. At least unless we got to them first. As always, please take care and respect the surroundings. If you do not wish to bushwhack directly to the cache there is an easier way in from either side. This would really be the approach we recommend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The place is picked to be the entry point to the several caches in the area placed during the North Armstrong County Cache Avalanche, or NACCA for short. Coming either from Smicksburg or Rt 85 we hope this cache will make for a nice starting point in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Caching

Some weeks during the year this town can be (believe it or not!) very busy. Also be aware of traffic, it can be busy all year long. Recommended parking at N40 52.655  W079 14.776 or at the nearby church.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although it is a micro there is some limited space for trading items. (Very limited) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Log was soaked after just one day out so measures has been taken to better damp proof the cache. Please return it as you found it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember to bring a pen!

During ACCA 2008 some 15 or more caches was placed in mostly the northern part of the county in an initiative to introduce several new and sometimes challenging caches in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It just made sense to us to put a cache here since we also placed on at the other end of Main Street in Dayton. As you progress down the street however it soon start to look not so much like a town road but more like, well, outside town. Which it is. Besides, our TomTom says it’s Main Street and we’re not about to argue the point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may not be able to drive all the way to the cache, Main Street or not. If it looks like the car may have problem making the last part of the trip it most likely won’t. So don’t. Besides there’s no good place to turn around by GZ anyway. Trust us, we know. The closest to the cache that we know for sure you will be able to turn around is at about N40 52.870 W79 13.213. These are not so much parking coordinates as they are turn around coordinates. This will put you about 1/3 of a mile away from the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will still be a nice walk though and during summer there are a plentiful of berry bushes and even wildlife along the last part of Main Street. The cache is well hidden but since you know what you are looking for it shouldn’t be too much trouble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lastly, a recommendation; even if you for some reason decided to drive all the way down to GZ DO NOT continue on the road after the bridge not matter what your GPS is trying to tell you. Main Street ends here (it really does) and the dirt road continuing leads to nothing but trouble. Don’t ask, just take our word for it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And last-last; PLEASE put the cache back and hide it like you found it. Even if you get your shoe wet...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Caching!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK1ABHR - Possible Point of No Return&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 52.870 W 079° 13.213&lt;br/&gt;We don't recommend you drive a car further than here.</groundspeak:long_description>

Alas, nothing could be further from the truth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Depending on what direction you come from you may already have noticed a sunken tractor (which is also a waymark on www.waymarking.com, WM3E54) or an interesting constellating of hay bales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are both placed by the land owner who is known to change the hay bale art several times a year. It’s hard to tell what you will see but we can guarantee that it will be something unique.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please, put the cache back EXACTLY as you found it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Caching!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is placed as a part of the Northern Armstrong County Cache Avalanche of 2008 or NACCA 2008. During ACCA 2008 some 15 or more caches was placed in mostly the northern part of the county in an initiative to introduce several new and sometimes challenging caches in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located in a place special to us. It may be ‘yet another cemetery’ but this is where we sometimes take our dogs to play. They know just about every rock, log and tree here, at least on the eastern unused part of the cemetery. Who knows, you might just encounter a herd of Golden Retrievers when you are out here looking for the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It should be a fairly easy find, no need for any type of bushwhacking or nasty climbs. In fact, you could probably have grandma retrieve the cache for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just remember to pay attention to the nearby ‘posted’ signs. The cache is not in the woods, no matter what your GPS is trying to tell you. Then again, you should get pretty good signal walking up (or down) to GZ and the rest… Well, that’s up to you!&lt;br/&gt;Happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We initially planned to put a cache at the absolute highest point&lt;br/&gt;in Armstrong County, but being as that location is somewhat posted&lt;br/&gt;land we came up with this location instead. A shame really since&lt;br/&gt;the ‘real’ highpoint has no less than three waymarkers very close&lt;br/&gt;to each other. But quite frankly, the view from here is not half&lt;br/&gt;bad either!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One way marker is still in view from the cache location;&lt;br/&gt;the&lt;br/&gt;spire of the church. In all honestly, the church spire&lt;br/&gt;waymarker was actually recorded when the church was located on the&lt;br/&gt;other side of the road, but it should still count!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another curious tidbit, this one to file under worthless knowledge;&lt;br/&gt;the cache container intended for the original highpoint ended up&lt;br/&gt;being the container for another of our caches,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GC1NMJT - To Boldy Go (or gently crawl)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We put a little surprise in the container for the FTF, some little&lt;br/&gt;thing to benefit a future cache!

knock-off Lock-n-Lock in the rocks near the locks...or something
like that. At any rate, this is a really beautiful section of the
Armstrong Trail. There is parking available near the cache location
or you can ride / walk on the trail to get here.

This cache was placed during the &quot;Walk and Wow&quot;
week-long series of guided nature walks along the trail north of
here, sponsored by the Armstrong Rails to Trails Association. While
it should be a quick grab, I hope that it encourages you to take
the opportunity to ride / walk on the trail and be &quot;wowed&quot; by the
beauty along the trail year-round.

The parking area near the locks is owned by the
Armstrong Trail and you are free to park there. The trail is open
from dawn to dusk.

This cache is listed on multiple listing services.  Congratulations to couldbriding and altimazion for finding it first.

Every new litter, we discover someone special that we have to keep!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizzy is our momma “Papillon”.  She actually is the boss of the house and that includes all the dogs that outweigh her by over 100 pounds.  When she barks and bites, they run!  We placed Lizzy’s cache near the Lock#8 where you can watch the boats come and go through the lock.  It is a small pill bottle that is well camoed.  Have fun and enjoy the view!

The name ‘Tio’ is Swedish for the number “10” and Tio WAS the 10th puppy born in his litter.  If there is such a thing in dogdom, Tio appears to be a bit autistic.  When he was born, he was dead, and the Mr. had to perform CPR and bring him back to life.  Tio has one goal in life and only ONE—to play ball.  He carries his tennis ball in his mouth continuously.  He eats with it, sleeps with it, drinks with it.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tio’s cache is a large pretzel jar full of goodies placed in a very nice spot.  Once again, please leave something nice if you take something nice.  That way everyone has fun.  Best of luck, have fun, enjoy the beautiful Armstrong Trail!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have always loved the view from this&lt;br/&gt;place. In a sense you get the feeling of looking out over our part&lt;br/&gt;of Pennsylvania as it must have looked like when the pioneers first&lt;br/&gt;came by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, there are roads and other evidence of&lt;br/&gt;‘civilization’ present as you look north out over the hills and&lt;br/&gt;valleys. But with just a little bit of imagination it is not hard&lt;br/&gt;to envision what it must have looked like to those few brave men&lt;br/&gt;and women heading west.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One also can’t help but wonder what life must&lt;br/&gt;have been like for the Native American inhabitants that hunted&lt;br/&gt;these woods and hills. And, according to local folklore, one of&lt;br/&gt;their burial grounds can be seen by standing by the tree and&lt;br/&gt;looking straight north. See the hill over there? That is what is&lt;br/&gt;said to be the Indian Cemetery in this area, and thus the name of&lt;br/&gt;this cache; Hidden Cemeteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking north-west you can even see a part of&lt;br/&gt;Mahoning Creek leading up to the dam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be careful to respect this site! Do not drive all&lt;br/&gt;the way up into the cemetery. Rather, park on the road up or just&lt;br/&gt;after it once you clear the somewhat steep climb. Do NOT attempt to&lt;br/&gt;drive up unless you have 4WD except if the ground is completely&lt;br/&gt;dry. Even under these conditions however, pot holes might take&lt;br/&gt;parts off your car that you would rather have attached. You have&lt;br/&gt;been warned; don’t blame us if your car sounds like an M1A1 coming&lt;br/&gt;off this hill…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cache itself should be fairly easy to find&lt;br/&gt;although some minor bushwhacking may be required during the greener&lt;br/&gt;part of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the swag was placed in individual plastic zip&lt;br/&gt;lock bags, as far as it is possible please keep it that way!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;All swag is more or less either nice small toys&lt;br/&gt;or functional tools; as far as it is possible we would like to keep&lt;br/&gt;it that way. The cache starts out with several goodies out over the&lt;br/&gt;obligatory log and pen;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;• LaserBuck Travel Bug – First drop!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• Red Jeep Travel Bug&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• Rockabilly Junction CD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• Pedometer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• Tape measure&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• Mini screw drivers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• Glider plane&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• Toy car set&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• Hand grip trainer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• And much much more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please let us know any problem with this cache as&lt;br/&gt;we would like to keep it nice and dry!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy Caching!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

With the rain and nasty weather we didn't stay long to look around, but we did get signed in.  Cache is in good shape.  Thanks for the hide!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I have always thought that this was a neat area.  There are two railroad bridges here, one that carries the Armstrong Trail over Mahoning Creek and one that carries tracks over the Allegheny.  You're looking for a micro hidden on or near the bridge over the creek.  Be careful that you don't slip, as there are a few places on the bridge surface where you can see water below :)  I left a small pencil in the cache, but you probably want to have your own writing utensil handy.  Please rehide as you found it.

This is my first hide, so I hope you enjoy it.  You can park in Templeton and ride / hike to the cache.  Or, if you're like me, you'll park in Kittanning or Ford City and ride the whole way ;)

The Armstrong Trail is open Dawn-Dusk, so please do not attempt at night. 

This cache is listed on multiple listing services.  Congratulations to DougLisa for finding it first.

Every new litter, we discover someone special that we have to keep!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is for the matriarch of the family.  She has given us so many beautiful babies and is such a darling momma-dog.  Nikita’s cache is a nice size lock n lock box with lots of kewl trinkets in it.  It is not extremely difficult and should be a lot of fun for you!   We hope you are enjoying all the new caches on the Armstrong Trail!

The AGT utilizes the growing&lt;br/&gt;interest in geocaching to assist both residents and visitors to the&lt;br/&gt;area in learning more about the unique attractions in the ten&lt;br/&gt;participating counties. This cache contains a unique self inking&lt;br/&gt;rubber stamp which you should use to stamp your Allegheny GeoTrail&lt;br/&gt;Passport to verify that you found it. When you have found a minimum&lt;br/&gt;of six AGT caches, you will be eligible to have your AGT passport&lt;br/&gt;validated and receive a commemorative AGT trackable geocoin at&lt;br/&gt;participating locations.

Enjoyed the area, so much to do here, loved the trails, and quietness of the vast areas I did find, seeming I am with in a days drive, hope to make it back this way one day, fall here must be a spectacular show, so maybe then I will finish the other 7 counties, a nice set of coins!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache contents are nothing special, it's more about the cache itself. It's situated on an old railroad bridge piling about 50-60 feet off of the ground in the middle of a creek. I highly suggest you scout this one out before getting your hopes up. I have identified at least three ways to get it off its perch, and can personally vouch for one way to get it back up there. Take a friend or two. Someone will get wet, and someone will get very tired of thorns. For a good view of the cache, walk downstream to the bridge, and take a good pair of binoculars. You'll see a silver ammo can awaiting it's rescue. It's painted silver to commemorate the 500th find of my team, The Allegheny Rangers. This is a cache at YOUR OWN RISK cache!! Keep in mind that this is a potentially dangerous cache, and that you need to exercise caution in going after it. Please be careful, and know that in outdoor activities, anything can and will occur. Neither Groundspeak or I will accept responsiblity under any circumstance, should you get hurt or killed. There is a chance that you will encounter falling debris. Wear a helmet and goggles, and any other safety equipment you may deem necessary. Don't do anything you don't honestly feel you're qualified to do. Remember- THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS TO DO THIS CACHE!! Oh, and one last thing... If you plan to go after this cache, let me know when, as Sparticus and I are dying to see what people can come up with. If you let us come watch, we promise to cheer you on. Happy Hunting! Owners Note: Yes, there are, indeed multiple FTF's available on this cache. The first is for climbing, while the second is for any other method of retrieval from the ground. Others may include Non-traditional methods such as, but not limited to; aircraft, catapaults and trebuchets, NASA surplus gear, or wizardry. (NO FIREARMS OR BLASTING EQUIPMENT, seriously...) To encourage innovation and use of imagination, I'll likely award FTF's to anything I haven't seen before. Congrats to 1RoknJp&amp;Zoose, Fatwalker, Brooke The Blonde &amp; Buttons4 for their Innovative (and overall) First to Find. You guys rule! Congrats to Redtail Forester and Mountainfolk406 for the Traditional Climb FTF! Congrats to gstiglitz and Kaboss for their rope ladder FTF! Thanks to my friends at www.extreme-caching.com for adding this cache to their great site!

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The cache is something I cooked up while in pursuit of a couple 5/5's. It seemed like I could go a bit more extreme, and so I did. This is a cache at your own risk type of cache, unless you are clever enough to retrieve it and replace it without getting too crazy... If anyone wants some help let me know, and I'll go with you to &quot;supervise.&quot; Thanks to Sparticus06, without whom this would have been even worse to place.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&quot;Adjusted&quot; means that the published coordinates are very accurate, and &quot;location scaled&quot; means that the published coordinates are not very accurate. The published positions for benchmarks with adjusted horizontal coordinates were computed using advanced surveying techniques and are far more accurate than even the finest handheld GPSr can get. The position of a benchmark with &quot;scaled&quot; coordinates was derived by a human in an office by estimating the location of the mark on a topographic map with a scale (ruler). As such, they can be off by 600 feet or more from the actual position though deviations in the 100 - 150 foot range are more common. Your handheld GPS may be very helpful in finding benchmarks with adjusted horizontal coordinates, but can be nearly useless for finding benchmarks with scaled horizontal coordinates. Feel free to post a picture of your GPSr at the benchmark with the coordinates. There is a micro log book near by to sign. Do not forget to log your benchmark ( MA1077 ) find!

(N 41*13.097' W 079*23.578') = Add 4 to the number of rows of barbed wire that are on top of the fence around Clarion University's football field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B.  (N 41*12.912' W 079*23.533') = Add 5 to the number of signs attached to the fronts of the gate posts to the Clarion graveyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C.  (N 41*12.873' W 079*23.194') = Find the Clarion Vietnam Memorial.  Subtract 23 from the day of the month that Valentine A. Ochs was killed in action on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D.  (N 41*12.911' W 079*23.161') = Find the benchmark beside the courthouse. (DO NOT USE THE ONE IN THE BACK YARD OF THE COURTHOUSE, THE ONE YOU NEED IS ON THE FRONT LEFT CORNER OF THE COURTHOUSE)  Subtract 1935 from the date stamped on this benchmark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E.

Once you get close to the GZ, slow down and let the GPSr settle. At the GZ, the cache should be on the right side if you are paddling up stream.

The cache is on SGLs, so wear some orange. May be hard to find in the snow. Camouflaged tube. You will need a pen. I left a tag for the FTF. </groundspeak:long_description>

Park at the trail head on Kiser-Wagner Road (N 41° 14.390 W 079° 23.863) and follow the trail to this cache.  Along the trail you will walk along fences that are meant to contain the wild pigs and rams at a hunting preserve beside the game lands.  After passing this, you will climb up a slight hill and find some very nice views as you walk along the trail.  Just before reaching the cache, you will pass some small ponds.  The cache is hidden very simply so that you don't have an enjoyable walk without a smiley.  Happy Hunting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is placed on State Game Lands so please wear orange during all hunting seasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to gstiglitz for the FTF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK2BX6Q - GC2BX6Q Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 14.390 W 079° 23.863&lt;br/&gt;Parking for NCT-Duck Pond's Micro</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;strong&gt;The geocache hidden at the posted coordinates is a regular&lt;br/&gt;geocache, however, it is also part of the Allegheny GeoTrail (AGT),&lt;br/&gt;a publicly funded project designed to promote a pleasant and&lt;br/&gt;positive experience and image of the Allegheny National Forest&lt;br/&gt;region and its gateway communities. The AGT utilizes the growing&lt;br/&gt;interest in geocaching to assist both residents and visitors to the&lt;br/&gt;area in learning more about the unique attractions in the ten&lt;br/&gt;participating counties. This cache contains a unique self inking&lt;br/&gt;rubber stamp which you should use to stamp your Allegheny GeoTrail&lt;br/&gt;Passport to verify that you found it. When you have found a minimum&lt;br/&gt;of six AGT caches, you will be eligible to have your AGT passport&lt;br/&gt;validated and receive a commemorative AGT trackable geocoin at&lt;br/&gt;participating locations. You must have your official AGT passport&lt;br/&gt;with you when you find this cache in order to stamp it. Click on&lt;br/&gt;the Allegheny GeoTrail Logo below to visit the AGT website at&lt;br/&gt;www.alleghenygeotrail.com for complete details and a listing of&lt;br/&gt;participating locations where you may pick up and validate AGT&lt;br/&gt;passports to receive your souvenir geocoin, trackable at&lt;br/&gt;www.geocaching.com .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This geocache will take you to a very interesting place in&lt;br/&gt;Clarion County, the Helen Furnace. The furnace is in excellent&lt;br/&gt;condition, the most significant element being the charging bridge.&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, one of the structural supports for the bridge has&lt;br/&gt;cracked, making the crossing unfeasible. It would be nice if this&lt;br/&gt;condition could be repaired, permitting access to the top of the&lt;br/&gt;stack. It is not clear who has maintained the site, but the area is&lt;br/&gt;very clean, maintained, and much of the furnace remains intact. The&lt;br/&gt;foundation pit for the engine house is located to the right of the&lt;br/&gt;furnace. The right hand tuyere still has the brickwork in place,&lt;br/&gt;including the round access hole for the blast pipe. The cupola&lt;br/&gt;remains intact, and the view up the stack shows that the wooden&lt;br/&gt;covering at the top is protecting the inner stack from damage.&lt;br/&gt;History Start of Operation: 1845 Blowout: 1856 Daily Tonnage: 1,500&lt;br/&gt;tons per year - best actual output was 1,000 tons. Built By: Robert&lt;br/&gt;Barber and Packer Stack: 32 feet w/9 foot bosh Blast: Cold Type:&lt;br/&gt;Charcoal The furnace was built by W.S. Packer &amp; Company, but&lt;br/&gt;they soon ran into financial problems and sold out to David Richey.&lt;br/&gt;He apparently owned the site for a limited time, and sold the&lt;br/&gt;property to Samuel Wilson. The Wilson's were a primary player in&lt;br/&gt;the region in terms of materials - they must have owned extensive&lt;br/&gt;property in the area. Mr. Wilson operated the furnace until 1857.&lt;br/&gt;The furnace was originally named &quot;Highland&quot; furnace after Alexander&lt;br/&gt;McNaughton, who prided himself on being a highlander. However,&lt;br/&gt;owing to the strong accent, the name sounded like &quot;Hieland&quot;, which&lt;br/&gt;was adapted over time to &quot;Helen&quot;. The site has recently been&lt;br/&gt;restored by Clarion County with some improvements to encourage your&lt;br/&gt;visit. There are picnic tables, and a portajohn on site, so bring a&lt;br/&gt;lunch and explore this historical site.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information found on Helen Furnace website at&lt;br/&gt;http://www.oldindustry.org/PA_HTML/Pa_Helen.html

The cache is a Lock n' Lock container that has been spray painted brown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area was used by the raftmen of the Clarion River to build and launch timber rafts when Leeper Hollow was logged out during the rafting logging era of the mid 1800s.  Across the river from the cache area, you can still see the remnants of a road that was used to bring the lumber from the hillsides. (It heads at an angle upstream from the landing, and follows Leeper Hollow)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have read other places, but don't know for sure, that this area was also a popular overnight area for raftmen coming from up river.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area was also used as a place to ford the river.  If you are canoeing to this cache, and the water is low, you will see why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would recommend using a canoe to find this cache, but you can walk it, if you wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is placed on State Game Lands.  Please remember to wear orange during all hunting seasons.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You may want a canoe, kayak or raft for getting this geocache.  You can hike to this cache, but you are on your own.  You will be able to park your boat within 1,000 feet of the cache (please remember to secure your boat with an anchor, you do not want to be stuck here).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located along the most beautiful and remote section of the Clarion River.  You will be leaving your boat on a gravel bar at the mouth of the Maxwell Run.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The closest place upstream from the cache to put in a canoe, kayak or raft would be the Gravel Lick area.  The closest place to get out would be Sarvey Mill Road on the Helen Furnace side of the Clarion River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is up on the hillside above a camping area on the downstream side of the Maxwell Run.  To make this easy, since the adventure is the canoe ride, the cache is at the base of a tree about 10 feet uphill from the biggest rock above this campsite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy your trip along this beautiful and little traveled section of the Clarion River.  You will see plenty of wildlife.  About a mile upstream from the Maxwell Run, in a large pine tree, is an eagle nest.  I actually spotted the eagle in a pine tree just before the Maxwell Run while floating down to hide this cache.  Good fishing too, so bring your pole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be aware that this cache is located on State Game Lands.  Please wear orange during hunting seasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to SmokeyBear1 for the FTF.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is a small lock and lock container amongst some interesting root formation along the North Country Trail.  This cache could also easily be found by someone canoeing this section of the Clarion River.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The easiest way to walk to this cache is to park at the Highland Drive trail head of the North Country Trail and follow the trail into the woods.  This is a very nice section of trail with only one hill coming back from the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After using a switchback to get down over the hillside, the North Country Trail follows an old logging road down toward the river.  This logging road was used in the mid to late 1800's to take timber from the forests above to rafts to be carried down the Clarion River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just think about the history of this road as you are making your journey to the cache site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the cache site, you will find a boulder with multiple trees growing on it.  It is really a pretty impressive sight.  The cache is hidden amonst the roots.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please remember to place the cache well hidden when you leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before leaving, head down to the river for a view of Maxwell run coming into the Clarion River just downstream (The gravel bar across the river is where Maxwell run enters the river).  Last year I took some pictures from my canoe of an eagle perched in the large pine tree just up river from the Maxwell Run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please remember that there is hunting in these woods.  During hunting seasons you must wear orange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK25PC4 - Parking - Clarion River - NCT meets Clarion River&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 17.956 W 079° 16.834&lt;br/&gt;Park here to get to the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is located just off the rail trail at the border between Clarion and Venango counties.  Was a good place to stop for a break on a recent North Country Trail chapter hike, so it's also a good place to hide a cache.  Thanks to stigloc for having a container on hand.  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Happy caching!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area is my favorite place on the Clarion River.  I (Maria), have only actually lived in Pennsylvania for about 11 years, but I have known about this place just as long.  While we were building our house we had to haul water for everything drinking and bathing.  That is how we came to learn of the spring on Gravel Lick.  We lived in a camper and took showers from a camping shower bag.  If you've ever had to do this you know how much &quot;fun&quot; it is.  Anyway we followed a path across from the spring that lead to the river.  We soon learned that it was a great place to swim also.  When you come to seek this cache bring your swim suit!  Bring a picnic too its a great place to spend the whole day.  At this spot in the river there is a HUGE rock that spans over much of the river about three feet under the water (after about five feet in you will be on the flat rock.  No sharp rocks to hurt your feet here.) If you decide to swim here please be careful.  I have heard rumors that people have drowned here by jumping off this massive rock and being pulled under it.  I always keep to the left of the rock and NEVER EVER jump off the drop off.  The river moves fast so I am inclined to believe the stories I've heard.  Remember if you decide to swim you are doing so AT YOUR OWN RISK! If you're smart and careful you shouldn't have anything to worry about.  I even let my six yr old swim here.  Stay to the left of the drop off and you should be fine. You can also bring you fishing gear here. You will not have to venture into the river at any stage of this multicache!  However at the second stage, it is possible that your feet will get wet!  The original cache contained a train whistle, cars pen, magnesium fire starter, a pez dispenser, a bandaid container, a CITO container, log book, and a FTF Level TB!  There may have been a few other things but I can't remember.  This is a three stage multicache and they are all hidden well.  Steve watched me hide the first one and ten minutes later even he couldn't find it! HE HE!  Have fun!  It is a tough one&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;S213V81 - Stage 2&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 18.310 W 079° 14.655&lt;br/&gt;Stage 2&lt;br/&gt;S313V81 - Final Stage&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 18.308 W 079° 14.562</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">So I have had this container for over a year, it was a gift from The Graystone Gopher. I was trying to find the perfect spot and finally I found one. DevinC adopted this part of the NCT (North Country Tail) and asked me if I wanted to put a cache on it, so I decided on a night cache. It is nice down here during the day, but wait till night to see how it is. Fairly easy walk down into the cache. The hill is not very steep. You will be walking about .40 mile to get to the final.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking is at N41° 18.906 W79° 14.751&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a good flashlight with you and definitely take a friend. Walk in past the gate and follow the cords to the beginning of this night time walk. The starting point will be 3 dots in a vertical line. The rest of the way down, use your light and follow the trail of firetacks. Once you get so far down, there will be 4 firetacks in the shape of a square on the left side of the trail. You are very close to the cache. If you shine your light around you will see that you are being watched. Walk to the right up through all the eyes on your right until you see a 3 eyed critter on your right. The cache is there.&lt;br/&gt;There is no reason to go down over the steep part on the left side of the trail You will be on the trail all the way to your little forest audience. You should be able to get the cache from the side trail. There is no need at all to bushwack.&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, enjoy, and have fun on the night time walk on the NCT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be sure to wear your orange during hunting season, even at night. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF - The Eye of the Tiger&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN263MB - Final Cache location&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Final location of the cache.&lt;br/&gt;PK263MB - Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 18.906 W 079° 14.751&lt;br/&gt;Parking area to start your hike.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is a very short walk to the cache from the trail head at Gravel Lick (about a 1/4 mile).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In it, you will find a log book, some trade items and a handmade stamper and ink pad.  PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THE STAMPER OR INKPAD.  Those who stamp their letterbox notepads will need it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to find this geocache without a gps, here are the directions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Take Route 66 North From Shippenville.&lt;br/&gt;2. At Leeper, turn right onto Route 36.&lt;br/&gt;3. Follow Route 36 for approximately 3.5 miles and turn right onto Miola Road.&lt;br/&gt;4. Immediately after getting on Miola Road, turn left onto Gravel Lick Road.&lt;br/&gt;5. Follow Gravel Lick Road until you see the trailhead for the North Country Trail.  &lt;br/&gt;6. Park your car and follow the North Country Trail SouthWest of where you park (the same side of the road as the North Country Trail Sign).&lt;br/&gt;7. Follow the trail across the crick and up the hillside.&lt;br/&gt;8. After a few switchbacks up the hill, the trail will go straight for about 300 feet until it intersects with Baker Trail.  There is a log box at the intersection of the North Country Trail and Baker Trail.&lt;br/&gt;9. The Letterbox is located behind the big rock about 30 feet from the log box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please make sure that you wear Flourescent orange when seeking this Letterbox during hunting seasons.

I have taken several readings, on several different days and you guessed it, came up with several different readings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are a coordinate purist (you should really learn a thing or two about the true repeatable accuracy of civilian gpsr's, especially under this thick of cover) you probably should not attempt this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To add to the degree of difficulty, I have been told that it is a pretty unique hide so search, you don't want them all to be park and grabs do you.  If you do, stay in the city or just go after ammo cans under a pile of sticks.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cache is located along Irish Rock Trail in Clear Creek&lt;br/&gt;State Park at an area known as Irish Rock. Please park at N 41°&lt;br/&gt;20.251 W 079° 06.303. To get to Irish Rock Trail, follow River&lt;br/&gt;trail. River Trail begins very near the parking coordinates. Both&lt;br/&gt;of these trails follow along the Clarion River. Irish Rock is an&lt;br/&gt;area of historic significance for the Clarion River. This area was&lt;br/&gt;used by the raftmen of the Clarion River during the rafting logging&lt;br/&gt;era of the mid 1800's. This was a spot that was easy for the&lt;br/&gt;raftmen to tie up their rafts to overnight on their long journey&lt;br/&gt;down the Clarion River. The cache is a 30mm ammo can. It is hidded&lt;br/&gt;in a very normal way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to some DNF's, and the purpose of this cache being a nice&lt;br/&gt;hike, not a hard cache, I want to help you out some. Plus I think&lt;br/&gt;the dense cover is playing havoc on people's gps's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;The cache is located just to the left of the trail as it starts&lt;br/&gt;to head up over the hill. It is under a collection of rocks between&lt;br/&gt;the trail and the big rocks by the river.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to lindlou99 for the FTF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK1Y09H - Parking for Clarion River - Irish Rock&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 20.251 W 079° 06.303&lt;br/&gt;This is the parking area for Clarion River - Irish Rock cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is on my property so, if you see someone in the yard, stop and say hi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a great place to discover travel bugs and coins or help one on it's journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My neighbors know that the cache is there so they will know what you are doing, but as to not disturb them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLEASE ONLY PULL INTO THE DRIVEWAY THAT HAS THE NUMBER 7251 ON THE MAILBOX POST (There is alot of landscaping in the front yard and the house is away from the road about 200 feet).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Feel free to park anywhere in this driveway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only rules are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Please do not walk through the landscaping. Cache is not there, it is above it. Up and above it (hint, hint.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Cache is open year round, but please only cache during daylight hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun, and feel free to stop by any time to discover or move along travel bugs or geocoins.

The AGT utilizes the growing&lt;br/&gt;interest in geocaching to assist both residents and visitors to the&lt;br/&gt;area in learning more about the unique attractions in the ten&lt;br/&gt;participating counties. This cache contains a unique self inking&lt;br/&gt;rubber stamp which you should use to stamp your Allegheny GeoTrail&lt;br/&gt;Passport to verify that you found it. When you have found a minimum&lt;br/&gt;of six AGT caches, you will be eligible to have your AGT passport&lt;br/&gt;validated and receive a commemorative AGT trackable geocoin at&lt;br/&gt;participating locations. You must have your official AGT passport&lt;br/&gt;with you when you find this cache in order to stamp it.

This was our last cache for the trip.  We ran into geO Kacher and group on our way in while they were coming out.  I agree that it was a longer walk then we were expecting and maybe the terrain is about 1/2 star too low.  I twisted my ankle pretty good on the way out.  However, it was definitely an easy find which was good because it was getting COLD.  This was our 9th stamp for Clarion County.  Very nice spot.

After about a 1/4 mile you will travel the last 300 feet to the cache along a turnpike built in just under 7 hours on November 6, 2010 by a work crew of 20 people from the Keystone Trail Association, the Clarion County Chapter of the North Country Trail Association &amp; the Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This turnpike raises the trail above the swampy ground underneath.  This section of trail was nearly impassible in very wet periods and unpleasant most other times.  Rerouting around this wet section was nearly impossible, requiring this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was placed in honor of the trail work session when this turnpike was created.  It was a very impressive example of a group of people getting together to improve a section of long distance hiking trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you continue further, there are 2 more geocaches along this section of trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the hunt and please remember that hunting does happen in these woods so remember to wear orange for your own safety during all hunting seasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to HOOTnOWL for the first to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK2HYGF - GC2HYGF Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 24.195 W 079° 11.721&lt;br/&gt;Parking for The NCT Turnpike</groundspeak:long_description>

Enjoy.

a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association
(NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of
the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile
apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North
Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA
66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.


&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged
individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a
commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of
the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the
inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the
100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the
corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50
NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on
the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address
to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your
North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the
real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That
treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure
that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt;
for more information on the trail and access points in the
Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At the southern end of the North Country Trail in the Allegheny
National Forest, the main attraction is the local population of
beavers. These guys, nature's engineers, are constantly building
new structures in this area and as a consequence, the trail is
constantly being reshaped to accommodate them.&lt;/p&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

GEO-GET-IT! HISTORY CACHE
LIGHT MY WAY 


GEO-GET-IT! LIGHT MY WAY 
What started the need for oil in the 1850s? The need for light! Refiners discovered that refined petroleum made ideal fuel for lamps.
Production boomed when large oil fields were discovered in Pa. The dominate producer and transporter of oil was The Standard Oil Company founded by John D. Rockefeller. In 1890, the National Transit Building was constructed to house The National Transit Co., Standard Oil's Great Pipeline Company.
We needed light and the answer was oil.

In 1978 the National Transit Building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Now, the Transit is home to the Transit studio artists, the Transit Fine Arts Gallery shop, the Graffiti Gallery, workshops and arts and entertainment activities.
Everyone creates. Everyone has ideas.
Ideas are Light.
Oil City needed light and the answer was Art!

a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association
(NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of
the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile
apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North
Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA
66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged
individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a
commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of
the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the
inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the
100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the
corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50
NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on
the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address
to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your
North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the
real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That
treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure
that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt;
for more information on the trail and access points in the
Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This cache is located just before or just after the crossing of
Coon Creek, depending on your direction of travel. This is a
beautiful area of the NCT and there is a very quiet pond a short
distance from here if you are interested in a short side trip.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

at Amsler Springs. This shelter is a few hundred feet into the
woods from the Amsler Springs trail head on Forest Road 145. This
backpacking shelter has been used by many an overnight hiker on the
NCT in the ANF. Stop in at the shelter on your way by it to read
the shelter's log book to see what adventures others had through
this section of the NCT.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association
(NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of
the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile
apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North
Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA
66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged
individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a
commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of
the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the
inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the
100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the
corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50
NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on
the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address
to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your
North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the
real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That
treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure
that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt;
for more information on the trail and access points in the
Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located a short ways down the trail as it heads
from Amsler Springs toward Kelletville. It is about half way up a
steady ascent up the hillside above the Amsler Springs area. At the
top of this hill is a pretty impressive collection of rocks. These
rocks have 2 rather large outcroppings. There is evidence that
people have used these outcroppings as shelter in the past.
Definitely worth venturing on from here to see what's at the
top.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

After finding the cache, stroll down to the creek to see this interest collection of rocks.  The rocks actually create an elevated pool of water that becomes a very good home for trout as they explore downstream after they are stocked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a very popular fishing spot, as the trails around the rocks show, so be sure to hide the cache as good or better than you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park at N41* 29.522' W079* 12.665'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small lock &amp; lock with a log and room for small trade items. Most of the trade items in the cache originally are oriented towards fishing.  Continue this if you wish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring your fishing pole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to gstiglitz for the FTF.

a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association
(NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of
the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile
apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North
Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA
66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged
individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a
commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of
the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the
inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the
100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the
corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50
NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on
the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address
to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your
North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the
real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That
treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure
that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt;
for more information on the trail and access points in the
Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This geocache is placed near a scenic overlook of the Salmon
Creek Valley. At the overlook, you can take a rest on the bench and
have lunch with a view or just take a few sips from your water
bottle while taking in the beauty of the natural surroundings. At
the exact location of the geocache is a very unique occurence.
Walking along the path, you will notice 2 trail trees. If you want
to learn a little bit about what trail trees are, just google them.
Very interesting stuff. These trail trees are pointing you to the
geocache. :)&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;The NCT travels up a small unnamed stream as it heads up a
valley away from Guiton Run. I stopped and placed this geocache in
a spot that seemed very peaceful and serene on this mid-spring day.
Stop and get this geocache and marvel at the high hillsides beside
you. You probably didn't even realize that they were getting so
big.&lt;/p&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is placed at a monument that was erected in 1934 in memory of 2 CCC members who lost their lives in an automobile accident.  They apparently stayed at the CCC camp that used to be here.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be surprised to find this monument back here.  It is very eery, because everything has grown up around it, but the monument and even the timbers that were placed around it have stayed untouched.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can find some interesting CCC information about the camp that was here on a sign at the end of the road leading to this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had been wanting to place a cache here for a long time now and just happened to do it today while coming by it on a caching trip with a friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Hunting.

This cache wasn't on my route and it was a bit of an interesting find since I'd driven by here while trying to get to the Blueberry cache because the Garmin Nuvi routed me this way.  I even stopped to take a picture on it on the way out to the main road.  After finding the Blueberry cache and the AGT cache I saw this one on my GPSr and figured that it had to be the monument that I'd seen about 45 minutes earlier.  So back I went and this time someone was at the camp.  I was as stealthy as possible and made the quick find.  Thanks for bringing me here.....twice....and for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

I parked at the parking coordinates which had no parking signs but figured what the heck.  There were also signs in two places that said &quot;No Public Access&quot;.  I'm not sure what those were all about but I ignored them since I'm a cacher, not public.  There was a bike parked by the fence so apparently he wasn't part of the public either.  Found the cache in short order and removed a wet soggy log.  The container definitely needs help.  Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

This is the site of the first plantings in America by the Civilian Conservation Corps back in May of 1933.  There is a sign commemorating this at the cache site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Across the road from the cache is the road leading to the Marienville Rod and Gun Club's Trout Nursery.  They raise trout here and release them into the local streams.  The public is welcome to go back there and see the fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a waterproof matchstick container.

a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association
(NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of
the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile
apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North
Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA
66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged
individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a
commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of
the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the
inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the
100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the
corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50
NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on
the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address
to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your
North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the
real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That
treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure
that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt;
for more information on the trail and access points in the
Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is placed very near the trail's crossing of a forest
service road. This is also the area where the trail crosses the
hilltop and leaves, or enters the Salmon Creek valley.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

are arranged almost perfectly. Truly amazing to see.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located near a rock with a gorgeous view of a large valley in the Allegheny National Forest. The coordinates for the easiest way to the top of the rock are N41 32.450 W79 13.090. The route to this cache is along a dirt road between Marienville and Kelletville.  The view is beautiful any time of year, but it is best at sunset.  You may need a 4WD though if trying to get this cache with snow.  The ride on the road itself gives a pleasant trip through this beautiful piece of woods.  The cache is located on the other side of the road.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache contains numerous items along with about a dozen cache in, trash out kits. Feel free to use them to clean up some of the mess left by litterbugs who come to enjoy this beautiful view.  You will know what I mean when you look over the rock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to The Davis Family Rockstoppers for the FTF

&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged

the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the

HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the
corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50
NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on
the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address
to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your
North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the
real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That

is a hiker log box about 15 feet from the cache. Feel free to sign
both log books. Take some time and read some of the hiker logs.
Some of the entries are entertaining and also shows you how many
people enjoy the trail.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located along the trail about a mile north of
Kelletville. The section of trail that this cache is on is about
5.3 miles one way from the trail head north of Kelletville to the
trail head on FR449. This is a delightful hike. Me and stigloc, my
hiking partner for the day (and every other day it seems), did this
hike in just under 3 hours and that was with placing cache.
Wonderful section of trail with very few up and downs.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Park/Clear Creek State Forest, Kennerdell Tract, geocoin. This is a
brand new coin, trackable on geocaching.com. Please only take one
per cacher, and help us spread the word about these two great
resources in the Oil Region!!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you park at the bridge on Miller farm road you will have the
shorter hike or you could park at the north or south end of the
trail and take a longer walk.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As you walk towards the cache you will go right past a cemetery and
then up the ridge that has a very steep drop off on either side of
it so please keep an eye on the little ones if you have any with
you. On one side the drop off descends into the beautiful
Pennsylvania forest that fills most of the region. On the other
side at times you will be able to see Oil Creek and the tracks that
the OC &amp; T railway rides upon. There are many wild animals in
the area and in the fall the leaves are a site to be seen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The many miles of trail that make up the Gerard Hiking Trail were
created and are maintained by a volunteer organization known as the
&quot;Over The Hill Gang&quot;. The trail gets it's name from one of the
volunteers who passed away before the completion of the project.
Make sure to say thanks if you happen to see any of them on the
trail doing there thing to make our lives a little more
enjoyable.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Along with the cache there is also a &quot;Benchmark&quot; near where you
will park and a &quot;Letterbox&quot; on the other side of the bridge. No
hints will be given as they should not be needed.&lt;br/&gt;

I'd been to the cemetery before and really enjoyed the history of the place.  So after work Mrs.uccacher and I headed off to Titusville in search of &quot;The Ridge&quot;.  I think it's cool that Bussard444 got to meet my dad who is part of the &quot;Over the Hill Gang&quot;, the group that takes care of the Gerard Hiking Trail every Wednesday morning.

We parked between the railroad tracks and bridge on Miller Farm Road and after taking  photo of the benchmark, climbed the steps and headed up the trail.  I'm glad we knew the proper route to take because I don't think that I would have liked climbing up the hill from the tracks.  Once we got to the top we found the cache without any problems and I dropped off a couple of the new coins since there weren't any left in the container.

We took our time on the way down so Mrs.uccacher could photograph her favorite subject.  Fungus!  I even went down the hill to where it drops off sharply to the tracks in hopes of getting some good photos of the creek.  Unfortunately there were too many trees in the way but I did get my exercise coming back up.  Once we got back to the Jeep, I decided to go down to Oil Creek and take some pictures of the bridge since the creek was low.

I've now met my goal of finding at least one cace for 159 straight days.  The reason for the 159 is because that is the longest number of days that I'd gone without finding a cache.  Will I stop at 159?  I guess I'll find out tomorrow.  Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association
(NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of
the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile
apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North
Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA
66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged
individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a
commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of
the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the
inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the
100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the
corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50
NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on
the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address
to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your
North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the
real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That
treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure
that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt;

Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located on the section of trail from Kelletville
to the trail head on FR449. It is hidden behind a mossy stump
beside Fork Run. This is a good size creek that the trail follows
along for a good piece. Enjoy the hike and the hide.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located along the section of trail from
Kelletville to the trail head on FR 449. It is hidden right after,
or before(depending on your direction of travel) crossing a snow
mobile trail that crosses the trail. The actual hiding spot reminds
me of the root fences that farmers used to put up way back in the
day. They would clear the woods away, creating a field and set the
roots of the trees up, without soil, and allow them to be the
fences to keep the animals in. This almost looks like that.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This cache is placed along the trail in the section that goes
north from Kelletville to the trail head on FR 449. There is an
interesting marker here from the department of agriculture that
uses three bearing trees (2 of which still have their marks also)
to confirm the location of the marker. Pretty cool to come along
the trail and all of a sudden find such an elaborate location
marker set up in the middle of nowhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

just about half way between Titusville and Meadville. A good place
to park would be on the edge of the dirt road across the street.
The coordinates will put you in the field so to find the cache from
there all you have to do is smell the “Pine fresh scent”. The
school was built in 1925, and was for grades one through six. It
was closed after 31 years of service in 1956. There were
three-rooms in the school. Kids who went to school here walked or
were brought by bus or buggy. A large coal furnace in the basement
heated it. Many of the neighbors that are still living in the area
went to school here. There was a small ball field next to the
schoolhouse at one time. After it was closed down it was used for a
Four H meeting hall for a short time. Then it was converted into a
living house and the present occupants have lived there for 20
years and are the ones who have given permission for the cache to
be placed here.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The North Country National Scenic Trail Geotrail (NCTGT) is
a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association
(NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of
the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile
apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North
Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA
66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged
individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a
commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of
the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the
inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the
100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the
corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50
NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on
the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address
to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your
North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the
real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That
treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure
that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt;
for more information on the trail and access points in the
Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located along the trail section that runs north
from Kelletville to the trail head on FR449. This cache was the
last one that I hid as my contribution to this incredible
collection of 100 caches along 100 miles of trail. I am, or have
been, your cache placing guide from Route 66 in Clarion County to
FR 449 just north of this location. I hope that you enjoy this
series of caches as much as I enjoyed putting my portion of them
out.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Park Avenue was a very busy place when we arrived but we threw caution to the wind and nearly got taken out by a little white car even though we were on the sidewalk.  Walked over to the wrong end and spotted it from there.  The cache is no longer attached but is otherwise in good shape.  Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

This cache is .5 mile south of PA 948 on the NCT.     </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">*There has been some big changes to this cache. There is now at&lt;br/&gt;least temporarily mud that is so thick I had to pull my 16 year old&lt;br/&gt;Daughter out of it (the worst can be avoided if you use care in&lt;br/&gt;choosing your path.) There are a lot more places where the cache&lt;br/&gt;could be so I have upped the rating a little.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The cache is in an ammo box and in the woods where I used to play&lt;br/&gt;as a kid. After you find the cache you may want to continue up to&lt;br/&gt;the rocks (roughly north of the cache). This cache started life&lt;br/&gt;with a Gore change purse, a book (Lost in space), a bugs life&lt;br/&gt;figure (Flick), a New York Yankees key chain, a skeleton key chain&lt;br/&gt;and some new shoe laces. Of course there is also a log book, 2&lt;br/&gt;pencils, a couple of pens and a pencil sharpener. If you have any&lt;br/&gt;questions feel free to send me an E-mail through this site.

The North Country National Scenic Trail Geotrail (NCTGT) is a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association (NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

This cache is 2.5 miles south of PA 948 on the NCT.  </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

Forest Road Series

This series of caches is dedicated to the Forest Roads (FR) that wind around the Allegheny National Forest. There are over 1100 numbered roads and many more unnumbered oil development roads throughout the area. Without these roads a lot of caches would not be possible. Each road is built to exacting engineering specifications. Some roads are open for everyday traffic, some open only at hunting season, and some are closed for resource management. If there is no gate on the road it is generally drivable by anyone. If there is a signed gate motorized vehicles are not allowed. All roads are open for hiking and bicycling, even the gated oil and gas development roads. Enjoy the series and enjoy the roads.</groundspeak:long_description>

Forest Road Series

This series of caches is dedicated to the Forest Roads (FR) that wind around the Allegheny National Forest. There are over 1100 numbered roads and many more unnumbered oil development roads throughout the area. Without these roads a lot of caches would not be possible. Each road is built to exacting engineering specifications. Some roads are open for everyday traffic, some open only at hunting season, and some are closed for resource management. If there is no gate on the road it is generally drivable by anyone. If there is a signed gate motorized vehicles are not allowed. All roads are open for hiking and bicycling, even the gated oil and gas development roads. Enjoy the series and enjoy the roads.</groundspeak:long_description>

Mrs. uccacher and I headed south to try the new ones near Titusville.  Even though the coordinates are good, this one took a few minutes to track down.  I guess I was thinking that in this part of the state it would have been hidden where it was snow friendly.  Now that I look at the attributes I see that it isn't.  I guess that's one of the disadvantages of going paperless since my GPSr doesn't show attributes.  Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

The trail is roughly brushed out and close attention to the trail is the keynote here, it is through a forested area, not marked but evident if you go slowly.
The cache is not far from the main trail, down another trail to the right. Just look for the White Pine tree, to the right, as you stand at the Y of the two trails. 


Take State Hy 77 East from Meadville to the town of New Richmond, turn right in town, to John Brown Road, go past the ruins of John Browns Tannery(Historic Site) and turn left on Johnson Road (look for the red barn on the right.)not far down the road, there is a marked parking area for State Game Lands, just past it on the right is another smaller parking area, park there. (41 42.46-079 57.16), walk down the road 100 ft or so and just past a white post with an orange sign on your left, there is an evident trail heading NNE about 40-50 degrees, follow that through the woods until you come to a Y (41 42.64 - 079 57.08), take the right trail, about 50-75 feet down the trail, on the right side, there is a White Pine tree with three trunks, and next to that a single tree. Cache is in a two gallon white sealed bucket at the base of the triple trunk tree. Contents, bag of pencils, sharpener, log book, crayons, chalk. 

A few other notes to would be seekers:
1. Please keep in mind that this cache is located in PA State Gamelands .
Use caution, wear blaze orange during hunting season,
and be sure to follow Pennsylvania Game Commission-Laws &amp; Regulations
2. There are some thorns, nettle, and other nasty nature.

This 4 stage multi will take you to a few different places within 1 mile of each other. The 1st 3 stages are considered NOT to be kid friendly, due to the closeness of the road(s), however the final stage is considered kid friendly.

EXTREME CAUTION is the best medicine to do this cache. Please watch yourself while searching the roadside.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well, the rain quit so I decided to give this one another go.  Armed with a little more information courtesy of emtfire10 (mainly the part about not having to leave the roadside), I was able to find the first stage quickly this time.  The coordinates had me on the opposite side of the road, down over the bank.  I'd looked in that area before but this time I had the right angle.  WooHoo!! Off to stage 2.

This area looked familiar because there was another cache nearby at one time.  Once again I made this one much harder than it was and found it after about 15 minutes.  I don't know how I missed this on the first or second passes but the third time was a charm.  WooHoo!!! Off to stage 3.

This was definitely the hardest of the three stages and I needed a lot of help from emtfire10 and firegirl69.  I was actually looking for the right object but it seems that something happened over night making it about a 4.5 difficulty.  Thanks for the big assist Dave and Val!!!  WooHoo!!!  Off to the final.

This one was an easy one and I made a pretty quick find, grabbed the FTF coin and left a coin and TB.  I ended up with about 3 hours invested in this one and was glad to be able to complete it.  I'm not a fan of multis but this one was too close to home to ignore.  I'm also adding a waypoint for the first stage that may help if your having trouble.  They look to be about 30' from the posted coordinates. The other 3 stages were right on for me. Thanks for adventure and FTF #16.</groundspeak:text>

This series of caches is dedicated to the Forest Roads (FR) that wind around the Allegheny National Forest. There are over 1100 numbered roads and many more unnumbered oil development roads throughout the area.  Without these roads a lot of caches would not be possible. Each road is built to exacting engineering specifications. Some roads are open for everyday traffic, some open only at hunting season, and some are closed for resource management. If there is no gate on the road it is generally drivable by anyone. If there is a signed gate motorized vehicles are not allowed. All roads are open for hiking and bicycling, even the gated oil and gas development roads. Enjoy the series and enjoy the roads.  This particular road leads to the interior of the National Recreation Area.  There is no gate at the main road but is located about 1/4 mile down the road.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Canadohta Lake is the second-largest natural lake in Pennsylvania. Its tree-lined shores and spring-fed waters are located in the Keystone State's Great Lakes tourism region. This sportsman's paradise is famous for its year-round fishing and the tournaments it hosts, in particular the ice fishing tournament held every February.

Canadohta Lake is one of eight lakes in Crawford County. The waterways draw outdoor enthusiasts to the area for hiking, sailing, swimming, fishing, camping, biking, canoeing and numerous other activities. Anglers are delighted to hear that big fish stories are no lie at Canadohta Lake; the state stocks Canadohta Lake annually with pan fish, bluegill, perch, sunfish, northern pike, muskellunge, walleye, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass.

Washington Lake was the first name given the body of water. As the story goes, during the Revolutionary War, George Washington was a friend of Colonel Crawford, the namesake of the county in which Canadohta Lake rests. The name was changed in the 1800s to the more aptly descriptive Oil Creek Lake. Prospectors and developers bought and sold land around the lake until about 1900, when a group of rich men bought up all the property around the lake. They changed the name to Canadohta after Cornplanter Chief Canadaughta. A lawsuit opened up the lake to the public, relegated ownership of Canadohta Lake to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and denied the Canadohta Club private use of the water.

When I got up this morning I checked my mail and saw that it had been published about 30 minutes earlier.  Hoping that Canadohtaman wasn't going to come out of retirementb  I headed south to try my luck.  When I saw that it was hidden in the same place as the old one I figured I'd grab my gloves.  Oh crap.  I'd used them the day before and didn't put them back in the Jeep.  Oh well.  Even though I had to search through the prickly stuff I was FTF at 8:00am.  Took a couple of coins to move on.  This was my 14th AGT-Crawford stamp.  Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

This series of caches is dedicated to the Forest Roads (FR) that wind around the Allegheny National Forest. There are over 1100 numbered roads and many more unnumbered oil development roads throughout the area.  Without these roads a lot of caches would not be possible. Each road is built to exacting engineering specifications. Some roads are open for everyday traffic, some open only at hunting season, and some are closed for resource management. If there is no gate on the road it is generally drivable by anyone. If there is a signed gate motorized vehicles are not allowed. All roads are open for hiking and bicycling, even the gated oil and gas development roads. Enjoy the series and enjoy the roads.</groundspeak:long_description>

Oh well, maybe a bit more than &quot;just&quot; off the road.  This cache is located off Grunderville Road along an oil lease road.   Pay no attention to the gate if you are walking.  It is to keep vehicles out. The lease, including the building, is located on the Allegheny National Forest.  As such you can walk anywhere you want despite what some oil producers want you to believe.  I would not drive up the road though even if the gate is open.  The cache is a medium sized snap lid food storage container that should keep things dry if the lid is replaced with care.</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache is a micro style with coordinates to the 2nd half of this multi. No Need to bushwhack on this one &amp; 1st stage is NOT down near the creek. Parking nearby, but please use extreme caution for possible traffic coming. This is stage one of the awesome view. You are looking for a micro container in the 1st stage. The 2nd container contains a small log to sign, so please bring a pen or pencil. There is a bit of a distance between the 2 caches. But I think you will love the views and the ride.

This cache is placed near the long closed Grunderville Road. It was a great short cut from RT 62 to Pleasant Drive outside Warren. PennDOT closed the road in the 90's as the road was constantly sliding down the hill and required periodic major maintenance. The closed road is in the middle of the existing Grurnderville Road as the road is still open on the east and west end.  Most of the closed road is on private property so hiking from one end to the other is not a reality.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is placed along the long closed Grunderville Road.  It was a great short cut from RT 62 to Pleasant Drive outside Warren.  PennDOT closed the road in the 90's as the road was constantly sliding down the hill and required periodic major maintenance.  The closed road is in the middle of the existing Grurnderville Road as the road is still open on the east and west end.</groundspeak:long_description>

For some reason, probably because of the 3 star terrain rating, I thought that the Road Long Gone caches were going to be on the closed part of the road and it was going to be a bit of a hike.  Much to my surprise I could park right next to it and step over the ditch and scramble up the hill.  Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

My Grandkids really like the playground here so I needed to let
everyone see what this park has to offer. Bring your picnic lunch
as there are lots of places to enjoy a snack and watch a ball game.
Lots of muggles around but maybe not for the final. The coords at
the second stage are the commercial standard for coords being 4
places. Just round the 4 places to three places for your GPSr.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: AI299P5 - Final Mac &amp; Dee's Fun Place&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: BP299P5 - Stage 2 of Mac &amp; Dee's Fun Place&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

It looks like it must have rained here either last night or early this morning because the grass and undergrowth in the woods were very wet.  It didn't much matter since we spent the entire day in the wet.  We were able to track down the first two stages very quickly and Tprints made the find on the final in a spot where I'd already looked.  For those who don't use DeLorme GPSr's, just round up the next to last digit of the stage 2 number that has 4 decimal places and everything will work our fine.

PennDOT closed the road in the 90's as the road was constantly sliding down the hill and required periodic major maintenance. The closed road is in the middle of Grurnderville Road as the road is still open on the east and west end.</groundspeak:long_description>

Forest Road Series

This series of caches is dedicated to the Forest Roads (FR) that wind around the Allegheny National Forest. There are over 1100 numbered roads and many more unnumbered oil development roads throughout the area. Without these roads a lot of caches would not be possible. Each road is built to exacting engineering specifications. Some roads are open for everyday traffic, some open only at hunting season, and some are closed for resource management. If there is no gate on the road it is generally drivable by anyone. If there is a signed gate motorized vehicles are not allowed. All roads are open for hiking and bicycling, even the gated oil and gas development roads. Enjoy the series and enjoy the roads.</groundspeak:long_description>

This area has a long history.  It started out as a Civilian Conservation Camp (CCC) in the 1930's.  After the war Elinor Roosevelt was instrumental in securing the site for a Girl Scout Camp.  It remained a camp until just the last few years when the Girl Scout council was moved to Pittsburgh.  That council decided to consolidate camps in their region and Birdsall Edey was closed down.  There are no current plans for the site now.</groundspeak:long_description>

A simple micro hidden in the normal fashion please BYOP.

Having water available in area streams, ponds and cisterns helps a fire department only if the water is readily accessible. The needed water may be located so far away from where it is needed that a fire department's ability to control the fire is impaired. Mobile water supply vehicles can move water from distant sources, but the critical factor is whether or not the fire department can maintain an uninterrupted supply of a predictable rate of water at the fire scene.

Installation of dry hydrants into nearby and developed water supplies eliminates the inefficiency and complexity of long-distance water shuttle operations. This arrangement also allows access to water sources from a roadway instead of having to work on soft ground immediately adjacent to the pond or stream.

In any area without water mains and domestic fire hydrants, the dry hydrant concept can provide a simple, cost-effective solution to the need for rapid access to water sources. A dry hydrant consists of an arrangement of piping with one end in the water and the other end extending to dry land and available for connection to a pumper.


Dry hydrants have the following features:
•Use a non-pressurized pipe system.

•Use relatively inexpensive piping materials and other supplies.
•Are permanently installed in existing lakes, ponds, streams and cisterns.

•Provide a means of access whenever needed, regardless of weather.
•Allow years of simple operation with a minimum of maintenance.

I brought my bike along to do this series, the series on the trail to the north and a few caches in the ANF as well.  The GPS put me in the middle of the trail so even though that's not far off, it made for an interesting search.  I'm sure the muggles were wondering why a Fence Inspector would be working on a Sunday but I just ignored them and went about my business.  After searching for quite awhile, I decided to call the last finder who told me where to look.  Thanks Dave!  That sure wasn't what I was expecting.  I'm certainly glad I didn't try this one in the winter time.  Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

I'd say that it's going to rain 25% of the time.  8:00am it was raining.  Same at 9:00am.  10:00am....rain.  11:00am, 12:00pm, 1:00pm...more of the same.  Finally at 2:30pm I decided that I was going to get wet so off I went.  Luckily I made a quick find just as somebody in a white Blazer drove by blowing the horn.  A short time later the owner's wife called and made a harrassing comment about my backside [:O] This was my 60th straight day of finding at least one cache.  Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

Enjoy the view both @ the first &amp; final stages, you may want to bring your camera, to catch some photos of the Osprey Nest that was recently placed.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">WooHoo!!! First to find.  I'll admit that I had help.  After searching for the first stage for 45 minutes, I called the owner for a hint.  He gave me a little one that confirmed that I was searching correctly but still couldn't come up with it after another 30 minutes.  So I called again begging for mercy and he gave a better hint.  It still took 10 more minutes to find it.  I think that it was hidden much better than intended.  I rehid it as found.

After that it was off to stage 2.  I knew about were it was going to be and knew of an easier way to get there but I wanted to check on a cache I was trying to get published.  It turns out that my cache is 475' from this one which is too close according to Groundspeak.

Fortunately the water is really, really low right now so it made crossing the water a snap.  Then it was just a matter of climbing the hill to GZ which wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  Worked my way over to where the GPSr showed the final and stood there surveying the situation.  Turns out I was standing about 3' from the well hidden container.  Signed the log at 11:26am and took the FTF coin which I will probably release since we have all of the AGT coins.  Thanks for the adventure and for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

This match stick container is located near the old Scandia Airpark.  It is not an active airport anymore but is used by the Kinzua Aeromodelers RC Model Airplane Club.  Please do not go past the yellow barrier across the road.  If the barrier is not in place and you see model airplanes flying you are welcome to go watch.  

As the title shows, this cache is placed as a caching memorial to the now deceased owner of the airport.  Harold has a long history of aviation including an instructor during the 2nd WW.  His support of the aviation community and our flying club will be missed.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is part of the 66 Bible cache series.

You may go to this one 24/7 and if your there in the afternoon stop out back and talk to the Yoder's, they are a very nice Amish family.

As far as parking goes. Just park on the side of Peterson rd.

Leviticus is a manual of regulations enabling the holy King to set up his earthly throne among the people of his kingdom. It explains how they are to be his holy people and to worship him in a holy manner. Holiness in this sense means to be separated from sin and set apart exclusively to the Lord for his purpose and for his glory. So the key thought of the book is holiness (see notes on 11:44; Ex 3:5)—the holiness of God and his people (they must revere him in “holiness”). In Leviticus spiritual holiness is symbolized by physical perfection. Therefore the book demands perfect animals for its many sacrifices (chs. 1–7) and requires priests without deformity (chs. 8–10). A woman’s hemorrhaging after giving birth (ch. 12); sores, burns or baldness (chs. 13–14); a man’s bodily discharge (15:1–18); specific activities during a woman’s monthly period (15:19–33)—all may be signs of blemish (a lack of perfection) and may symbolize human spiritual defects, which break spiritual wholeness. The person with visible skin disease must be banished from the camp, the place of God’s special presence, just as Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden. Such people can return to the camp (and therefore to God’s presence) when they are pronounced whole again by the examining priests. Before they can reenter the camp, however, they must offer the prescribed, perfect sacrifices (symbolizing the perfect, whole sacrifice of Christ).

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">During the heart of Prohibition a shall we say &quot;gentalman&quot; of the local area by the name of Jacob Ostergard had himself a rather lucrative business of moonshining going on in the general area of this cache. His stills were the biggest in the area and produced only the highest quality illegal Gin in the two state area. Through a network of sneaks and &quot;vacuum salesmen&quot; Ostergard's gin was delivered to the many back room bars and Speakeasys in the Corry and Youngsville areas along with Clymer and Findley Lake NY.
The business was a great success for may years till one day while doing a proofing test he managed to some how set his entire setup to flame. After sending his helper to safety Ostergard was killed when one of the tanks collapsed under the heat and the ensuing blast literally blew him to pieces and shook the ground for miles. After a rather lengthily search all of the remains were found with the exception of his head. Many people said that he got what he deserved but many more drank to his memory for as long as the back stock of the great mans Gin held out.

Groundspeak's email server was broken so we didn't get notification of this one when it was published.  I saw that it was published last night when I checked my closest unfound caches in the morning but since this was one of three new ones in the same area, I figured some one had already grabbed them either last night or early this morning.  So after grabbing another FTF in Cambridge Springs and seeing that it still hadn't been logged, we headed toward Clymer to give it a shot.

The deer carcass that's about 30' or so away adds a nice touch.  It probably didn't smell when the cache was hidden since it was more like winter yesterday but the aroma was pretty noticeable in the scorching 60 degree heat.  We found the cache right away and saw that twhrider had been here about 40 minutes ahead of us.  After signing the log, I gave her a call and found out that she was first on the other two as well and that she was about 1 minute from passing by.  She stopped and we had a nice chat before heading for home.  We saved the other two caches for another day so that I can keep my consecutive days caching streak alive.  It stands at 55 right now.  Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

We'd debated trying it last night after doing one at the Union City Dam in the dark but decided against it.  We headed out right after work and after quickly checking the obvious spot, we started looking elsewhere.  After about 10 minutes I finally found it in the first non-obvious spot that Mrs.uccacher had checked.  She usually finds the caches in places that I've already checked.  After we signed the log at 5:45pm and rehid the container, the owner showed up.  We chatted for about 30 minutes before heading out to grab a few more local caches that we hadn't found yet.  Thanks for another FTF and a fun cache!!  At least it was fun for us since we found it.</groundspeak:text>

Driving in the area looking for a few caches I came upon this small creek &amp; area.
Took a good look at it, &amp; what I figured is it must have been so type of Dam or Flood Contol System.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The book of Judges depicts the life of Israel in the promised land from the death of Joshua to the rise of the monarchy. On the one hand, it is an account of frequent apostasy, provoking divine chastening. On the other hand, it tells of urgent appeals to God in times of crisis, moving the Lord to raise up leaders (judges) through whom he throws off foreign oppressors and restores the land to peace.
With Israel’s conquest of the promised land through the leadership of Joshua, many of the covenant promises God had made to their ancestors were fulfilled (see Jos 21:43–45). The Lord’s land, where Israel was to enter into rest, lay under their feet; it remained only for them to occupy it, to displace the Canaanites and to cleanse it of paganism. The time had come for Israel to be the kingdom of God in the form of an established commonwealth on earth.

But in Canaan Israel quickly forgot the acts of God that had given them birth and had established them in the land. Consequently they lost sight of their unique identity as God’s people, chosen and called to be his army and the loyal citizens of his emerging kingdom. They settled down and attached themselves to Canaan’s peoples together with Canaanite morals, gods, and religious beliefs and practices as readily as to Canaan’s agriculture and social life.</groundspeak:long_description>

Many readers of Joshua (and other OT books) are deeply troubled by the role that warfare plays in this account of God’s dealings with his people. Not a few relieve their ethical scruples by ascribing the author’s perspective to a pre-Christian (and sub-Christian) stage of moral development that the Christian, in the light of Christ’s teaching, must repudiate and transcend. Hence the main thread of the narrative line of Joshua is an offense to them. 
It must be remembered, however, that the book of Joshua does not address itself to the abstract ethical question of war as a means for gaining human ends. It can only be understood in the context of the history of redemption unfolding in the Pentateuch, with its interplay of divine grace and judgment. Of that story it is the direct continuation.

Joshua is not an epic account of Israel’s heroic generation or the story of Israel’s conquest of Canaan with the aid of her national deity. It is rather the story of how God, to whom the whole world belongs, at one stage in the history of redemption reconquered a portion of the earth from the powers of this world that had claimed it for themselves, defending their claims by force of arms and reliance on their false gods. It tells how God commissioned his people to serve as his army under the leadership of his servant Joshua, to take Canaan in his name out of the hands of the idolatrous and dissolute Canaanites (whose measure of sin was now full; see Ge 15:16 and note). It further tells how he aided them in the enterprise and gave them conditional tenancy in his land in fulfillment of the ancient pledge he had made to Israel’s ancestors, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Numbers relates the story of Israel’s journey from Mount Sinai to the plains of Moab on the border of Canaan. Much of its legislation for people and priests is similar to that in Exodus, Leviticus and Deuteronomy. The book tells of the murmuring and rebellion of God’s people and of their subsequent judgment. Those whom God had redeemed from slavery in Egypt and with whom he had made a covenant at Mount Sinai responded not with faith, gratitude and obedience but with unbelief, ingratitude and repeated acts of rebellion, which came to extreme expression in their refusal to undertake the conquest of Canaan (ch. 14). The community of the redeemed forfeited their part in the promised land. They were condemned to live out their lives in the desert; only their children would enjoy the fulfillment of the promise that had originally been theirs (cf. Heb 3:7—4:11).

As his final act at this important time of transferring leadership to Joshua, Moses delivered his farewell addresses to prepare the people for their entrance into Canaan. In them, Moses emphasized the laws that were especially needed at such a time, and he presented them in a way appropriate to the situation. In contrast to the matter-of-fact narratives of Leviticus and Numbers, here the words of Moses come to us from his heart as this servant of the Lord presses God’s claims on his people Israel.

The trucking industry is a very tough job to deal with. The hours required to move all types of freight from point A to point B. Here you may see Kwhops, Big &amp; Long Nose Petes, Freightshakers, Overgrown Dodges on steroids, Cabovers and numerous other types. Some are company owned &amp; some are not.

When I drove out on the road, the trucks that I had seen were un real. I travelled all over the East Coast with Florida being the only state that I never drove thru.

I would love to do this job again, only if the pay was right.If you bought it, drive it, wear it, breathe it, drink it, or eat it a Trucker brought it @ some point.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Christ's Church in Port Maitland was built in 1841. My wife &amp; I&lt;br/&gt;were married here in 1976. Her parents and numerous relatives are&lt;br/&gt;buried in the church cemetery. There is also a public cemetery&lt;br/&gt;adjoining the Anglican Church cemetery immediately to the east.&lt;br/&gt;Parking is available at the entrance to the church at the following&lt;br/&gt;coordinates: N42o 51.502 W079o 35.235&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some interesting history related to this little country&lt;br/&gt;church. Because of its excellent harbor, the British maintained a&lt;br/&gt;naval base at Port Maitland after the War of 1812. In 1850, the&lt;br/&gt;ship Commerce sank off of Port Maitland and 25 of those who&lt;br/&gt;perished are buried here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following account is from The Grand River Naval Depot by&lt;br/&gt;John Thornley Docker, D.Min.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Three steam vessels, the Minos, the Toronto, and the Despatch&lt;br/&gt;were stationed in the harbour during the following years. On May 6,&lt;br/&gt;1850 the worst disaster on Lake Erie up to that time occurred just&lt;br/&gt;outside the Port Maitland harbour. The Despatch, stationed at the&lt;br/&gt;naval depot, rammed the steamer Commerce, which was damaged so&lt;br/&gt;badly that it sank in a very short time. The Commerce had been en&lt;br/&gt;route to London with 125 officers and men of the 23rd regiment of&lt;br/&gt;the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, their wives and children. Those saved&lt;br/&gt;were put on board the Minos and taken to the naval establishment.&lt;br/&gt;The actual number of those who perished that night has never been&lt;br/&gt;definitely established. Twenty-five bodies recovered from the wreck&lt;br/&gt;were interred in a long grave in Christ's Church cemetery. A&lt;br/&gt;monument placed over the grave by the regiment remains as a&lt;br/&gt;reminder of the tragedy.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monument is still legible after all these years. You may&lt;br/&gt;find it interesting to read after you have located the cache. Also,&lt;br/&gt;be sure to enjoy the great view of the lake, the pier and the Port&lt;br/&gt;Maitland Light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; A detailed account of the sinking of&lt;br/&gt;the Commerce can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first cache I have hidden. It's a small camouflaged&lt;br/&gt;lock n lock container. At the time of hiding it contained the&lt;br/&gt;following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Log book and pencil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Geocache note&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- An Oakcoins &lt;em&gt;&quot;First to Find&quot;&lt;/em&gt; pin for the first to&lt;br/&gt;find&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A small blue toy pickup truck for trading purposes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A new travel bug I'm releasing here&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK276P2 - Parking for GC276P2&lt;br/&gt;N 42° 51.502 W 079° 35.235</groundspeak:long_description>

Advice to anyone doing this one, TAKE LOTS OF BUG SPRAY! and watch the fields on the way in and out. After our find we were rewarded by watching a raccoon and 3 deer in the field. The deer then appeared to chase off the raccoon.

There is an issue with this cache. If a red circle on a post or fence means no trespassing (and I'm pretty sure that's what it means), the cache where it is now is located almost directly behind one of these red blazes... There is no trespassing required to get there as far as I know, and the cache can be retrieved without trespassing, but on the other side of the trail might be a safer bet so no one complains.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">LadyJaime and I decided it was a nice afternoon for a little caching so went out to find this one after leaving the babysitters. As soon as I turned off the main road, I realized I had been here before for a wedding a few summers back. This is the quintessential 'little country church' - beautiful inside as well as the surrounding grounds. One thing that you don't see very often is the large 'crypt-like' stones. Also noticed a very small stone on the way back from the cache - very old and hard to read, but appeared its owner had lived only 24 days... nice to see that the monument has lasted so long.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;The cache is NOT at the posted coordinates&lt;/b&gt;, but the
coordinates can be used for parking and for the first stop of your
tour.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To complete this cache, you will need to learn a bit of the history
of Dunnville by taking a short walking tour of the downtown area.
You should be able to complete this walkabout in 30 to 45 minutes.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Early History: The town of Dunnville owes its existence to the
building of the original Welland Canal. The need to raise water
levels in the canal was fulfilled by the damming of the Grand River
and construction of the feeder canal in 1827. A town soon grew up
around the dam but growth was slow until the Grand River Navigation
Company was formed and the Grand River began to be used as a
transportation corridor. By 1859 the town had a population of
1,800.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This walking tour will take to a number of historically significant
sites in the downtown area. At each stop you will need to find a
bit of information regarding the history of Dunnville. Waypoints
are provided below. Please be careful crossing streets which can be
busy at times and keep an eye on the little ones when walking from
stop to stop.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ready to start?&lt;/b&gt; Here we go!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Stop #1: The Farmer's Market: established in 1860, the Dunnville
Farmer's market still operates from March until the end of December
every Tuesday and Saturday from 7am to noon.&lt;br/&gt;
A = the first digit of the regulation section that prohibits
animals at the market.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Stop #2: The Firehall: here you will find a bell and tower erected
by the Dunnville Firefighter's Association and 2 plaques. B = the
last digit in the year associated with the &quot;Protection Co. No.
1&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Stop #3: The Royal Canadian Legion: Here is a plaque commemorating
Dunnville Branch #142. There are seven numbers on the plaque. C =
the last digit of the sixth number.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Stop #4: The Library: outside the library you will find a number of
plaques. One commemorates the Harvard Mark II, one of the principal
training aircraft used by the R.C.A.F. during the 2nd World
War.&lt;br/&gt;
WW = the last 2 digits of the number of British Commonwealth pilots
who received their flying training on this type of aircraft at No.
6 Service Flying Training School at Dunnville from Oct 31, 1940 to
Dec 1, 1944.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Stop #5: Dunnville Mozaik Sunset: this mosaic is based on a sunset
photo of the Grand River taken by local geocacher Roadapple49 and
commemorates Dunnville's Sesquicentennial Birthday (150 years). On
the plaque below the mosiac you will see a 4 digit number
indicating the number of cells in the mosiac.&lt;br/&gt;
E = (the 1st plus the 4th digit) minus (the 2nd plus the 3rd
digit).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Stop #6: Central Park: Behind the cenotaph which commemorates those
who served in 3 wars you will find an ancient cannon. Take note of
the year engraved on the top of the cannon. Now find a mate to this
cannon elsewhere in the park. Take note of the year engraved on the
top of this 2nd cannon. Subtract the year of the 2nd cannon from
the year on the first cannon.&lt;br/&gt;
D = the answer. (you can verify your answer by checking the 3rd of
the three numbers engraved above the year on the 2nd cannon).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Stop #7: The Gore: defined as a triangular piece of land found
where roads merge or split, this is the center of downtown
Dunnville. This waypoint will bring you to a small statue in a
flower bed. Stand on the sidewalk near the statue and look around.
Across the street you will see one of Dunnville's oldest and one of
my favourite restaurants. If you can't see it, move east towards
the crosswalk.&lt;br/&gt;
Z = the last digit in the year this diner was established.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Stop #8: The Old Bridge: here you will find a large mural depicting
the original dam and bridge.&lt;br/&gt;
X = the number of waterways or plumes that are depicted as flowing
under the bridge.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Stop #9: The Maple Tree Memorials: A large maple tree stands here.
Beneath it are a number of things on which are mounted memorial
plaques. There is another thing which is similar to the others but
has no plaque.&lt;br/&gt;
Y = the total number of these things.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The final:&lt;/b&gt; Now that you have learned your history lesson and
have all your answers, simply plug them in to the coordinates as
follows:&lt;br/&gt;
N 42 AB.CDE&lt;br/&gt;
W 079 WW.XYZ&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Note: the cache area can sometimes be high in muggles. Please be
careful not to expose the cache to muggles. The cache container is
a camo'd decon container. When re-closing the lid be sure to listen
for 4 distinct &quot;pop&quot; sounds as each corner snaps into place. Cache
contains a log sheet but no writing instrument so bring your own.
There's a loonie for FTF and a geocoin that wants to move to
Halifax.&lt;br/&gt;

Dunnville's &quot;Grand Canyon&quot; is spot in the Marshall Memorial Forest that looks out onto the Dent Drain. OK, it's not the Grand Canyon, but it's a nice spot to rest while hiking through the forest.

Official entrance to the Marshall Memorial Forest is at the end of Gillian Drive. But much better parking (P1) can be found at the Church on Highway 3 and another trail entrance (T1) is just a short walk to the bushline at the back of the church lawn. There are numerous paths and unmarked trails throughout the forest. To get to the cache from the trail head, follow the foot trails avoiding the ATV trails, as they can be very muddy. I've provided a waypoint (PD) to a pond which is on the way. The trails have numerous foot-bridges to assist you in crossing the swampy areas that you will encounter. Cross with care.

The cache is a small decon container with a strap and clip which you can use to pull it from it's hiding spot. When re-closing the lid be sure to listen for 4 distinct snaps as each corner of the lid closes tightly. Please replace the container into it's hiding spot so that the strap and clip do not show.

There's a toonie in the cache so FTF can have a coffee on me as well as the &quot;Benzie&quot; 50th Anniversary geocoin to help get things started.

You will walk past GCZVB4 on your way this cache, so be sure to grab it while you're here. Also, GC2RRMD &quot;King Oak&quot; is a short walk through forest.

Oh yeah, - - - Bring BUG SPRAY! - - - 
And bring your own PEN or PENCIL!

Congratulations to BFT6 and ldot for their FTF!

We hid it near a soccer field because we thought there would be lots of places to put it. 
If there is a game be careful not to be see as there are lots of people around at these times. 

It is a medium sized camouflaged box containing a log book, pencil, and Yu-Gi-Oh card for trading. Great item right?

Have fun looking for our cache. Yea. </groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is the the Marshall Memorial Forest near two big old oak trees that I have dubbed &quot;King Oak&quot; and &quot;Queen Oak&quot;.

Official entrance to the Marshall Memorial Forest is at the end of Gillian Drive. But much better parking (P1) can be found at the Church on Highway 3 and another trail entrance (T1) is just a short walk to the bushline at the back of the church lawn. There are numerous paths and unmarked trails throughout the forest. To get to the cache from the trail head, follow the foot trails avoiding the ATV trails, as they can be very muddy. The trails have numerous foot-bridges to assist you in crossing the swampy areas and ditches that you will encounter. Cross with care.

The cache is a small lock and lock container. There's a toonie in the cache so FTF can have a coffee on me as well as the &quot;Big Yellow Whale&quot; travel bug to help get things started.

You will walk past GCZVB4 on your way this cache and, depending on which route you follow, GC2QN0B &quot;Grand Canyon&quot;. Be sure to get them both while in the forest.

Oh yeah, - - - Bring BUG SPRAY! - - -
And bring your own PEN or PENCIL!

So went after another hobo highway cache in town and met up with the SneakySeguis, who didn't have time to head out to this one today. Figured someone would pick it up today, and waited until picking my son up from school, along with his friend. So with geobabe (LadyJaime), catsrule51 and his muggle friend we headed out for an after school walk in the woods to find a couple caches. We were greeted with a blank log book around 3:27 p.m. TFTC and the FTF </groundspeak:text>

Thought this was a good place for a cache. It is located at a rest stop on Highway 3. This stop doesn't have any ammenties but does have tables to sit at for a picnic. It is a nice spot to stretch your legs.

very old as well as some newer markers.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sign says &quot;Willson's Cemetery&quot; but it is often referred to
simply as the &quot;Wilson&quot; cemetery. Judging by the dates on some of
the older markers, it appears to be the final resting place of some
of the pioneers of the township. Please be respectful of the area
and for the souls who rest here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a small camo'd lock'n'lock container and should be
an easy find. Contains a log book but no writing instrument so
BYOP. There's a smiley face pathtag for FTF.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Canby was a Quaker born in Buck's County, Pennsylvania.&lt;br/&gt;He moved to the Niagara region where by 1792 he had built a sawmill&lt;br/&gt;at 12 Mile Creek near &lt;br/&gt;St. Johns village. Later, he operated a tannery and a ferry.&lt;br/&gt;With John McGill he built the first Bridgewater Mills in the&lt;br/&gt;Dufferin Island area of Niagara Falls. Eventually Canby settled at&lt;br/&gt;the Indian Trail crossing of the Oswego Creek, later to be known as&lt;br/&gt;Canby Town. He brought in settlers and blazed trails designed to&lt;br/&gt;converge at his mill and store. He leased a 600-acre strip of land&lt;br/&gt;from Joseph Brant that now lays within the present boundaries of&lt;br/&gt;Paris. He later sold this to the first settlers of Paris,&lt;br/&gt;Christopher and William Holme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canby purchased a 19,500 acre parcel of Grand River land from&lt;br/&gt;Captain John Dochstader for £5,000 (some sources indicate that &quot;in&lt;br/&gt;some irregular manner, he managed to get possession, and refused to&lt;br/&gt;execute the mortgage as agreed upon or to pay the money&quot;). Canby&lt;br/&gt;was described in the Illustrated Historical Atlas of Counties&lt;br/&gt;Haldimand and Norfolk, as ''thrifty, energetic and far-seeing, and&lt;br/&gt;although a Quaker, not overly scrupulous in his dealings.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first settlers Canby brought in were John Byers and John&lt;br/&gt;Miller followed by Peter Swick, Matthew Smith and Peter Melnick.&lt;br/&gt;When the early settlers came to Canboro there were no roads to&lt;br/&gt;reach the township, they had to ascent the Chippewa and Oswego&lt;br/&gt;creeks by boat, bringing all their possessions by this conveyances.&lt;br/&gt;Canboro was formerly well timbered with pine and oak. A steam saw&lt;br/&gt;mill was operated at the village by Mr Crane. William Fitch , a&lt;br/&gt;relative of Canby's came from New York State in 1832 and became a&lt;br/&gt;successful man in the village, owning mills, a store and becoming&lt;br/&gt;the first Post Master. &lt;br/&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;These lands were later incorporated as a township and named in&lt;br/&gt;Canby's honour. Benjamin Canby is buried in the pioneer section of&lt;br/&gt;the cemetery at N 42° 59.458 W 079° 40.111&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find the cache, you will need to determine the final&lt;br/&gt;coordinates from the information above and on the plaque at Stage&lt;br/&gt;1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A = Canby's age when he operated a ferry at &quot;the Landing&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;B = The number of years between the time that Canby and Fitch&lt;br/&gt;settled at Canby Town&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;C = the year that Canby &amp; McGill built the first mills at&lt;br/&gt;Dufferin Island&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D = the year in which Canborough Township was incorporated&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the Stage 1 coordinates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North offset = subtract (A + B) / 1000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;West offset = add (D - C) / 1000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a toonie in the cache for the FTF so you can get&lt;br/&gt;yourself a coffee on me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Kreamer&amp;BrearsKrew for&lt;br/&gt;FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN2KNQH - GC2KNQH Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S12KNQH - GC2KNQH Stage 1&lt;br/&gt;N 42° 59.504 W 079° 40.057</groundspeak:long_description>

So went to bed hoping to be well enough today to head down the road and make the find. The fresh air did me good. Took the geokids out for a FTF around 10 a.m. Will go into town later for some Timmies' hot chocolate:-) Thanks for the FTF and well researched local history lesson. Had considered stopping in here previously, now I had a reason:-) Traded TBs.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Merritt Island 

The trail on Merritt Island runs from the CN Rail Bridge south through the island across the Aqueduct and connects with the Greater Niagara Circle Route.  It's a 4 km walk from the parking area at the Merritt Island Building to the train bridge - or 8km out and back.  You will enjoy the company of families, joggers, roller blades and even a few recreational cyclists.

Merritt Island is host to ten wood carvings by celebrated artist JP Gauthier of Welland. 

The wood carvings are titled: 

The Vertical Farm
My Son
Eagles
Remembrance Day Tribute
Three Bears
Lone Wolf
Bear Hunter
Owl
Lion
Hidden Heron

Located in the first 1.75 km stretch of the island the carvings are a hidden gem.  

The island is host to many bird species, fishing docks, &quot;Wild Flower Trail&quot; which sweeps down by the Welland River and many other treasures. 

The park has different closing times depending on the Season. Please check the entrance gate for listed hours..

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I found this area while exploring. It looks like the big clay/mud walls were part of some run off ditches. Very close by are the remains of what used to be a small pump house. From what I can gather the water was pulled from the canal and into the low lying area near the cache. The reason for this is unknown to me.
The cache is located just off a well used trail. It would be nice to see a few more caches on this side of the river. It would be nice to see them every few hundred meters. I would love to spend the day walking end to end finding caches on the way.
(HINT TO OTHER CACHERS)
Enjoy the walk.

Saw this published last night and my son and I went out at the crack of dawn for what I thought would be an easy pleasant stroll through the woods at Ruigrock... but GPS signal was really wonky and had us going all directions... when it came to a decision I made a bad one and took the less used of the two paths. &quot;Two roads diverged in the yellow wood and I chose the one less travelled by, and that has made all the difference&quot;... Well, this morning that difference meant a whole lot of burrs for the poor dog, traipsing through semi-bog and a lot of unnecessary bushwacking. But it also resulted in a FTF at 7:50 a.m. when I finally smartened up. Thanks for the reminder of a lesson I should have learned long ago, but apparently need to keep relearning! TFTC and the FTF:-)

The second stage has ample parking, but is available only during the day, between dawn and dusk. Please note that the lot has a gate, so make sure you don't get trapped in!

The cache is a small camouflaged container that contains a logbook and, at the time of placement, a pencil.</groundspeak:long_description>

At stage one we immediately realized what tool would be required to attain this happy face. Thanks by the way, I've been meaning to get one of these [;)]. 

At the final the mosquitos were swarming us so bad that we didn't waste any time winding through the trails. Coords were great. We signed in as FTF and made our way back to the geomobile [^].

Once the puzzle was solved I plugged in the coords and off we went. We followed the ATV tracks until we were on the 90 degree angle. From there the cache was a hop, skip and a jump away. Found it in the first spot I looked. 

Great puzzle Willy.

I won't bore you with the story.  This is a series of three ammo cans, each of varying sizes. It should be an easy walk in the woods.  I parked at Niagara Square and trekked in.

There is a skatepark, a beautiful new playground, with a splashpad open daily during the summer.  There is also a nice go-cart track off Kingsman Court.  Bring the kids!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best to do this one during the day, as the park is closed and there are posted signs warning that you will be trespassing if you attempt this cache between the hours of 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. However, it is accessible from Kingsman Court side if you are night caching, and you will not be on YMCA property.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Bouncy Bunny, the sneaky bunny that she is,
had stowed away in the back of the VW, on a recent trip to Niagara
Falls. As we walked the trails, visiting the many wonderful sites
of Niagara, we could hear noises around us, but every time we
looked around, we only could spot the wind blowing through the
vegetation, so we of course didn’t think much of it, until we
got home and spotted a note in the trunk of the car.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 


You people are so
unaware.&lt;br/&gt;
Walking along the trails,&lt;br/&gt;
With your eyes glued on the numbers.&lt;br/&gt;
As they count down to zero,&lt;br/&gt;
You follow the pointing arrow.&lt;br/&gt;
With the hopes of finding a hidden treasure.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If only you knew of the many treasures you walk by,&lt;br/&gt;
Each and every day that you are out.&lt;br/&gt;
Here’s another you will never find.&lt;br/&gt;
Unless you solve my puzzle.&lt;br/&gt;
It’s seemingly simple, but its not.&lt;br/&gt;
You will use both your physical and mental stamina.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Here I give you a task to perform.&lt;br/&gt;
It will lead you to a jar of treasures.&lt;br/&gt;
And a tiny bonus I’ll show you too.&lt;br/&gt;
So sit and relax, and enjoy the falls,&lt;br/&gt;
But only if you can find my treasure,&lt;br/&gt;
Which is guarded by the big rock.&lt;br/&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
This puzzle will test your powers of logic and
deduction. The diagram is made up of a series of open triangles
with a number in the center; that number represents the sum of the
digits you are to write into the spaces on the sides of the
triangles. Where two triangles share a side, they share the number
to be written into that side. All the combinations in this puzzle
use only the digits 0 through 6. All the possible combinations for
every sum are listed in the chart below, so all you have to do is
figure out which of these combinations belongs where (not as easy
as it sounds!). The numbers in a combination can go in any order
around their triangle, and each combination will be used exactly
once.&lt;br/&gt;

Finding another Bouncy Bunny cache? PRICELESS!

WHEW! You made us work for this one... and all for a 2.5 terrain? Yeah, right!!
This was one of the hardest terrains I think I have ever done. Maybe it was the route we chose... all I know is I am sure glad there were ropes there, or I would likely be sitting in the ER right now. 

Once we got to GZ, I am pretty sure we weren't thinking clearly and started expanding our search, rather than following the clue. In any case, we eventually came up with the cache. 

*does the happy bouncy bunny cache found dance*

Another D/T and tequila D/T off my list! YAY!

After a quarter of the way through the first time I messed something up. So I erased it all and started fresh. It took about 1 hour to complete the second time around.  Once it was finished I wanted to go find it right away but I waited until the next morning. 

With geobabe on my back, geomom, P.E.Z. and I headed to GZ. It took a few times of walking right by the cache before we zeroed in on the location. Reception is not the greatest in this area. Once the log book was in hand we signed the first open spot we could find because the bugs were thirsty. 

TFTC and taking us on this great adventure.</groundspeak:text>

I was surprised to find out when I got closer that there was actually 3 or 4 of these along the hydro corridor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the original hiding spot was muggled, so it has been replaced with a 35mm camo.  This one should prove more difficult in the summer when the vines come back.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Sloth (Latin, acedia) is one of the Seven Deadly Sins.

The definition of sloth has changed considerably since its original inclusion among the seven deadly sins. In fact it was first called the sin of sadness or despair. Sadness (tristitia in Latin) described a feeling of dissatisfaction or discontent, which caused unhappiness with one's current situation.

The modern view of the vice is that it represents the failure to utilize one's talents and gifts. For example, a student who does not work beyond what is required (and thus fails to achieve his or her full potential) could be labeled slothful.  I usually find myself slothful after overconsumption from nearby establishment....you guess which one.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Niagara Falls Brewing Company was once Ontario's most innovative brewery, producing beers like no other in the province. However, their beer lineup underwent some changes, and three of their finest beers were discontinued, and replaced by beers not possessing the same daring spirit. I would like to commemorate the Niagara Falls Brewery and the beers that made the brewery the most innovative in Ontario. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Niagara Falls Brewing's beer lineup from 1995-1996 will forever be remembered as one of the most diverse and interesting that Ontario has ever tasted. The slate included: Maple Wheat, Olde Jack Strong Ale, Gritstone Ale, Brock's Extra Stout, Apple Ale, Kriek, Saaz Pilsner, and of course, Eisbock. These beers spanned numerous flavours and styles, a rarity to find such interesting types of beer all at once, from one brewery, and all of high quality. Perhaps the brewery was ahead of its time for the Ontario marketplace in 1996, as this slate did not last, but they should be celebrated and remembered by the fortunate few who were lucky enough to taste these brews. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discontinuation of the Maple Wheat was a great loss to Canadian brewing. The Maple Wheat was a undoubtedly Canadian brew, incorporating Ontario maple syrup with wheat from the Canadian west. The result was a very complex, flavourful brew, and when it was unveiled in 1992 it was at the time Canada's strongest beer at 8.5%. Depending on the serving temperature, the aroma and taste of the brew varied. The smell could have been malty, maple or brandy. The taste had a subtle maple flavour, but if the brew was left to warm, the maple sweetness burst onto the palate. Maple brews are rare in this country, but a few exist. Upper Canada released a Maple Brown Ale in 1998, but it pales in comparison to the original Maple Wheat from Niagara.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In April 2007, Moosehead Brewery, which owns Niagara Brewing, moved its Niagara Falls brewery to Brampton. &lt;br/&gt;At the time, Moosehead said the relocation was for efficiency reasons. That brand is now only served as draft in bars and restaurants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While it is saddening to reflect on what Niagara Falls once was, and what is today, Niagara Falls will soon be home to the region’s two microbreweries, following a decision by a St. Catharines brewery to relocate here.  Cheers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original cache container was an actual micro brew magnet, but sadly, it has gone missing.  Replaced with 35mm camo a little closer to Johnny Roccos than the coordinates listed (by about 15 feet) Take that into consideration.</groundspeak:long_description>

Wow, you endured the long line, the numerous questions about tobacco, alcohol, and firearms, and the unexpected cavity search when you decided to make an imprompteau joke. (Border guards are infamous for their lack of humour...it's actually in the job description.)  What better way to stretch your legs than a quick and easy cache?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go straight up Hwy 420 after clearing customs, and pull in to the Ontario Visitor Centre along Stanley Avenue.  The cache container is perfect for dropping off that cross-border geocoin or 2, but there's not much room for anything else.  There were a few Canada/Niagara Falls pins in here when it was placed.  Beware of muggles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please take note of exactly where the cache is and replace it in the same spot, not on a different side, or it will not fit properly, will be visible, and may therefore be muggled. Wow! That's the longest sentence I ever wrote!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P.S. Watch for decoys! Do not add logbooks as the cache is not missing one.  Read the card!</groundspeak:long_description>

Quick easy find on fairly level terrain.

The &quot;Restin`&quot; caches are a series that will take you to local cemetarys, places of great interest. From pioneers and modern people the lovely places are full of interesting information. Please take your time, walk around, visit with the past. The caches are easy to find. Please respect where you are.

Camo'd Film container containing logbook only so BYOP!

As with any Restin' (cemetery) series cache PLEASE DO NOT CACHE AT NIGHT !!!!

I'm very sure I was in the right area - it just looked right. I made a search, but I might have been more thorough if I'd had someone with me. Things were pretty slippery with the recent rain and I didn't look in every place I wanted to, so I'm not logging a DNF but I'm going to have to come back to try again when things are a little drier.</groundspeak:text>

This birthday cache is for you.
It is a nice spot with lots of photo opportunity. Im glad to see that old age hasn't slowed you guys down to much. No worries Logger, from parking the direction to the cache is pretty flat with lots of spots to rest along the way for when you get tired. It's the last 30 feet or so that might be to much for you to handle!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You Naughty Geocachers!

The seven deadly sins are a classification of the most objectionable vices that were originally used in early Christian teachings to educate and instruct followers concerning man's tendency to sin. The identification and definition of the seven deadly sins over their history has been a fluid process and the idea of what each of the seven actually encompasses has evolved over time. This process has been aided by the fact that they are not referred to in either a cohesive or codified manner in the Bible itself, and as a result other literary and ecclesiastical works referring to the seven deadly sins were instead consulted as sources 
With that being said, the Seven Deadly Ones are generally considered to be:
Lust
Gluttony
Greed
Sloth
Wrath
Envy
Pride

Blah Blah Blah Blah..... These caches are not about a lesson in morality.  They do have a connection to their placement in some manner though.  Keep your head up and have a look around and see if you can spot it in each case for a little chuckle.

Once you have found all 7 Sins, you will have the coordinates to this final.  Don't forget to write down the numbers from each sin you find.  As some caches are missing, the cache is at the posted coordinates.

With confirmation of a digit that I thought I had written down wrong off we went.The first spot I went searching was along a creek not too far from the proper hiding spot. The second location paid off.  I thought this one was going to be harder considering the rest were a little challenging. Great series.

I have been on here in the winter but to go back during the early summer and see everything come alive was amazing. Near the cache is a small waterfalls that is dry most times of the year but can be very slick if its wet.                              I was out doing a near by zodiac series cache that caused me to re visit this area. So even though I placed the cache, it was Flick who inspired me to want to bring others back to this incredible area.
Please have respect for the near by campsite located south of the cache. It is used often by people who are walking the trail system.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Trapper Leo Park. The Cache is Located on the perimiter in a traditional hiding spot. 

 This is one of the caches in the travel series that must be completed in order to find the final for the series which is : 

GC218VH
 Travel Series -- Time ?

We as man have been on the move since the dawn of our existence. We looked new settlements and food sources and as time wore on a thirst for exploration of new places grew, we developed a need for a means of Travel.

When our civilization grew and we needed to transport large numbers of people and supplies to other communities, the train and rail development was the greatest thing since sliced bread. The ability to be so versatile in the number of boxcars and engines that could be used in a train to accommodate its payload made the rail system the king of travel and transportation for hundreds of years. 

Trapper Leo Park is a great place to bring your kids or just come by yourself to enjoy the outdoors , play some soccer , frisbe , use the jungle gym, and ...... oh yeah sit back and watch some trains. 

There is partial co-ords written on the logbook as well as the lid of the container ... don't forget to write these down as you will need them to find the final in the series .
You will also need to visit these caches to get to the final :

GC21GPY Travel Series -- On or Off Road 

GC21GP8 Travel Series -- Float Your Boat

GC21GNP Travel Series -- Take Flight</groundspeak:long_description>

Like greed, envy may be characterized by an insatiable desire; they differ, however, for two main reasons. First, greed is largely associated with material goods, whereas envy may apply more generally.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Easy walk heading out from firemans park with a few other caches along the way. 

 I grew up riding along these trails and thought what a great place to hide my very first cache. A nice easy walk along a trail leading out from Firemans park , whether you park in the upper lot or lower lot is up to you. The upper lot is more straight forward using the trail along the back. If you decide to go and park in the lower lot which is my favorite you will have to cross a set of train tracks to get to the lower lot, just as you are about to cross the tracks you will see a trail to left side of the road, i like that trail the best.... stay to the right hand fork in the trail and you will get there . When you get close to the cache look for a trail leading up the hill on your left. Its a nice view from atop the heap to the south. Just follow the trail leading to the heap, its a bit of a climb to the top but well worth the view in my opinion. Happy hunting. Cheers

      This cache is a medium sized lock and lock style container with camo tape on it, contains log book and pencil and has enough room for small items and a few trackables.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Pride (Latin, superbia) is one of the Seven Deadly Sins.

In almost every list pride is considered the original and most serious of the seven deadly sins, and indeed the ultimate source from which the others arise. It is identified as a desire to be more important or attractive than others, failing to acknowledge the good work of others, and excessive love of self. Vanity and narcissism are prime examples of this sin.

I have seen a few proud geocachers in my few years of caching..  Some care about the numbers so much that they will claim a find when they haven't completed the cache.  Some will e-mail the cache owner begging for extra hints or clues, rather than log a &quot;DNF&quot;.  Come on! There's no shame in DNFing!  Put your Pride aside and revel in your mediocrity!

Some of you will have seen this one before, but it lasted only a short time before it was broken. If you are wondering where the key is, it is inside the container, but it can be retrieved if you are patient.

Take note of the numbers you find in the cache as you will need them to locate the final.

It seems the key may become stuck inside the container. If you don't hear the tinkle, try giving it a rap near the centre to jar it loose again. You should be able to hear the logbook (inside a 35mm container) and the key rattling around in there.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Wrath (Latin, ira) is one of the Seven Deadly Sins.

Wrath (or anger or &quot;Rage&quot;) may be described as inordinate and uncontrolled feelings of hatred and anger. These feelings can manifest as vehement denial of the truth, both to others and in the form of self-denial, impatience with the procedure of law, and the desire to seek revenge outside of the workings of the justice system (such as engaging in vigilantism) and generally wishing to do evil or harm to others.

Whose wrath you ask?  Hmmmm depending on your point of view, It's either yours or mine.  If you placed a pine tree micro which unfairly discriminates against the colour-blind, or your clue on a cache ever said &quot;none available&quot;, &quot;nope&quot;, or &quot;you don't need one&quot;, then it's my wrath.  Hope you enjoy....BWAH HA HA HA HA.


To get the password at the Sign, look at the 4th row of print.
Take the following letters from the last word in that line. 1,5,9,11,12.  Now rearrage them into a word that fits the theme of the series

Take note of the number you find within the stage 3 cache, as you will need them to do the final of the series.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located on the grounds of the former Garden City Raceway which was in operation from 1964 - 1976 

 St. Catharines once had a keen interest in the showing and racing of fine looking horses. In fact, in 1887, the Queen's Plate, the premiere racing event in Canada, was held in St. Catharines on a track located near the present Thomas Street Sports Park.

It wasn't until 1964 that St. Catharines received one of the finest racing showplaces in Canada. The Garden City Raceway (opened in 1964) was built on a 400 acre tract of land in the heart of Canada's Wine country. It was a modern harness racing extravaganza with a glass enclosed, climate controlled grandstand. Horsemen of the time considered the race track's limestone-cushioned strip one of the fastest tracks, and each season during its operation it attracted North America's finest two and three-year-old trotting and pacing colts.

The Garden City Raceway closed its doors in 1976. I invite all who visit here to share any memories or stories that they may have of this racetrack in their log entries.




**** Please rehide all stages  just as you found them or better. As I have checked on this cache before and stages were left out in the open. Thanks everyone **** 

Have fun and I hope you all enjoy this one!

I Think this is the foundation for the original Grandstands of the raceway, I Originally wanted to hide the final here, but it was too close to another Cache, so I had to move it.

Stage one took a little bit of time to find. It was like finding a needle in a hay stack. The rest of the stages were fairly simple. Coords were dead on at all stages.

We took the hard way in to the final and the easy way out.

Great history behind this cache. 

TFTC and showing us around the area.

 This used to be the old section of York rd. before the road re-alignment took place to accommodate the service center and make the on/off ramps more efficient. 

If you like bird watching this area might interest you. Sometimes I stop by out here to watch the hawks that nest nearby and in the mornings there are sometimes wild turkey that mill about here in the clearing. Many times when I have been here I have spotted deer and the odd coyote. 

This once was a proposed site for the Niagara region ambulance dispatch center, but it got rejected, as it would have cost the city way to much money to bring in the services needed to accommodate the dispatch center. The city went ahead with looking into the site across the road from auto parts dealer as the home for the dispatch center and that too was squashed. In the end a nice new facility was built on Townline Rd. which is a shared crew quarters for the EMS and the Volunteer Fire Hall, located behind the a parcel delivery service building. 
The Dispatch cente is placed in the &quot;Niagara Corporate Business Centre&quot; also formerly ( Foster Wheeler ) building, which is located across the highway from this cache. 

Now this dead end road which once was the new #8 Hwy at one time;  is now just a quiet hang out for our city’s finest to do paperwork and enjoy some coffee and quiet time. 

Hope you enjoy this little quiet hang out spot, I really like the area where the cache is hidden, it really cool after an ice storm in the winter. 

Happy caching.

* p.s. Thanks to a fellow cacher / EMS employee for the correction re: new dispatch center *

 Beware of muggles

&quot;This park is named in recognition of the Lowrey family for their contribution to the village of St. Davids. 
David Jackson Lowrey, a United Empire Loyalist, brought his family to St. Davids in 1867. His foresight brought about the first commercial vineyards and peach orchards in the region. Future generations of Lowrey's established or operated the local canning factory, quarry and golf courses. The park is located on a parcel of the original Lowrey farm.&quot;

** Please be gentle with cache in the cold as it maybe become brittle. Thank-you ** 

 This is the final stage for my Travel Series, 

The cache is not located at posted co-ords but you will need to stop here to gain the the offset for the N and W co-ords for the final placement. While you are here I invite you to really take just a moment and appreciate the view here, it's one of my favorites.

If you stop and think of the many ways that we as humans travel about our globe and now into space, what could be possibly left to play with, ... .....
I got this idea a while back and I thought to myself hmm; I could do a short series about travel leading people back here to ponder the Idea of Time Travel! 

What a great place to hide such a massive invention if there were ever to be one, cause you would need a massive power source I would think, and the focus of the grounds here would act as kind of an Ironic cover. I Love this area and the grounds keeping staff do an excellent job every year with our great attraction. If you are ever in the area at the right time look into when tours are available of Sir Adam Beck Power Generation Station it is really interesting and worth the vist. 

In order to complete this cache you will need to first find 4 other caches in the &quot; Travel Series &quot;. Contained within these 4 caches there will be parts of the co-ords you will need to collect in order to get to the Final. 

OX21GNP  Travel Series - Take Flight
OX21GP8  Travel Series - Float your Boat
OX21GPP  Travel Series - Ride the Rails
OX21GPY  Travel Series - On or Off Raod

Once you have visited these caches you can make your way to the posted co-ords to obtain the offset. 

QUESTION 1
How many Kilometers does the Niagara Escarpment extend across Ontario from Niagara Falls to Manitoulin Island ?

Now take your answer and divide it by 1000 to give you your offset, now take that offset and Subtract it from the West co-ords that you have collected. This New W co-ord is where the Final is hidden.

QUESTION 2
How many Million years ago did a shallow tropical sea cover most of central North America ?

Now take your answer and divide it by 1000 to give you your offset, now take that offset and Add it to the North Co-ords that you have collected. This New N co-ord is where the Final is hidden.

This takes you to the end of this short little series, I hope you have enjoyed my first series attempt and some of the sights I have brought you to. 

** Please be gentle with cache in the cold as it maybe become brittle. Thank-you **

Hmmm ..... Time Travel huh ? 
Does it make you wonder ?

One of my favourite caches of all time was Canada Island by McKinley GCG9CZ Placed 7 years ago, I was sad to see it archived.  I enjoy spending time down here, Cross Country skiing in the winter, canoeing in the warmer months.  

I thought a few of the newer cachers might enjoy the challenge of a great local adventure. AKA old school caching.  I'm also sure some of the old timers wouldn't mind re-visiting an area they visited oh so long ago. It would be great to hear all about your adventure getting to the cache in your log write up.  

Now, as mentioned, this is a water access only, there is no legal way to access it from land. The surrounding lands are private property so please do not even try to come at this from the nearby shore.  (Besides its on an island, so your gonna get wet if you try)

You can park on the South Service Rd and carry your canoe, kayak or dinghy down to the waters edge at N43 10.749 W79 19.642 Please be sure to follow the rules for safe boating, life jackets all around, safety kits, spare paddles etc. If you are not an experienced paddler please be sure to hook up with someone who is before attempting this cache. 

The trip is a nice 1.5km paddle to the cache.  Round trip it took 1.5 hours for me to solo out to the island with a canoe at a very leisurely pace (with plenty of stops to watch the wildlife along the way.)

There appears that a group of herons have been living in this area for the past few years and they seemed very curious about my arrival making a number of fly-bys to check me out. I counted at least 6 of them on my trip.  Hopefully you will get to see them as well. The fish were jumping all over the pond while I was there so feel free to bring along your rod and reel if you are so inclined.

I've placed this Rubbermaid container much higher from the waterline than the original cache hoping it doesn't meet the same fate as its predecessor.

Please hide the container EXACTLY as you found it and make sure it is well covered by the sticks and leaves to conceal it, and please make sure the lid is on securely before re-hiding it.

 This is one of the caches in the travel series that must be completed in order to find the final for the series which is :

OX218VH
Travel Series -- Time ? 

We as man have been on the move since the dawn of our existence. We looked new settlements and food sources and as time wore on a thirst for exploration of new places grew,  we developed a  need for  a means of Travel. 

This cache is for the creation of roadways and infrastructure. Although  in the beginning it may have been nothing more than a trail through the lands much like the Bruce,  but in time we developed  roads which started out primitive like this one, but eventually grew into the basis for the most widely used form of  Travel that we all use today.

There is partial co-ords written on the logbook as well as the lid of the container ... don't forget to write these down as you will need them to find the final in the series .

You will also need to visit these caches to get te final :

OX21GPP Travel Series -- Ride the Rails 

OX21GP8  Travel Series -- Float Your Boat

 This cache is hidden on a muddy side road that used to be very good for riding and 4 wheeling, but it just recently got a good grooming from what it used to be. 

In the area you will see decanting ponds from the old nearby fruit processing and packing plant, and depending on what end you come in at you can take notice at the big aggregate opperation going on, they are removing the red clay to make house bricks. There is 100,000 tons of clay removed each season from this site and the plans here are for removal of such clay for the next 60 yrs which in the end the site will be turned into a nature reserve. 

Hope you have fun grabbing this cache, why not give it a shot after a good day or so of rain to make it a little bit of a challenge.</groundspeak:long_description>

 This is one of the caches in the travel series that must be completed in order to find the final for the series which is : 

GC218VH
 Travel Series -- Time ?

We as man have been on the move since the dawn of our existence. We looked new settlements and food sources and as time wore on a thirst for exploration of new places grew, we developed a need for a means of Travel.

Probably the earliest form of travel would have to be floating a boat on water. This ideal would have opened the doors for us to travel in search of new lands, source of food, and started the beginings of trade and commerce between other communities and nations. Boats have come a long way from their creation, today they can range anywhere from small pleasure craft to trade and cargo, crusie liners to military use and massive ships that are like a floating city. Here along this trail you might get a chance to see some ships traveling through our great canal system which is the only gravity fed canal in the world dropping a considerable range in elevation from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario. 
The cache is a small camo taped jar hidden in traditional fashion.... should be an easy one. 
There is partial co-ords written on the logbook as well as the lid of the container ... don't forget to write these down as you will need them to find the final in the series .
 You will also need to visit these caches to get to the  final :

GC21GPY Travel Series -- On or Off Road

GC21GPP Travel Series -- Ride The Rail 

GC21GNP Travel Series -- Take Flight</groundspeak:long_description>

 This is a new placement for this cache as after getting permission from the airport management to place the original cache at the end of the airfield I still had problems with a local farmer. So now this cache has been moved to a less ideal spot for this series but you can still watch air traffic from here. 

This is one of the caches in the travel series that must be completed in order to find the final for the series which is :

OX218VH
Travel Series -- Time ? 

We as man have been on the move since the dawn of our existence. We looked new settlements and food sources and as time wore on a thirst for exploration of new places grew,  we developed a  need for  a means of Travel. 

Its funny how flight  was once  only a thought or a dream that surely would never happen, but look how we have evolved and how our means of travel into flight and aerospace has taken off. This development has given us the opportunity to explore every corner of our planet and beyond. 

There is partial co-ords written on the logbook as well as the lid of the container ... don't forget to write these down as you will need them to find the final in the series .
You will also need to visit these caches to get to the  final :

OX21GPP Travel Series -- Ride the Rails

OX21GP8 Travel Series -- Float Your Boat

OX21GPY  Travel Series -- On or Off Road</groundspeak:long_description>

opened on September 29 1996. &quot; Green as a Symbol of Hope &quot;. The
colour green speaks of plants and new life. We are rejuvenated when
we see new growth in spring and the colour green gives us a sense
the we can begin anew.&lt;br/&gt;

nope, and after a quick exchange of information we had a rough idea what we were looking for. we all had already poked at, or at least looked at the cache, but dismissed it. after more fruitless search i returned to the search and gave it a bit more effort - voila, there it was. turns out it just didn't open because it was somewhat stuck.

as already mentioned, the log was a total mess. we still managed to sign it, but not without ripping some parts of it. i recognize the attempt at making the container waterproof, but it obviously and unfortunately didn't work. it would be an awesome hide if it did.

Geobabe had a great time playing with a stick. Retrieved the cache, unrolled it a little bit to see that Fired Up was just here to sign the bottom of the log as first. Then I opened the log up all the way to see that the Newfies were here at 4:30 this morning. They signed both the front and back of the log as first to find. WOW, are you guys still on Atlantic time?

Sorry Fired Up, The Five Newfies beat you by two hours.

 Welcome to Lock 2 of Welland Canals Parkway and access to the Multi Use Trail. This is a great spot to relax and do some boat watching and listen to the birds and use the great trail system. This portion of the St. Catharines multi use trail is 8.2 km long well paved and is great for walking with pets, friends or family. Also good to use for in-line skates, cycling, skateboards, strollers, and even cross country skiing in the winter I guess… You get the idea, oh yeah and it has a nice view too!

Please use stealth and watch for muggles!
Please return just the way you found it.
Thank-you</groundspeak:long_description>

Had to make our way out in the dark and got a soaker as well but had a great time.  So excited to finally be the first to find a cache!!!  Re-hid a bit better but within a metre from coordinates.  Signed the log and left a toy frog.  THX!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This could be a very simple puzzle leading to a medium sized cache on a nice trail. 

 Sometimes throughout life there are people that just want to be noticed or just want to be heard. It could be that they may have problems and are not sure how to deal with them or they may think that no one is paying attention to them, or they may just want to express themselves in some way. Using color may be a tool that is used to accomplish such things. Color plays a great role in many cultures in the way that it brings joy or sadness to an art form, décor, or even it may be a defining symbol of a particular nation, society or group. Color also has a very large impact in nature, ranging from anything as a warning of apparent danger in the forms of bright colors on plants or even in living creatures, or darker colors may be way of disguise or blending in with a surrounding environment. Colors can even be used as a form of expression, and sometimes when there is a voice that is being heard the use of colors can speak volumes! 

Now at the cache site take a look at some of the use of color by these individuals and tell me in short your opinion whether this is a form of artistic expression or just a cry out of voices that are not being heard. What’s your interpretation?

The puzzle: Find the common value of each group and input that value into the formula below: 

AA:
Ivory Tower
Almond Paste
Soft Suede
Earthy Cane
Rattan
Wool Tweed
Twig Basket 

BBB:
Clear Yellow
Bright Laughter
Pineapple Delight
Canary Yellow
Golden Yarrow
Grass Daisy
Pollination

CC:
Whitewater
Delicate Petal
White Clover
Green Crystal
Mesa Verde
Chives
Shady Knoll

DDD:
Filigree
Sentimental Lady
Heavenly Blue
Walden Pond
Stormy Ridge 
Animation
Star Spangled 

Input your answers into the following co-ords  problem. 

N 43° AA-300.BBB
W 079° CC-400.DDD

The puzzle is not difficult and the math is very simple, just use common sense to get the answer in the usual format.

Hey Akela... the brakes on my car are touchy. No need to stop so quickly. I will let you know when the whiplash goes away and we can go caching again. :D

Thanks for the quick find, once I actually looked at my GPS. Co-ords are great on this one.

Yup we managed to find this with out too much trouble.  I did check the hint to see if it was of any help, all I can say is ya it helps, just that there is at least 1,000+ place that match it.

It is a symbol of democracy and the preferred shape for an&lt;br/&gt;assembly of equals; the council circle, the campfire circle, and&lt;br/&gt;King Arthur's round table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The circle is divine. The halo, the rainbow, the ring as a symbol&lt;br/&gt;of unity. Magic rings appear in Roman and Egyptian history.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A quick visit to the final resting place of Colonel John
Butler.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 




&lt;p&gt;Colonel John Butler was the leader of Butler's
Rangers which were the early descendants of what is now the Lincoln
and Welland Regiment. Butler's Rangers were formed in 1777 after
John Butler led a strong detachment of Indians from Niagara at the
Battle of Oriskany in August of 1777. One of their goals was to aid
and rescue Loyalists trapped as a result of the American
Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butler's Rangers were renowned for the guerrilla
warfare tactics used against the Patriot forces of the United
States. These tactics which did not conform to the &quot;Rules of War&quot;
made the Rangers a very feared and much hated force during the
American Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rangers were based out of Fort Niagara but
as the size of the Rangers ranks swelled Butler requested and
negotiated for the lands across the Niagara River for housing and
training his Rangers. Butler's Barracks are named to honour the
memory of Colonel Butler and served for many years as the training
and assembly ground. The current location of Butlers Barracks is
not the original location where Colonel Butler originally built the
barracks. The original location was on the high ground of what is
now Melville Street&lt;/p&gt;

 


&lt;p&gt;When the Ranger's were disbanded in 1784 Butler
returned to farming in the Niagara Peninsula. In his civilian life
he was still very much active in the local affairs as well as
continuing to serve with the Indian Department right up until his
death. A great deal of frustration on Butler's part grew from the
fact that he was never asked to participate in a larger political
role in the formation of Canada. Butler died in Niagara on 12 May
1796 after a lengthy illness and was interred here. While many
think that this is a military burial ground it is in fact the
Butler family plot. The front of the crypt has been backfilled in
after the door to the crypt was damaged and fears that animals may
drag the bones away from their rightful resting place. All that is
visible today is the top concrete work of the crypt as shown below.
Please be respectful as this is not only a place of internment but
is surrounded by residential homes. Daytime caching only
please.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This should be an interesting walk. It starts with a skimpy,
possibly muddy and slippery trail at the given waypoint, heading
down towards the lake, and then continues as a walk along the shore
towards GZ. You are likely to get your feet or at least your shoes
wet, &lt;b&gt;so bring waterproof shoes or, better yet, boots&lt;/b&gt;, you
will need them! In summer, you can use water shoes and shorts,
which will make for a nice refreshing walk. There's also a few
obstacles on the way that you will need to climb over (or
under).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do not try to approach this in straight line from the
cemetery&lt;/b&gt;, you're likely to break your neck. Use the provided
trailhead waypoint instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cemetery is open daily between 8:00 and 21:00. &lt;b&gt;You're
trespassing if you go after 21:00. Absolutely no dogs allowed
within the cemetery!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative access via boat is also possible if that's your
thing, but finding an appropriate launch point is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a camo'd Lock 'n' Lock containing the geocache
essentials and originally some small swag, some pathtags to take
and a TB to move along. &lt;b&gt;Please make sure the cache is secured
properly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF gets bragging rights and is welcome to take one of the
pathtags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and have fun! Oh, and &lt;b&gt;BYOP&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This multi requires certain high-tech gadgets in order to
complete and will present you with some riddles that you need to
solve to find the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read the complete description before attempting this
cache!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;b&gt;three intermediate stages&lt;/b&gt; to this multi, plus
the final cache. The coordinates to the three stages are given
below (in the additional waypoints). You can visit them in any
order you want, but if you park at the suggested coordinates and
start from there, it's suggested that you visit them in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three intermediate stages are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of them is a &lt;u&gt;Chirp&lt;/u&gt;, a type of wireless beacon that
requires a compatible device to receive. Currently only certain
models of GPS receivers from a particular manufacturer are capable
of doing that.&lt;br/&gt;
This stage will present you with a riddle. Solving this riddle gets
you a number. Call this number A.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another one of the stages is a &lt;u&gt;QR code&lt;/u&gt;. The easiest way
to decode it is to use a smartphone with an appropriate software,
but alternatively you can use any camera to take a picture of it
and then use an online decode (at home) to get the information out
of it.&lt;br/&gt;
Decoding the QR code gets you another riddle, and solving this
riddle gets you another number. Call this number B.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet another one of the stages requires &lt;u&gt;UV light&lt;/u&gt; to be
made readable. Note that it may be difficult to achieve this in
bright sunlight. You should be either prepared to cover up the clue
(make it dark) so the UV light can do its thing, or simply go at
night.&lt;br/&gt;
There's no riddle here, but again you will get a number from this
stage. Call this number C.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here's two important notes about the above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The stages described above are not given in the same order
as you will encounter them!&lt;/b&gt; Keep this in mind when you start
looking for one, or after you've found one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;!!! Beware of decoys !!!&lt;/b&gt; You &lt;b&gt;will&lt;/b&gt; come across
them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've found all stages and solved the riddles, you can do
a quick checksum. The combined &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root&quot;&gt;digital root&lt;/a&gt; of the
three numbers should be 2. If you get anything else (even if it's
only slightly different, like 1), you better revisit the stages and
double-check everything you've found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In any case, please make sure you replace all the stages
exactly as you've found them, and secure them properly into
place.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of simple math is required to calculate the coordinates of
the final cache. For the north coordinate, perform the following
calculation:&lt;br/&gt;
X = 18783 + A + B&lt;br/&gt;
Divide X by 1,000 and you got the minutes of your north
coordinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the west coordinate, calculate this:&lt;br/&gt;
Y = 47112 - A + C&lt;br/&gt;
Again, divide Y by 1,000 and you got the west coordinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're unsure, can't find it and/or are mobile internet
enabled, you can check your final coordinates here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=9f62f3f8347bc276540dc0ea65ab8552&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=4743324e304e4b&amp;amp;name=596f752063616e2774204d616347797665722074686973206f6e6521&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good luck and have fun!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note that the high difficulty rating is not only because of
the required gadgets and the riddles. The hides themselves can also
pose a challenge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There's an unactivated micro geocoin in the cache as FTF
prize!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN2N0NK - Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PK2N0NK - Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 18.449 W 079° 47.999&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S12N0NK - Stage 1&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 18.480 W 079° 47.980&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S22N0NK - Stage 2&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 18.683 W 079° 48.027&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S32N0NK - Stage 3&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 18.867 W 079° 48.043   </groundspeak:long_description>

Started this one yesterday with stinger503... got to stage 1, figured out the riddle no problem. Got to stage 2, got the riddle, but didn't know what to do with it. Got to stage three and couldn't get my technology to work, so had to use my lifeline (blackberry) until I found someone who did have the technology needed to get the riddle. Eventually we had all of the pieces we needed, but didn`t have the time (or, frankly, the energy) to grab the final. 

SO, we left it for our cache a day today. We teamed up with Joe.Small and Deadly Rose, and explained the puzzles to them... then they explained how some of the technology worked to me. Plugged in the final coords and off we went. 

For a terrain 2, this one was tougher than I had expected... went to find the final wearing work clothes... I should know by now (1300+ caches into this addiction) that this usually doesn`t end well. Sure enough, I slipped on some of the rocks. Oh well, guess they can be caching pants now. :)

This puzzle definitely deserves a favourite point - the creativity, use of technology and sheer effort put into it, not to mention the spectacular view, made this one very worthwhile.

Thank you so much for putting this one together. You`re very right, you`d have one heck of a time trying to McGyver it... :D</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Read, understand and follow these instructions to find the
cache:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the given coordinates. There's nothing hidden there, so
don't waste your time searching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait until 3:30 a.m. (that's right, 3:30 at night).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At precisely this time, a message will start appearing in the
distance. It is over 100 meters away and quite small, so you need
keen eyes. Bad weather, especially fog, will make this very
difficult to impossible. Extra challenge during christmas
season!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you've spotted the origin, you can come a bit closer to
get a better look. Don't jump any fences though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decode the message to get the coordinates for the actual
cache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The message will get repeated for 60 minutes, which gives it
time for about 22 repetitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The checksum of all the digits of the coordinates is 52 and the
location is about 1.6 km away (straight line). Proper parking and
trailhead will be included in the message, and you will want to
drive there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cache is just slightly off the trail, so there's no need to
bushwhack. &lt;b&gt;Please make sure you rehide and cover up the cache
properly after you're done, so muggles don't accidentally discover
it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of this cache and the description should give you a
clue on what kind of message to expect. You'll want to brush up on
your skills before heading out. &lt;b&gt;Please don't leave any spoilers
in your logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case your skills aren't up to par, having one or more of the
following items with you may save you from having to make the
night-time trip a second time (no guarantees though):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pen and paper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A smartphone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A caching buddy (much recommended in any case)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video camera or audio recorder (the latter will work, but using
it should be very interesting)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There's a few loonies and AA batteries for FTF and STF
prize!&lt;/b&gt; Choose whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good luck and have fun!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We were introduced to this area while doing the Bruce Almighty series of caches and have returned several times to enjoy the area.

 All stages are colored tags with the next stage's coordinates. There are 8 tags(stages) as well as the final, which might seem like a lot but they should be quick finds. After all, we could have placed 40 of them! At each stage there are two tags with the next coordinates. At most of the stages there will be one tag clearly visible and one that is well hidden. If the easy-to-find tag gets muggled, just look a little harder to find the other tag. 

 The cache is quite large and will accommodate large trading items and TB's. Please replace the final as found, or re-hide it better to keep it well hidden for the next cacher. 

Parking is available on the shoulder of Guelph Line near the Bruce Trail trailhead at N43 23.300 W79 51.243.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Park your car at one of the given parking waypoints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the given trail head (see waypoint &lt;b&gt;THEAD&lt;/b&gt; below).
This is just off Mainway, a relatively busy road with no roadside
parking. You'll have to walk along the road for at least a
bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your way towards the posted header coordinates. There's a
skimpy beaten path going there from the trail head and &lt;b&gt;WHITE&lt;/b&gt;
firetacks have been placed along this trail to help guide your way.
The firetacks are spaced quite far apart, so don't rely on them
alone to get to your destination!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you get to the coordinates, you have entered the Sheldon
Creek Woodlot, which extends roughly to the northeast from here.
The trail of white firetacks ends here, and generally all trails
end here. There's no trails running inside the woodlot at all,
you'll need to bushwhack your way around, which may be easy or
difficult depending on the time of year. There's also some pieces
of leftover wire fence on the ground, so be careful where you
step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somewhere in this woodlot (which is a nicely big and open area
that's surrounded by farmers' fields on all sides), there are two
trees that are marked with &lt;b&gt;WHITE&lt;/b&gt; firetacks. Your mission is
to find those two trees. They have plenty of firetacks on all sides
of them, which makes them relatively easy to see and
recognize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the posted header coordinates, there are &lt;b&gt;ORANGE&lt;/b&gt;
firetacks to help you find your way to those two marked trees. The
orange firetacks have been placed about 30-50+ meters apart, which
again means that you can't rely on them alone to find your way.
They're merely a rough guide to aid you in your quest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you find a tree that has been marked with &lt;b&gt;TWO orange&lt;/b&gt;
firetacks, you'll know that you're close to one of your
targets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you find one of your target trees (the ones with the
&lt;b&gt;WHITE&lt;/b&gt; firetacks on them), use your GPS to mark a waypoint at
this location (at the tree). You will want to use any &quot;averaging&quot;
feature of your GPS to get a waypoint that's as accurate as
possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue following the orange firetacks until your find the
second marked tree. Again mark a waypoint here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now you have two waypoints (the two marked trees). Together
with the two given reference points (see additional waypoints
below, waypoints AAAA and BBBB - there's nothing there, don't go
there) you have four waypoints total.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using those four waypoints: &lt;b&gt;X marks the spot!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get it? There's several ways of doing this, and it's up to you
to figure out how. Some involve mathematics, others involve
technology. With any half decent handheld GPS device, all you
should need is your GPS (and some braincells). It's highly
recommended that you find a usable method that you can use in the
field &lt;b&gt;before&lt;/b&gt; you head out and attempt this cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a night time only cache!&lt;/b&gt; You will have to use
your flashlight to locate the firetracks mentioned above. Firetacks
are thumbtacks with reflective tape on them. They become visible by
shining your flashlight onto them and will then light up quite
brightly. Since they reflect the light back the same way that it
came from, you will see them best if you hold your flashlight as
close to your eyes as possible. Headlamps are recommended.
Obviously it needs to be dark for this to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a small Lock &amp; Lock container, painted brown.
There's an unactivated geocoin as FTF prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just love driving around in the country. There's less traffic,
fewer stop lights, nicer scenery and cleaner air than in the city.
Sometimes it's about finding a great spot. Other times it's more
about getting there than the destination. That's what this series
is about, an excuse to get away from the hustle and bustle of the
city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of my favourite driving roads. This one has lots of
twists and turns as it goes through the valley. The stream nearby
hops back and forth from one side of the road to the other. Just
north of the cache is a scenic spot where it crosses under the
road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch out for traffic as the road is busy at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK28NN2 - Northbound Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 25.067 W 079° 55.775&lt;br/&gt;Safe place to pull off.</groundspeak:long_description>

William Parkway. GZ is right at the edge of a drop-off so keep an
eye on the kids as you approach the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1827, Colonel William Chisholm purchased 960 acres of land
from the Crown at the mouth of the Sixteen Mile Creek and planned
out the Town of Oakville and the harbour. The first brick building
on site was erected c.1835, and served as a storehouse and possibly
an early Custom House. Later in its' life the Custom House was
converted into the Chisholm family home know as Erchless Estate.
William developed the harbour and invested heavily in shipping and
shipbuilding. He spent his final years in the family estate, living
with his son, Robert Kerr. Despite his dreams and determination,
William declared bankruptcy in 1842, dying shortly after at the age
of 54. William is buried in Oakville St. Mary's Cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just love driving around in the country. There's less traffic,
fewer stop lights, nicer scenery and cleaner air than in the city.
Sometimes it's about finding a great spot. Other times it's more
about getting there than the destination. That's what this series
is about, an excuse to get away from the hustle and bustle of the
city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fun twisty spot on Britannia Road as briefly joins up
with Walkers Line because of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Crystals are minerals that have had the chance to grow in the shape that they were meant to be. Just like your DNA determines the colour of your eyes, how tall you will get to be and the shape of your bones, the chemicals that a mineral is made of determines what shape it gets to be. We can tell different minerals apart by what crystal shape they are.

Sometimes minerals form in spaces where there is not a lot of room, so they don't have a crystal shape. When there is just a big hunk of a mineral, it is called a massive mineral. If there is a definite shape with easy to see flat sides, it is called a mineral crystal.

Most of the earth's crystals were formed millions of years ago. Crystals form when the liquid rock from inside the earth cool and harden. Sometimes crystals form when liquids underground find their way into cracks and slowly deposit minerals. Most mineral crystals take thousands of years to &quot;grow&quot; but some like salt (halite) can form so quickly that you can watch them grow at home!

Grow your own crystals.
If you want to have some fun, as an optional task, why not try to grow your own crystals. There are many web sites that you can read on the internet on how to do this. We have been successfully growing a crystal for 2 months now and it continues to form and grow every week where we can see the changes.

Cache is a small lock and lock container amoung the rocks.</groundspeak:long_description>

The 1877 Historical Atlas of Halton shows the land owned&lt;br/&gt;by the Campbells at that time. This may account for the joint&lt;br/&gt;cemetery name. Often early settlers would set aside a corner of&lt;br/&gt;their farm for a cemetery. A small frame Wesleyan Methodist Church&lt;br/&gt;was also located on this lot. It may have been first known as&lt;br/&gt;Cline's, but later referred to as Davidson's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Little&lt;br/&gt;online History can be found here (Thanks Rockharder for picking&lt;br/&gt;up my slack)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watch your step, there's not much room here.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just love driving around in the country. There's less traffic,
fewer stop lights, nicer scenery and cleaner air than in the city.
Sometimes it's about finding a great spot. Other times it's more
about getting there than the destination. That's what this series
is about, an excuse to get away from the hustle and bustle of the
city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorite driving roads. I usually start from
the south and then do a left onto Sideroad 3 for more nice scenery.
I've been wanting to start this series for a while and when I drove
by this spot I just had to put the first one here.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
There is an admission fee to get into the conservation area.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Crawford Lake is a meromictic lake located in Crawford Lake
Conservation Area. Go back in time as you enjoy an educational
stroll along the boardwalk that encircles this rare lake. As an
added bonus, be sure to check out Mr. Twister and how it’s
formed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Crawford Lake is small but deep with limited circulation and little
oxygen below 15 meters. Most living things cannot exist in the
bottom 9.4 meters of the lake and so the sediment lies unchanged in
its depths. A meromictic lake is one which lacks complete
circulation. In meromictic lakes the deepest water contains no
dissolved oxygen. Sediments are relatively undisturbed and
therefore offer a detailed record of the history of the lake.
Normally lakes in the temperate zone mix completely during the
spring and autumn when water temperatures are approximately the
same from top to bottom. In meromictic lakes there are no periods
of overturn or complete mixing because seasonal changes in the
thermal gradient are either small or overridden by the stability of
a chemical gradient, or the deeper waters are physically
inaccessible to the mixing energy of the wind. Most commonly, the
vertical stratification is stabilized by a chemical gradient in
meromictic lakes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The upper stratum of water in a meromictic lake is mixed by the
wind and is called the mixolimnion. The bottom, denser stratum,
which does not mix with the water above, is referred to as the
monimolimnion. The transition layer between these strata is called
the chemocline. Of the hundreds of thousands of lakes on the Earth,
only about 120 are known to be meromictic.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;In order to log a find on this cache, you will need to walk
along the boardwalk that surrounds this lake. Based on the
information given and using your own GPS to obtain measurements of
the lake, approximately how many litres or gallons of water are in
the bottom 9.4m of this meromictic lake. Additionally, based on
what was once in this area, what kind of things can one expect to
find in the lake sediment?&lt;br/&gt;
As a bonus, how was Mr. Twister formed?&lt;/strong&gt; 

You may post your answers in your log and compare it those the results that others have found and posted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Permission has been granted for the placement of this cache by Conservation Halton. Conservation Halton does not permit physical caches here due to the environmentally sensitive area. </groundspeak:long_description>

After running around Rattlesanke for the day we were too tired to make the trek to this one. Glad That I finally got around to doing it with the end to end crew. This place is great. Wandered around, did some math and discussed what would still be at the bottom of the lake which brought up some interesting items in the conversation including Jimmy Hoffa. Thanks for showing me this place. </groundspeak:text>

we figured we should take advantage of the beautiful weather and make the descent somewhat safer due to dry ground and warm weather
while dfx was searching and searching i kept looking at the gps and recalling from memory the picture from avernar's trip i was 99.99% certain we have the right cave
when search proved fruitless dfx came up and we got a chance to look at the picture and confirmed that was indeed the entrance to GZ
off he went back down but no luck again so he returned
i was determined that we will not leave here with a DNF
after observing him descend twice i knew its not too hard to get down 
we have established before where the location of the spoiler picture is but still meticulously checked every possible hiding spot as i descended 
meanwhile dfx got a revelation about the hint so i went to that spot
checked all around and few minutes later something caught my eye and YEESSSSSSSSSS ...BINGO! [:D]
awesome place for this hide and the hint is very accurate

going down was easier than expected and while i was on the way, t4e read the hint out to me. ok, sounds easy enough, and i started looking around. and i was looking and looking and looking... nothing. after having exhausted all options, i decided to get back out and give the phone another chance to load those pictures.

more luck with that this time and soon we were looking at the spoiler picture and the pics posted by the penguin. by comparing those with what we could see around us we could confirm that it was indeed the right cave. i went back down a second time, this time with the phone in hand, with the spoiler image loaded, and with that i could determine the approximate location where the cache should be. i had looked there before, but went and looked again, even more closely. still nothing! argh!

defeat. i got back out to make room for t4e's attempt. while she was heading down, i started reading the description and hint myself. that's when i figured out my mistake, i misinterpreted the hint (damn that punctuation) and had been looking for the wrong thing all along! t4e and me exchanged some thoughts and new ideas (she was still down there) and it was only a few minutes later that she made the find. yey!

good one, and i can see where all those DNFs come from [:D]

Section of the Bruce Trail duing GCZZZ0. This is just down the
trail from the exact point the Toronto Club starts (at the Fence).
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There was a large group of us that started our hike from here,
intending to finish the entire Toronto Bruce Club in one day. Four
people made it: Psychocyclist, Res2100, Tomtec and Jeff-Trex. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Cache is a medium sized lock-n-lock container. Parking on Appleby
Line is not permitted - you should have someone drop you off, or
park at Kelso/Hilton Falls Conservation Areas and hike in. &lt;br/&gt;

Mills, and look at that hill over there. Yes, you have to climb
that thing! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Stop at this micro and ponder your decision to proceed. Few have
made it to the end in one day.... maybe you should just give
up!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 On the other hand, you'll miss all the fantastic views from the
Escarpment... you'll miss the Hole in the Wall, Lime Kilns and the
old Mill at Limehouse. You won't see the beautiful autumn scenery
at Terra Cotta. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You could drive to these spots, but parking's a pain, and you won't
get that end-to-end patch. You know you want it. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So what are you still doing here? Get a move on - daylight's a
wasting - or did you give up and go home?&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Geocache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an
easy multi stage cache that was placed as a demo cache within Kelso
Conservation Area for Conservation Halton’s
&lt;b&gt;Fall Into Nature&lt;/b&gt; event. It will
take you to 3 locations by the Halton Regional Museum and then to a
final cache located closeby. Cache is a medium sized lock and lock
container. You will collect the information from the plaques at the
locations indicated below and plug them into the following
coordinates in order to find the final location of this
geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geocache is
located at &lt;b&gt;N43 30.2A1 W79
56.7CB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the
Blacksmith Shop (&lt;b&gt;N43 30.337 W79
56.753&lt;/b&gt;) look on the associated plaque for the year that
Adam Alexander III was born (18A3). You are looking for the missing
number which we will call A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Stone
House (&lt;b&gt;N43 30.361 W79 56.730&lt;/b&gt;)
look on the associated plaque beside the front door. For how many
generations has Adam Alexander and his family owned and farmed the
land? This number we will call B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Log
House (&lt;b&gt;N43 30.359 W79 56.719&lt;/b&gt;)
look on the associated plaque. Approximately when was this log
house built (1C50)? You are looking for the missing number which we
will call C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fill in the
3 numbers that you acquired above into the following coordinates
and proceed to the cache:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;N43
30.2A1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;W79
56.7CB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

I've used this park and pool several times to meet up and carpool at the start of a cache run so I figured that it deserves a cache of its own.

The cache is located in the corner of the lot.  There is a small drainage ditch you&quot;ll have to hop over to get to it.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is a straight forward 2 stage multi located in the
beautiful Hilton Falls Conservation Area, which will allow you to
see some neat features that you may or may not know existed if it
wasn't for geocaching. It is about a 3km round trip hike. Cache is
a clear Lock-n-Lock container located near Hilton Falls within
Hilton Falls Conservation Area.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hilton Falls charges an admission fee. Alternatively you can
park a few kms north at one of the small parking lots on 6th Line
and follow the Bruce Trail side trail for a few kms to enter the
conservation area for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to eelow&amp;below for the container used for this
geocache which we received as the FTF prize from their evil shelter
cache at the OktoberCache event on October 6, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure most can figure out the reason for
this cache and why the various reasons for the title of it. If not,
I will be happy to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the first stage you will find a plaque
which contains two 5-digit numbers. Subtract the smallest 5-digit
number from the largest 5-digit number. Next divide the result by
1000 and add that to the following meaningless coordinates to find
the location of the geocache.&lt;br/&gt;
N43 28.640&lt;br/&gt;
W79 56.654&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

Pencil and logbook with discovery note on back&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>[Stage 1] It's a plaque near a large hole in the ground. You really can't miss it. 
[Final] Located in a small horizontal tunnel\cave. Stick your head in and look down, since your body probably wouldn't fit. About half way up the mound and probably best to approach from below. Cache is just sitting there, not covered, but you won't see it unless you poke your head in.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Had the day off work today, and an itch to go visit my favourite hiking spot, Hilton Falls. Pulled into the conservation area and flashed my Bruce Trail membership to avoid the park fee. Seeing my GEOCACHING.COM banner on the windsheild, the gatekeeper took some time to talk about the activity to me. She told me that Halton Conservation just had a geocaching event at their annual picnic nearby and how she was interested in learning more about the game. I suggested a few caches within the park and area she should try and she knew about some of them already! 

I packed my camera gear and water for the hike. Along the way I encountered another amateur photographer and we exchanged stories about several photography techniques as we walked along the trail together. When we reached the Bruce Trail's blue blazed Hilton Falls side trail, I bid farewell to my new friends as we took different routes.

I've always loved the geological features and the waterfall the trail provides here. While standing at the pothole, I took the time to search with my eyes for signs of the older, larger version of 16 Mile Creek as it would have been 14,000 years ago. The signs of the glacial meltwater channel are obvious, if you look for them. At this point, I made my way over to the Falls themselves and set the tripod up in the river. I spent about a half hour standing barefoot here, and at a few other points in the river before deciding that my feet were getting cold and perhaps it was time to enjoy the view from the shore. Being a Friday in September I more or less had the place to myself so I had lots of time to explore and compose photos. When I made my way up to the top, I did notice the old wooden bridge to the Mill side of the river has been disassembled and a new sign asking people to protect the ruins has appeared. 

Finishing off my photos, it was time to finish the geocache so I put the camera away (then pulled it back out a couple times along the hike) before heading to the cache. A quick find (after the requisite check for big nasty spiders that frequent places like this) and I had the cache in hand. The cache was in excellent condition, and I signed my name and rehid it. I enjoyed my hike back to the car and headed over to Rattlesnake Point for another short hike. 

This cache is definitely best if enjoyed like a fine wine. Take your time to enjoy all the little things about the cache, the area and the history. You don't want to rush this one!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Been wanting to visit Hilton Falls again for some time, and this cache was a great excuse to do so. I rode a bike in from the 6th Line parking area, taking the Bent Rim bike trail part  of the way. I got a little dirty looking for the final, but found it fairly easy. This was the only the second cache today so far that wasn't swarming with mosquitos, which made for a nice change while signing the log.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">If you're hiking the end-to-end of the Toronto Club of the Bruce
Trail, you'll find yourself tired and more than happy to stop for a
cache hunt here, as you've just climbed up the Escarpment. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The trail is typical Bruce Trail, rocky bumpy and definately not
wheelchair friendly. Bikes are NOT allowed on this section of the
trail, please hike in. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You can park at Hilton Falls conservation area if you're not thru
hiking the trail. The cache is very close to the trail and it's a
medium sized lock-n-lock (camouflaged). Please ensure the cache is
not visible when you rehide it. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Not winter friendly. &lt;br/&gt;

So we decided, why not go to Hilton Falls and find our 9th closest to home unfound cache. It's about time that we go find this one. Made our way over to it from Hilton Falls, which was quite the hike. Then afterwards we headed towards the Hilton Falls viewing area, but first we made a stop at the other falls which were just as spectacular at the top end of the reservoir. Took lots of pictures and then took even more at Hilton Falls. The water sure was moving stongly today over the falls. last time we were here in the fall, there wasn't even a drop. Had a great time here today. Oh, took about 5 minutes of searching before spotting the cache.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just love driving around in the country. There's less traffic,
fewer stop lights, nicer scenery and cleaner air than in the city.
Sometimes it's about finding a great spot. Other times it's more
about getting there than the destination. That's what this series
is about, an excuse to get away from the hustle and bustle of the
city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes take 6th line instead of Trafalgar when I tired of
just going in a straight line. The road does a neat S turn here as
it crosses the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK28NN5 - Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 30.956 W 079° 46.711&lt;br/&gt;Room for one or two cars</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A walk through two wooded areas in Tom Chater Memorial Park.

The first cache I found was in this park so I was sad to see it archived.  Since I live so close I just had to put in a cache of my own here.  This time however it's a two stage multi.

To get to the first stage you can either take the direct route through the woods right from the parking or you can go around a bit and enter closer to the cache.

The final is located a short distance from the paved trail that snakes through the other wooded area in the park.  Watch out for muggles walking by when finding this one.

There is room for geocoins and small trading items.  Please don't damage the cache container trying to stuff something too big into it.

FTF prize is a $5 tim card.

Park closes at 11PM.


Parking available at  N 43° 31.674 W 079° 41.900

the final luckily didn't take as long. the hiding spot is pretty much disintegrating, the cache is still in good shape though. tftc.</groundspeak:text>

Stage 1 caused us some problems even though we were searching in the right area...Found the container...ooops...no...that one wasn't it...but luckily found the right container in the next spot I searched along with a number of potato bugs that were crawling around the container. At one point as we were searching my GPS said we were 950m away from stage 1 even though we were realy only a couple meters away.

On to the final. I searched a number of spots and then my wife Ellesche finds it nicely tucked away in a spot I guess I missed. Cache was stuck in place but managed to get it out with some wiggling. Left a TB and a nice geocoin. 

Enjoyed this multi.</groundspeak:text>

A muggle came over and asked if we were geocaching during the hunt. Looks like the locals know all about our hobby here.

Both stages hid better than found - as per the owner  [}:)]

 Cache is accessible from Highway 25 - head into the Carpool Lot
(follow the signs with the &quot;P&quot; inside a green circle).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Since you can park within a few metres of this cache, please do not
do something foolish like parking on the 401, or Highway 25. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache was placed here, where you can get a lovely view of
Milton's Licence Plate Factory. The other name this facility goes
by is the Maplehurst Jail. This facility is one of Ontario's
'megajails'. The Ontario government describes Maplehurst as : &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;Medium to maximum security correctional facility for adult
males 18 years of age and over sentenced to less than two years
incarceration and for those remanded in custody pending appearance
in court. A variety of programs and services are provided to
inmates that are not accessible to the general public. Programs and
services help inmates develop positive skills and attitudes for
successful adjustment in the community after release. Volunteers
help to deliver many programs, including literacy, life skills,
addictions, anger management, human relations, religious services
and spiritual care, Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous,
Aboriginal services and individual counselling.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I do note they don't specifically mention licence plates, but I'm
free to speculate on that one all I want :). Don't climb that fence
off to the South East. &lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is a short 3 stage multi along Main St in Milton placed in
honour of a similar one that was archived by another cacher. My
kids and I loved the old multi and thought the area needed it
replaced. You'll find this is an excellent bike ride or walk for
families with little kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Bushman002 who worked hard to try keeping the old
cache alive despite being abandoned by the old owner. Anyone who
found the older caches will notice some similarities and also some
changes. This isn't intended to be difficult so if you run into any
problems, don't hesitate to msg me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 1: Micro in a neighborhood park containing the coords to
stage 2. You'll often find kids playing basketball at the nearby
court so stealth may be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 2: Micro along a storm pond containing coords to the
final. This will bring you close to another cache to pick up if you
haven't already logged it. There's a small playground nearby for
the kids to stop for a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 3: Small size cache along a storm pond. I've tried to
stock it with swag for the kids to trade with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

This one proved a little problematic as the insects had made homes in some of the reflectors.  Bakers Dozen persevered and got us to the correct spot.  A straight forward find from there.

Thanks for the fun night cache. </groundspeak:text>

Heard alot of deer smashing out of this area as I made my way to the circle.

Took nothing and left nothing.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tachyonic Antitelephone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tachyonic antitelephone is a hypothetical device
in theoretical physics that could
be used to send signals into one's
own past. Such a device was first contemplated
by R. C. Tolmanin 1917[1] in
a demonstration of how faster-than-light signals can lead to
a paradox of
causality (a.k.a. Tolman's paradox).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The example of the antitelephone is a thought experiment intended to
demonstrate how any faster-than-light communications capability
could lead to causality violations. According to the current
understanding of physics, no such faster-than-light transfer of
information is actually possible. For instance, the
hypothetical tachyon particles which give the device
its name do not exist even theoretically in the standard model of
particle physics, due to tachyon condensation, and there is no
experimental evidence that suggests that they might exist. The
problem of detecting tachyons via causal contradictions is
considered in Ref.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;- Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posted co-ordinates are for the location of the BFL Command
Centre on October 30, 2010. There is no geocache to be found there,
but on the event night you will encounter geocachers there.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There are two ways you can visit this geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Option One: Visit the final cache before any of the required
stages, by simply remembering to send the information into your own
past when you visit the stages in the future. You should remember
to visit the stages eventually, or you may end up causing a paradox
and end life as we know it in this temporal plane, or worse, you
may disrupt the Temporal Prime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Option Two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 
BFL Boot Camp V - Devilluminati event on October 30,2010 this
cache and 9 other caches were placed. You can choose one (or both)
of the two lists of 5 geocaches to visit and obtain the codes for
the final. One you have the codes, complete the math puzzle shown,
and you will have the co-ordinates of the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there are 9 caches, one of the caches is listed in both
tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

I only needed to find one more from the alpha track to get my final code before I could locate this one. Once I put together all the pieces I thought the coords were wrong but they were at least worth a shot. There were other caches down this trail so I figured my odds were a little higher. About 15m away from GZ we heard a pack of coyotes off in the distance. This was a sence of accomplishment and I cannot wait for BFL VI.

The rest of the CREW headed to the Alien cache, while alli-oop and I were tired, and headed to this final. After a short hike, we arrived at GZ to find about 10 people searching. We joined the hunt, and eventually, after about 20 minuted the caches was found about 30 m from the co-ords. Later, at the BFL Command Centre we found out why it was off.  Thanks for all the effort that was put into the BFL event and caches.

The final here was very straight forward although we kept expecting there to be some twists or turns along the way. Thanks for a fun series of caches. Glad we stayed as a small group today instead of doing the caches in larger groups like previous years. Our smaller group definitely enhanced our overall experience with most of the caches tonight. Looking forward to next year.</groundspeak:text>

They played in the park with mom, while I found Stage 1 and Stage 2. They were very hard to find, as I didn't know what I was looking for.  Needed your clues to find them.  They were very small and camouflaged!!  Family joined me for Stage 3.Stage 1 - Real Head Scratcher. Almost gave up!Stage 2 - Cleverly concealed. Almost gave up!Stage 3 - Camouflaged. Easy. Yay!!!Kids loved finding the treasure!!! We left some new items.

Please explain the codes on Stage 2 and Final in your description.  See below:

It was an enjoyable multi and almost stroller friendly as there was still a little bit of snow left on the trails. We only had the small umbrella stroller with us today so it was fairly easy to lift baby TK over the snowy patches. Stage 2 was the only one we needed the hint for and I actually missed spotting it the first time I looked in that spot. Walked the loop and took the sidewalk back to the car.</groundspeak:text>

complete &quot;Blind Man's Bluff&quot; follow the trail from the posted
coordinates, approximately 100m to where the trail turns right as
indicated by the blue blazes. At this point turn to your left, and
follow the white reflectors as you would in any traditional
nightcache. You'll find the first stage when you see three white
reflectors. The first stage is a lock 'n lock with instruction
sheets which you'll need to complete a task at stage 2. Completion
of that stage leads to the final cache.


 Please
only take one sheet per person or group 


**** Parking is limited at
the trailhead, with only room for a couple of cars just south of
the driveway to get safely off the road. DO NOT block the driveway as it is
private property. There is lots of parking 850m south of the
trailhead on the Sixth Line for those who don't mind the walk.
Carpooling with other cachers from the parking to the south is also
a great idea as well.

A lot of thought and planning went into it.My favorite cache of the BFL series this year.We were managing to solve all of the clues as a group effort. After getting all of the clues together we had a heck of a time figuring out what to do with them. We did discuss what we could do to Goju with a white cane but that's another story and not printable here. Finally figured out the cords and off to the frinal. TTC</groundspeak:text>

At stage 2 we started the decoding and the figuring and the searching and so on. Checking once, twice, thrice and maybe more and me saying several times, stop telling me that it's a letter R. In the end we had what was needed and a few thoughts on what could be done and then it made sense and we had what seemed like plausable coords and sure enough it led us and the others who showed up on to the cache. Excellent group effort on this one and again thanks for something really unique and appreciated that it actually made us think in order to figure out the coords for the final.</groundspeak:text>

Great job Team Goju!  This was a lot of fun to do.  We had some challenges when we tested as a result of using the provided conversion tool.  Once we sorted that out we were able to start our search.  What a camo job!  Those things are tricky to find.  After some searching, many hands make light work, we headed off to find the final.

the instructions to stage one seem a bit off as the &quot;left turn' is not quite a left but more of a &quot;turn around&quot;
once we got the instruction sheet at the posted coordinates we met what seemed to be half the attendees of the event
definitely a busy place, quite impossible to get to the &quot;translation&quot; so Bruce made good use of his iPhone and figured it out quite quickly
getting the coordinates was a different story with all the commotion and chatter going on, but we got it and off we went to the final, not absolutely sure we do actually have the right GZ
after quite a bit of bushwhacking, since we didn't seem to find the trail, we looked and looked and some more cachers showed up and soon after dfx spotted it and we were signing the log
IMO this deserves a higher difficult rating and perhaps terrain too, i can't honestly imagine doing this one in the summer with buzzers swarming around, nor in the winter at any bellow 0C temperatures

First, the said&lt;br/&gt;burying ground to be used for that purpose and nothing else, and&lt;br/&gt;second, that the above mentioned trustees shall not prevent or&lt;br/&gt;hinder directly or indirectly the building or erecting a house of&lt;br/&gt;worship of Almighty God, on the following limitation or conditions&lt;br/&gt;if built. First to be for the use of the Canadian Wesleyan&lt;br/&gt;Methodists and to be open for other denominations when not occupied&lt;br/&gt;by said Methodists, with free access to it at all times in and for&lt;br/&gt;the consideration, to be paid yearly when demanded of each of the&lt;br/&gt;trustees. In witness whereof I set my hand and seal this 26th day&lt;br/&gt;of September, 1835.&quot; Witnessed by Robert Cunningham and Alex&lt;br/&gt;Alderson and signed by Richard Bloomfield, Andrew Cunningham,&lt;br/&gt;William Forest and Allan McDougal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wooden church was built in 1836 serving as a Methodist Church&lt;br/&gt;until about 1876 when a new church was built at Hornby.

I read about the wasps this morning, but decided to try anyways. I saw the cache in it's hiding spot and removed it with a couple wasps hovering around below, but not bothering me. Signed us all in and put it back. Then made sure I gave the hiding spot a few good swift wacks before running...Looked over my shoulder as I ran, but they didn't follow so I stopped and watched the 2 wasps hovering around the middle. I guess I didn't annoy them enough. I am sure the wasps will be gone by winter.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you read the entire cache
description before you start so that you know what you will need to
do. This is a 3 stage multicache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Paranoia&lt;/b&gt; is an unfounded or exaggerated distrust of others,
sometimes reaching delusional proportions. Paranoid individuals
constantly suspect the motives of those around them, and believe
that certain individuals, or people in general, are &quot;out to get
them.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Stage 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Ever get that feeling of paranoia where you are constantly looking
over your shoulder, thinking that someone or something is watching
you? You will probably be feeling just that as you approach the
first stage of this geocache. Perhaps there is a mysterious
creature that inhabits the area, so be careful. Start at the given
trailhead and head towards the posted coordinates. Continue walking
along the trail from the posted coordinates, which is just an
arbitrary point along the trail. You will want to be constantly
looking over your left shoulder for a tree that has 3 orange
flagging markers hanging from it. This tree will be within 100m of
the posted coords, so if you have gone further than that, then you
have gone too far. Once you find this tree, within about 5m of it,
you will need to locate a set of 2 flat pieces of coloured wood
which are about 6cm long. These 2 pieces of wood are also hanging
from a tree. These pieces of wood have holes in them. Count how
many holes there are in each piece (hope you don't lose track while
counting) and subtract the smaller amount from the greater amount.
We will call this result X. I.e., if wood A has 150 holes and wood
B has 100 holes, then your answer for X would be 50. In order to
find the location of Stage 2 you will need to do the following
math:&lt;br/&gt;
North: Add X to 107, divide by 1000 and then add this result to the
posted North coords.&lt;br/&gt;
West: Add X to 225, divide by 1000 and then subtract this result
from the posted West coords.&lt;br/&gt;
Continue along the trails until you get to Stage 2. I strongly
suggest that you continue to look over your left shoulder as you
never know what you may find or discover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stage 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I hope you have your BFLs with you as they might come in handy
here. A change of underwear might also come in handy for some of
you. And above all, watch out for the creature that resides here. I
had the misfortune of encountering this rather large creature. I
have never seen such a creature before and I can't even begin to
say what kind of creature it was. When I encountered it, it made
it's move and I didn't bother to stick around. I can tell you that
it didn't seem to like the light of my flashlight. Maybe that is a
good thing and perhaps kept me safe. If you dare, enter the
creature's home and find one of the 2 entrances into it's basement.
Have a look in the far corners of the basement and hopefully you
will find the necessary information that you need in order to
continue on your adventure. Paranoid yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stage 3 (Final)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;You
have now reached your destination, hopefully everyone in your group
is still with you. The cache you seek is a large lock and lock
container hidden deep within a small cave. This is rumoured to be
the vacation home of the creature that you may have encountered in
the basement at Stage 2. I think I may have started that rumour.
The creature could easily fit in here, but you can't, so you'll
have to reach in for the cache container. However, it's not that
easy though. People who have come before you tried to trap the
creature in it's vacation home by placing 3 large boulders in front
of the cave opening. You and several of your friends will have to
use your muscle to move these boulders in order to retrieve the
cache. When you are done, make sure you put the cache and the
boulders back exactly as you found them. Now look around and smile,
you're on Candid Camera! Ok you can go back to your cars now. Don't
forget to wash your underwear when you get home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much to see in this area
if you take the time to look around and explore including the pond
that you will be walking past along with the old dam and even the
Speyside dish not too far away. Much of the land to the south
however has now been approved for the quarry expansion and you can
already see progress of this to the west. This of course does not
make the ghosts of Christmas past happy at all. And what about the
mysterious creature that I encountered while I was exploring the
area? What will happen to it? Is there more than just one creature
that lives here? What if there's more? What if some are bigger?
What are they and why did I discover one lurking in the darkness of
the basement? Maybe basement is not the right word. Perhaps more of
a dungeon or a deep prison. Either way one can not help by being a
bit paranoid down in there. I actually got the courage to enter
again to look for the creature. I wanted to take a picture of it,
but I did not have my camera with me, but I did have my PDA and
thought I would try and snap a photo and use the light of my
flashlight for assistance, but the creature disappeared and I did
not spot it again. It wouldn't have been a good picture anyways
with my PDA, but it would have been better than nothing and would
have been proof hopefully that a strange creature exists in the
area here. I hope you have read the entire cache page and if you
did then you know what I tell you now in order to find the final is
very important. At the second stage what you should do is count the
slightly angled beams that support the roof and count how many
square holes go down below the concrete floor. A person can easily
fit down through these square holes. For the north coordinates of
the final, multiply the number of beams by four and then subtract
the number of holes and then add the result to the last 2 digits of
the posted north coordinates. For the west coordinates of the
final, multiply the number of beams by eight and then add nine and
then divide this by one thousand and subtract that result from the
posted west coordinates. Remember the very first thing I told you
at the beginning of the cache description? If you did, then you
would be reading this right now before you even started out on this
cache and would hopefully not be sticking your head in or crawling
around in some basement, although the basement definitely is worth
exploring, especially if you are able to get a rare photo of this
never before photographed elusive creature. Anyways back to our
trusty adventures again who are lost somewhere in the woods on a
dark stormy night constantly looking over their shoulders to see
if  they are being stalked by an unknown creature or some
crazy guy with a camera. I hope they all make it out in one piece
and I look forward to hearing any encounters with this creature.
You know I will be back too to have a look for myself, but most
certainly not on my own anymore. Oh and there was the guy with the
helmet that was lurking around the edge of the forest that I
spotted as I wandered down a different trail. I was heading right
for him when I spotted him less than one hundred meters away. I saw
him, but I don't think he saw me. I turned around quickly and made
my way back to where I came from. I wonder what else is lurking in
the woods here.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

As I knew all about this cache, I was sworn to secrecy and instead let the crew complete this as I walked a bit behind the group. I loved the well thought out, creative storyline behind this cache. The cache saw quite the activity on event night, and played right into the storyline of the cache. 

Thanks res2100 for taking the time to place this, and I can't imagine how long it took you to come up with that detailed write up! Bravo! </groundspeak:text>

Had to make a stop on the way out to grab one of the CO's other newer caches in the area. Thanks for the hike  and I'll be adding waders to my caching bag for future Res caches, just in case.

She was taking lots of pictures and even had the time to hide a
geocache in this beautiful park. She left the following trail of
droppings to help you find your way to her geocache, as the
geocache is not at the posted coordinates.

&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Bouncy Bunny also wants you to bring your own writing instrument
with you, as this geocache only contains a logsheet. She also
reminds you to make sure the geocache is completely hidden when you
re-hide it. The real prize here is the location and the park that
it is in.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Captain John Callis&lt;/b&gt; often sold his prizes
and cargo in the villages of Laugharne and Carew. He commanded the
&lt;i&gt;Swallow&lt;/i&gt; during his pirate career which lasted for decades.
Later on he attempted to assist authorities in tracking down other
pirates in exchange for his release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This series consists of 7 caches. You will need to find the 6
treasure chests that have been hidden by these famous pirates and
collect the required information in order to find the secret
location of where Princess Theresa has taken refuge. Before
attempting any cache in this series, you should refer to
Pirates of Morovia - Princess Theresa (Final) for more
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each cache location you will find a treasure
chest. Engraved on the back of each treasure chest is a 3 digit
number which you should take note of. Also take note on whether the
treasure chest is open or closed. Do not remove the treasure chest
playing piece from the cache. For some added fun, when you log your
finds on this series, why not give your character a name and give
details of your character's journey throughout the area of Morovia
as you try to locate all of the chests that the 6 pirates have
hidden. The Princess likes stories and may have extra rewards
available for those that tell her the tales of their heroic
journeys. The Princess however does not understand pirate speak,
but she is very fluent in miffer speak, which is a common dialect
that is communicated among the people of Morovia.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Hint changed to suit new&lt;br/&gt;location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update: April 28th 2009 - removed parking waypoint. The new&lt;br/&gt;cache location is a hop, skip, and jump away from Sapling Trail so&lt;br/&gt;the parking spot off of Saratoga Way is kind of pointless. Sorry&lt;br/&gt;Buttons and Beaux!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update: Jan. 23rd 2010 - new parking waypoint right next to the&lt;br/&gt;cache. New logsheet.

Nassagaweya-Esquesing Town Line.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just love driving around in the country. There's less traffic,
fewer stop lights, nicer scenery and cleaner air than in the city.
Sometimes it's about finding a great spot. Other times it's more
about getting there than the destination. That's what this series
is about, an excuse to get away from the hustle and bustle of the
city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road here goes between a small pond and a scenic wetlands
area. Continue going south and you'll go through a nice forested
area and end up at a parking area for the Bruce Trail.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I have been told this is very hard. GOOD! You do need a good eye and it's to your right off the path!

Bring a PEN!!

For a reward, there are wild Raspberries @

This area is known for student hang-outs so be wary of muggles. Also, feel free to collect any trash in the area to keep this place clean.

cache. No climbing over anything required.

Halton's Scotch Block Reservoir was built in 1971. It provides flood control and low flow augmentation in the Sixteen Mile Creek watershed.  For a nice scenic view visit in late spring, summer or fall during daylight hours. The reservoir is home to ducks and Canada Geese. The geese tend to stick around during the winter months and can be heard honking even at night. 

There are no parking signs along that stretch of road. The two parking coordinates are where the signs end. It's a 200m walk from the north one and a 240m walk from the south one. The road goes down hill slightly from the south parking. 

Please put the cache back exactly where and how you found it. Bring your own pen or pencil. Do not use stickers as they make the log too thick.

Parked north of the cache right beside where ted went into the ditch. Enjoyed the walk to the cache and suprisingly found it right away although it certainly blended in nicely with it's surroundings. Took lots of pictures too and continued on down the road and enjoy the area...in total we did a 1.5km round trip hike from car to cache to further to cache to car...you get the point. 

Anyways, great hide with this one and this is the first time I have ever driven down this road past the Reservour in the past 12 years since I lived here.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The active caches in this series (more to follow)&lt;/i&gt; 

&lt;br/&gt;
If you are an amateur radio operator, each cache contains the
callsign and frequency of a repeater that can be heard from the
cache area, so you can chat with some of the local hams on your way
back to the car, or on your way to the next cache. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There is a code word and repeater call sign on the first page of
the log book. Save this information if you want to go for the final
later. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Park at N43 34.700, W 079 59.780 &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Follow the Vanderleck Bruce Side Trail until you get to N43 34.625,
W079 59.676, at which point the cache is on the left hand side of
the trail (if you approached from the parking co-ordinates). It is
within 35 metres of the trail, and within 200M of the parking
co-ordinates. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you continue down 17th sideroad to Highway 25, you will see the
repeater site for the Milton area. The repeater is at N43 35.410/
W79 59.184. This tower is tall and on a hill - repeaters like that
sort of thing, as it helps to extend their range. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This repeater is used for the Milton and Halton Hills Amateur Radio
Emergency Service. The ARES service is described on the Radio
Amateurs of Canada website: &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;ARES is composed of licensed radio amateurs who have
voluntarily registered their qualifications and equipment for
communications duty in the public service, when disaster
strikes.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Basically, they're the people that will be very handy to have
around when the Internet and the phone system fails. ARES members
will typically be sending messages to/from emergency shelters and
other emergency services (Police, Fire, Red Cross) or sending
health and welfare messages (read: &quot;I'm OK Mom!&quot; type messages).
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Once a year, ARES groups stage a simulated emergency to practice
their skills. Throughout the year, they help out at community
events like marathons, bike races and the Santa Claus parade. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the ‘final’ cache for the
BFL Boot Camp IV – The Hunt
Four L.E.D. October event&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you will need to visit the caches in
the BFL Boot Camp IV series, and obtain the codes from the
logbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 5 code numbers, scattered among 10
geocaches placed for the event. These caches will be activated on
Oct 4, after the event has passed.&lt;/p&gt;

To find the start for the final, add all five codes together then
divide by 5000.  This will give you a value, we will call
“F”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Take all the codes and reverse the digits for each code. Add these
numbers together then divide by 5000, which will give you a value,
we will call “G”&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add F to 27.4152.  This is your north
coordinate.&lt;br/&gt;
Add G to 52.4276.  This is your west coordinate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N43 and W79 are assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

proceed here to start the final journey to the L.E.D.

careful to follow the correct reflectors!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Reflector Trail starts with 2 white reflectors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Reflector Trail ends with 2 brown reflectors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you encounter an orange reflector, there may be more than
one way to proceed - but there's only one route to the cache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pair that's an Orange and a White reflector is a dead
end&lt;br/&gt;

The caches we did to get to this point were from CM, Ave, Goss, Dread and KOTH. Had no problems finding the first few reflectors and started following them. We hit several dead ends and some of them more than once. Back tracking I think was the hardest part for us and then trying to locate the reflectors again going backwards. Then after several orange ones, hopefully not all the same that we already found, we chose correctly finally and found our path to the final thankfully. I think we picked every path but one. It was a fun evening and I'll have to get out another time to do the remaining caches in this series as I am really looking forward to all of the creativity on them.

Was here with the CO one night and it took us forever to find a OK spot.  When we came back to place the reflectors I stumbled upon a GREAT spot just 10 meters from the old one.  Once I managed to get penguin to come over to it we quickly pulled the reflectors from the old spot and moved the final over here.  How did we miss this the first time around???</groundspeak:text>

fish. The large bell is actually called &quot;The Friendship Bell&quot;. A
lot of people come here for their wedding photos (the owners of
this cache included). Bring a camera and come early in the day for
the best photos. Be sure to spend some time wandering and enjoying
this place; it is very special to us. &lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;b&gt;This park closes at night and is monitored. No night caching
for this one.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

 You can reach this cache without stepping on any plants or
otherwise harming the garden. This is a rather busy place with
people milling about enjoying the view in the warmer months. Please
use discretion.&lt;br/&gt;

Acorns from the Royal Park at Windsor were sent to schools within
the commonwealth in 1937 to celebrate the coronation of King George
and Queen Elizabeth - and the former Dublin School, just south of
Acton, received one.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The students there planted the acorn, and when that school closed
and Speyside School was opened in 1960, the tree was transplanted
to its current location with a commemorate plaque attached to the
school. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When Speyside School closed in the 1980s, the tree stayed behind,
but the spirit of the Royal Oak carried on with an acorn planted in
each of the new school yards for the Speyside students: Brookville,
Limehouse, Pineview and Stewarttown. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It's not been investigated whether any of these new trees planted
at these 4 schools have survived.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The 70-year-old Royal Oak will soon receive heritage
designation.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
 In order to find the cache you need to find the &lt;strong&gt;ROYAL
OAK&lt;/strong&gt; and it's associated plaque at the posted coords. On
the plaque is a number in roman numerals. Take that number and add
it to the following coords in order to find the location of the
cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
N43° 35.335&lt;br/&gt;
W79° 59.146&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Bring your own writing instrument to sign the log with.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please only use 1 line of the log per signature. Do not use a stamp
or stickers on the log. There is room for about 190
signatures.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Coordinates for the final where taken with both a Garmin
60CS and a Garmin Legend HCx and they were exactly
identical!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

This is letterbox-hybrid cache - you'll find it at the posted coordinates. Make sure to bring along your own personal stamp for the logbook. The caches in this series are on a 4-5km trail loop that can be accessed from 15 or 17 Side Road (I personally recommend 15 Side Road). Sadly this forest doesn't contain many oaks but if you keep your eyes peeled you'll see one in the distance or the leaf from an oak on the path.

DO NOT remove the ink pad or hand-carved stamp from the cache. They are not to be traded.

White Oak (Quercus palustris)
From Wikipedia

Quercus alba, the white oak, is one of the pre-eminent hardwoods of eastern North America. It is a long-lived oak of the Fagaceae family, native to eastern North America and found from southern Quebec west to eastern Minnesota and south to northern Florida and eastern Texas.

Normally not a very tall tree, typically reaching 65–85 feet (19.5-25.5 m) at maturity, it nonetheless becomes quite massive and its lower branches are apt to extend far out laterally, parallel to the ground. The tallest known white oak is 144 feet (43 m) tall. It is not unusual for a white oak tree to be as wide as it is tall, but specimens growing at high altitudes may only become small shrubs. White oaks have been known to live up to six hundred years. The bark is a light ash-gray and peels somewhat from the top, bottom and/or sides.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;I am Wacky Wabbit and this
is my fiwst geocache hide. I weawwy wike geocaching a
wot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pwease don't make fun of me
because I tawk funny. It weawwy bothews me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The othew kids used to make
fun of me in schoow, because of how I pwonounced my
wowds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even my fwiends wouwd
sometimes tease me and that made me feew even wowse. I nevew
undewstood why they made fun of how I spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since peopwe thought that I
tawked funny, a wot of times it gave me a stwong sense of
insecuwity, so I was vewy sewf-conscious whenevew I wouwd say
something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do peopwe make fun of
me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The othew kids in my cwass
and even those that I didn't know in the schoow even waughed at me
too. I was vewy awawe of this and I wouwd puwposewy avoid tawking.
I was happy to just be awone and pway by mysewf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://server6.theimagehosting.com/image.php?img=wackywabbit.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I awso hated to wead
stowies out woud in cwass, since I knew that the othews that wewe
wistening to me wead, might not undewstand some of the things that
I was weading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I did have to wead out
woud, I wouwd awways pick a showt stowy ow page to wead. I awso
hated doing pwesentations in cwass. Sometimes I fewt so scawed that
I wished I didn't have to do it. I wouwd have been happy getting an
F on the assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I was happy in
that when someone didn't undewstand what I said, my fwiends said it
fow me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often I twied to use
diffewent wowds to say things, so as to avoid being made fun
of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am suwe we have aww been
made fun of at some point in ouw wives. It is cewtainwy not a nice
feewing. We need to wemembew to tweat othews as we ouwsewves expect
to be tweated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And wemembew, nevew tease a
wabbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pwease stop waughing at me
and go find my geocache.&lt;/p&gt;

The caches in this series are on a 4-5km trail loop that can be accessed from 15 or 17 Side Road (I personally recommend 15 Side Road).

Bur Oak (Quercus macrocarpa)
From Wikipedia

Quercus macrocarpa, the Bur Oak, sometimes spelled Burr Oak, is a species of oak in the white oak section Quercus sect. Quercus, native to North America in the eastern and midwestern United States and south-central Canada. This plant is also called Mossycup oak and Mossycup white oak.

It occurs from the Appalachian Mountains west to the middle of the Great Plains, extending to central Texas, across southernmost Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, east to the Atlantic Coast in southern New Brunswick and down the coast to Delaware. Bur Oak is the state tree of Iowa.

It is a large deciduous tree growing up to 30 m (100 ft), rarely 37 m (120 ft), in height, and is one of the most massive oaks with a trunk diameter of up to 3 m (10 ft); reports of taller trees occur, but have not been verified. It is one of slowest-growing oaks, with growth rate of 30 cm (1 ft) per year when young. A 20-year-old tree will be about 6 m (20 ft) tall. It commonly lives to be 200 to 300 years old, and may live up to 400 years. [1] The bark is a medium gray and somewhat rugged.

The leaves are 7–15 cm (3–6 in) long and 5–13 cm (2–5 in) broad, variable in shape, with a lobed margin. Most often, the basal 60% is narrower and deeply lobed, while the apical 40% is wider and has shallow lobes or large teeth. The flowers are greenish-yellow catkins, produced in the spring. The acorns are very large, 2–5 cm (0.8–2 in) long and 2–4 cm (0.8-1.5 in) broad, with a large cup that wraps much of the way around the nut, with large overlapping scales and often a fringe at the edge of the cup.

Bur Oak is sometimes confused with Overcup oak and White oak, both of which it occasionally hybridizes with.</groundspeak:long_description>

Quercus rubra, commonly called northern red oak or champion oak, (syn. Quercus borealis), is an oak in the red oak group (Quercus section Lobatae). It is a native of North America, in the northeastern United States and southeast Canada. It grows from the north end of the Great Lakes, east to Nova Scotia, south as far as Georgia and states with good soil that is slightly acidic. Often simply called &quot;red oak&quot;, northern red oak is formally so named to distinguish it from southern red oak (Q. falcata), also known as the Spanish oak.

In forests, the northern red oak grows straight and tall, to 28 m (90 ft), exceptionally to 43 m (140 ft) tall, with a trunk of up to 50-100 cm (20-40 in) diameter. Open-grown trees do not get so tall, but can develop a stouter trunk, up to 2 m (6 ft) in diameter. It has stout branches growing at right angles to the stem, forming a narrow round-topped head. It grows rapidly and is tolerant of many soils and varied situations, although it prefers the glacial drift and well-drained borders of streams.[2] It is frequently a part of the canopy in an oak-heath forest, but generally not as important as some other oaks.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I've been wanting to hide a cache in here for a very long time, and
I finally got my chance during the Bruce Club Hike Event (GCZZZ0).
I particularly liked this section of the hike which features some
lovely evergreens, and there are little ponds and creeks scattered
all over the place. You'll get the best hike if you park along 15th
Sideroad instead of taking the smash-n-grab approach from 17th SR.
I strongly recommend you stick to the Bruce Trail, or one of the
Side Trails to access this cache. It is surrounded by very pretty
creeks and ponds. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Speyside Side Trail interects with the Main Trail, leading to
the impression that there are trails everywhere here! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Trail conditions can be a little muddy during the spring thaw.
Cache container is a small rubbermaid container. You should bring
something to write with. &lt;br/&gt;

As I was getting out of the Jeep a couple of other Jeeps were coming out of the 17th sideroad road allowance.  Wonder if they tried going through the giant lake I found in the middle of the road allowance later on.

Enjoyed the hike and the great scenery.  Lots of water everywhere.  Muddy in spots.  Walked right past the cache without noticing it.  Doh!  A helpful hint from the CO proved how blind I can be sometimes.

Tylor and I went in off of 17th Sideroad, but it was still quite the walk to the cache. It was a cool day, but despite that, the mosquitos were out, but only got 1 bite and it didn't live to tell about it. Lots of water and puddles on the trails today and it brought back some memories of the hike. Took about 20 minutes to find the cache and I could never get the GPS to get before 3m and it usually said 10+ meters away. Had to resort to the hint after awhile, and the hint made me think it was some kind of sneaky hide, but then once I read the description more closely and thought about the hint, I guessed right as to what it meant and then spotted it as I got deeper. Container had some water in it, which we emptied out, but everything inside was nice and dry. Took the other trail out to make a nice loop. Thanks for the very enjoyable hike we had today and seeing parts of the Bruce Trail that we have not visited too often...Before geocaching, Tylor and I actually got lost in these woods for 2 hours and that is what prompted me to buy a GPS and also how I found out about geocaching.

As we got to where we parked, there were 3 jeeps there, and one had one of it's wheels on top of one of the large boulders blocking the trail. Not sure if they were trying to drive onto the trail or just taking some pomorotional videos as 2 of the guys had video cameras with them and on the side of 2 of the jeeps it said something like Overland Adventures or something like that.</groundspeak:text>

This is letterbox-hybrid cache - you'll find it at the posted coordinates. Make sure to bring along your own personal stamp for the logbook. The caches in this series are on a 4-5km trail loop that can be accessed from 15 or 17 Side Road (I personally recommend 15 Side Road). Sadly this forest doesn't contain many oaks but if you keep your eyes peeled you'll see one in the distance or the leaf from an oak on the path.

DO NOT remove the ink pad or hand-carved stamp from the cache. They are not to be traded.

Pin Oak (Quercus palustris)
From Wikipedia

[Pin oak] is native to North America, mainly in the eastern United States from Connecticut west to eastern Kansas, and south to Georgia but not Florida, across to eastern Oklahoma; it is also native in the extreme south of Ontario, Canada. The Pin Oak is also well adapted to life in Australia (where it has been introduced) and is quite widespread across the Australian continent especially in the cooler southern States such as Victoria and New South Wales. Is also well adapted to life in Argentina especially in the Río de la Plata region.

It is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing to 100+ ft tall, with a trunk up to 1 m (3 ft) diameter. It has an 8-14 m (25-45 ft) spread. A 10-year-old tree will be about 8 m (25 ft) tall. The crown is broad conic when young, with numerous small branches radiating out from a central leader. When older, some upper branches become quite large and the central leader is lost, while the lower branches gradually droop downwards.

The leaves are 5-16 cm long and 5-12 cm broad, lobed, with five or seven lobes. Each lobe has 5-7 bristle-tipped teeth. The sinuses are typically u-shaped and extremely deep cut. In fact, there is approximately the same amount of sinus area as actual leaf area. The leaf is mostly hairless, except for a very characteristic tuft of pale orange-brown down on the lower surface where each lobe vein joins the central vein. Overall autumn leaf coloration is generally bronze, though individual leaves may be red for a time. The acorns, borne in a shallow, thin cap, are hemispherical, 10-16 mm long and 9-15 mm broad, green maturing pale brown about 18 months after pollination. The acorn is unpalatable because the kernel is very bitter.

The species usually lives only 90 to 120 years. It is naturally a wetland tree, and develops a shallow, fibrous root system, unlike many oaks, which have a strong, deep taproot when young. It is confined to acidic soils, and does not tolerate limestone or sandy Florida soil, and grows at low altitudes from sea level up to 350 m. The specific name palustris means &quot;of swamps&quot;.

A characteristic shared by a few other oak species, and also some beeches and hornbeams, is the retention of leaves through the winter on juvenile tissue. Young trees under 6 m (20 ft) will often be covered with leaves year-round, though the leaves die in the fall, remaining attached to the shoots until the new leaves appear in the spring. As with many other oak species, dead Pin oak branches will stay on the tree for many years.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A miniature version of the classic &quot;A Cache A Day&quot;
Challenge. This challenge cache is one of a series of 12 challenges
focused on finding a cache on every day for a specified month. All
caches in this series have been placed by members of the Golden Horseshoe Monthly Geocaching
Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache IS at the posted coords. You may not
claim a find on this cache until you have met the requirements of
this Challenge cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rules
Summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find and log (at least) one
cache for every day of the month specified on this mini
challenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finds do not need to be during the
same year. I.e., your qualifying find for October 1 may be from
2008, for October 2 from the present year, for October 3 from 2004,
and so on. As long as at some point in your caching career you
found a cache on every day of the specified month.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;All past, present and future finds
count.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;No editing logs or logging your finds
on a different day. The day you physically found the cache is the
day you write your found it log as. Of course just like with
everything to do with geocaching, you are on the honour
system.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Provide some kind of list, chart,
bookmark, etc as proof of completing the challenge portion of this
cache. You may find the calendar on this link
useful.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please try the other caches placed as part

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is hidden on the Brown Property section of the Bruce
Trail. It is a great section of the trail to hike, with a wonderful
forest and two wetland areas. Be sure to check out the new side
trail just west of the cache. The trail is not particularly
challenging to hike - it's generally level terrain, but it could
pose a problem for strollers. Bikes are not recommended on the
Bruce Trail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Rock wall on the north side of the trail. Head to the west side, about 5 feet above the trail in a crevase that is not visible from the trail.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

We decided to approach from 4th Line this time. No problems finding the cache as there were footprints from 2 days ago leading right up to it. Getting it out and putting it back required some bending and twisting since there was a baby attached to me and I couldn't lean over onto the rocks. Below are the dates used to meet this challenge...This is the first in this series that I am logging.

&lt;br/&gt;
An easy hike along a new side trail in Speyside. The trail is
accessed off the main trail, about 500 meters east of the Third
Line road allowance. You can expect the shortest approach to be
about 1.2km for a round trip.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You will see a couple wetlands in the area, and the trail gets
rockier as you leave the main trail. As you are hiking, take note
of the small valleys that form on either side of the trail. This
will be a fantastic trail to hike in Autumn.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
To find the cache, follow the Blue Blazed side trail - if you are
hiking northbound, the erratic is on the left hand side of the
trail, about 200 metres from the main trail. The cache is tucked
underneath this lonely boulder. The cache is a medium sized
rubbermaid container. While you are here, sit quietly for a bit and
listen to the birds in the trees, or the frogs off in the
wetlands.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Take your time, and enjoy this quiet landscape

This time we decided to come in from 4th Line. After doing your nearby challenge cache, we continued on and totally missed the side trail as the start of it wasn't really marked yet. Once we found the trail (we were just on it a couple weeks ago) it was easy to find the erratic and no problems finding the cache either. I was worried that it might be buried in snow, but that definitely wasn't the case. Left a Penguin TB.

Thanks for a couple of enjoyable caches.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;strong&gt;All caches in this series are located along the 47.9 km stretch of the Toronto section of the Bruce Trail. Each cache is a standalone micro cache. There will also be 2 final regular size multi-caches in this series in which you will need to collect the clues found within each of the 5 mirco film containers to find these 2 multi caches. There will also be a bonus cache!&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each cache is very well hidden and will take you through some interesting points on the trail, many of which I am just discovering now as I place these caches. Since these are micro caches, it could potentially be difficult to find, and hence I will be rating the difficulty a 3 on all of them. My 5 year old son chose each of the hiding spaces himself and then we concealed it well. However, since you are taking the trouble to find these caches, the hint will tell you exactly where the cache is hidden, just in case you get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have written a letter in coloured marker on the inside of the each lid and also on both sides of the log sheets. When you find the cache and if you want to attempt the 2 multi-caches, make sure you take note of what the letter is and what colour it is written in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring your own pen/pencil to sign the log.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

Recommended Parking:&lt;br/&gt;
N43° 36.875&lt;br/&gt;
W79° 58.497&lt;br/&gt;
Less than a 400 meter hike from roadside parking. Only obstacle is a small river that leads to a large pond. Although there is no bridge, you shouldn't have any trouble crossing it. Cache is about 35 meters from the trail along the escarpment. It is in fairly easy view if you look from the right angle and my son put some small stone &quot;features&quot; in front. Please leave the stone features as you found them, as they are part of the hint below.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>From below, when standing in front of the hiding spot it is between waist and chest level...about 3 feet from the top. It is under a ledge that sticks about 3 feet out. Placed into a small crevice and covered by a small flat rock and then a larger ice cream tub sized rock in front of that.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Wake Up.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Follow the white rabbit.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
What is the Illuminatrix? Follow the white rabbit to find your
answer. Once you find the rabbit's den you will choose - you can
stay in Wonderland, wake up in your bed and believe whatever you
want to believe - or you can see how far down this rabbit hole
goes.&lt;br/&gt;

About this geocache. This is a night cache, you will require a
flashlight – preferably a smaller one, like a headlamp. This
cache is not optimized for a large “BFL” - you'll have
the best results with a flashlight that's bright and about one inch
across the lens.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
At the posted co-ordinates, you will arrive at a trailhead for a
Bruce Trail Side Trail. You will find the White Rabbit's trail on
the west side. Parking is along the road. DO NOT block, or walk up
the nearby driveways. These driveways are private property –
please respect the individuals that live near here.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please remember to get the code you need from the final for this
cache if you will be pursuing GC2G0NA: BFL Boot Camp V :: Tachyonic

Cache plays out as follows:

Arrive at posted co-ords - white reflector trail leads cacher to ammo can with two laminated cards. One has co-ords to parking area (blue pill) and the other leads to Stage 3 (red pill).

Stage 3 - ammo can with the &quot;Illuminatrix Device&quot; where cachers calculate the location of the final. 

Final as mentioned above.</groundspeak:long_description>

One of the things we discovered we decided to ignore for now, but would check on later. We had a good understanding of what we had to do and it was just a matter of getting it to work out and give us coords that seemed plausible. We kept getting an extra light for the west I think it was, but we tried a few numbers, expanded our search a bit to places that made sense and came up with the find with enough eyes searching. In the end round trip was only about an hour. I can see that this cache is not for the average cacher or even average person, as it definitely introduces one to some new concepts.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Geopuzzle Project&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
by res2100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How it works&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I provide the blank hexagon puzzle pieces. You get one and decorate
it however you want, including your geocaching username. Return the
puzzle piece to me in person, by mail, or drop it into the
Geopuzzle Project - Hexagon Dropoff cache. All of the completed
hexagons will be put together to form one giant puzzle mosaic.
Pictures will be posted to show the progress as the puzzle
grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Puzzle Pieces&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The puzzle pieces are hexagon shaped. A hexagon is a 6-sided
figure. Each side is 2 inches in length. I have cut them from
thicker paper stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What can I put on my puzzle piece?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Personalize it however you want.&lt;br/&gt;
Draw something by hand.&lt;br/&gt;
Design something on the computer and print it out to fit the puzzle
piece.&lt;br/&gt;
Design something on the computer using one of the templates and
email it to me.&lt;br/&gt;
It could be something geocaching related or something that is of
interest to you.&lt;br/&gt;
Make sure you include your geocaching username somewhere on it
too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where can I get a blank puzzle piece?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
From the Geopuzzle Project -
Hexagon Pickup cache at N 43° 38.167 W 079° 53.904.&lt;br/&gt;
From me directly.&lt;br/&gt;
I can also send you the hexagon puzzle piece template through
email.&lt;br/&gt;
Randomly inserted into other geocaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I return the completed puzzle piece to you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Leave it in the Geopuzzle
Project - Hexagon Dropoff cache.&lt;br/&gt;
Return it to me in person.&lt;br/&gt;
Mail it to me (ask me for my mailing address).&lt;br/&gt;
If you created your puzzle piece on the computer using the template
I provide, you can email it to me and I will print it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Geopuzzle Project -
Hexagon Pickup cache contains some letters in the
maple leaf of the log book. These letters are needed in order to
figure out the location of the Geopuzzle Project - Hexagon Dropoff cache. Optionally and to take part in the fun, at the Geopuzzle Project - Hexagon Dropoff you should to take home and decorate one of the hexagon
puzzle pieces if you haven't done so already and deposit it into
the cache. Your completed puzzle piece may serve as your log.&lt;/p&gt;





In order to find this cache, you will need to obtain the
letters located within the maple leaf of the cover of the log book
from the Geopuzzle Project -
Hexagon Pickup cache. Take the associated values of
these letter and add them together, then subtract 900 and then add
the result to the decimal minutes of both the North and West of the
posted coords in order to locate this cache and deposit your
hexagon puzzle piece.&lt;br/&gt;
You can find parking at the posted coords.

Yes signing the log is enough. Decorating a hexagon piece is optional and I have updated the description to add appropriate wording. Can you point me to the link where it mentions this guideline though so I have it for future reference as it is not in the guidelines that is linked when creating a new cache.
I wonder why opencaching does not save my reviewer notes or certain updates some of the time.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cherry Beach is a lakeside park located at the foot of Cherry Street just south of Unwin Avenue in Toronto.For many years it was one of the few Toronto beaches that was clean enough for swimming. It has change rooms for bathers and barbecue areas for picnickers. It also has an off-leash area for dog walkers. The Martin Goodman waterfront trail passes through the park.
At the time of placement the cache contained two geocoins, a travel bug, a number of trade items and a FTF treat.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blackbeard&lt;/b&gt; also known as Edward Teach was
a notorious English pirate in the Caribbean Sea and western
Atlantic. His best known vessel was the &lt;i&gt;Queen Anne's
Revenge&lt;/i&gt;, which is believed to have run aground near Beaufort
Inlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This series consists of 7 caches. You will need to find the 6
treasure chests that have been hidden by these famous pirates and
collect the required information in order to find the secret
location of where Princess Theresa has taken refuge. Before
attempting any cache in this series, you should refer to
Pirates of Morovia - Princess Theresa (Final) for more
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each cache location you will find a treasure
chest. Engraved on the back of each treasure chest is a 3 digit
number which you should take note of. Also take note on whether the
treasure chest is open or closed. Do not remove the treasure chest
playing piece from the cache. For some added fun, when you log your
finds on this series, why not give your character a name and give
details of your character's journey throughout the area of Morovia
as you try to locate all of the chests that the 6 pirates have
hidden. The Princess likes stories and may have extra rewards
available for those that tell her the tales of their heroic
journeys. The Princess however does not understand pirate speak,
but she is very fluent in miffer speak, which is a common dialect
that is communicated among the people of Morovia.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

GPS was a bit bouncy, and of course I didn't come prepared for the challenge ... specifically the last couple feet, so I ended up using my smartphone in a most unusual way to locate the cache. After I figured out how to get that close. On my way out of the area, I encountered another hiker who hiked the loop the opposite direction so we sat and had a nice chat about the area's hiking before we parted ways a few minutes later. </groundspeak:text>

Recommended Parking:&lt;br/&gt;
N43° 37.945&lt;br/&gt;
W79° 58.375&lt;br/&gt;
Along the Black Creek Side Trail. Shortest way when entering the
main trail is to go to the right, but I strongly recommend you
continue along the Black Creek Side Trail until it connects back up
to the main trail and forms a loop back to the parking.&lt;br/&gt;
At the spot where it joins back up to the main trail, take a few
minutes and head over the bridge to the right to see the ruins of
an old mill, very large kiln (fenced in), then another set of 4
other kiln ruins. Then to make your way back to the parking lot,
turn around at the kilns and follow the main trail (white blazes),
back over the wooden bridge, past the side trail you came from, and
then over another wooden bridge, then make sure you go to your left
and follow the white blazes upwards through the &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot;
and up the 2 ladders. This is definately worth seeing. My son and I
have hiked here many times and are amazed each time.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>About half way between the trail and river. Probably the largest tree in the area, with 2 thick main trunks. In a hole with a root sticking out, near the bottom of the tree, facing the river. Cache is in the hole behind th e3 very small rocks.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Geopuzzle Project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;by res2100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How it works&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I provide the blank hexagon puzzle pieces. You get one and decorate
it however you want, including your geocaching username. Return the
puzzle piece to me in person, by mail, or drop it into the
Geopuzzle Project - Hexagon Dropoff cache. All of the completed
hexagons will be put together to form one giant puzzle mosaic.
Pictures will be posted to show the progress as the puzzle
grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Puzzle Pieces&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The puzzle pieces are hexagon shaped. A hexagon is a 6-sided
figure. Each side is 2 inches in length. I have cut them from
thicker paper stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What can I put on my puzzle piece?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Personalize it however you want.&lt;br/&gt;
Draw something by hand.&lt;br/&gt;
Design something on the computer and print it out to fit the puzzle
piece.&lt;br/&gt;
Design something on the computer using one of the templates and
email it to me.&lt;br/&gt;
It could be something geocaching related or something that is of
interest to you.&lt;br/&gt;
Make sure you include your geocaching username somewhere on it
too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where can I get a blank puzzle piece?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
From the Geopuzzle Project -
Hexagon Pickup cache at N 43° 38.167 W 079° 53.904.&lt;br/&gt;
From me directly.&lt;br/&gt;
I can also send you the hexagon puzzle piece template through
email.&lt;br/&gt;
You can download a hexagon puzzle piece template from the website
indicated below.&lt;br/&gt;
Randomly inserted into other geocaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I return the completed puzzle piece to you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Leave it in the Geopuzzle
Project - Hexagon Dropoff cache.&lt;br/&gt;
Return it to me in person.&lt;br/&gt;
Mail it to me (ask me for my mailing address).&lt;br/&gt;
If you created your puzzle piece on the computer using the template
I provide, you can email it to me and I will print it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Geopuzzle Project Website&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
http://geocaching2100.bravehost.com/geopuzzle/geopuzzle.htm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Geopuzzle Project -
Hexagon Pickup cache contains some letters in the
maple leaf of the log book. These letters are needed in order to
figure out the location of the Geopuzzle Project - Hexagon Dropoff cache. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Captain Henry Every&lt;/b&gt; was most famous for
being one of the few major pirate captains to retire with his loot
without being arrested or killed in battle. He commanded the
&lt;i&gt;Fancy&lt;/i&gt; which he obtained by a well planned Mutiny against
Captain Gibson for who he served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This series consists of 7 caches. You will need to find the 6
treasure chests that have been hidden by these famous pirates and
collect the required information in order to find the secret
location of where Princess Theresa has taken refuge. Before
attempting any cache in this series, you should refer to

Pirates of Morovia - Princess Theresa (Final) for more
information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each cache location you will find a treasure
chest. Engraved on the back of each treasure chest is a 3 digit
number which you should take note of. Also take note on whether the
treasure chest is open or closed. Do not remove the treasure chest
playing piece from the cache. For some added fun, when you log your
finds on this series, why not give your character a name and give

as you try to locate all of the chests that the 6 pirates have

but she is very fluent in miffer speak, which is a common dialect

We followed the trail from Mountainview, but kept sneaking off to follow deer trails and check out the forts the locals built. After overshooting the cache area, we came back along the trail and made the find quickly. I left a lanyard, signed the log, and we posed for a quick photo before continuing on to follow more animal trails. Thanks for the hide.

This time with the trail segment that res2100 sent me showing the new trail down here. Time to explore. Parked the car and made my way to the cache over the nice new boardwalk, and stopped to take a few photos in between mosquito/deerfly attacks. The GPS initially took me to the wrong side of the trail at the final, and I hunted around for a while with no luck. Pulled the hint - nope nothing like that around here..... back toward the trail to give the GPS a chance at a better lock. Spot something I didn't see before, investigate, and voila! 

Now, I'm going to have to find out where the rest of that trail leads - could be a pretty handy bike/walking loop if that pops out at Cedarvale [:)]</groundspeak:text>

This geocache is about whatever you choose to experience while hiking around and exploring in Hungry Hollow. Go explore a bit and take some time to look at beaver activity along the river. We hid this cache awhile ago as we went exploring in Hungry Hollow. We approached from Mountainview Rd and were trying to make out way over to 8th Line, but were running out of visible trails to follow. We enjoyed several hours down here exploring that day and did about a 7km round trip hike from home.

Easiest but longest approach would be from the trailhead from the NW side of Mountainview Bridge.

Another way in would be from Heslop, which is very steep and there's probably a couple other ways to get in too which we haven't explored yet. You might be able to get in from Cedarvale Park but it would probably be a good bushwack.</groundspeak:long_description>

Once we got the car running, I needed to stretch it's legs a bit, so we took a roam around Georgetown. Once it seemed to be running normally, we decided to go visit this new cache in town. 

We parked off Heslop (before realizing that the end of Sargeant would be a lot shorter) and hiked along the trails. I found this particular section quite interesting and I think I'll be back with the camera when spring ramps up a bit more.

letter.&lt;br/&gt;
A = 10 * (# of A answers)&lt;br/&gt;
B = 20 * (# of B answers)&lt;br/&gt;
C = 30 * (# of C answers)&lt;br/&gt;
D = 40 * (# of D answers)&lt;br/&gt;
E = 50 * (# of E answers)&lt;br/&gt;
X = A+B+C+D+E&lt;br/&gt;
Finally, subtract X from the decimal minutes of both the posted
North and West coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a new portion of the Halton Hills Trail that starts at City Hall.

Trail Entrance is at
N43° 38.360 
W79° 55.834
...lots of room to park, either on the road or in the parking lot.

Follow the hard packed gravel trail and then turn right onto the trail that goes into the woods. 

Cache is a 1 gallon white bucket hidden very well. There's lots of great hiding spots and it is located about 55 meters from the trail. Please put the cache back as you found it and make sure it is completely covered.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Find a good place to sit on a natural looking bench. You're virtually sitting on the cache. As you enter the woods from the trail, stay to your right (with the slope very close on your right).</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Walk to the back of Maple Creek Parkette and through the gate to the trail (well sort of a trail). You will be walking along the hillside towards the cache. Watch your footing especially in rain or snow.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silver Creek Find 1000&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This geocache was placed to mark
a milestone in our caching adventures. We found our first geocache on November 6, 2002. It was called Silver Creek Find (GC2EF3). 540 days later, on April 26, 2004, we found our 1000th geocache called Lookout, lookout, lookout (GCGZGG).
During this time we have had many enjoyable geocaching adventures that brought
us to so many wonderful and interesting places that we never knew existed
before. Because of geocaching, we found these places and came away with very
fond memories of many of them. We have also met quite a lot of geocachers
during this time and I am proud to say that many of them I am now able to call
my friends. Everyone we have met has been very friendly and pleasant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silver Creek Find 1000 (GCJCBM) is
our 34th geocache placed and we think it is only fitting that we
place it close to the first cache we found. Please take a moment to sign the
card contained in this geocache and add any comments, or even tell about some
of your milestones, goals or even your memorable experiences as a geocacher.
Don’t forget to log your find online too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that you enjoy this area,
as I believe that the experience and adventure that you have in finding this
and any geocache, and also the area it’s hidden in, is the ultimate prize for
any geocache hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you and remember to have
fun!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It's about 2 feet off the ground in a tree which I think is a pine tree, or maybe it is a cedar. The tree has 2 trunks and the cache is between these 2 trunks among the branches. You'll have no problem seeing it once you get to the right tree. There are a few other trees scattered about similar to the one that holds the cache. You will be standing in an overgrown field with not much of a view. I placed this cache as an experiment, although I am pretty sure I will know the results. Have fun! Or not. It's up to you. If you prefer a cache with some fun, adventure and in a neat spot, then why not try my Lonely Credit cache instead of this one. Also, if it is raining or wet out, please do not find this cache. If the log even gets a drop of water on it, I suspect it won't be long until it will be ruined. </groundspeak:long_description>

3&lt;br/&gt;
(Ontario Mini-Fizzy 9 Challenge)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A miniature version of the classic 81 &quot;Fizzy&quot; Challenge. This
challenge cache is one of a series of nine mini-fizzy challenges
focused on a specific difficulty level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache IS at the posted coords. You
may not claim a find on this cache until you have met the
requirements of this Challenge cache. This actual physical cache
has a Difficulty/Terrain rating of 3/1.5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original idea for this cache came
from &lt;b&gt;GC1MCZZ - Five Fives (Eatonville Mini-Fizzy Challenge) by
K2D2&lt;/b&gt; and is also based on &lt;b&gt;GC11E8N - Well Rounded Cacher (The
Fizzy Challenge) by Kealia&lt;/b&gt; in honour of the cacher
&lt;b&gt;FizzyMagic&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &quot;Challenge Cache&quot; and hence must
meet all of the Groundspeak guidelines in regards to a Challenge
Cache. In order to log this &quot;Difficulty 3&quot; Mini-Fizzy Challenge
cache as a find, you MUST find nine separate Difficulty 3 caches.
Each of the nine caches must have a different Terrain rating from 1
to 5. In order to level the playing field, only caches which you
have found AFTER the publication of this cache will qualify towards
this Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rules Summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;All 9 caches must have a Difficulty
rating of 3.0.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Each of the 9 caches must have a
different Terrain rating.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Only new finds, found on or after
September 9, 2009 (09/09/09), will qualify for this
challenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Each of the 9 caches must have a
different cache owner.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are a premium member, you
should create a public Bookmark which includes your caching name in
the title. It must also include the 9 qualifying caches that you
have found which meet the requirements of this challenge. You
should then link your Bookmark to the cache page. In the comments
field of each of the caches in the Bookmark, state the Terrain
rating of the cache along with the date that you found the cache
on. Alternatively, if you are not a premium member, in your Found
It log, please include the 9 qualifying cache names, GC codes,
Terrain ratings and dates for when you found each of the 9
qualifying caches.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;This Challenge cache can not be used
as one of the qualifying caches.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find this physical cache and sign the
log book after you have met the requirements of this
cache.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are unsure of any of the rules
or requirements for logging this cache as a find, please feel free
to ask one of the nine participants.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**As an optional extra
Challenge, see if you can find 9 different cache types to represent
your 9 qualifying caches for this Challenge Cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please try the other caches placed as part of the Ontario

The walk on the bruce trail was great as always, and the hide was quickly spotted. We went on to do the next one too. This is my first Miny Fizzy, I hope to do more. Finds are in my bookmark list.

From N 43° 38.662 W 079° 56.460, start your way along the trail to the west. The walk from here is under 100 meters. Continue walking keeping your eyes to your right until you come across the number 96 to your right. At this point stop and face left with your back to the number 96. Cache is a film container hanging about 10 feet off the ground from a long stick positioned in the crotch of a large multi trunked tree just a couple meters off the trail.

Within the container you will find a log sheet for you to sign or place your stamp. There is also a stamp inside of the container which you can stamp your own letterbox book with. Bring your own ink.

Optionally, when logging your find, post what your favourite flavour is (see the stamp to know what I am talking about).

The trail here winds through a couple wooded areas and crosses some farmland. You'll be treated to a couple landscape views that stretch all the way to Mississauga in the distance! 

The cache is a small lock-n-lock. Bring your own pen, there isn't one in the cache. You can access the cache from two points, both trailheads are off 5th Line north of Limehouse.  For the best experience, park at one and hike out the other end.

The terrain got a bit more hilly, but that was OK. I like the fact there were no bugs,  this is a good time to be on the Bruce. Once we got to GZ it was a quick find. There was a child's sandbox toy near GZ, I wonder what that was about?

We started along the Bruce Trail, but with 190m to go the trail went in a different direction so we continued to follow it for another 100m or so, but we kept getting further away, so we backtracked and took the other trail straight to it. Nice east find and that sure is one big birth tree that you found here. 

Back in Limehouse CA, they were clearing the trees and shrubbery around the large draw kiln and restoration work will start on it soon. I am surprised however that a conservation authority would actually cut down perfectly healthy trees.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The posted coordinates will take you to the Sundial Garden in
the Lucy Maud Montgomery Heritage Garden located within the village
of Norval which was home to Lucy Maud Montgomery from 1926 to 1935.
Lucy Maud Montgomery is best known for writing Anne of Green
Gables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of construction, Norval was the proud possessor of
only the fourth Analematic Sundial in Canada (the others being
located in Calgary, Penticton, and Hamilton) and the tenth in North
America. A similar and more understandable name for this sundial is
Human or Interactive Sundial. When a person is standing in the
correct position on a stone slab that is marked off in months of
the year, their shadow will point toward a low wall containing a
series of marker stones representing the hours of the day. As the
sundial is used mostly in the summer, the hour stones are oriented
to tell summer time. The sundial will tell real time as well as
watch time. Apparently there is a difference and it's nothing to do
with hours leaping forward or falling back. This added feature
makes this sundial absolutely unique. There is no other sundial
anywhere that contains this highly educational element!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directly above the &quot;N&quot; near the southern part of the stone slab
is a year. Take note of this year, which you can call X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearby to your right you will find a dedication plaque. You are
looking for the plaque that contains the words &quot;LEST WE FORGET&quot;.
Take note of the year on this plaque, which you can assign to
&quot;Y&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculate Z as follows: Z = X - Y&lt;br/&gt;
Subtract Z from both the following North and West coordinates,
which will give you the location of the geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N43 39.489&lt;br/&gt;
W79 53.353&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several ways and methods to approach the cache. Please
do not trespass on Upper Canada College lands, the racquet club
(signed private property) or any other business lands as you head
to this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the the rest of the garden and the tranquil location of
the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting geocache facts that I found out after placing this
cache:&lt;br/&gt;
This is the only 1/5 Difficulty/Terrain multicache in Canada.&lt;br/&gt;
The next closest 1/5 Difficulty/Terrain multicache is more than
465km away in Pennsylvania and then more than 700km away in
Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: CA2Z88Y - Cache&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

to visit the 3 stages first to gather some information. It doesn't
matter in what order you visit each of these 3 stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1 (N 43° 38.760 W 079° 55.077)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Here you will find information on a group of people who lived on
the land here.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; = How many girls are mentioned on the plaque
which sits on top of a metal pole?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2 (N 43° 39.276 W 079° 54.410)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Here you will find a rabbit.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; = How many carrots are in his right jacket
pocket?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; = How many buttons are on his vest?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; = How many pocket watches does he have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3 (N 43° 39.689 W 079° 54.543)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
There are 2 years mentioned on the plaque which sits on top of a
metal pole.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; = Take the later year and subtract the earlier
year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To find the final:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Add A + B and divide the result by 100 and add it to the North
portion of the following meaningless coords.&lt;br/&gt;
Multiple C x D x E and divide the result by 100 and subtract it
from the West portion of the following meaningless coords.&lt;br/&gt;
N 43° 39.500 W 079° 55.533 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you read the questions carefully and please obey all
signs. There is &lt;strong&gt;Poison Ivy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Stinging
Nettles&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ants&lt;/strong&gt; by the final cache

Had we not known who lived here, seen the smiley balloon and the TOMTEC license plate in the driveway, would never have had the nerve to attempt it. Found the cache and as we were signing the logbook, the cache owners arrived on the scene, including Elf, the finder and keeper of lost socks! To the sounds of &quot;Reunited&quot;, LadyJaime's socks were a pair once more. LJ then traded a couple packs of soothers ('cause those are for sucky babies) for a little pair of baby hiking shoes, and off we went to the BFL so the Rainbow Connection could continue their Hallowe'en costume preparations. Nice to meet you both and thanks for the amazing cache! </groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What a great cache. Had this one planned for this evening along with completing a couple of the new Geocaching Challenges. Started with this one after dinner. As we drove up we could see the cache owners darting around the inside of their house, probably in excitement of getting visitors. We had the pleasure of meeting all 3 of the Treehouse Gang that live here. On we ventured into the great unknown, and saw many good hiding spots, but the bunny gave it away. I think this is most largest cache I have ever seen. Opened the container and my 2 year old daughter was eager to venture in. She seemed to be intrigued by the 2 badminton rackets. However in the end we decided to trade for the premade camo cache container which we know we will put to good use very soon and left an Orange shirt, since we know the cache owners love orange shirts. I think the cache also must hold a record for the most trade items and very well sorted by type. I am sure there must have been atleast a thousand items to trade in there. We might just have to come back to trade some more, which I am sure our daughter would love to do. Or maybe find some large TBs to leave in the cache. Had a nice chat with the cache owners and then continued on to Norval. Thanks for the unique and memorable cache and experience. And I wonder what you will do with Money in the freezor.</groundspeak:text>

This is the
former location of the famous Dominion Seed House, which is known
for their mail order catalogue of seeds.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It was established in 1928 and operated here until 1993, when it
was sold. The old Seed House building unfortunately was demolished
in 1999. This portion of the property has now been turned into a
beautiful garden park. Take a walk around the park...sit on the
benches, read the many plaques, and simply enjoy your time in the
park. Go to the posted coords which are for the entrance to the
park from the parking lot (You can enter the parking lot off of
Maple Ave) to start your adventure.
&lt;p&gt;To find the location of the cache (camoed diabetes strip
container, with a hook), visit the 4 locations specified in the
additional waypoints to gather the necessary information needed in
order to calculate the location of the geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Canada Goose&lt;/b&gt; (N43 39.120 W79 54.843)&lt;br/&gt;
What is the goose doing (take the value in brackets corresponding
to the correct answer):&lt;br/&gt;
A) Flying (25)&lt;br/&gt;
B) Eating (140)&lt;br/&gt;
C) Nesting (45)&lt;br/&gt;
D) Walking (110)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Gate&lt;/b&gt; (N43 39.114 W79 54.838)&lt;br/&gt;
What kind of gate is here (take the value in brackets corresponding
to the correct answer):&lt;br/&gt;
A) Fantasy Gate (25)&lt;br/&gt;
B) Gate to Eternity (140)&lt;br/&gt;
C) Gate to Heaven (45)&lt;br/&gt;
D) Polar Gate (110)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boys&lt;/b&gt; (N43 39.114 W79 54.799)&lt;br/&gt;
What are the 2 boys doing (take the value in brackets
corresponding to the correct answer):&lt;br/&gt; A) Eating their supper
(25)&lt;br/&gt;
B) Spending time with their animal friends (140)&lt;br/&gt;
C) Sleeping (45)&lt;br/&gt;
D) Going for a walk holding hands (110)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leaves&lt;/b&gt; (N43 39.108 W79 54.781)&lt;br/&gt;
You are at an intersection with 2 walls, count the total number of
leaves on top of both walls and then subtract how many different
types of leaves there are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the answers you obtained from all 4 of the locations above
and add them together. Then divide your result by 1000 and then add
them to both the north and west of the following meaningless
coords. This will give you the location of the geocache. Bring your
own writing instrument.&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just love driving around in the country. There's less traffic,
fewer stop lights, nicer scenery and cleaner air than in the city.
Sometimes it's about finding a great spot. Other times it's more
about getting there than the destination. That's what this series
is about, an excuse to get away from the hustle and bustle of the
city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scenic spot near a small creek. Just to the south is Limehouse
which has a neat single lane bridge.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After a nice walk around Limehouse CA, this was the next closest cache so we headed here. Searched and searched, but just couldn't find the cache. As I stepped off the rock wall I banged my knee on it as I landed on round rock. Found an interesting &quot;thing&quot;...not really sure what it is or what it's used for...some kind of metal sled\vehicle in the ditch on the opposite side of the road from the cache. Continued the search and looked over every bit of the guard rail and still nothing. Went back to the car and got my wife's GPS while she gave TK her bottle and continued searching. My wife's GPS zeroed right on the spot and mine was close. Eventually, just by luck I suppose, I finally found it after 20-30 minutes of searching. Honestly, I should have found it in the first minute as I really don't know how I or anyone could miss the container even with the camo on it. Well done. Left something special in it for another cache.</groundspeak:text>

This came up on the radar on the way out, and I needed a cache-a-day square filled in, so parked the car within a metre or so and got to searching. Within seconds I was nose to nose with a hornet climbing out of it's nest in one of the bridge railings - yipes! Backed away, and wondered why Avernar would put one so close to a nest like that. After a couple minutes of pondering, I decided Avernar wouldn't do that so I tried a different approach and voila! Tupperwhere! 

Taking a few minutes while logging, I notice the creek is rather scenic here. Nice. Makes up for the hornets. I think.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The tiny hamlet of Hanlan was named for the famous oarsman Ned&lt;br/&gt;Hanlan, whose name also adorns a certain clothing-optional beach in&lt;br/&gt;the Toronto Islands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The settlement's first postmaster was George Johnson, who is said&lt;br/&gt;to have chosen the name Hanlan because it was short and easy to&lt;br/&gt;remember. George Johnson was the son of blacksmith D.W. Johnson who&lt;br/&gt;built his shop at the corner of Tomken and Britannia in the&lt;br/&gt;1830's.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methodist settlers living in the area originally travelled to Derry&lt;br/&gt;West to make use of Carter's Anglican Chapel. Sometime in 1840, the&lt;br/&gt;Anglican congregation no longer allowed the Methodists to use their&lt;br/&gt;space, so a new church was built where the southeast corner of&lt;br/&gt;Dixie and Britannia can now be found. Hunt's Chapel, named for the&lt;br/&gt;original owners of the land sold to the Methodists, lasted until&lt;br/&gt;1867, when it was replaced by a larger building and renamed Trinity&lt;br/&gt;Wesleyan Methodist Church. This latter church closed in 1925.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All that remains of the hamlet of Hanlan is the Trinity Wesleyan&lt;br/&gt;Methodist cemetery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;To find the cache:&lt;/b&gt; Go to the posted coordinates. Look for&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Baldock&lt;/b&gt;. You need two pieces of information: where was&lt;br/&gt;Thomas when he died (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;) and how old was he when he passed&lt;br/&gt;(&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;London, England (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;=279)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calgary, Alberta (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;=289)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;North Bay, Ontario (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;=299)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take the correct value for &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; and add it to &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;. Divide&lt;br/&gt;the total by 1000 and add it to this North coordinate to get the&lt;br/&gt;North coordinate of the final location:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;N 43 39.000&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now look for &lt;b&gt;Garbutt&lt;/b&gt; (west of Baldock). You again need two&lt;br/&gt;pieces of information. Of what place was John Garbutt a native&lt;br/&gt;(&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;), and how old was his wife Mary when she died (&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yorkshire, England (&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;=707)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Devonshire, England (&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;=717)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lancashire, England (&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;=727)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take the correct value of &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; and add it to &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;. Divide&lt;br/&gt;the total by 1000 and add it to this West coordinate to get the&lt;br/&gt;West coordinate of the final location:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;W 079 38.000&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The digital root of &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;+&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; is &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The digital root of &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;+&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; is &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please respect where you are. &lt;b&gt;There is no need to enter the&lt;br/&gt;fenced-in area.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please read this page for&lt;br/&gt;more information.

for a GO Station to have.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 If you look around here, you should find a marker for the
   
Canadian Gravity Standardization Net, which is a type of
Geodetic Survey marker. Your first step will be to find the marker,
and also the three digit number contained on it. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 This will be a fun job for you if you come during rush hour, or on
a Tuesday night (the marker can be blocked on Tuesday nights).
Watch as the muggles try to figure out what on earth you are
doing.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 When you have the number, divide it by 1000 and add it to:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 N 43 38.704&lt;br/&gt;
W 079 54.617&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The result will lead you to the micro. Please try to be discreet
lest the cache get muggled. You will need to bring some form of pen
or pencil, as the container is way too small to facilitate one of
these. &lt;br/&gt;

A few weeks ago I walked over after a family &quot;do&quot; and got the first stage. I had trouble reading the last digit of the number, so I was a bit off for the final. I looked around a bit but did not find it. I walked back to the house, and on the way home drove over and got out the BFL to get the number exactly. Just as I got back to the car, the heavens opened up with a huge rain storm, so I did not attempt the final that day. Today, we had dinner at the brother in laws, and headed over to the cache on the way home. Today it was a quick find, I think I had even looked there the first time and missed it. I grabbed the cache and took it into the car to sign. The train was due soon, so there were a few muggles around the station. Just after I got into the car, a group of teen muggles decided to sit around the cache site for a while. We drove to the other side of the lot, to look like we were waiting for the train. After about 10 minutes the muggles finally left, and I could get the cache back in place unseen. 

So all in all an interesting cache.

The co-ords sent us to a nearby trail a couple of hundred meters north of the tracks. Everything seemed okay until the GPS  was pointing to what we figure would be someones living room in a house off the trail. Went back to make sure I took the number down correctly. Fastest way back was via the tunnel at the station. Fell down the stairs. Checked the clue...correct. Used the calculator again. Got the same coords as last time.Hmmm.  Checked the math. Looked at the calculator again and realized it had a burned out section of LED. Went back, via the stairs to the car on the other side of the tracks, drove back around to the correct spot and had the cache in hand in a few minutes.
Thanks for the &quot;quick&quot; multi.</groundspeak:text>

This is a little spot I've known about for years. It's a hidden gem
in the middle of Georgetown's industrial section. As you drive down
Armstrong Avenue, you will see a bunch of depressing factories and
a dirty recycling depot. But as you pass the intersection at
Sinclair an Oasis appears, briefly.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you visit in Autumn, and you're a &quot;Leaf Peeper&quot;, you'll find the
location particularly enjoyable. You can park your car on the north
side of Armstrong, and wander back toward the cache. The cache is
on a slope that overlooks the Credit River Valley, and the Credit
Valley Footpath. This area is a very steep valley, that is almost a
gorge in parts. It's flanked with a combination Carolinean / Great
Lakes - St. Lawrence forest system and looks stunning during
September/October.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is located a short distance down the slope. It is larger
than a film canister but still qualifies as a micro. Please take
care getting to the cache as the slope drops off rather suddenly
after the cache location. There a few good spots to sit down and
take in the view.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Look for a geocaching.com georock tucked under one of the concrete slabs. Pick the slabs that are higher up on the hill to check.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Visited a couple other stores at the mall and then as the sun was setting we decided to grab this cache. Even convinced the boy to come along. Spent some time scrambling around eliminating spot after spot and then having fun hurling some rocks down the hill, listening to the thump, thud, boink and to see if it would make a splash at the bottom. That was becoming fun, but we still had the cache to find. There were so many possibilities of where this cache could be hidden. One more toss...wait no not that one, unless I wanted the wrath of a penguin on me. Hid it nicely back as we found it and decided on no more tossing rocks down the hill. I bet this will be a nice place to see the fall colours. I did have the urge to go down to the river to do some exploring but that would have to wait until another day.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This was the first cache I ever placed. I have rehidden it in a new hiding spot close to where the original was located.

In a Cemetery in Georgetown. This should be a fairly easy one (10-20 minutes...about 200 meters total or less). Try to do it without the hints. Please respect the graves. I always liked math, so I hope you know how to count, add and subtract.

The graveyard is only open from sunrise to sunset (although the gates are always open). Also note that no pets are allowed in the cemetery.

This is a 3 part cache as follows:

1) There is a sign at the posted coordinates. Count all the letters (only the letters, no symbols). Take the Amount of letters in the sign and multiply it by 5 and then subtract the result from the last 3 digits of both the following Latitude and Longitube: N43° 39.541 &amp; W79° 54.897. This will bring you to a grave.

2) On this gravestone is listed 2 people, the man is still alive (well he was when the cache was placed, but has since passed away, but was not buried here and hence not reflected on the gravestone), but the woman has died (He was a friend that lived in town and this was his first wife, who had died over 15 years ago). How many months did the woman live (round up to the nearest month)? It's a grey gravestone. Take the # of months that you calculated and subtract that # from Latitude N43° 39.913 and add that same # of months to Longitude W79° 54.057. This will take you to somewhere along the fenceline where the cache is hidden. 

3) Cache is now a camoflaged film size container. It is hanging on the fence to the right of a corner fence post from the old gate. Near the top of the fence in the vines. Bring your own writing instrument.

We had moved into Georgetown about two months before the housewarming that Alden and his Mom attended -- our house. 
We had only been told about GeoCaching at that point, so this would qualify as the first Geocaching experience that I had ever encountered. There was about seven of us crowded around the GPSr that we borrowed from Alden's mom. I recall doing a whole lot of walking and it was typically the kids that were spotting the clues before the adults could. 

Fast forward to today (April 3, 2005) and the family now has 7 geocachers, and three more that join in sometimes. 

Thanks for putting this one so close that Alden and his Mom decided to introduce us to Geocaching with it. </groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find the bunnies and you're on your way
to finding the final cache.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 This is the final cache in this series.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In order to find this cache, you will first need
to find and take note of the information that are
part of the following 3 caches in this series:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Where's Bouncy Bunny 1: Waiting for Lord
British&lt;br/&gt;
Where's Bouncy Bunny 3: Climbing to New
Heights&lt;br/&gt;
Where's Bouncy Bunny 4: Chasing the White Rabbit&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;strong&gt;Add the 3 values together from the above caches:&lt;/strong&gt;

 
&lt;p&gt;To find the bunnies (stage 1), add the result
that you calculated above to each of the following
numbers and then convert them into coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;258721 &amp; 6190028&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://nmgeocaching.com/check.php?code=75bcce709db69752a189c4e291e2e0e1&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=GCZJCP&amp;amp;name=Where%27s+Bouncy+Bunny+5%3A+Hiding+in+Rolling+Meadows&quot;&gt;
Click here to check your answer for Stage
1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have found the group of bunnies at stage
1, which you calculated above, take note of the value
written\etched inside\below the bunnies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the value obtained above
and then multiply this by the amount of bunnies that you
found at stage 1 above. &lt;/p&gt;






 
&lt;p&gt;To find the final location of this cache, add the
result that you calculated above to each of the
following numbers and then convert them into coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4336061 &amp; 7953078&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now go find the cache and enjoy the walk along
the trail.&lt;/p&gt;

Cache is wedged into the branches of a very green tree. It can most likely be seen from the trail by passer-bys if they are paying attention. I wonder if anyone will discover it and sign the log.

This is a pickle jar filled with some games.

Closeby parking can be found at the end of Ann St and then a short walk along the rail trail (passing by 2 other older caches) and then branch off to a smaller less travelled trail.

I don't think I can make it much simpler.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;strong&gt;All caches in this series are located along the 47.9 km stretch of the Toronto section of the Bruce Trail. Each cache is a standalone micro cache. There will also be 2 final regular size multi-caches in this series in which you will need to collect the clues found within each of the 5 mirco film containers to find these 2 multi caches. There will also be a bonus cache!&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: March 25, 2003:&lt;/strong&gt; The cache as been replaced and put into a new hiding spot just a little further along the trail. It is now located at the following coordinates:&lt;br/&gt;
N43° 39.676&lt;br/&gt;
W79° 54.391&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each cache is very well hidden and will take you through some interesting points on the trail, many of which I am just discovering now as I place these caches. Since these are micro caches, it could potentially be difficult to find, and hence I will be rating the difficulty a 3 on all of them. My 5 year old son chose each of the hiding spaces himself and then we concealed it well. However, since you are taking the trouble to find these caches, the hint will tell you exactly where the cache is hidden, just in case you get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have written a letter in coloured marker on the inside of the each lid and also on both sides of the log sheets. When you find the cache and if you want to attempt the 2 multi-caches, make sure you take note of what the letter is and what colour it is written in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring your own pen/pencil to sign the log.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

Safest spot is at the side of the road on top of the hill. Although we parked on the shoulder by the bridge, I would not recommend it. 
Walk to the bridge and then down towards the river. On your left you will see the Credit Valley Footpath Side Trail (blue blazes) access point which takes you up some steps up the hill...that is the way to go. Also check out the dam by the river towards your right.</groundspeak:long_description>

nearest path.&lt;/strong&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Located in Glen Williams on a Halton Hills Trail. I discovered
this trail while driving by a couple weeks ago and took the time
today to check it out and hopefully bring others to this trail too.
Trail entrance sign is at N 43° 39.709 W 079° 56.070 on Wildwood Rd
and makes for a nice short hike. You can also park at the end of
Ann St.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is now a smaller camoflaged container with the usual
goodies. Please make sure you cover the cache well again. After you
find this cache, head towards the moundy field in the East and
check out the views (I would have liked to place it closer to this
field, but there just wasn't a suitable hiding spot)...you probably
want to head in that general direction afterwards anyways...HINT,
HINT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun and enjoy this trail and the area. We had a fun day in
hiding this cache.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Your entire journey of this 6 part series will take you on a 4.7km

the entire loop of the Great Esker Side Trail of the Bruce
Trail.&lt;br/&gt;

Read the entire cache page to get the necessary information for
finding this Letterbox.&lt;/strong&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The posted coordinates are not the location of the Letterbox,
but within about 20 meters. The posted coordinates is the point on
the trail (also possibly marked by a red piece of yarn) where you
would turn 90 degrees to your &lt;strong&gt;RIGHT&lt;/strong&gt; and leave the
trail in a perpendicular direction from the trail.&lt;br/&gt;
**Letterbox is in on the ground in the small open area.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Continued from 
GEST 3: As I walk through the Valley of Death &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Ah, this is much better now.
Such a lovely place I think to myself. The trees seem forever
green. Although it’s a nice pleasant day, I think of how this
place would look like in the winter, with sheets of snow draped
over everything. Even Santa Claus could call this place home. But I
am abruptly removed from my thoughts of peacefulness by a jab in my
side, as if being poked by a cane. I look around, but I am the only
one here. I take a couple more steps and feeling that poking
sensation again. I certainly can’t be going crazy yet, but
once again I feel some sort of presence around me.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I see some movement out of the corner of my eye. Who’s there?
No one answers. Once again I get poked. What is going on here? I
thought I see an old lady hiding in the pines so I go to
investigate. I enter a clearing and begin to get poked several
times and I again see a glimpse of an old and frail looking lady,
but she keeps disappearing. And once again with the pokes and jabs.
Ok, that is quite enough, lady, please go on your way as you are
really beginning to bug me. I hear a taunting cackle through the
wind. The wind picks up and the trees start to rattle. Maybe it is
I that should be one my way.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Additional Information about this series:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Each Letterbox contains a stamp, marker and log/stamp book. You
can use the marker to colour the stamp or bring your own ink pad.
Stamp the log book with your personal stamp. Stamp your personal
stampbook with the stamp from the Letterbox. Bring your own writing
instrument if you want to write any additional information in the
log. DO NOT take the stamp.&lt;br/&gt;
--All containers are 500 ml or 1 litre jars.&lt;br/&gt;
--As always, hint is very specific, so only decrypt it if you are
having trouble finding the Letterbox.&lt;br/&gt;
--Please make sure the container is COMPLETELY hidden and standing
upright when replacing it.&lt;br/&gt;

GEST 2: Follow That Esker&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Finally I get to walk down
hill. Boy does this ever descend quite deep. Down, down, down I go.
And it starts getting a little creepy down here. I would certainly
hate to be here alone in the middle of the night. My heart is
pounding, but is it from the eerie feeling I am having, or just
from the descent into the valley, or maybe I am just getting a bit
hungry. I need to sit down somewhere and rest. I sit there
contemplating about what has taken place so far. Although I didn’t
start out the day alone, I am alone now, but yet again I feel as if
I am not alone. Have you ever been alone and yet not alone? It sure
can be lonely.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Ok, snap out of it. I better get moving again. This place is just
a bit too creepy. I continue walking and walking, but I get this
strange feeling that I have passed this peculiar looking tree a few
times already, and there it is again. Ok, this time I mark it and
continue on. Oh no, there is the tree again and it has my marking
on it. It certainly doesn’t feel like I have been walking in
circles, but yet I keep encountering the same tree and I am still
in this valley. I hear a noise and turn to my left to look. I don’t
like what I see and start to run as fast as I can and then with a
big leap of faith I begin to see what appears to be sunlight
shining down ahead, so I proceed.&lt;br/&gt;

      Letterboxes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Your entire journey of this 6 part series will take you on a 4.7km
hike. Find the Letterboxes in order, which will allow you to hike
the entire loop of the Great Esker Side Trail of the Bruce
Trail.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Parking and trailhead can be found at:&lt;br/&gt;
N43 40.786 W79 57.989&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Read the entire cache page to get the necessary information for
finding this Letterbox.&lt;/strong&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The posted coordinates are not the location of the Letterbox,
but within about 20 meters. The posted coordinates is the point on
the trail (also possibly marked by a red piece of yarn) where you
would turn 90 degrees to your &lt;strong&gt;RIGHT&lt;/strong&gt; and leave the
trail in a perpendicular direction from the trail.&lt;br/&gt;
 **Letterbox is under a rock wall very close to the trail.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Continued from 
GEST 4: Hey Lady, Don't Bug Me! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You know what they say, looks
can be deceiving. I just left a place that looked quite peaceful
and beautiful, but yet I know I was not alone and something just
did not feel right about being there. As I walk for what seems
several more hours I come upon 2 very interesting and yet ominous
looking trees that seem to be watching me. I turn around for a
quick look, but I don’t stay around here long. I thought those
trees were weird, but now I come across an even stranger part of a
tree, in quite an unexpected area. I examine it much closer as it
has caught my interest. Has this tree done something wrong for
mother nature to give it such a deformity I wonder.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Then it happens, as if being pushed, I plummet into a rocky pit.
With stone walls all around me, I wonder how I will ever get out of
here. I turn around and find what appears to be, well, a strange
cylindrical shaped metallic object. This certainly has no place
being here, but then again, neither do I. I contemplate on how to
get out of here. I try to climb, but just can’t quite make it. Ah,
a wooden pole. I didn’t see that here before. The pole appears
positioned just right to get out of here. I hear the flutter of
bats nearby and they appear to becoming closer, so I make my way up
the wooden pole and out of my temporary prison.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;i&gt;The active caches in this series (more to follow)&lt;/i&gt; 

&lt;br/&gt;
If you are an amateur radio operator, each cache contains the
callsign and frequency of a repeater that can be heard from the
cache area, so you can chat with some of the local hams on your way
back to the car, or on your way to the next cache. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There is a code word and repeater call sign on the first page of
the log book. Save this information if you want to go for the final
later. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Bring a writing instrument (pen, pencil) as the geocache container
does not have one inside. This cache may not be easily accessible
if there is a lot of deep snow in the area. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Park at 43 40.667 / 079 59.301&lt;br/&gt;
If you look up the hill from the parking, you will see the repeater
site for the Halton Hills area. Follow the Bruce Trail to access
the geocache. The cache is within a few metres of the trail. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Radio Spectrum Services Center is within 10 kilometers (at 43
39.239 / 080 03.618 ), on 32 sideroad. This is one of the places
that Industry Canada uses to monitor radio frequency use in the
Greater Toronto Area. I guarantee they can hear that conversation
you just had on FRS channel 2, but they probably didn't pay any
attention to it. &lt;br/&gt;

GEST 1: Who Let You Drive?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As I leave the car behind and
hope it doesn’t fall to the same fate as the near by bucket of
rust, I journey up to what seems like the top of the world and
along the great esker. Now I hope you do know what an esker is,
don’t you? Well, in case you don’t, it is a long narrow ridge of
sand and gravel deposited by glacial meltwaters. Wow, that sure is
a long way down and would make for a great place to go sledding, if
it wasn’t for all of the trees on the side. Not every day you get
to see, let alone walk, an esker. I can only imagine the incredible
length of time it took to form such a geological feature.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I even wondered that maybe there would be some fossils of
prehistoric wildlife buried deep in here somewhere. Wouldn’t that
be incredible to find. One never knows the things that are so close
to us and that we walk by every day, but yet our eyes and our minds
just don’t see it. I better be careful around here, as I sure do
get a sense that I am not alone. It’s just a weird feeling that I
get as I walk along the top of the esker. Perhaps there are
mystical creatures watching me and maybe they are the ones that
caused that other car to wind up where it was. This trail just has
to lead somewhere. It’s already felt like I have walked
forever.&lt;br/&gt;

Keith and Jimmy took the brunt on this one. Cleverly hidden - stickered and stamped the logbook again. I think Jimmy wants some stickers now.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;strong&gt;1st in a series of 6
      Letterboxes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Your entire journey of this 6 part series will take you on a 4.7km
hike. Find the Letterboxes in order, which will allow you to hike
the entire loop of the Great Esker Side Trail of the Bruce
Trail.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Parking and trailhead can be found at:&lt;br/&gt;
N43 40.786 W79 57.989&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Read the entire cache page to get the necessary information for
finding this Letterbox.&lt;/strong&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The posted coordinates are not the location of the Letterbox,
but within about 20 meters. The posted coordinates is the point on
the trail (also possibly marked by a red piece of yarn) where you
would turn 90 degrees to your &lt;strong&gt;LEFT&lt;/strong&gt; and leave the
trail in a perpendicular direction from the trail.&lt;br/&gt;
 **Letterbox is in something that doesn't belong here.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Now look what you’ve done!
Why did I ever agree to let you drive? We were doing just fine
driving along the road. Nowhere did I say that you should turn in
here. You think this is a road for cars? See that’s why there were
a bunch of big rocks blocking the entrance, to keep cars out. Now
we’ll be stuck here forever or perhaps even longer. Cars were built
to drive on roads. Tell you what, since you got us into this fine
mess, how about you go for a walk and find help, while I wait here
by the car. But don’t take too long, ok? Are you listening to me?
Now get moving. You better be quick about it too.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Somehow, I think I have been abandoned, along with what’s left of
the car. I don’t know how much longer I can wait for help to
arrive. This certainly wasn’t how I expected to spend my time.
Perhaps I should go and see if I can find help myself. But there
are so many different ways to go, and the area seems so big. What
happens if I get lost? Then again, I already feel lost being here
all by myself. I could just start walking and see where I end up.
Or I could wait longer. Nah, I’ve waited long enough, time to see
what lies in store for me. I am sure the car will be safe. Oh,
there’s another car. I wonder what happened to the people who owned
that car. Perhaps they made the mistake I did and let someone else
drive.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Continue on to GEST 2: Follow That Esker &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Additional Information about this series:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Each Letterbox contains a stamp, marker and log/stamp book. You
can use the marker to colour the stamp or bring your own ink pad.
Stamp the log book with your personal stamp. Stamp your personal
stampbook with the stamp from the Letterbox. Bring your own writing
instrument if you want to write any additional information in the
log. DO NOT take the stamp.&lt;br/&gt;
--All containers are 500 ml or 1 litre jars.&lt;br/&gt;
--As always, hint is very specific, so only decrypt it if you are
having trouble finding the Letterbox.&lt;br/&gt;
--Please make sure the container is COMPLETELY hidden and standing

&lt;p&gt;Continued from 
GEST 5: Entrapment &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As I continue along I wonder
if I will ever find my way out of here. I come across a swamp with
several platforms winding its way along and as I step on the
platform, I feel it teeter to one side. Every step I take is a
careful one, so as not to fall in, as I don’t know and
certainly don’t want to find out what is lurking in the swamp
beneath me. I just want to make it out of here as fast as possible
and that is exactly what I do. I manage to reach and area where I
am now feeling completely safe and secure, without any sensations
of anyone else close to me. This time I am alone and am glad to be
that way. Sometimes loneliness can be a blessing.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I think I am home free now and certainly will find my way to
civilization once again. But that doesn’t last, as soon after
I am feeling a strange pulling to my right and am pulled off the
path of safety. Although I know I should not go this way, I feel
that I must. I start to see something familiar in the distance.
Could it be? Yes it is the spot where I abandoned the car and
started my journey. But how could it be that I wind up in this spot
again, as I have walked miles and miles for hours on end and here I
am. I walk a bit further and what do I see? Yes, someone seems to
have been by in my absence and has provided help with the car. I
hop in and try the key. It starts! As I drive off I look in my
mirror and I can not believe what I see.&lt;/p&gt;

Large ammo box hidden along the Bruce Trail. I discovered this location during the 52.3km Bruce Trail hike event that I hosted back on April 6th.

Not all caches are for everyone and this is probably one of them. Some random thoughts about this cache:

--Cache is probably more kid friendly than adult friendly.
--I don't recommend you do this cache alone.
--A cell phone might come in handy if you get yourself in trouble.
--It was an equal 50/50 effort between myself and my son to get this cache placed.
--Although the entire trail is level, it is extremely rocky to hike on it, so wear good shoes. Sandals won't cut it on this trail.
--Cache is just sitting there in the open...sort of. Not covered by anything and you should be able to see it if you look hard enough.
--If you own a BFL, bring it along, it might come in handy.
--2 potential approaches to get to the cache. We only tried one, but we saw the light from both!
--You'll either enjoy this cache a lot, or you will hate us for where we placed it.
--Cache could be VERY difficult to retrieve.
--Cache was hidden today, the first day of fall.

If you are curious as to what you are getting yourself into, ask me or decrypt the following spoiler information. Afterall, I do want you to find it, but don't want to spoil any fun or the challenge either.

We were taking the Bruce Trail route back down to parking, and figured we'd grab a couple caches along the way. Elf and R@inbow were kinda bummed that we couldn't go after some cave caches today, and I was looking at what else was in the area in my iPhone when I found this one... Tunnel? Wait a sec... Woohoo! Elf STOP! (Elf keeps walking, toque is covering ears... ELF STOP!!!) There is a cache on your left! How far? 8 meters... ish. What do you mean &quot;ish&quot;? Well, we get to explore a tunnel! Yay! So Elf grabs Chip the Beaver TB and her headlamp and slides right in, after verifying that there is more room, R@ainbow and Davey Jones follow. Elf found the other end, and then they other 2 return with the cache. Very nice! We made some trades: Dropped off a Compass Rose Geocoin, Fox40 whistle, LED Keychain Light and a Poker Chip Keychain for a Glow Stick and Flashlight. I brought the cache back inside, snapped some photos and made the tight squeeze to enter the cave. Very nice find! Thanks for the great hide, and for making everyone's day!

&lt;p&gt;In the north Atlantic Ocean between Greenland
and Europe there existed the Island of Morovia which was once
filled with much prosperity and riches. Morovia was ruled by a King
and Queen who were very well liked and treated their subjects well.
Many ships from throughout Europe and even the rest of the world
would stop here to load up on supplies and also to trade their
wares. However, not everyone that visited Morovia had the best
intentions. Many lived the pirate's life and heard of the treasures
that could be had on Morovia. The pirate raids on the Island of
Morovia as well as the ships that travelled too and from Morovia
become more and more frequent over time and many residents of both
Morovia and those of the ships that passed through were taken as
slaves by the many pirates that now sailed the seas surrounding
Morovia. In order to protect  their daughter, Princess
Theresa, from harm, the King and Queen sent the young Princess,
along with several trusted followers, west to take refuge in the
new world. This location remained a secret and was only known to
the King and Queen and a few of their most trusted followers. Those
that were taken as slaves by the pirates were able to write 3 digit
numerical codes on the backs of the pirates' treasure chests. When
collected, these codes would help those loyal to the King and Queen
find their way to the new world to live in safety among Princess
Theresa and her people. As a reward for to the first travelers that
make it to the new world to be with Princess Theresa, the King and
Queen have left a special sac of treasure containing coins and
jewelry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to find the location of Princess
Theresa in the new world, you will first need to find all 6 of the
treasure chests that the various pirates have hidden and then do
the following:&lt;br/&gt;
Add up all of the 3 digit numbers you obtained from the open
treasure chests, divide the total by 1000 and add the result to the
following meaningless North Coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;
Add up all of the 3 digit numbers you obtained from the closed
treasure chests, divide the total by 1000 and add the result to the
following meaningless West Coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;

At first I thought we'd be out of luck but then I noticed the entrance was not blocked. It was a bit tight for me to fit, but some work with my hiking stick extended my reach a bit. Great location for the cache, and a great series overall. Thanks for bringing us outside for some great hikes. </groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;100% PURE
EVIL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the 1950s when the former town of Silver
Creek was commissioned for expansion, it was decided to turn 8th
Line into a 2 lane street and use it as a potential future regional
highway to connect Georgetown and Acton. In addition to a regional
highway (now Hwy 7 to the south), the plan was to eventually expand
the town of Silver Creek by subdividing the land for future homes
and also bring in sewage, hydro and phone service. At the time, 8th
Line here was just an old unmaintained road that passed through the
Scottsdale Farm property which was then owned by Stewart and Violet
Bennett. The plans were drawn up and survey work began in the
summer of 1958. On September 16, 1958 documents show that a crew of
4 surveyors were scheduled to work this portion of land here. They
were signed in at the work trailer located within Silver Creek at
the corner of 27th Sideroad and 7th Line (now known as Trafalgar
Rd) at 7am and their supervisor indicated that they had left to
start their work. Previous work logs indicated that they usually
signed back in at the end of their work day at 4pm. By 5pm, the
supervisor was making his rounds to lock up the work trailer and
noticed that the men had not signed in at the end of their shift
and the survey equipment was not at the trailer yet either. He
proceeded to head down 27th Sideroad and over towards 8th Line
where the men were scheduled that day to do their survey work. When
he got there, the survey equipment was all set up still, but no one
was to be seen. Looking around the area, he spotted the men's lunch
boxes at the edge of the drop off, along with the survey book. He
discovered their partially eaten sandwiches and some both half full
and some knocked over cups of coffee and a canteen of water. Down
the hillside from where it appears the 4 men were eating their
lunch, was the work book. He scrambled down and retrieved it. There
were several dozen entries in it for that day with the last one
being at 11:54am. Nothing in the work book indicated anything
unusual for that morning. The supervisor hurried back to the
trailer and contacted the authorities as he knew something was not
right. Together with the police, they went back to the survey point
to look for clues. It was now well into the evening and dark. A
full scale search would commence in the morning if the crew of 4
did not show up in the meantime. Morning arrived and word had
gotten out about the disappearance of the 4 men. Along with both
local and provincial police, fellow workers and also many of the
area residents, a search began of the area. For the next 2 days
they systematically searched the area within a 4km radius and some
points beyond, but there was no sign of the 4 missing workers.
Random searches of the area continued on and off for the next week,
but everyone soon gave up hope. The 4 men simply vanished and were
never heard from again. Police and newspaper reports show their
names as Paul Edwards (age 47) of Hamilton, Udo Volkov (age 39) of
Acton, Roger Ingram (age 35) of Hillsburgh and Eric Lapointe (age
not specified) of Acton. Today they still remain in the Missing
Persons files of the OPP. After the disappearance of the 4 men,
work did not continue in the area and all plans for expansion were
put on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 1966 once again the authorities
were called to the area. Local residents had reported the faint
cries of what sounded like a child in trouble that could be heard
in the still of the night on several occasions. Once again the
police along with area residents combed the area to try and
pinpoint where the cries were coming from. It didn't take long to
narrow down the location of where the sounds were coming from as a
number of local farmers had now also heard the cries and some said
it was laughter and not crying, while yet others said it was
voices. There were no reports of any missing children or persons. A
long narrow shaft was discovered, possibly an old well or some kind
of vent. Several of the people that day indicated that they could
hear voices and murmurs from the shaft that they discovered. The
shaft was large enough for a child to fall into, but for an adult
it would be a very tight fit. The shaft was described as
approximately 1 foot in diameter at its opening and descended deep
into the ground. The searchers, now turned rescuers, called down
into the shaft to the voices they heard, and other than some
murmurs every so often, the sounds from below eventually stopped. A
light was lowered on a rope, but nothing could be made out below. A
camera with lights was also lowered and it was discovered that it
seated itself on a ledge about 80 feet below. The shaft got wider
the deeper it went and there appeared to be a small cavern or cave
like opening just slightly below the ledge. The camera did catch a
quick glimpse of what was thought to be some movement below, but
other than that, there was however no sign of any child. No more
sounds or voices were heard from within the shaft. Concerned, a
young rookie for the OPP by the name George volunteered and
suggested that he was narrow enough that he could be lowered into
the shaft, since whoever was down below might be in some serious
trouble. He put on a climbing harness and was lowered into the
shaft. He had a light and a radio with him so he could report his
finding to the rescuers above. From the ledge he crept into the
cavern opening. He reported that the cave went deeper and there was
nothing unusual. He said he was going to search further along into
the cave, while still being in his harness and attached to the rope
that lowered him. Several moments later from the radio came &quot;Oh my
gosh. There's...oh...Get me out! Quick!&quot; Then the tension on the
rope disappeared. The radio went dead. The horror could be heard in
George's voice which rose through the shaft along with a foul
smell, so bad that one of the rescuers passed out from the stench
and needed oxygen. Rumbling and loud crashing could be heard from
below. The rope was pulled up and the end of it was torn apart and
frayed. Streams of dust came rising up through the shaft.
Immediately they scrambled to lower down the camera again and call
down below. Dust was still in the air within the shaft. This time
however, the camera stopped after only 50 feet or so and didn't go
any further. The lower part of the shaft had collapsed. Heavy
drilling equipment was called in and the next day they tried to
drill into the shaft and also in the surrounding area, but they did
not have a drill that would go down 80 feet or anywhere even close
to that. Whatever happened to George below and what he discovered
would forever remain a mystery. George's apparent death was simply
identified as an unfortunate accident during a rescue mission where
he became trapped and buried when the area around him collapsed. It
was ordered that the shaft be sealed by filling it up with concrete
along with the other holes that were dug. Other than an obituary
for George Caceras indicating that he died in the line of duty,
nothing about the incident made it to print in any of the
papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rupert Liven, a life-long resident of what is
now the town of Halton Hills, is in his late 80s and now living at
the Mountainview Residence family care facility. He first sparked
my interest in the above cases several years ago when I would visit
the local senior's center to help out. I always looked forward to
chatting with Rupert on a Tuesday evening. I would tell him about
my many geocaching adventures and hikes along the Bruce Trail and
what cool places and things I came across. Equally, I enjoyed
listening to all of Rupert's stories about how he worked at
Scottsdale Farm and the many things he experienced in life. His
favourite place to go which he told many what seemed like hundreds
of times, was Snow Falls, which just happens to be down the street
from where this latest geocache is hidden. Snow Falls went under
the road and although small, it was a pretty sight so close to home
and a place I liked to visit myself. I had accidently discovered
Snow Falls (although I didn't know it's name at the time) once
while driving through some out of the way roads perhaps 10 years
ago. I remember stopping here and watching a turtle on the side of
the road. However, since I was new to the area, I did not remember
where this waterfall was and although I tried, I could never find
this waterfall again. It wasn't until geocaching when I was heading
to find a cache that I once again drove by this waterfall and
discovered it once again, but this time I knew had no problem ever
finding it again and know the area well. Now even though I knew
where the waterfall was and would visit it often, I was intrigued
when Rupert told me that there 2 Snow Falls here. 2 waterfalls like
one above the other or one further down stream a bit I asked. No,
that wasn't the case, but instead he told me that the 2nd waterfall
was very close by, but you couldn't see it simply by driving or
walking by. It was hidden as he put it. He knew I liked puzzles and
games and he told me to go stand at the end of 8th Line and open my
ears. I didn't always think he was 100% with it with his age and
all, but I was intrigued and drove out there and did exactly what
he said. I listened closely and sure enough I heard something and I
followed the sound of water to the edge of the road and a few steps
into the tree line and what do I see. Sure enough Rupert was right
and here was a 2nd waterfall, nicely hidden away from passersby.
All these times I drove by here as do hundreds of people, and I
find this neat spot where not many know about. I learned a lot of
neat things about Halton Hills from Rupert over the past couple
years and I never ever again doubted what he said especially since
every time he told me about something around town, it sure enough
was accurate. One of the adventures I told Rupert about my series
of 6 Letterboxes along the Bruce Trail off of 8th Line and how I
hid one in the remains of a car that I found off the trail in the
middle of the woods. I told him I thought it was strange and
wondered how a car got to be here. Rupert knew exactly the car I
was referring to. He leaned forward from his chair and grabbed my
arm...a bit too tight I might add, and told me of how 2 bodies, one
of a man and the other of a woman were found here in their car. He
stared straight into my eyes and said, &quot;It was their bodies! They
had no heads! There were NO heads! Something Evil took place here!&quot;
Wow, I was so stunned I didn't even notice that his grip on my arm
was getting tighter and was beginning to cut off my circulation.
Sure enough when looking up the old newspaper archives at the
library, a small one paragraph tidbit of news mentioned the
discovering of a couple found in their car in the woods. It did not
mention that they were headless though, but I have no reason to
doubt Rupert. The remains of the car is still there today as is my
cache (GCR6QC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime earlier this year I was telling Rupert
about my Cavernous cache not far away. I told him I found an old
Lime Kiln, some other things I found interesting along the way and
most of all, the ladder going down the escarpment and if you walk a
short ways along the side of the escarpment there was a small cave
with a tight fit to get in. I said the walls inside the cave looked
really neat. Guess what Rupert did? Ya, he grabbed my arm again and
held it tight. Oh great, now what I thought. I was beginning to get
real freaked out. Rupert inhaled deeply and looked straight into my
eyes (I hate when he does that) and said, &quot;They found George's head
here.&quot; I had no clue who George was, but I figured it was one of
the 2 decapitated people that was found in the car in the woods
that Rupert had told me about quite awhile ago. Eventually I
realized he wasn't talking about the couple found in the car and
was talking about someone else. &quot;Why do you think the quarry
stopped operating here?&quot; he said. &quot;Did you have a look at the cave
walls?&quot; Well ya I did. &quot;Didn't you notice something unnatural about
the walls...something is not right there. Wall are not like that,&quot;
he exclaimed. Ok I got my arm free from his clutches and got a bit
distracted while trying to get my circulation back. But yes he was
right, I did think the wall of the cave looked somewhat odd. I
remember looking at the wall while I was in the cave. The cave wall
looked just a bit too perfect in my opinion. Rupert started up
again, but I held my arm back so he couldn't grab it this time,
&quot;There was Pure Evil at work here! They found some caves here and
then all of a sudden one day they closed a perfectly good quarry
without a word to anyone. They blasted and sealed the caves shut.
Be careful!&quot; Ok, but I still didn't know who this George's head guy
was. This is when he told me the story of Officer Caceras and how
he bravely went down into a hole in the ground to rescue a child
many decades ago. &quot;He disappeared too. That's his head. They never
found the rest of him,&quot; he exclaimed. I saw him reaching for my
arm. I wish he wouldn't be so grabby. I pulled back again. What do
you mean he too disappeared, I had to ask. Who else disappeared? Of
course I had to ask. That's when Rupert told me about the 4
surveyors that disappeared 50 years ago to this day (today...when I
placed the cache in roughly the same location where they presumably
disappeared). Oh crap, he got a hold of my arm again. The stuff he
shares with me is just so interesting. It's worth it my arm turning
a bit red. So after all this time, no one has ever heard of or seen
any trace of these surveyors. I did find it very strange some of
the things that went on over the years and wondered if there were
any other strange and mysterious occurrences. But unless I
mentioned something that clicked a light bulb on in Rupert's head,
I mostly heard about the wonderful experiences in his life. I knew
when I would click on one of those light bulbs as he would always
grab my arm, but those were few and far between. I went on vacation
for a month this summer and when I came back I went to do my usual
visit to Rupert, but upon arriving the care worker told me that
Rupert had passed away on July 14, 2008. My heart dropped and a
tear flowed from my eye. I sat down where I used to sit when I
visited Rupert. As I was hunched over collecting my thoughts,
another elderly man walked by and whispered into my ear &quot;100% Pure
Evil. Stay away from the pond!&quot; Pond? What Pond? Who was that? I
saw the man turn the corner and I jumped up, tripped and fell flat
on my face. I picked myself up, looked around the corner and down
the hall of rooms, I did not see the man anymore, nor do I know
which room he went into. I lost a good friend in Rupert and I miss
him greatly. But from what all the things he told me, I was able to
do enough research over the past couple months to put this cache
together. I did wonder if these mysterious occurrences and
disappearances that Rupert told me about were connected in some
way. Other than the general area and a couple of similarities,
there was no documented evidence that ever connected these
incidences. Although it still does bother me what was whispered
into my ear by a stranger just a couple months ago and hence the
name for this cache. Please be careful and I don't suggest trying
this cache alone or at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research done from information and documents
obtained from the following sources:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Ministry of Transportation&lt;br/&gt;
Halton Region archives&lt;br/&gt;
Halton Hills Public Library&lt;br/&gt;
Ontario Provincial Police&lt;br/&gt;
Rupert Liven (1921-2008), area resident, friend and former
part-time worker at Scottsdale Farm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache
Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This cache was intentionally made difficult. Expect some head
scratching and frustration. You probably want to give yourself some
time for this cache and also explore the area and many trails
afterwards. You might find some very interesting things hidden away
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When parking,
don't park at the posted coords as it is on a hill and unsafe to
park there. Park at one of the 2 suggested parking waypoints which
both have more than enough room to pull safely off of the gravel
road. Also note that this portion of the road is closed in the
winter so you will have to walk a bit further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk to the
posted coords and find two 4-digit numbers. Once you have found
both of them, subtract the lower number from the higher number,
divide by 1000 and add the result to the following meaningless
coords in order to find the final cache:&lt;br/&gt; N43&lt;b&gt;°&lt;/b&gt;
39.918
W79&lt;b&gt;°&lt;/b&gt;
57.212&lt;br/&gt;
Make sure you find the correct 4-digit numbers. You will know that
you found the correct ones when the difference between the two is
between 1000 and 2000 and the sum of the two is less than
10000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring your own writing instrument to
&quot;sign&quot; the &quot;log&quot;. And please put everything back at both Stage 1
and the final exactly as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;

We got to the first stage and suffered the same &quot;colorado cut the listing short&quot; problem Nozzletime had. So we found what was there and said &quot;Huh!?&quot;. Reading previous logs and Nozzletime's came up. Thank goodness we both carry smartphone devices so we called up the rest of the listing and we were able to continue along. Blew it on finding all the numbers but we made an (incorrect) assumption about something we saw, plugged it in and it took us close enough to find the cache. 

This was an enjoyable cache, and here I was worried the &quot;evil&quot; nearby might try to smite us for having the gall to visit this cache at 10:00pm, in the darkness. </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I'll be back next week to hide an ammo box 500+ meters down the
trail. Read on...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This evening I decided I wanted to go out for a hike. I needed a
hike. I needed some excercise. I've had an ammo box in the car for
several weeks now ready to hide. I've had the spot picked out for 5
months already. I might as well go hide it tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was I thinking. I ventured out alone, it was 8pm and was
dark already. Flashlight in hand I walk down the extemely rocky
trail. I get about 150 meters into the woods and 450 meters from
where I want to hide the cache, and something big moves around in
the bushes 10 meters from me. I shine my flashlight and just see
the bushes moving. I take one more step and come to my senses
wondered how I could be so stupid to go for a hike in the woods in
the dark, alone, on a trail I have only been on once before. As I
am about to hit the trailhead where I parked, I see the perfect
hiding spot for a cache. Ammo can won't fit, so I dig in my
backpack for another cache container which fits perfectly...except
that when I am about to place it, a car pulls up on the deserted
out of the way road and parks 30 meters behind my car. People get
out, they do something. I decided to forget about the car and go
back to the car. I am scared enough being all alone in the woods
right now. Back in my car, I turn the engine on and wait. The car
behind me obviously notices and drives away, but then stops about
100m in front of where I am parked and once again they do their
thing for a minute, then turn around and drive back the other way
and park around the corner as I could see their headlights through
the trees. Ok I might as well place the cache, so back into the
edge of the woods I go and hide this one and then back to the car
and home I go. Once again I see the car on the side of the road in
a different spot. But I ain't going to stick around to find out
what they are up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, with this, starts a new series. The type of caches most
people really enjoy even if they don't admit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Cache Spew ('spyü) series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
It is obvious that most cachers prefer the quick caches, whether
they be drivebys or perhaps only a 100m hike. If you like these
quick and easy caches, then you'll love this series. There are so
many caches out there now that you can pick and choose which caches
you want to find and just pass these caches by if they do not
appeal to you. But most people like them, so please respect their
decision to find these. Please bring your own pen\pencil to sign
the log. If you would like to Spew a Cache too and be part of this
series just place your cache, let me know and I will assign the
next sequential number in this series to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly...HAVE FUN!&lt;/p&gt;

Found the cache without much difficulty.  Keith bonked his head ducking under a fallen tree on the way back.  He didn't see the second fallen tree right after it.  He ended up with just a bump so it wasn't that bad.

At first we were worried we wouldn't be able to find it because of the ice and snow.  After carefully walking to the spot over the ice in the dark we managed to find it.

Spent some time after taking some photographs of the ice formations near the cache.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Captain George Booth&lt;/b&gt; operated mostly in
the Indian Ocean and Red Sea about the &lt;i&gt;Speaker&lt;/i&gt;, until he got
word of the many riches that Morovia had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This series consists of 7 caches. You will need to find the 6
treasure chests that have been hidden by these famous pirates and
collect the required information in order to find the secret
location of where Princess Theresa has taken refuge. Before
attempting any cache in this series, you should refer to Pirates
of Morovia - Princess Theresa (Final) for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each cache location you will find a treasure
chest. Engraved on the back of each treasure chest is a 3 digit
number which you should take note of. Also take note on whether the
treasure chest is open or closed. Do not remove the treasure chest
playing piece from the cache. For some added fun, when you log your
finds on this series, why not give your character a name and give
details of your character's journey throughout the area of Morovia
as you try to locate all of the chests that the 6 pirates have
hidden. The Princess likes stories and may have extra rewards
available for those that tell her the tales of their heroic
journeys. The Princess however does not understand pirate speak,
but she is very fluent in miffer speak, which is a common dialect
that is communicated among the people of Morovia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treasure chest is open and has a code of
135&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>From the main Bruce Trail, walk through the rock corridor. Cache is in a cavity on the right wall, maybe a few feet from where it ends. About four or five feet up. There's a couple of small rocks in front of the cache.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

This cache is located along one of my favourite places to hike -- particularly in autumn -- and today was definitely the day to visit. The fall colour here is simply splendid. I spent a fair amount of time wandering around with the camera before returning to the car. Had a good chuckle when I saw that the BFL Flush Mob sign from last year's BFL Event was still here, even though the outhouse had been replaced. I removed the sign for postierer-ity.  </groundspeak:text>

of the famous Mount Pleasant Cemetery. There are many prominent
figures buried here along with many interesting monuments. This
multicache will show you just a small handful of them which we
found of interest. There are many more familiar and prominent names
if you take the time to look around. Allow yourself at least a few
hours to complete this multicache. We used the book &quot;Mount Pleasant
Cemetery - An Illustrated Guide&quot; as a reference as we toured the
cemetery while creating this cache. Also note that photography is
not allowed within Mount Pleasant Cemetery. If anyone knows or
figures out why, we would be curious to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer each one of the questions below and enter the appropriate
North and\or West value into the appropriate columns as indicated
on the chart.&lt;br/&gt;
Example: If  it says (N:200) beside an answer that you choose,

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Please don't commit suicide while trying to find this cache.

There have been a number of caches located at the Scarborough Bluffs, but none of them have survived for too long. So this is my shot at placing a cache that will hopefully survive. I was going to hide a micro somewhere around here, but when I looked in the trunk of my car, I realized that I took them out last night at grandma's house. So all I had was this cache that has been sitting in the trunk of my car for over 5 months that some friends of my son put together and wanted to hide, but never got around to it, so I am claiming it now.

It is neither on top of, nor on the bottom of the bluffs...oh! oh!

However, approach from the top and follow the path part of the way down. Hey, atleast I hid it near a path, and my 7 year old son followed me.

Don't attempt this cache when it has been raining or snowing or if the path appears to be wet or slippery.

If you feel like committing suicide, then go right ahead. There's lots of places that this can be done from.

Lastly, you assume all risks in finding this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>As you walk DOWN the cliff along the path, the cache is a few meters to the left of the path, seated nicely in a hollow tree trunk.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Travel Bugs and other guests will be meeting at the &lt;strong&gt;Walking Fern Resort&lt;/strong&gt; to discuss the state of geocaching and ways to improve it! Since Travel Bugs are all really stuck up and snobbish due to their elite status, they do not drive themselves, so they need a chauffeur to drive them to their next destination. Please help them along, but they like to travel alone...&lt;strong&gt;so please only TAKE 1 Travel Bug!&lt;/strong&gt; (This will allow others to have the excitement of finding Travel Bugs too...feel free to log all travel bugs as notes though). Thank you for your cooperation,

THE MANAGEMENT!

&lt;p&gt;The executive parking lot can be found at N 43° 42.584 W 079° 57.773. The Walking Fern Resort is approximately half way down the 1km trail (But GPS says it's only 400m from parking...straight line). Looks like the management will go to any expense to keep away the undesirables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first set of elite Travel Bug guests of the Walking Fern Resort are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Agent Skully&lt;/strong&gt; - She wants to return to Oregon by December, 2003.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Identity Crisis Travel Bug&lt;/strong&gt; - He is always travelling in disguise and is never the same bug twice.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Papa Bear&lt;/strong&gt; - He misses Mama Bear a lot and is looking to get reunited with her.&lt;br/&gt;
And lastly there are a handful of other non-elite guests that have survived the raid of the old Walking Fern Hotel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Also, the management strongly recommends hiking to the end of the trail, since you are already half way there...it is well worth it. Also feel free to come back often as in each season the area looks so different...hard to believe! It's like God gives it a makeover every few months!

The resort is a 2 gallon round white bucket. It is well hidden, but yet not covered at all...hmmm. Flashlight is strongly recommended and if you are standing in the right spot, you should be able to see part of it. &lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; Be very careful near the resort site as there is a fairly large loose moss covered boulder here! Please return the resort in exactly the same place and orientation as you found it.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Resort is 10 meters up the hillside from a large hollow stump that sits along the trail. You will have to reach in with half your body to get/see it within the largest opening in the rocks.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

When you face in the rocks (in the direction of the trail) you will see a large slanted rock slab at about a 30 degree angle...go up that and then stand in front of the slab a few feet to your left. Bend down and look into the small cave (under another very large rock slab) that goes about 4-5 feet in towards the right a bit and there you will find the cache.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Cache is very well hidden along a beautiful area of the Bruce Trail. Take the time to enjoy the view from the top too.

The trail access is off of 10th Line, and there is more than enough parking (N 43° 42.584 W 079° 57.773) there. Take the main trail (white blazes) as opposed to the Walking Fern side trail. Follow the trail up the steps, over the bridge and up the hill.

Cache contains the usual assortment of trinkets, in addition to a nice leather key holder.

</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>In an opening of a knee high hill consisting of many rocks. Hidden at ground level. About 10 meters from the trail (guess). You might have to move a rock that covers part of the hiding spot. You will have to reach in to your elbow to get it.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Walk a short distance along the road (along the fenceline, facing traffic of course) until you see the Main Bruce Trail entrance and head down the steps and along the trail towards the cache.

Painted small size season salt container. Will only hold small trading items, but the real prize here is the little undocumented waterfall at this location. We discovered this waterfall last week to our surprise, while hiking here for the first time.

Stand on the bridge and look down to see it, or cross the bridge and get a better view from the side. Careful you don't fall in when standing on the bridge.

...It gets better...stay tuned!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This very special tree contains a geocache somewhere hidden in it.
The tree is located in an enchanted forest. Legend says that this
tree used to be a mean old ogre who roamed these lands. One day he
encountered a mystical beast. He was mean to the beast so the beast
turned him into a tree, but not just any tree. As you wander
through the enchanted forest you will know right away when you see
the tree that you seek.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A letterbox cache located on the Vaughn Trail in Terra Cotta Conservation Area.

See the Additional Waypoints on the cache page for alternate approaches and to enter the conservation area for free.

This is a letterbox cache, please DON'T take or trade the stamp out.

Now that I am almost 9 months old, mommy and daddy figured it was time for me to hide my own cache, so....

My mommy has a cache in Terra Cotta called Lisa's Lost Lunch and she carved a stamp for me as a companion to that cache.

This cache contains a hand-carved stamp, a log book, a stamp pad and a pencil.

Please stamp this hand-carved stamp into your letterbox book and add your own stamp to the logbook inside the cache. If you do not have a stamp, just draw a little something and sign your name. Enjoy!

As you walk along the Vaughn Trail, you will soon see a wise old monster. Not Cookie Monster or Grover but rather an Ent. He is holding the cache for me.

He is about 30 mommy steps or 30 baby crawls from the trail. </groundspeak:long_description>

located along the Caledon Trailway. Bring your own writing
instrument. At the posted coordinates you will find a stone
indicating the start of the Caledon Trailway. There are 6 numeric

&lt;h3&gt;North America&lt;br/&gt;
There are currently 23 countries
within North America. North America, which covers the landmass
north of the Panama-Colombia border, and the islands of the
Caribbean. North America is the northern continent of the Americas,
situated in the Earth's northern hemisphere and almost totally in
the western hemisphere. It is bordered on the north by the Arctic
Ocean, on the east by the North Atlantic Ocean, on the southeast by
the Caribbean Sea, and on the west by the North Pacific Ocean;
South America lies to the southeast.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Caledon Trailway&lt;br/&gt;
The Trailway follows the path of
an abandoned rail line that once linked Hamilton with Barrie. The
Town of Caledon purchased 35 km of rail section in 1989 and it
became the first officially designated portion of the Trans Canada
Trail in 1995. The first Trans Canada Trail Pavilion in the
country was built in Caledon East in 1996. This is a multi-use
trail, ideal for walking, geocaching, cycling, horseback riding,
and cross-country skiing in winter.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Stage 1&lt;/b&gt; (N43 42.937 W79 57.537) - Bridge (Posted

divide the amount by 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stage 2&lt;/b&gt; (N43 42.899 W79 57.463) - Bridge&lt;br/&gt;

The yellow number on the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Final&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
To figure out the location of the cache, take only the smallest
number that you got from the stages above. Multiply this number by
10 and add it to both the north and west of the following

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The entire area was once part of a warm, shallow sea. Far to the southeast, a mountain range the size of the Himalayas was building, and rivers from these mountains were sending red, iron-rich sediment from the mountains into the seas, forming a large, muddy delta. The sea was teaming with life, but on land, no plants or animals had yet developed.

Here you will find the formation of Queenston Shale which is a very soft rock, in comparison to the harder sandstone, limestone and dolostone that make up the rest of the Niagara Escarpment. Erosion of the shale can occur rapidly if layers of other rock or vegetation are removed, and particularly if the area is impacted by grazing and large number of people. As the protective layer of vegetation was removed and the shale began to erode, erosion of the area has continued to its present-day state. This type of topography is rare in Ontario because in most areas the shale is protected from erosion by overlying hard rock (limestone, dolostone or sandstone), sand or gravel. 

The erosion and emergence of &quot;red soil&quot; that you see here is happening rather rapidly. Even just as recently as 4 years ago there was only a couple portions visible along this 500m stretch of road, but now as time goes on you will see more and more sections of the &quot;red soil&quot; magically appearing. If you are familiar with the area you will even notice some efforts have been made to deter some of this erosion that is taking place. 

Cache is magnetically attached to the inside of the culvert.</groundspeak:long_description>

We measured 278M of erosion/badland. 
We found 5 sections ... 4 if you remove the driveway that bisects the last one.

The northerly exposed sections are smaller...as small as 20-25m, with the longest one being the most southerly one. 5 sections, and close to 300m sounds about right to me.

Keith Watson and Kitten on the Hunt were my willing partners on this hunt. Got to the cache and found it after a few minutes of searching - got to try my new mini-BFL flashlight out. 14 LEDs throw out a ton of light :). On to the block of wood - this was Kitten's find as I was literally searching in the wrong area. Before moving, we calculate the information for the final -- just in case we're 100 feet from it. Nope ... back to the car. Madness ensues as we literally spend the next 800 metres of walking trying different methods of teasing each other. There's the turn the lights off and duck into the woods (cue: Kitten laughing hysterically ).... there's the toss a stick up the trail and act like an animal is coming (cue: Kitten laughing again)... shake a tree nearby and watch Kitten jump... then laugh again. On and on we all took turns making this quite the fun walk. I don't know if Kitten has any more laughing left in her! (Did I mention it's midnight?)</groundspeak:text>

The geocache is hidden very well and the hint is very specific. Please make sure you hide it well so no one can see it as they are climbing around on the rocks.

I won this Ammo Box filled with goodies at the first event that I attended last year. I was only 1 month old at the time, but now that I have 8.5 months old my parents took me out to help me hide it and I thought it would be neat if I hid it for their event which celebrates 10 Years of Geocaching.

The geocache is hidden very well and the hint is very specific. Please make sure you hide it well so no one can see it as they are climbing around on the rocks.

A special something has been included in the cache for the first person to find it during the event on May 1st. If you bring the prize card to me or my parents during the event, we will give you the item as a reward.

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Go to the SE side of the rock area. Here you will see a very large angled slab of rock about 3m long. Go to the top of the slab and then step down to a small area. In front of you is a short wall with a couple small maple trees growing out the top. Bend down and reach to your right into the crevice along this rock wall. </groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;h3&gt;North America&lt;br/&gt;
There are currently 23 countries
within North America. North America, which covers the landmass
north of the Panama-Colombia border, and the islands of the
Caribbean. North America is the northern continent of the Americas,
situated in the Earth's northern hemisphere and almost totally in
the western hemisphere. It is bordered on the north by the Arctic
Ocean, on the east by the North Atlantic Ocean, on the southeast by
the Caribbean Sea, and on the west by the North Pacific Ocean;
South America lies to the southeast.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Caledon Trailway&lt;br/&gt;
The Trailway follows the path of
an abandoned rail line that once linked Hamilton with Barrie. The
Town of Caledon purchased 35 km of rail section in 1989 and it
became the first officially designated portion of the Trans Canada
Trail in 1995. The first Trans Canada Trail Pavilion in the
country was built in Caledon East in 1996. This is a multi-use
trail, ideal for walking, geocaching, cycling, horseback riding,
and cross-country skiing in winter.&lt;/h3&gt;

While out with the CO doing some challenging caches, I never took a close look at the D/T combos of the caches we were attempting, until near the end of the day, and as we headed to Puslinch Lake, I realized the last cache of the day was the one I needed.... a nice surprise to end a fun day. A kilometre in an inflatable boat in the dark, climbing trees and a brutal bushwack... what a great way to complete this challenge. We enjoyed so many awesome places and experiences trying to complete this challenge. 

Only 7 more to go for the double now.....!

&lt;h3&gt;North America&lt;br/&gt;
There are currently 23 countries
within North America. North America, which covers the landmass
north of the Panama-Colombia border, and the islands of the
Caribbean. North America is the northern continent of the Americas,
situated in the Earth's northern hemisphere and almost totally in
the western hemisphere. It is bordered on the north by the Arctic
Ocean, on the east by the North Atlantic Ocean, on the southeast by
the Caribbean Sea, and on the west by the North Pacific Ocean;
South America lies to the southeast.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Caledon Trailway&lt;br/&gt;
The Trailway follows the path of
an abandoned rail line that once linked Hamilton with Barrie. The
Town of Caledon purchased 35 km of rail section in 1989 and it
became the first officially designated portion of the Trans Canada
Trail in 1995. The first Trans Canada Trail Pavilion in the
country was built in Caledon East in 1996. This is a multi-use
trail, ideal for walking, geocaching, cycling, horseback riding,
and cross-country skiing in winter.&lt;/h3&gt;

If you come during the springtime you will have the chance to see the tadpoles swimming around in the lake and see the various stages as they develop into frogs. The tadpoles are a few inches in size and there's lots of them.

At the posted coords you will find a sign. Up to how many years will the plastic sheets be in place covering the ground? Assign this number to X. In order to find the location of the cache, multiply X by 10 and add your result to these meaningless coords:
N43 43.257 W79 57.784

This cache was placed for our &quot;10 Years! Terra Cotta, Ontario&quot; event which celebrates 10 years since geocaching started.

Enjoy a walk through the wetlands of Terra Cotta and learn a bit about its history too.



Each of the stages is an information sign, so you can just walk around the wetlands to each of the signs to get the necessary information.

Stage 1 - N43 43.430 W79 57.408
How many acres was the pool?

Stage 2 - N43 43.428 W79 57.389
What number appears in the heading &quot;Touching ___ Worlds&quot;?

Stage 3 - N43 43.441 W79 57.348
What percentage of its original wetlands has southern Ontario lost?

In order to find the cache, take the 3 numbers you found at the 3 stages and multiply them together, divide by 1000 and add them to the following meaningless coords:
N43 43.329 W79 57.256

&lt;h3&gt;North America&lt;br/&gt;
There are currently 23 countries
within North America. North America, which covers the landmass
north of the Panama-Colombia border, and the islands of the
Caribbean. North America is the northern continent of the Americas,
situated in the Earth's northern hemisphere and almost totally in
the western hemisphere. It is bordered on the north by the Arctic
Ocean, on the east by the North Atlantic Ocean, on the southeast by
the Caribbean Sea, and on the west by the North Pacific Ocean;
South America lies to the southeast.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Caledon Trailway&lt;br/&gt;
The Trailway follows the path of
an abandoned rail line that once linked Hamilton with Barrie. The
Town of Caledon purchased 35 km of rail section in 1989 and it
became the first officially designated portion of the Trans Canada
Trail in 1995. The first Trans Canada Trail Pavilion in the
country was built in Caledon East in 1996. This is a multi-use
trail, ideal for walking, geocaching, cycling, horseback riding,
and cross-country skiing in winter.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
Christmas is upon us, and what better way to enjoy it, than a nice
walk through a winter wonderland.


Best time to see the beauty of the area, is after a fresh snowfall.
You are looking for a Christmas tree decorated with many and
various types of ornaments...some are even hand painted by us. Feel
free to trade ornaments for ornaments or simply add your own
ornaments to this special tree. There's also a fairly heavy
&quot;wrapped present&quot; under the tree for anyone that wants to take
it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Log book is in a micro container also hanging in the tree.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Trail entrance with lots of room for roadside parking can be found
at:&lt;br/&gt;
N43 43.598&lt;br/&gt;
W79 57.496&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>From the birdhouse in the small clearing, head towards where the hill starts to slope down slightly and then look to your right and you should see the eight foot high (at time of placement) Christmas Tree, which is about half the size of most other trees in the area.

Micro container with the log is hanging about chest high in the tree.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;h3&gt;North America&lt;br/&gt;
There are currently 23 countries
within North America. North America, which covers the landmass
north of the Panama-Colombia border, and the islands of the
Caribbean. North America is the northern continent of the Americas,
situated in the Earth's northern hemisphere and almost totally in
the western hemisphere. It is bordered on the north by the Arctic
Ocean, on the east by the North Atlantic Ocean, on the southeast by
the Caribbean Sea, and on the west by the North Pacific Ocean;
South America lies to the southeast.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Caledon Trailway&lt;br/&gt;
The Trailway follows the path of
an abandoned rail line that once linked Hamilton with Barrie. The
Town of Caledon purchased 35 km of rail section in 1989 and it
became the first officially designated portion of the Trans Canada
Trail in 1995. The first Trans Canada Trail Pavilion in the
country was built in Caledon East in 1996. This is a multi-use
trail, ideal for walking, geocaching, cycling, horseback riding,
and cross-country skiing in winter.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cuba &lt;b&gt;-&lt;/b&gt; 3&lt;b&gt;3 active geocaches as of

&lt;h3&gt;North America&lt;br/&gt;
There are currently 23 countries
within North America. North America, which covers the landmass
north of the Panama-Colombia border, and the islands of the
Caribbean. North America is the northern continent of the Americas,
situated in the Earth's northern hemisphere and almost totally in
the western hemisphere. It is bordered on the north by the Arctic
Ocean, on the east by the North Atlantic Ocean, on the southeast by
the Caribbean Sea, and on the west by the North Pacific Ocean;
South America lies to the southeast.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Caledon Trailway&lt;br/&gt;
The Trailway follows the path of
an abandoned rail line that once linked Hamilton with Barrie. The
Town of Caledon purchased 35 km of rail section in 1989 and it
became the first officially designated portion of the Trans Canada
Trail in 1995. The first Trans Canada Trail Pavilion in the
country was built in Caledon East in 1996. This is a multi-use
trail, ideal for walking, geocaching, cycling, horseback riding,
and cross-country skiing in winter.&lt;/h3&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;Bouncy Bunny and all her many
friends once again have gathered for a big Easter celebration.
Easter of course is her favourite holiday and she looks forward to
it every year. Lots of preparation goes into this festive time,
from colouring Easter eggs, picking fresh flowers and decorating
the baskets. Lots of treats are hidden in many places. The young
ones just love to go and hunt for their Easter surprises. If you
would like to visit Bouncy Bunny and all her wonderful friends and
take part in the festivities, she has left some clues below on
where they will be celebrating Easter this year.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
North Picture:&lt;br/&gt; http://img.geocaching.com/cache/78e9067d-a4a8-4649-aa53-54d67854e33d.jpg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
West Picture:&lt;br/&gt; http://img.geocaching.com/cache/8c6c48a9-9096-40e8-ae08-93b206d834f5.jpg&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 To join in on the celebration, you will need to count the bunnies
and do some simple math. (Click on the images to see the larger
versions.)&lt;br/&gt;
 To figure out the North coordinates, count the bunnies in the
North picture above, reverse the two digits, divide by 100 and add
the result to the posted North coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;
To figure out the West coordinates, count the bunnies in the West
picture above, reverse the two digits, divide by 100 and add the
result to the posted West coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Example of math:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
xy (# of bunnies in picture)&lt;br/&gt;
yx (reversed digits)&lt;br/&gt;
0.yx0 (divided by 100)&lt;br/&gt;
add 0.yx0 to the specified posted coordinates&lt;br/&gt;
 ...I don't think it can be any simpler, except this time you might
want to pay close attention. Sometimes Bouncy Bunny can be a bit
sneaky.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Bouncy Bunny also says that the first 24 geocaching teams to visit
her Easter celebration may trade for one of the figurines which
have all been hand picked by her owners. If visiting with multiple
kids, they may each trade for one of the figurines.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 In order to log this cache as a find, Bouncy
Bunny requests that you write in your online log about an Easter
experience from the past or what your plans are for this upcoming
Easter.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Click here to verify your
coordinates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Sometimes it helps to pause and think before you click. As a checksum, the digital root of all of the bunnies that you counted is 2.

&lt;h3&gt;North America&lt;br/&gt;
There are currently 23 countries
within North America. North America, which covers the landmass
north of the Panama-Colombia border, and the islands of the
Caribbean. North America is the northern continent of the Americas,
situated in the Earth's northern hemisphere and almost totally in
the western hemisphere. It is bordered on the north by the Arctic
Ocean, on the east by the North Atlantic Ocean, on the southeast by
the Caribbean Sea, and on the west by the North Pacific Ocean;
South America lies to the southeast.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Caledon Trailway&lt;br/&gt;
The Trailway follows the path of
an abandoned rail line that once linked Hamilton with Barrie. The
Town of Caledon purchased 35 km of rail section in 1989 and it
became the first officially designated portion of the Trans Canada
Trail in 1995. The first Trans Canada Trail Pavilion in the
country was built in Caledon East in 1996. This is a multi-use
trail, ideal for walking, geocaching, cycling, horseback riding,
and cross-country skiing in winter.&lt;/h3&gt;

Well, mission HALF successful. We found the cache, which has wintered nicely and blends in well. There are a few pieces chipped off the cache but it's still in good shape. 

Unfortunately, we had a bride and groom show up for their photos and this cut our time short looking for the wooden block - we didn't find it after about 20 minutes of searching.  Nice area, hopefully I'll have more time to search for that elusive block next time I'm out this way.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sixth Sanctum: Grotto of Inescapable
Demons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 The orcs once lived on this land and they would summon demons to
help do their bidding. However the demons became too many and the
orcs over time could no longer control them and were forced to
leave the land. However, before they left, they captured a mighty
conjuror and made him cast a spell on the land to keep the demons
trapped here forever. Heed the warnings of others. Beware of the
demons, all who choose to enter here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 



&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 Before attempting any cache in this series, you should refer to

Sixth Sanctum: The Final Journey for more information. You will
need to take note of the Adventurer, his Experience (exp) and the
Items that you find listed on the card in this cache. Do not remove
the card. When you log your finds on this series, give your
character a name and give details of your character's journey
throughout each location of the Sixth Sanctum. The King likes
stories and may have extra rewards available for those that tell
him of their heroic journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you start your journey through the grotto you
encounter a plaque containing the text &quot;Enjoy The Moment&quot;. There
are also 8 individual numbers on this plaque. Take the 8 numbers
and multiply all 8 of them together which will give you a 5 digit
number. Take the last 3 digits of the 5 digit number that you just
found the product for and add it to both the North and West of the
following coords.&lt;br/&gt;
 N43° 44.326&lt;br/&gt;
 W79° 11.476&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden close to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series consists of 11 caches. You will need
to visit each of the other 10 caches in this series in order to
find King Balthazar's steel chest.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Arriving I find the remains of many previous battles. I find myself in a very quiet place but strangely do not feel alone. Keeping a keen eye for intruders hiding in the remains I venture forward to my goal. The wind off the sea is cold so I must proceed without haste. I find the information I seek and return without the need of battle. I am relieved as I ventured forth on my own. Cold and laden with much information I carry on to a safe place to prepare for the final conquest. </groundspeak:text>

&lt;h3&gt;North America&lt;br/&gt;
There are currently 23 countries
within North America. North America, which covers the landmass
north of the Panama-Colombia border, and the islands of the
Caribbean. North America is the northern continent of the Americas,
situated in the Earth's northern hemisphere and almost totally in
the western hemisphere. It is bordered on the north by the Arctic
Ocean, on the east by the North Atlantic Ocean, on the southeast by
the Caribbean Sea, and on the west by the North Pacific Ocean;
South America lies to the southeast.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Caledon Trailway&lt;br/&gt;
The Trailway follows the path of
an abandoned rail line that once linked Hamilton with Barrie. The
Town of Caledon purchased 35 km of rail section in 1989 and it
became the first officially designated portion of the Trans Canada
Trail in 1995. The first Trans Canada Trail Pavilion in the
country was built in Caledon East in 1996. This is a multi-use
trail, ideal for walking, geocaching, cycling, horseback riding,
and cross-country skiing in winter.&lt;/h3&gt;

Town of Caledon purchased 35 km of rail section in 1989 and it
became the first officially designated portion of the Trans Canada
Trail in 1995. The first Trans Canada Trail Pavilion in the
country was built in Caledon East in 1996. This is a multi-use
trail, ideal for walking, geocaching, cycling, horseback riding,
and cross-country skiing in winter.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Caledon Trailway&lt;br/&gt;
The Trailway follows the path of
an abandoned rail line that once linked Hamilton with Barrie. The
Town of Caledon purchased 35 km of rail section in 1989 and it
became the first officially designated portion of the Trans Canada
Trail in 1995. The first Trans Canada Trail Pavilion in the
country was built in Caledon East in 1996. This is a multi-use
trail, ideal for walking, geocaching, cycling, horseback riding,
and cross-country skiing in winter.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sixth Sanctum: Threshold of
Eternity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 Your journey to the Threshold of Eternity with be a long and
dangerous one. Beware of traps and watch for the many cliffs that
may appear at random. No one has ever returned from here. Even the
orcs do not feel confident to enter this land. It is said that all
who enter this land will have to remain here for eternity as there
is no way to find your way out of here once you
enter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 



&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 Before attempting any cache in this series, you should refer to
Sixth Sanctum: The Final Journey for more information. You will
need to take note of the Adventurer, his Experience (exp) and the
Items that you find listed on the card in this cache. Do not remove
the card. When you log your finds on this series, give your
character a name and give details of your character's journey
throughout each location of the Sixth Sanctum. The King likes
stories and may have extra rewards available for those that tell
him of their heroic journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series consists of 11 caches. You will need
to visit each of the other 10 caches in this series in order to
find King Balthazar's steel chest.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Using the sparse information provided we venture forth and find a trail that is straight and short. A barrier must be overcome and now we are close to the sea. Mindful that attackers outnumbering us could easily make short a battle by pushing us forward - we keep a mindful watch. The distance that remains is short but not without risk. One wrong step and I will be lost to the sea. I order the Golden Reliever to rest at the top and await my return. Should I not return before darkness he is ordered to obtain help. I continue on my quest knowing that my canine companion is able and obedient. The remaining quest is completed and I return to a steadfastly waiting friend and no sight of foe. It is with great fear and horror that I come to know that I did not return with all that I brought. I must trek again into the danger. Once again the Golden Reliever is ordered to wait and obtain help should luck not be present in my return from danger. I return quickly and we joyfully reunite in the knowledge that we live to battle another day. We take the straight and direct trail out.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;h3&gt;North America&lt;br/&gt;
There are currently 23 countries
within North America. North America, which covers the landmass
north of the Panama-Colombia border, and the islands of the
Caribbean. North America is the northern continent of the Americas,
situated in the Earth's northern hemisphere and almost totally in
the western hemisphere. It is bordered on the north by the Arctic
Ocean, on the east by the North Atlantic Ocean, on the southeast by
the Caribbean Sea, and on the west by the North Pacific Ocean;
South America lies to the southeast.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Caledon Trailway&lt;br/&gt;
The Trailway follows the path of
an abandoned rail line that once linked Hamilton with Barrie. The
Town of Caledon purchased 35 km of rail section in 1989 and it
became the first officially designated portion of the Trans Canada
Trail in 1995. The first Trans Canada Trail Pavilion in the
country was built in Caledon East in 1996. This is a multi-use
trail, ideal for walking, geocaching, cycling, horseback riding,
and cross-country skiing in winter.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;South America&lt;br/&gt;
There are currently 12 countries
within South America. South America is bordered on the west by the
Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean.
North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest. South
America has an area of approximately 17,840,000 square kilometres,
or almost 3.5% of the Earth's surface.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Caledon Trailway&lt;br/&gt;
The Trailway follows the path of
an abandoned rail line that once linked Hamilton with Barrie. The
Town of Caledon purchased 35 km of rail section in 1989 and it
became the first officially designated portion of the Trans Canada
Trail in 1995. The first Trans Canada Trail Pavilion in the
country was built in Caledon East in 1996. This is a multi-use
trail, ideal for walking, geocaching, cycling, horseback riding,
and cross-country skiing in winter.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

While lost in that thought, we spotted the tiny plots opposite the cache. Having lost my daughter at only 2 years of age, it was an emotional moment to say the least. We've found a lot of caches of these type, but this one we'll remember for some time.

&lt;h3&gt;South America&lt;br/&gt;
There are currently 12 countries
within South America. South America is bordered on the west by the
Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean.
North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest. South
America has an area of approximately 17,840,000 square kilometres,
or almost 3.5% of the Earth's surface.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Caledon Trailway&lt;br/&gt;
The Trailway follows the path of
an abandoned rail line that once linked Hamilton with Barrie. The
Town of Caledon purchased 35 km of rail section in 1989 and it
became the first officially designated portion of the Trans Canada
Trail in 1995. The first Trans Canada Trail Pavilion in the
country was built in Caledon East in 1996. This is a multi-use
trail, ideal for walking, geocaching, cycling, horseback riding,
and cross-country skiing in winter.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is one of the oldedest cemeteries in the Town of Caledon.
The first person to be buried here was Welsh pioneer David Williams
in 1823. He was only 29 years old when a tree fell on him while he
was clearing his land. It's rumored that he was buried in the bark
of the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land was formally deeded much later in 1858. The property
was expanded in 1896 and 1908. The stone and iron gate entrance to
the cemetery was built in 1930. In 1966 the adjacent school
property was added to the cemetery and the single room school house
became the mortuary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;TH264AQ - Stone and Iron Gate&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 46.410 W 079° 55.623</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The area has been identified as an Earth Science Area of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSI) by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. The Badlands are also part of Ontario’s Niagara Escarpment, which was designated a UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) World Biosphere Reserve in 1990.

Where you are now standing was once the edge of a warm, shallow sea. Far to the southeast, a mountain range the size of the Himalayas was building, and rivers from these mountains were sending red, iron-rich sediment from the mountains into the seas, forming a large, muddy delta. The sea was teaming with life, but on land, no plants or animals had yet developed.

Formation of the Badlands Queenston Shale is a very soft rock, in comparison to the harder sandstone, limestone and dolostone that make up the rest of the Niagara Escarpment. Erosion of the shale can occur rapidly if layers of other rock or vegetation are removed, and particularly if the area is impacted by grazing and large number of people. The Badlands probably began to form in the early 1900s when the trees were cut down to allow for a cattle pasture. The protective layer of vegetation was removed and the shale began to erode; although farming at the site ended in 1931, erosion of the badlands has continued to its present-day state. The Badlands are part of Ontario’s Niagara Escarpment, which was designated a UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) World Biosphere Reserve in 1990. The property contains one of the best examples of “badlands topography” development in southern Ontario, and has been identified as an Earth Science Area of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSI) by the Ministry of Natural Resources. Badlands topography is rare in Ontario because in most areas the shale is protected from erosion by overlying hard rock (limestone, dolostone or sandstone), sand or gravel. The Badlands lie within the Inglewood Slope Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA), which is an important groundwater discharge area. The coldwater stream on the property at the foot of the badlands is a tributary of the Credit River.

&lt;h3&gt;South America&lt;br/&gt;
There are currently 12 countries
within South America. South America is bordered on the west by the
Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean.
North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest. South
America has an area of approximately 17,840,000 square kilometres,
or almost 3.5% of the Earth's surface.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Caledon Trailway&lt;br/&gt;
The Trailway follows the path of
an abandoned rail line that once linked Hamilton with Barrie. The
Town of Caledon purchased 35 km of rail section in 1989 and it
became the first officially designated portion of the Trans Canada
Trail in 1995. The first Trans Canada Trail Pavilion in the
country was built in Caledon East in 1996. This is a multi-use
trail, ideal for walking, geocaching, cycling, horseback riding,
and cross-country skiing in winter.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sixth Sanctum: Deserted Chamber of
Voices&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 The only way into this chamber is through a small hole in the
roof. However, the mighty orcs had blocked the hole when they were
last here. Although the chamber may look deserted, it is rumoured
that there are some long lost secrets to be discovered here. Listen
to what the voices in your head tell you and heed their warnings.
Great and unexpected danger awaits all who enter the
chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 Before attempting any cache in this series, you should refer to
Sixth Sanctum: The Final Journey for more information. You will
need to take note of the Adventurer, his Experience (exp) and the
Items that you find listed on the card in this cache. Do not remove
the card. When you log your finds on this series, give your
character a name and give details of your character's journey
throughout each location of the Sixth Sanctum. The King likes
stories and may have extra rewards available for those that tell
him of their heroic journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden close to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series consists of 11 caches. You will need
to visit each of the other 10 caches in this series in order to
find King Balthazar's steel chest.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Refreshed and with renewed strength I set out once again in aid of the King. Lady Leona and I chose the stealth of night to fool the Orcs, as what humans would dare be here after dark? Quietly we made our way through the blackness, the shadows protecting our eyes from their horrible appearance, though there was no way to avoid the disgusting Orc stench all around us. Success was ours easily this time, but we know the worse is yet to come......</groundspeak:text>

Despite their dire warnings of the trials we had ahead we chose to press on and endure this Chamber. We parted ways and took to our pursuit - we could hear the tormented souls as we made our way across the hunting grounds. So many beasts, yet none stood in our way. We hastily entered the Chamber for it's secrets and left with it's secrets before being condemned to it's hells.  When we approached the gates, the traveler was in his carriage but his maiden was nowhere to be seen. It wasn't long before she appeared from the floor of the carriage. We supposed the traveler dropped his sword and she was helping him. 

A most memorable quest, indeed!

They will live another day and we will proceed to our primary goal. The path is straight and the heavy downfall is covering the tracks of early adventurers - until we get close. The venturer before us has travelled in all directions and has left many marks of failure. We try to ignore his path and strike our own. The information we seek is soon in hand and we return to a location just beyond a water crossing structure. The foes we once saw are now absent. We move on without engaging in battle. </groundspeak:text>

NOTE: Cache is rather small, and did not accomodate a writing instrument. You should bring something to write with. Cache will handle small items (like geocoins)

---

There are two ways to access the trail system. The cache is located in a brand new park located at the end of Port Union Road. 

There is a pedestrian tunnel under the railway tracks. Please use the tunnel at N43 46.545/W 079 08.093. Crossing the very active, very high speed railway line elsewhere is just a plain stupid thing to do.

Near the tunnel, you'll find a wonderful trail system, with a 'lookout' hill with a great view of the city, and of the nearby Pickering Nuclear Generating Station. 

This cache was placed while I was on a walk with Kitten on the Hunt's family. 

The trail extends out beyond the Rouge Hill GO Station (which has a geocache in it) There is parking at that end of the trail, but there is a gate blocking the trail entrance. It would appear there may still be construction at that end of the trail, so access the path from the tunnel.

The path itself is paved, and would be great for rollerblading, or riding your bike here. Wheelchairs should be able to get fairly close to the cache, but may need assistance for the last few meters.

We were out for a walk today. It's good to see that the tunnel is finally open after 6? years. Everytime we've come by here, it's been blocked. This time instead of walking, we drove to the end of Pt Union Rd. I grew up not too far from here, and boy has the area ever changes. So many new houses, where the former asbestos plant (with contaminated land) used to be.

A very enjoyable cache, park and walk. I know we will be back here to walk the trails some more.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;h3&gt;South America&lt;br/&gt;
There are currently 12 countries
within South America. South America is bordered on the west by the
Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean.
North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest. South
America has an area of approximately 17,840,000 square kilometres,
or almost 3.5% of the Earth's surface.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Caledon Trailway&lt;br/&gt;
The Trailway follows the path of
an abandoned rail line that once linked Hamilton with Barrie. The
Town of Caledon purchased 35 km of rail section in 1989 and it
became the first officially designated portion of the Trans Canada
Trail in 1995. The first Trans Canada Trail Pavilion in the
country was built in Caledon East in 1996. This is a multi-use
trail, ideal for walking, geocaching, cycling, horseback riding,
and cross-country skiing in winter.&lt;/h3&gt;

A HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION
This cache was previously located in Morningside Park but retrieved due to storm damage. After doing a physical check of the location and area following a storm. We discovered what is often referred to as a widow maker. A large, heavy branch hanging well above the cache location. This branch had broken of from its tree and was being held, precariously above the cache location by very thin branches. In order to avoid any serious injury to cachers we have relocated it further south along highland creek. Much of this area is still in a state of repair since the flooding in August 2005 and many of the park entrances are still closed.

This cache is now located in an area that wasn’t to heavily damaged by the flooding (ENTIRELY SAFE LOCATION). However if you follow the paved path further west from the cache location, you will find lots of damage. Two bridges either washed away or damaged by the flooding. A tennis court ravished by the high water and many trees broken or placed along the shore line.

Parking can be found at the following co-ordinates

N43 46.785
W079 10.570

This cache is a quick 800m round trip along a paved path.

You can also visit our other nearby cache Fern View Relocated from the same parking area. Roughly a 800m round trip hike.</groundspeak:long_description>

2 ways to access this cache via parking in colonel danforth park and taking the upper trail (this way involves lots of climbing gloves and boots recommended)... or parking on the road leading to the entrance to the park ( by the bus stop ) and walking down kingston rd heading southwest. 

the cache is just nustled in not crazy hidden or anything.

Will be available in winter but geocachers must use extra caution

&lt;p&gt;Mr Slate is once again upset at Fred Flintstone. He asked Fred
to do a simple task of finding the cache that he hid, and yet Fred
failed. He just couldn't get to it and is asking Mr Slate for
forgiveness. Maybe you can secretly help Fred find the cache so
that Mr Slate won't be upset at Fred anymore. Afterwards, Fred can
enjoy a nice brontosaurus burger along with a smiley.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;You shouldn't have any problem finding this cache once you
figure out the puzzle. When you solve the puzzle, it will give you
the coords of where you need to go to find some additional
information, which you then need to do some simple calculations in
order to get to the final.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The coords needed to find the object at the first location of
this cache can be determined from the following:&lt;br/&gt;
GC&lt;i&gt;4NX1Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
GC&lt;i&gt;8HJ5J&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Go to the coordinates you calculated from the above puzzle. Here
you will find a tall object. You are looking for the thing that is
closest to the bottom of this object that starts with an H and ends
with an E. The word you are looking for has between 4 and 9 letters
in it and there are several of these one right above the other.
Take the word and convert each of the letters into a number using
the following sequence: A=1, B=2, C=3...E = 5...H = 8...Z=26. Add
all of the values from each letter of the word together to give you
the number that we will call X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located at:&lt;br/&gt;
N43 46.(7*X-45)&lt;br/&gt;
W79 12.(3*X+44)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container that contains the logbook is a white diabetes
strips container that is similar in size and shape to a film
container. However, it's not as simple as that. Once you find the
cache location, which should be very simple as something is here
that is out of place, you will need to get the cache container out
and sign the log in order to claim this cache as a find. Please be
very careful when extracting the actual cache container. Please
return the container and everything else exactly as you found it
(completely covered, especially so no one sees it as they walk by
on the trail) and try to make as little mess as possible, otherwise
it will just ruin the whole cache for any future finders. This type
of hide is unique and I am sure you have never seen this done
before. It's different and you might not like it, but please
respect the fact that this is what I have done for this cache. If
you get here and don't feel like getting the cache, then just skip
the cache and do a different one, but I hope you can appreciate the
creativity and originality of this cache. Additionally, this cache
I would not consider winter friendly, so with that I ask that once
it dips below zero, that you do not attempt this cache. I might
also suggest that you bring a towel, napkins, some diaper wipes,
and even a 1 litre container. These may or may not be useful. Or
maybe you have something else useful in your caching bag to aid in
getting the cache. Oh and bring your own writing instrument.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Parking is close by in the valley on Military Trail and so is a very short trail. Then the FUN begins. Cache is a fairly large square plactic container.

My 5 year old son and I placed this cache. I used to live not too far from here when I was a child and was always amazed by the steep road. Although we took the straight approach, with not too much trouble, there might be a better and safer way, but I didn't see it (rating is based on our approach and the trouble we had in hiding it). Boots are recommended and be careful near the river in the spring.

Other approaches:
1) Fall and Winter should be easy to cross the river (follow the main gravel path from parking in the valley), without getting (too) wet. Probably the hardest time to find in the fall due to all the fallen brush.
2) On the east side of the bridge there is a small trail that goes up and down the hillside...just be careful, as I slipped going over a fallen tree and got a grapefruit sized bruise just above my knee...I can still see remains of the bruise on my knee 5 months later. Spring time would make for a really easy find.
3) There should be an approach from the other side of the river, perhaps from Centennial Collage or some other park along a nice gravel path...if you are familiar with that approach or have taken it, please let me know.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Park at the bottom of Military Trail, follow the short trail to the river, cross the river, and go part way up the hill and to the left a little bit. Cache is hidden under a big pile of fallen trees/branches. You might have to reach for it.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Took the red smiley magnet and left a tire repair kit for them summer x-country bikers :)

Going back was just as  challenging. I  literally had to swing from small tree trunk to small tree trunk to avoid landsliding down into the melting creekbed :)

&lt;h3&gt;South America&lt;br/&gt;
There are currently 12 countries
within South America. South America is bordered on the west by the
Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean.
North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest. South
America has an area of approximately 17,840,000 square kilometres,
or almost 3.5% of the Earth's surface.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Caledon Trailway&lt;br/&gt;
The Trailway follows the path of
an abandoned rail line that once linked Hamilton with Barrie. The
Town of Caledon purchased 35 km of rail section in 1989 and it
became the first officially designated portion of the Trans Canada
Trail in 1995. The first Trans Canada Trail Pavilion in the
country was built in Caledon East in 1996. This is a multi-use
trail, ideal for walking, geocaching, cycling, horseback riding,
and cross-country skiing in winter.&lt;/h3&gt;

Yet another in the GO Caching series. This one is in the middle of
the Old Cummer GO station.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;You have to be very &lt;strong&gt;quiet&lt;/strong&gt; while hunting for
this cache, otherwise you might cause a &lt;strong&gt;riot&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring your own writing instrument.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Listen to the Hobbit’s warning, as only the brave, or perhaps the foolish, will attempt such a journey.&lt;/p&gt;

I have hidden my treasure in my home.&lt;br/&gt;
A home which only my friends and I can enter.&lt;br/&gt;
I have given you a false sense of confidence,&lt;br/&gt;
As the journey starts off with ease.&lt;br/&gt;
I have placed some stairs in your way.&lt;br/&gt;
Hold on tight. One wrong step,&lt;br/&gt;
And you will be lying on the floor below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

If you choose to continue along the trail,&lt;br/&gt;
You will not find my home.&lt;br/&gt;
This I tell you. Follow the wall.&lt;br/&gt;
Up and down you will go.&lt;br/&gt;
Along the walls of towering stone.&lt;br/&gt;
Past two mystical springs glistening from the ground,&lt;br/&gt;
Which form rivers that only go down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Watch your step, every moment of the way,&lt;br/&gt;
For the vultures are hungry and are wanting you.&lt;br/&gt;
Go further and further,&lt;br/&gt;
Until your feet tell you no.&lt;br/&gt;
Bring your agile bodies, but leave the weak at home,&lt;br/&gt;
For this journey is not for young or old.&lt;br/&gt;
But adventure I promise, you will have.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When you find my home,&lt;br/&gt;
Don’t be misled, as the next challenge awaits.&lt;br/&gt;
The treasure is inside, and you are not.&lt;br/&gt;
Now don’t you wish you brought that child?&lt;br/&gt;
Or perhaps a friendly elf or gnome.&lt;br/&gt;
Try to enter if you dare,&lt;br/&gt;
But if you get stuck, you will be belong to me, my precious.


    
  

&lt;br/&gt;
Many have tried and failed. None have succeeded. How will you fare? This journey is not for everyone. Even if you get to your destination, finding and retrieving the treasure will be a challenge too. Be sure to read any logs, to find out more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The Hobbit's treasure initially contained a variety of about 40 Canadian postage stamps from the 1960s and 1970s.</groundspeak:long_description>

yes, yes i know &quot;what goes up must come down&quot;
well, with the combination of up and down along the way  this one turned out to be what i consider the perfect hike  
really enjoyed the trip to the cache and the hobbit's home [:D]

Chris-mouse and jeff-trex came along with us even though they found it before.  Of course this being the BFL crew we're doing it at night.  I think the whole group is crazy.

Northernpenguin took photos of us going down the stairs.  He decided to go back to his car with his expensive camera equipment which was a good thing as it started to rain heavily soon after.

We made our way along the base of the cliff.  The rocks were slippery, there was a boggy patch of dirt along the way, and the vegetation was dense in a few spots.  This only slowed us down a bit but didn't stop us.

Once at the cache I took the top way in while chirs-mouse crawled through the bottom.  Then it was time to head back.  When we finally made it to the car we were soaked and exhausted.

Had a lot of fun.  TFTC.

Big time thanks to Dread for the actual cache retrieval part. That sure was freaky going down that cable at night. I'll come back for the valley view during the day sometime. Not a Kitten friendly cache ;).

I'm also going to pay more attention when Fizbot suddenly has to go home. I suspect that's really a code for &quot;arduous journey ahead&quot;. </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">‘Twixt Crick &amp; River is a single re-direct multicache
located in the Glen Rouge Park at the border of Toronto and
Pickering. It takes its name from the nearby merging of the Little
Rouge Creek and the Rouge River.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We
decided to make this a multicache since
the final cache is close to the main parking lot, and would not
pose much of a challenge as a standalone cache. There are other
caches in the area. If you plan properly, you can find the stage
one container, keep hiking to other nearby caches, and retrieve the
final cache on the way back to the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you really wanted to though,
this cache could be done within half an hour as a standalone. The
coordinates for the final cache are found in the first stage
container. Pretty straightforward, though the container can be
difficult to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The final cache container was
replaced in February 2010. It is now an ammo can with a home-made
camo paint job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The final cache location is off
of the trail, so some bushwhacking is required. In summer, the
growth can get pretty thick, and there are some prickly plants. It
is much more easily accessed in winter. Please leave the cache well
hidden!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

My GPS was also quite accurate and I found it after KW instructed me to believe my expensive satellite based navigation system over my own less expensive, and flawed intuition in this case. So many obvious - but wrong - spots to look around here.

Came back after getting some much needed pub-grub a few km away [man, I needed that with all these hills today]. The final was found in pretty short order with Kitten on the Hunt and we took a quiet moment to stargaze while we waited for the others to find the cache. Great fun!</groundspeak:text>

the Rouge Valley...But that may not be what Billy has in store for
you.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 If you read the story closely, you shouldn't have to walk more
than 6km round trip. Please bring your own writing instrument.
Cache is attached to a tree...unscrew bottom and remove log from
lid.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rumours say that a young boy named Billy was abandoned here
as a young child by his parents in the 1930s. He was left behind
with only the clothes on his back and a tattered stuffed bear with
the name Leo embroidered on it. Why his parents abandoned Billy
here, if in fact they did, or whether perhaps Billy simply got lost
in the overpowering valley below while out playing one day, is
still not completely known. Many people have different
theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been several stories over the years from hikers and
passersby of sights of a young boy dragging a teddy bear behind
him. Also similar stories of a man and even more so now, an elderly
man, with a similar teddy bear. But still to this day people swear
that they have sightings of the young Billy and his teddy bear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It certainly couldn't be the same Billy that went missing so
many decades ago. Near this spot where you stand, once stood the
old Glen Eagles Hotel. Many patrons of the Glen Eagles Hotel also
stated that they have seen both the boy and the elderly man. It's
believed that Billy would come to the hotel in search of food and
other discarded items. One night the hotel had caught fire. However
what a firefighter found the next morning in the burned remains
behind the hotel sent chills down many spines of those who knew the
story about Billy. There in the dirt behind the hotel lay an old
tattered teddy bear. And stitched on this bear was a name...Leo!
Could all these rumours of a lost boy by the name of Billy be
true?&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next several days people searched the hillsides and
valley below in the hopes of finally putting a rest to some of
these rumours. Certainly the find of the teddy bear put some truth
and at the same time more questions in the minds of the people who
heard the countless stories of Billy. Of course, Billy was never
found. However over the years there are still the odd reports of
sightings of either a young boy or an old man dressed in rags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last known sighting came two years ago by a young couple who
were sitting enjoying the views at 2am in the morning on a cool
summer night. They say a ragged old man walked right by them,
stopped and then looked at them for a few seconds, as they sat
there with a sense of fear and amazement. The man seemed to utter
the word &quot;Leo&quot; as if asking a question. Then he simply continued on
straight down the hillside into the valley below where they swear
the aged man disappeared into the darkness and a young child could
then be seen, but only for a moment. This was the last ever
reported sighting of what may have been Billy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all these years, is Billy still walking around in the
Rouge somewhere? Perhaps looking for his lost teddy bear, Leo?
Perhaps if you come here at 2am you might just get a glimpse of
Billy. Have a look for yourself at the posted coordinates and be
sure to note the year that the Glen Eagles Hotel permanently
closed. Take the year and divide it by 1000 and add that to both
N43 46.525 and W79 07.857.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to these new coordinates you might find some old
artifacts that some say Billy had collected over the years. Count
up the number of artifacts that you find and divide it by 1000. Add
that to both N43 48.502 and W79 09.820 and go there to leave a
message for Billy. Maybe even leave him a little present somewhere
in the valley and check back in a few days to see if Billy has
visited and taken your gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you keep a close lookout for Billy and please report
any sightings. Maybe even bring a camera incase you do spot him.
Billy might still very well be out there somewhere. Perhaps he is
even watching you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;FIPZVJ - Billy, are you there?&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PKPZVJ - Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 48.566 W 079° 09.921&lt;br/&gt;Parking lot is here.&lt;br/&gt;S2PZVJ - Have you seen Billy yet?&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is a 50mm Ammo Container that has received a nice
home-made camo paint job courtesy of the cache owner.
 &lt;p&gt;I have been looking at the ammo cans that
   have been accumulating in the garage just waiting to be
   hidden.  It's now
   officially spring, though the cache was placed on a rather gray
   day, with temperatures only a bit above freezing, so the trails
   were muddy in places, and still icy in others.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located only a few metres from
the trail.  There are
no really steep climbs or descents required, the trails are pretty
friendly.  The cache container is pretty tucked into its
hiding spot, and may be a little difficult to remove, but I have
seen worse.  Please take care to re-hide the container
well.  I have rated the cache a 3.5 difficulty due to the
hiding spot, but the terrain should not be much of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite what
your mapping software may tell you, this cache is located
&lt;b&gt;NORTH and EAST&lt;/b&gt; of the Little Rouge Creek.  If you park at the recommended
coordinates, you will &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; want to cross the bridge before
hitting the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cache started with some decent swag, and a couple of geocoins and a
travel bug. &lt;/p&gt;

I parked my car at Kingston Rd and we juggled the other car to Twin Rivers parking lot. This was the first of 8 finds today in about 3.5 hours...yes I was really walking at a fast pace today. This was also probably the easiest find of the day for us as the GPS took us right to it and the coords were right on. Cache had a few drops of water in the bottom which I emptied out, but otherwise contents and log were dry and great condition. Really enjoyed the walk along this trail today.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kortright Centre is named after Dr. Francis
H. Kortright (1887-1972), world-famous outdoorsman, an engineer,
businessman, author and dedicated conservationist. Long before the
environmental crisis became a well-known issue worldwide, Dr.
Kortright recognized the urgency and resolved to do something about
it. He devoted the latter part of his life, his full attention and
abundant energies, to the cause of protecting wild animals of the
fields, the forests, the waters and the skies. In so doing, he
created for all Canadians a legacy that will be appreciated by many
generations to come.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cache is located at a small viewing
platform\bridge offering a nice view of the East Humber
River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one of the outside walls of the visitor
center you will find a very large and old wooden carving that will
be of interest and is related to the topic of this cache.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you
will find a small riverside 'beach' of sands and gravels. The
Humber River watershed experienced a massive deluge of rain back in
October 1954 resulting in disastrous flooding along most of the
river system. The 91 deaths resulting from this flooding downstream
led to the amalgamation of all the conservation authorities with
watersheds draining to Lake Ontario in the Metro Toronto area.
(MTRCA, now the Toronto Conservation Auhority.) Imagine almost 3
meters of water above the present water level here! (About 250 mm.
of rain fell in 12 hours.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Humber
River Watershed has a wide range of surficial geological features.
The upper reaches, particularly in the west, are characterized by
significant thicknesses of sand and gravel associated with the Oak
Ridges Moraine. These areas comprise the key recharge areas in the
watershed. In some areas, the sand and gravel is overlain by a thin
layer of silt till (Halton Till), but with the hummocky topography
and thin till, significant infiltration is still possible. In the
upper east reaches, however, the till thickness increases to about
20-30 m, which limits the infiltration potential. The surficial
geology of the remainder of the watershed is dominated by low
permeability silt, clay, and silt till of the Halton Till
Formation, although there are sands in the lowest reaches near
Bloor Street associated with the former Lake Iroquois shoreline and
some isolated recent&lt;br/&gt;
fluvial sand deposits along the Humber River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geology of the
watershed generally consists of Quaternary sediments infilling a
fluvial valley system incised into the bedrock surface. This
bedrock valley system drained the upper Great Lakes basin to what
is now the St. Lawrence River. This sedimentary package ranges in
thickness from zero (bedrock outcrop) to 270 metres within the
Laurentian bedrock valley system.&lt;br/&gt;
There are four main geologic features present, including:&lt;br/&gt;
--A bedrock valley system that contains thick sand and gravel
deposits;&lt;br/&gt;
--The Niagara Escarpment that forms the western boundary of the
Humber River watershed;&lt;br/&gt;
--The Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM) that forms the headwater of the
watershed; and&lt;br/&gt;
--Areas where Quaternary sediments have eroded and largely
in-filled with fining upwards sequences of sand and silt. This
erosive action is attributed to tunnel channel formation beneath
glacial ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overburden sediments
deposited in the watershed 135,000 to 10,000 years before comprise
the bulk of the aquifer systems across the watershed. The
stratigraphic framework for Quaternary sediments in the study area
has been studied in detail over the last 12 years by researchers at
the GSC and others. Quaternary glacial sediments within the study
area consist of glacial and interglacial deposits formed within the
last 135,000 years summarizes the Quaternary sediments generally
found within the watershed. Not all units exist throughout the
entire watershed. In the western portion, the Thorncliffe Formation
lies in direct contact with the bedrock. Similarly, the moraine
sediments are not present in the western part of the West Humber
River subwatershed.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to log this
cache you will need to perform the following task and post your results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Measure a 10 meter stretch along the edge of the river. Find a
relatively small floating object like a stick or even better, bring
along a popsicle stick and time how long it takes to travel the 10
meters. What is the velocity. V= Distance/Time =
meters/second&lt;br/&gt;

Invasion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crinoids are marine animals
which live in both shallow water and depths of up to 6000
meters. Crinoids are characterized by a mouth on the top
surface that is surrounded by feeding arms. They have a U-shaped
gut, and their anus is located next to the mouth. Although the
basic echinoderm pattern of fivefold symmetry can be recognized,
most crinoids have many more than five arms. Crinoids usually have
a stem used to attach themselves to sediments at the bottom of
streams, but many live attached only as juveniles and become
free-swimming as adults. There are only a few hundred known modern
forms of crinoids, however they were much more numerous both in
species and numbers in the past. Some thick limestone beds dating
to the mid- to late-Paleozoic era are almost entirely made up of
distinct crinoid fragments. At this location you will prominently
find an abundant concentration of crinoid stems imbedded throughout
the limestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Samples of smaller crinoid stem segments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crinoids comprise three basic sections; the stem,
the calyx, and the arms. The stem is composed of highly porous
ossicles which are connected by ligamentary tissue. The calyx
contains the crinoid's digestive and reproductive organs, and the
mouth is located at the top of the dorsal cup, while the anus is
located peripheral to it. The arms display pentamerism or
pentaradial symmetry and comprise smaller ossicles than the stem
and are equipped with cirri which facilitate feeding by moving the
organic media down the arm and into the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crinoids feed by filtering small particles of food from the sea
water with their feather like arms. The tube feet are covered with
a sticky mucus that traps any food that floats past. Once they have
caught a particle of food, the tube feet can flick it into the
ambulacral groove, where the cilia are able to propel the stream of
mucus towards the mouth. Generally speaking, crinoids living in
environments with relatively little plankton have longer and more
highly branched arms than those living in rich environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crinoids have separate male and female individuals. They produce
their gametes from genital canals found inside some of the
pinnules. The pinnules eventually rupture to release the sperm and
eggs into the surrounding sea water. The fertilised eggs hatch to
release a free-swimming larva. The larva is barrel-shaped with
rings of cilia running round the body, and a tuft of sensory hairs
at the upper pole. In some cases females have been known to
temporarily brood the larvae using chambers within the arms. The
larva does not feed, and lasts only for a few days before settling
to the bottom and attaching itself to the underlying surface using
an adhesive gland on its ventral surface. The larva then
metamorphoses into a stalked adult, with the adult eventually
breaking away from the stalk. Within 10 to 16 months the crinoid
will be able to reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Modern day Crinoid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some areas, these crinoid stems are collected by either
extracting them from limestone or from the seashores and made into
necklaces and rosaries. These are commonly known in different
regions as St. Cuthbert's beads (England) and Indian beads
(Mid-west USA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crinoids are the state fossil of Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to log this cache
you will need to perform the following tasks and post the
answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
a) Count how many crinoid stems are present
on the surface area of the limestone.&lt;br/&gt;
b) What is the length of the largest of these crinoid stem
fossils?&lt;br/&gt;
c) Are there any crinoid fossils present that show more than just
the stem of the crinoids? If yes, describe and indicate how many
arms they have.&lt;br/&gt;
d) Select three prominent stems and calculate how many ridges per
inch are present in each. Is you answer the same, why or why
not?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that you enjoyed learning about
crinoids and the next time you come across these fossils you will
have the knowledge to explain them to your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Kortright Marsh there is a bird blind,
boardwalk, and raised viewing platform. This marsh was created in
1977 by berming (dredging and piling up fill) and creating a
diversion of drainage when needed with waters from Cold Creek. The
outflow is the red structure by the bird blind. Wetlands, like a
marsh, are important to our planet for many reasons including:
nesting, feeding and resting habitat for migratory waterfowl;
creation of food chains/web; habitat to a variety of mammals and
shore birds; etc. One of their most important roles is to clean
water as they are the 'planet's kidneys'. Of special note to this
marsh is the returning pair of trumpeter swans which return every
year.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In geography, a marsh, is a type of wetland that is subject to
frequent or continuous flood. Typically the water is shallow and
features grasses, rushes, reeds, typhas, sedges, and other
herbaceous plants. Woody plants will be low-growing shrubs. A marsh
is different from a swamp, which has a greater proportion of open
water surface and may be deeper than a marsh. In North America, the
term &quot;swamp&quot; is used for wetland dominated by trees rather than
grasses and low herbs.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to log this virtual, indicate what wildlife you observed in the marsh and any other information that you have learned or find interesting.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most beavers live in a lodge built out of sticks
and mud. However, at Kortright, most beavers prefer to build their
homes in the river bank. For this reason, they are called &quot;bank
beavers&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beavers are active all year - they do not
hibernate. To prepare for winter, they use branches they have cut
and chewed to build a dam across the river. Dams block the flow of
water and create wetlands that all animals can use. The deep water
created by the dam allows the beavers to gain access to their lodge
and store a food pile of branches under the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have found that when beavers build
dams, the diversity of bird life increases in the area around the
new wetland.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the posted coords you

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; June 14, 2004. Made a
      change.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;The Tale of Bouncy Bunny and the Package&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Dufus Dog and Kitty Cat were best of friends. They lived in the
quiet northern town of Pettsburry (that's in Canada, eh! Not in UK)
and had a big yard where they could play with each other all day
long. Each day before dinner they would run around the yard and
play games like tag or woof meow. They always had lots of fun. They
also had a very friendly neighbour named Bouncy Bunny. That
afternoon Bouncy Bunny came bouncing over with a package she had
just received in the mail. The three of them all sat around the
package with excitement in their eyes. They sat around it guessing
what it could be. After about five minutes of discussing what
wonderful things may be in the box, they couldn't resist any longer
and proceeded in opening the box. &quot;What could it be? What could it
be?&quot; they all said in excitement. A couple of Bouncy Bunny's
younger siblings peered across the yard and were curious why there
was so much excitement in the air, so they quickly hopped over to
see. They got the box open and were surprised with a brand new GPS.
&quot;A GPS? What is that?&quot; enquired Dufus Dog and Kitty Cat. Bouncy
Bunny told them about a friend of hers that did something called
geocaching. &quot;Geocaching? Wow that sounds like a lot of fun.&quot; The
younger bunnies were also really excited about it. But since it was
almost dinner time, the five of them thought that it would be best
if they would eat something first. They ate very quickly and off
they went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They entered the coords and headed west in the direction that
the GPS pointed. &quot;Only seven hundred meters away. That shouldn't
take us long at all&quot;, replied Bouncy Bunny. They continued along
the trail. “Only ninety five meters left to go”, shouted Dufus Dog.
&quot;We should be there in no time&quot;, they said. They were all excited
by what they may find when they get there. &quot;I hope there's at least
five items in there, so that we all can have something&quot;, said
Bouncy Bunny's younger siblings. They were very close now and they
started their search in hopes of finding the mysterious geocache.
Then Dufus Dog saw something poking out from behind a gate. They
all looked there in excitement. Kitty Cat retrieved the cache from
it's hiding spot. They felt that good fortune was on their side as
they had found the cache. They all huddled around the plastic
container as they opened it up. There were lots of things in it and
they each traded something. They returned the cache and returned
home. &quot;Wow, what a fun time we had&quot;, they all agreed. As they got
home and told their parents about their adventure. However, a
question still remained. Who had sent them the GPS? The package did
not have the sender's name on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;THE END&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The cache container is in fine form, there is a ziplock bag with the original logbook, but that's been breached so it's pretty icky now. Had a fantastic hike to the cache, and the camera was out a few times along the way. </groundspeak:text>

It A Marsh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About this
marsh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wetlands that you see here
are currently in transition. The geological process that you have
the opportunity to witness here is the formation of a marsh. This
freshwater marsh here is being formed by both standing water and
inflowing water from the surrounding area. Surface-water
levels change seasonally. Flooding occurs in times of high rainfall
during. During dry periods the water level here diminishes often
exposing matted vegetation or mud. Here you will see the formation
of mosaic surface patterns made up of pools or channels
interspersed with clumps of emergent sedges, grasses, rushes and
reeds, with bands of shrubs found along some of the edges. You will
also see submerged aquatic plants where pooling of water occurs and
if you come during the summer or fall you may also see floating
aquatic plants which should be increasing in numbers over the
forthcoming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beavers, man and nature are all playing an
important role in the formation of this marsh. Due to the
topographic nature of this area, the width of the marsh will remain
fairly unchanged over the years, however the length of the marsh
will increase over time and you can watch it grow and develop in
the future years. Beavers dam up the watercourse. Man has had a
recent and direct impact on the increased amount of water here by
increasing the flow of runoff from the nearby subdivision into
Marigold Creek. With these two primary factors, it is now easy for
nature to take it's course in the transition of this area to a full
fledged marsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characteristics of
a marsh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A marsh is a type of
wetland. The 4 principal types of wetlands are: marsh; swamp; bog;
fen. These wetlands are differentiated by such factors as types of
vegetation, acidity and amount of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshes have: Differing
water levels, depending on time of year (rainfalls and
snowmelt);&lt;br/&gt;
Vegetation, including cattails and marsh marigold at the
edges;&lt;br/&gt;
And they are relatively shallow.&lt;br/&gt;
During dry periods they are, at least, waterlogged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So is this area
a marsh yet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still can't decide if this
is a marsh? Consider the following:&lt;br/&gt;Marshes have an assortment of
grasses, reeds, and sedges, yet without large bushes or tall
trees.&lt;br/&gt;
The height of standing water can range depending on the location
and season.&lt;br/&gt;
The mud or clay that forms the base of the marsh is always heavily
saturated.&lt;br/&gt;
There is often a large space of open water where birds will
colonize.&lt;br/&gt;
A marsh
provides a vital habitat for many plant and
animal species, as well as protecting neighbouring areas of land
from flooding.&lt;br/&gt;
Plants that live in marshes are adapted to changing water levels.
They tend to be very hard and have broad leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you learned enough
from the cache description and by visiting the location to know
about the formation and transition of this wetland? You can also
find information on the sign at the location.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Describe your observations in your log and what you have learned. Also...is it a Marsh?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you are curious and
come back in the years to come to see the marsh and how it has
changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache was placed under
direct supervision of park staff. Please use the provided trails
and visit this eocache only during park hours. Because of the environmentally sensitive area of this location, a physical caches are now permitted in the marsh area.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sixth Sanctum: Marsh of Grand
Dreams&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 This area was once filled with much water which was used by many
of the people of the land. The orcs put something in the water that
made anyone that drink it fall asleep and never wake up. This made
it very easy for the orcs to invade all of the villages in the
area. Over time most of the water had drained, so only marshland
remains. However, the effects are still present and many that enter
suffer the same fate the the many villagers that were here
previously.  It's also said that if you simply touch the water
now, you will also suffer the same fate as the villagers. Only a
few have been revived from their deep sleep and they travel the
lands spreading their warnings of the horrible dreams that they had
while asleep. Death would be welcomed over the vivid nightmares
that they would have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 Before attempting any cache in this series, you should refer to

Sixth Sanctum: The Final Journey for more information. You will
need to take note of the Adventurer, his Experience (exp) and the
Items that you find listed on the card in this cache. Do not remove
the card. When you log your finds on this series, give your
character a name and give details of your character's journey
throughout each location of the Sixth Sanctum. The King likes
stories and may have extra rewards available for those that tell
him of their heroic journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden about four feet off the
ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series consists of 11 caches. You will need
to visit each of the other 10 caches in this series in order to
find King Balthazar's steel chest.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
I've been meaning to hide a cache here since I hiked here with the
BT Hike crew on the way to Glen Haffy. The posted co-ordinates will
take you to the entrance. Look for a 4 digit number below a sign
and this will guide you to the cache. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is technically a micro, so it does not contain a pen.
Geocoins *may* fit inside, but not much else will. Rehide the cache
the way you find it. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To find the NORTH co-ordinate, add all the digits together and add
5. Divide this number by 1000, and add it to the posted
co-ordinate. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To find the WEST co-ordinate, add all the digits on the sign
together, then add 4. Divide this number by 1000, and subtract it
from the posted WEST co-ordinate. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
That's all there is to it. The hint is specific, so don't decode it
unless you want to know where it is. Good luck, and happy hunting.

After walking the 3.5km to the Bailey Bridge in the park, we were thankful that Rideau Rangers were able to give everyone a ride back to their cars. One more cache before heading home and this one was it. Did the calculations using the 4 digit # for the north and then the calculations using the 10 digit number from the sign (since the description said to use the sign) for the west. This put us about 30m too far east I think as we weren't finding the cache. Even stuck my head in the &quot;other&quot; tunnel on the other side of the road on the other side of the tunnel...if that makes any sense. So we had no choice but to resort to the clue which helped greatly in finding the cache. I have a feeling we were supposed to use the same 4 digit # that we used for the North as opposed to the phone # on the sign about the 4 digit number...I'm sure you'll set me straight on that. Had fun making noises in the tunnerl...off to head home now after a fulfilling day.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sixth Sanctum: Tower of Dreams&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 This is one of the few places where the orcs could not capture.
The orcs have tried many times, but to no avail. Mighty beings use
their dreams to defend the tower from all evil and only allow those
that are pure in mind and soul to survive the journey. There are
many traps set out around the tower and there is only one approach
and that is along the mighty Red River. Keep close to the rivers
edge for a safe journey and think good thoughts. If you travel any
other way you will surely fail to reach the
tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 Before attempting any cache in this series, you should refer to
Sixth Sanctum: The Final Journey for more information. You will
need to take note of the Adventurer, his Experience (exp) and the
Items that you find listed on the card in this cache. Do not remove
the card. When you log your finds on this series, give your
character a name and give details of your character's journey
throughout each location of the Sixth Sanctum. The King likes
stories and may have extra rewards available for those that tell
him of their heroic journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series consists of 11 caches. You will need
to visit each of the other 10 caches in this series in order to
find King Balthazar's steel chest.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sixth Sanctum&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 King Balthazar has enlisted your services to help retrieve his
prized steel chest which was stolen by the evil army of orcs along
with many other items. Although the King does not state it, it is
rumoured that his steel chest contains many mystical items of great
power and magic. The orcs left trails of destruction wherever they
went and scattered many of the King's items throughout the land.
The king has sent out many adventurers before you and they have all
failed. In each case, the orcs have captured each of the
adventurers that the King had previously recruited for his mission.
The orcs have made it known who their captives have been. Now is
the time to show your allegiance to King Balthazar and journey out
into the far reaches of the Sixth Sanctum to find who these
adventures before you were and what items have been taken by the
evil orcs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are able to find King Balthazar's steel
chest, he will be most pleased and will see to it that you are
greatly rewarded. There is also one special magical amulet for one
lucky adventurer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 This series consists of 11 caches of which this one is the final.
You will need to visit each of the other 10 caches in this series
in order to find this final cache where King Balthazar's Steel
Chest is located. Before attempting any cache in this series, read
all of the information on this page. You will need to take note of
the Adventurer, his Experience (exp) and the Items that you find
listed on the card in this cache. Do not remove the card. Also pay
attention to see if you see any orcs anywhere within the Sixth
Sanctum as King Balthazar might find this information useful when
the time comes to rise up against the evil orc empire. When you log
your finds on this series, give your character a name and give
details of your character's journey throughout each location of the
Sixth Sanctum. The King likes to hear your stories of your
adventures and has extra rewards available for those that tell him
of their heroic journeys and any vital information that could be
used to defeat the orc empire that has been playing havoc in the
Sixth Sanctum for far too long. You might find the charts and
information located below useful in aiding you in your search for
the steel chest.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 The 10 caches that you will need to visit to find this final are
as follows:&lt;br/&gt;
Sixth Sanctum: Ancient Valley of Unknowable Storms&lt;br/&gt;
Sixth Sanctum: Deserted Chamber of Voices&lt;br/&gt;
Sixth Sanctum: Foul Gorge of the Warriors&lt;br/&gt;
Sixth Sanctum: Grotto of Inescapable Demons&lt;br/&gt;
Sixth Sanctum: Marsh of Grand Dreams&lt;br/&gt;
Sixth Sanctum: Mortuary of Heaven&lt;br/&gt;
Sixth Sanctum: Ominous Refuge of the Assassins&lt;br/&gt;
Sixth Sanctum: Threshold of Eternity&lt;br/&gt;
Sixth Sanctum: Tomb of Salvation&lt;br/&gt;
Sixth Sanctum: Tower of Dreams&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Miscellaneous Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 --A number of the caches in this series are hidden on the ground
and may be difficult to find if there is a fair amount of snow on
the ground.&lt;br/&gt;
 --Some caches in this series should not be attempted in the
darkness due to areas being unavailable after hours.&lt;br/&gt;
 --Due to the nature of this challenge
and the area covered, the final is within 10 km of the posted
coordinates. The posted coords are merely an approximate center
point of most of the caches in this series and the approximate
intersection between the Northern\Southern most and Eastern\Western
most caches in this series.&lt;br/&gt;
--All coords were taken with a Garmin 60CS.&lt;br/&gt;
--Orcs can be very deceitful and sneaky. They are not to be
trusted.&lt;br/&gt;
--All caches are in plastic bags (newspaper or milk bags). I am
sure that these bags will get torn and ripped over time, so if you
have any extra newspaper or milk bags, bring them with you when you
go out to find the caches in this series just incase one needs a
new bag. The King would be pleased.&lt;br/&gt;
--&lt;strong&gt;When rehiding the caches, make sure the cache is inside
the plastic bag and wrapped around the cache and in almost all
cases the caches should be very well re-hidden so that no protion
of them can be seen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--If you have any questions or concerns or just need help with your
journey through the Sixth Sanctum, feel free to contact the King as
he is always willing to help out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;



 
 
&lt;br/&gt;
Each item that you find has a monetary value. In the Sixth Sanctum,
the currency most commonly used was known as the Bronze Gulden
(BG).&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do all of the following calculations for the chance to
possibly find the location of where the orcs have hidden King
Balthazar's steel chest.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A = Total value of all of the Armour you found multiplied by how
much Armour you found.&lt;br/&gt;
B = Total value of all of the Books you found multiplied by how
many Books you found.&lt;br/&gt;
C = Total value of all of the Devices you found multiplied by how
many Devices you found.&lt;br/&gt;
D = Total value of all of the Jewelry you found multiplied by how
much Jewelry you found.&lt;br/&gt;
E = Total value of all of the Potion you found multiplied by how
many Potions you found.&lt;br/&gt;
F = Total value of all of the Weapons you found multiplied by how
many Weapons you found.&lt;br/&gt;
G = Adventurer with the most experience multiplied by the
Adventurer with the least experience.&lt;br/&gt;
H = Amount of letters in the name of the Adventurer found in the
Marsh of Grand Dreams multiplied by ten.&lt;br/&gt;
X = Sum of A through H.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Divide X by 1000 and subtract that result from the following North
and West coords.&lt;br/&gt;
N43° 50.838&lt;br/&gt;
W79° 10.471&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last digit of the North Coords is 0.&lt;br/&gt;
Last digit of the West Coords is 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can check your calculations of King Balthazar's
Steel Chest at

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; Beware of orcs as there is much evidence of
their presence here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF prize is one of King Balthazar's magical amulets containing
great power. It is located in the bag with the log scroll.&lt;br/&gt;

After preparing a protection spell to hide the carriage we made our way into the darkness of the shadowed woods. Our location spells were not enough and we were subjected to many twists and turns as the woods seemed to change with every turn. Rivers that were not to be seen a minute ago were now a formidable challenge. Trees would uproot and cross the path we had just travelled.  The eyes were everywhere, yet outside the squalid beam of our lanterns. Always out of sight, yet always watching. We approached the Bridge of the River Styx and found it distorted, some would even say it bent to the will of the River. Some would turn back but we had come so far, and our quest was so near that we pressed on - very nearly falling into that cataclysmic gorge that dropped straight to the unforgiving River below. The eyes continued to watch, and occasionally a branch would reach out, as if to touch or grab yet it would freeze where it was if a moment's glance was given. Fearlessly we pressed on until the Chest was discovered. We could see names scrawled here from adventurers past. 

I only hope those intrepid adventurers made it safely out of the Woods, as we have - for I have yet to hear of any of them to this day....

However on this day the Golden Reliever would be commanded to remain at the fort to ward off unwanted intruders. Without my most trusted companion and working under the cover of darkness I would need to obtain reinforcements. Sir Laffsalotnot and fresh soliders Princess Yapsalot and Prince Bitesalot join me on this the most epic quest of all. Setting out into the land of vast battles we are guided by the light of a full moon. It isn't too long into our journey that the angry river has taken hold of our fiercest soldier, Prince Bitesalot. Prince Bitesalot is valiant in his effort to remain afloat while the Barbarian and Sir Laffsalotnot resist all temptation to sacrifice self in a misguided notion to save one. Time goes slow but feels like an eternity in the battle against the angry river. Almost as fast as it started it was over - the river will need to pick a weaker foe next time. Prince Bitesalot and Sir Laffsalotnot are wet but relieved this portion of the battle is over. We continue on our quest ever mindful that an angry river not satisfied may strike again. We move further inland and continue on. It isn't too much longer that our goal is satisfied, the King will be pleased!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;strong&gt;About a 2.5km round trip hike that will take through the
south side of the abandoned Cold Creek Conservation Area. We found
the hike to be very enjoyable with some spectacular views and
interesting structures along the way. I recommend that you give
yourself atleast 1.5 hours to do this cache and enjoy the
area.&lt;/strong&gt; And bonus points to anyone that can tell me how to
get to the other side of the river without getting wet.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Stage 1 - Old School House:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
N43°51.488&lt;br/&gt;
W79°40.765&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you will find an old school house. At the side of the road
is a green address sign with white numbers. The address has 4
digits. Mark the numbers as follows:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A = 1st digit of address.&lt;br/&gt;
B = 2nd digit of address.&lt;br/&gt;
C = 3rd or 4th digit of address (you choose).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2 - Pole With Numbers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
N43°52.266&lt;br/&gt;
W79°41.795&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you will find a pole with 6 numbers (which look like they
are in 2 rows) at about eye level on it, which is across from a
gate that enters the conservation area (We entered through here,
but there is also other gates just a little further up and a little
further down the road from where you are right now). If you total
the numbers it comes to 34. Mark the numbers as follows:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
D = 2nd number of top row minus 1st number of top row.&lt;br/&gt;
E = 2nd number of 2nd row.&lt;br/&gt;
F = 3rd number of 2nd row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3 - Awesome View:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
N43°52.294&lt;br/&gt;
W79°41.706
&lt;p&gt;Follow the path to the top of the hill. If you are lucky you
don't have to climb up here. But if you feel like walking down the
hill, it looks like there is a foundation to an old farmhouse at
the bottom. At the top of the hill, you will see an awesome view,
with lots of hydro towers in the distance. Now count the hydro
towers. Now close your eyes. How many do you see now? You can open
your eyes again.&lt;/p&gt;
G = Number of hydro poles you saw when I asked.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stage 4 - Stone Structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
N43°52.248&lt;br/&gt;
W79°41.678&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you will find a stone structure. Count how many rows of
bricks (stones) there are from the top to the bottom. Check around
as some bricks are missing and not everything is bricks. Some of it
is cement or wood that may look like bricks. Best to count on the
right hand side of the doorway when facing the structure, or on the
left wall when facing the structure. You will get a 2 digit number,
that when you add the 2 digits, it equals 10.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
H = 2nd digit of the amount of rows of bricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stage 5 - Car Remains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
N43°52.180&lt;br/&gt;
W79°41.580&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you will find the remains of a burnt car. Hold old are you?
You, not the car! You're really that old?&lt;/p&gt;
I = The lowest digit of your age if it is more than one digit
long.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stage 6 - The Hole&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
N43°52.169&lt;br/&gt;
W79°41.465&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you will find a hole in the ground, under the tree and also
some remains of a metal object which looks like there may have been
some sort of tower here at one point. What was the purpose of the
hole? Was it an old well or something? Climb into the hole. Be
safe, don't do anything stupid. Warning! Incase this is some sort
of actual well or bottomless pit to China, be very careful here and
don't go climbing in it without some strong rope to support you.
Use your brains and poke it with a stick first or something. Watch
for the mysterious blue crocodiles.&lt;/p&gt;
J = If you climbed into the hole, write down 3. If you didn't,
shame on you for not following instructions...go home!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stage 7 - Teepees!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
N43°52.228&lt;br/&gt;
W79°41.019&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are standing in the middle of a bunch of Teepees. Watch out
for the Indians! They are watching you! How many Teepees are there?
As a check, if you add the digits of the amount of Teepees you see,
it should total 5. Oh, and you are very close to the final cache
location. You can probably see it's hiding spot.&lt;/p&gt;
K = The amount of Teepees in this area.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Stage 8 - The Cache!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now have all the information that you need to find the
actual cache container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Calculate North Coordinates:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substitute the numbers accordingly that you found earlier in
your journey, to find the north coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
N43°KD.DCK&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Calculate West Coordinates:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substitute the numbers accordingly that you found earlier in
your journey, to find the west coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
W79°EG.HHF&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it, now go find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To count this as a find, you must sign the log sheet. Cache is a
regular Oxy Clean container. My son marked the general hiding spot
(you'll see what I mean when you get there). We placed it and
removed it from it's hiding spot with little effort. I can think of
a couple ways to get it and place it back. Please place the cache
back exactly where you found it. I hope you enjoy the hike and the
area as much as we did. Now if I could only find a place to cross
the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contacted the TRCA before placing this cache. They said that
even though this conservation area is closed, people can still use
it, but at their own risk. Such a large conservation area, that
it's a shame that it's closed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: XCJ37D - XCJ37D&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was a fun cache, both for the geocacher in me - and the photographer. We spent more time than we should have practicing stupid camera tricks at the schoolhouse. Didn't like the no-trespassing signs at the one gate but the others weren't marked so we parked over at one of them. 

More stupid camera tricks on the trail, and some difficulty locating the stone structure (easy enough - it was farther down the trail). There was a spider the size of an apple in there so I wasn't inclined to go inside any more than necessary. The final was a bit of a challenge to get to - seemed pretty dangerous but that situation resolved itself soon enough. Unfortunately, this also meant that the cache location changed about 10 feet or so - but not on the X or Y axis.....

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sixth Sanctum: Ancient Valley of Unknowable
Storms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 Storms are forever occurring in this area. Storms of all kinds.
They never stop. These storms beat down on any creature that enters
and only the strong will be able to make their way through this
ancient valley. It is a difficult journey and sometimes it is best
to take the longer way around to avoid the storm. It is also
rumoured that there are 2 large shafts here that have been sealed
off. Something great lies within these shafts, but no one can say
for sure if it's something good or something evil, but many have
their theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 Before attempting any cache in this series, you should refer to
Sixth Sanctum: The Final Journey for more information. You will
need to take note of the Adventurer, his Experience (exp) and the
Items that you find listed on the card in this cache. Do not remove
the card. When you log your finds on this series, give your
character a name and give details of your character's journey
throughout each location of the Sixth Sanctum. The King likes
stories and may have extra rewards available for those that tell
him of their heroic journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden close to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series consists of 11 caches. You will need
to visit each of the other 10 caches in this series in order to
find King Balthazar's steel chest.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Deep valleys and fierce winds greeted our every move. The highways of the ancient times were in shambles, washed out and grown over in places. We continued on lest our quest be lost and were rewarded. Upon returning to the carriage our army was reduced to two as news from Skae Corners brought Sir Lucifer and Lady Majestic back to their homelands.

in the series is a film canister (excluding the ones that

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Bouncy Bunny's Quest for Paradise&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing the many wonderful water falls which Ontario has to offer, Bouncy Bunny thought she needed some more adventure. She met up with her friends Dufus Dog and Kitty Cat and headed off for a day long geocaching adventure. First they were confronted by a river crossing near the top of a waterfall. They knew the cache was just on the other side. Bouncy Bunny dug in her backpack and pulled out a couple of items. Should they use the rope which she had nicely rolled around a can or the blow-up raft. “Of our past experiences, we may have to use a combination of both,” suggested Kitty Cat. With reeds filling several portions of the river, they also had to make sure that their rope did not get tangled in the reeds. “What if our rope is not strong enough?” asked Dufus Dog. “It’s a Nexus IXC version B rope,” replied Bouncy Bunny. “Nexus IXC? Didn’t I hear about some of those breaking?” asked Dufus Dog with a worried look on his face. “Yes, that was the older model, this is the new improved IXC version B, although I did hear that they will be coming out with a version E next year,” replied Bouncy Bunny. Bouncy Bunny suggested that Dufus eventually buys an E version when they come out, for their next adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they prepared the raft and the rope. “First we stand back and pray that we have a safe crossing of this river and that we don’t go over the falls. Even the most careful of geocachers have mishaps from time to time,” said Bouncy Bunny. When I need to be careful, I always am,” said Kitty Cat. They had spent quite a bit of time deciding and preparing the safest traversal of the river, and as the day went on a misty haze rolled across the area, from the falls. To be completely safe, they decided to cross the river individually, so Dufus Dog went first, since he was the strongest paddler. When he got across, he tied part of the rope to a rock on the bank, and the others pulled the raft back to their side. “Ok, who’s next,” yelled Dufus Dog across the river. “Can I next?” asked Kitty Cat, so she went across next. They all made it across the river safely and on the other side they found their own little paradise. What an adventure this was and a beautiful area. They thought that perhaps they could return here on New Years Eve next time and have a nice celebration. “I hope that if our adventures bring us to all these neat and wonderful places, that we can have a celebration each year at a different spot,” exclaimed Bouncy Bunny. They were so impressed by this wonderful location, that they almost forgot about the geocache that they wanted to find. The location definitely was the prize in this instance.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE END&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The find was really fun.  The kids took advantage of the recent snowfall to build a small snowman nearby.  I thought &quot;how cute&quot; and then they started pelting the snowman with snowballs.  Oh well...
Took nothing, left nothing, signed the log.

The cache is in a great location however finders will have to be discrete if the area is busy. Left a rain hat and liberated the TB.

Thanks for placing the cache and give my brain a brief exercise.</groundspeak:text>

posted co-ordinates.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When writing your log, please
follow the guidelines below:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;(Step 3 is very important)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.  Write a log
that is at least 150 words long. [please do not use to much slang
or contractions (can't, didn't, etc.)]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Tip:  You can lie
about your adventure if nothing exciting at all happened to
you.  Make up a story about how you battled off a dragon or
nearly drowned in the creek until a little native boy raised by
fleas rescued you and took you to his home in a tree trunk. 150
words is only a rough guideline.  Just don't write something
really short.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.  Run your log through an
online translator from English into any other language and then run
the translated text back through into English. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Some translators good
are:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://babelfish.yahoo.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
           
&lt;a href=&quot;http://translate.google.com/translate_t?hl=en&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;       &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldlingo.com/en/products_services/worldlingo_translator.html&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;http://translation.babylon.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3)
Fix the log, making sure you can understand what is being said but
still keeping grammatical errors intact.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4)
Publish your log, including the original English version
also.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5)
Read other people's logs to hear about their &quot;crazy&quot;
adventures!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;That's all there is to it!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for info on the cache and how to
get to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¤  You can access the park from the
posted Trailhead waypoint.  Parking is available on McCullock
Cres. in Ajax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¤ DO NOT try to access the cache from
Rossland Road.  You will be trespassing on PRIVATE PROPERTY
and that is not good. ONLY access from the supplied Trailhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¤ Terrain rating is 3.5 because of some
seasonal muddy patches and many trees to climb over and a
moderately steep hill to climb up part of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¤ Cache is in a large peanut butter
container (with camouflage tape).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¤ Please be stealthy if there are people
around and re-hide very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have fun Caching and writing your
log,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This series of geocaches will take you to some of my
favourite childhood playgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bring your dog, your kids, and anything else that
likes to run around and have a picnic and enjoy the
day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every cache
in the series is a film canister (excluding the ones that
specifically say so in the hint).  Some have camouflage tape
and some do not.  Please watch out for muggles as there are
usually lots out and about in these areas.  Please put the
caches back where you found them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sixth Sanctum: Ominous Refuge of the
Assassins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 This was once the home of the orcs before they wreaked havoc on
the land. A mighty sorceress, who some say is King Balthazar's
grandmother, observed how the orcs were destroying the land around
them and came through here ages ago dressed as a humble peasant.
She did not like what she saw and placed a curse on all orcs who
enter this area. It is said that any orc found here will turn into
a tree. Those that walk through the woods here say that they can
hear the grumblings of orc voices in the wind. One particular tree
is said to be the once mighty ruler of all orcs. He was the worst
of all of them and had one large horn growing from his deformed
head. Although the sorceress had great power, it is said that she
is now weak and her hold over the area will not last forever.
Beware if you spot the tree which was once the mighty ruler of the
orcs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 



&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 Before attempting any cache in this series, you should refer to
Sixth Sanctum: The Final Journey for more information. You will
need to take note of the Adventurer, his Experience (exp) and the
Items that you find listed on the card in this cache. Do not remove
the card. When you log your finds on this series, give your
character a name and give details of your character's journey
throughout each location of the Sixth Sanctum. The King likes
stories and may have extra rewards available for those that tell
him of their heroic journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache is hidden 180m from the posted coords. As
you enter the refuge, stay on the main trail heading in a
southernly direction until you get 202m from the entrance to the
refuge. Once you get to this point, project 86m at a bearing of
249°True. Look for the once mighty ruler of the orcs which now lies
in rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache contains a letterbox stamp. Please do not
take the stamp. Use it to stamp your own letterbox book. Bring your
own stamp pad or markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series consists of 11 caches. You will need
to visit each of the other 10 caches in this series in order to
find King Balthazar's steel chest.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

  Hearing tale of the battle between the King's soldiers and the Orc hordes from my home in the distant forests I, Dread the Halfling had been leery to join up with the quest until I was summoned by the people of the Hoop and Stick, to accompany them on a spirit quest to see what evil troubled their forest. 

  After a hearty meal of fowl and tubers washed down with some ale, we set off on our quest to investigate further the tales of goings on in the forest by the river. There seemed to be a certain uneasiness about the place as if at any moment the trees themselves might come to life and strike out. Definitely some witchcraft held the forest in its bind. We made our way along the ice covered trails to a dense patch of trees which lead us to some kind of twisted wire barrier that was put in place to keep the curious out...or to keep something in.

  The snap of a twig from the other side of the barrier alerted us to their presence. A small group of Orcs were gathered around a grotesque looking tree and chanting in low tones. They hadn’t spotted our group yet and appeared to be focused on the tree.  The Hoop and Stick people had a legend that no Orc can step foot in these woods without being transformed in some way. If this was so, then why were there Orcs here? Was the power that kept the Orcs at bay diminishing?
  We aided each other in crossing the twisted wire barrier and edged closer to get a better view. That’s when someone spotted it. One of the King’s steel chests lay tucked in a copse away from where the orcs were gathered. Knowing that the King would pay handsomely for the return of the chest we inched forward, keeping an eye on the Orcs. The chanting grew louder as we neared. We reached the chest unnoticed and opened it. That’s when all hell broke loose...

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sixth Sanctum: Tomb of Salvation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 There are many tombs here and only the Tomb of Salvation allows
one with a pure heart to enter. If you choose the wrong tomb, you
too will be entombed in your inner prison
forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 Before attempting any cache in this series, you should refer to
Sixth Sanctum: The Final Journey for more information. You will
need to take note of the Adventurer, his Experience (exp) and the
Items that you find listed on the card in this cache. Do not remove
the card. When you log your finds on this series, give your
character a name and give details of your character's journey
throughout each location of the Sixth Sanctum. The King likes
stories and may have extra rewards available for those that tell
him of their heroic journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series consists of 11 caches. You will need
to visit each of the other 10 caches in this series in order to
find King Balthazar's steel chest.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

      Cache A Day&lt;br/&gt;Mini
      Challenge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A miniature version of the classic &quot;A Cache A Day&quot;
Challenge. This challenge cache is one of a series of 12 challenges
focused on finding a cache on every day for a specified month. All
caches in this series have been placed by members of the
Golden Horseshoe Monthly
Geocaching Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache IS at the posted coords. You may not
claim a find on this cache until you have met the requirements of
this Challenge cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rules
Summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find and log (at least) one
cache for every day of the month specified on this mini
challenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finds do not need to be during the
same year. I.e., your qualifying find for March 1 may be from 2008,
for March 2 from the present year, for March 3 from 2004, and so
on. As long as at some point in your caching career you found a
cache on every day of the specified month.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;All past, present and future finds
count.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;No editing logs or logging your finds
on a different day. The day you physically found the cache is the
day you write your found it log as. Of course just like with
everything to do with geocaching, you are on the honour
system.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Provide some kind of list, chart,
bookmark, etc as proof of completing the challenge portion of this
cache. You may find the calendar on this
link
useful.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please try the other caches placed as part
of the GHMGC A Cache A Day - Mini Challenge

It is a bit of a hike to get to this cache...2.4km one way from the
front gate of the Cold Creek Conservation Area. Make sure to look
up the 3 earthcaches there as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located within Glen Haffy Conservation Area. Near the posted coordinates, you can find out some more information about the Buried Escarpment.

In this central portion of the Niagara Escarpment very few exposures of the bedrock strata are visible. This area lay between 3 major lobes of ice during the Pleistocene glaciation, resulting in a massive accumulation of glacial till in the form of morainic ridges and extensive deposits of sand and gravel from subsequent meltwater. The controlling topographical influence of the underlying Escarpment strata is still evident, however, from the elevation of the area above the lowlands to the east and south.

This is a simple 2 stage multi that will take you past some features of the Bruce Trail.

You may enter through the main entrance on Airport Rd (Fee - April to October) to the west or hike in from Coolihan's Sideroad (free) to the south. </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>If you are unsure of where to go, I suggest you find the Bruce Trail (White Blazes) and walk along it. Both the Red trail to your east and the Blue trail to your North will take you to the Bruce Trail and the location of where the edge of the Niagara Escarpment is located.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I have been enjoying visits
to Saint John New Brunswick for several years and decided to honour
this fair Canadian city with a cache. As Canada’s oldest
incorporated city, Saint John is rich with historical sites and is
also full of fun geocaching opportunities. In 2010 I had the
pleasure of meeting some of the local cachers and got to experience
some of their hides. In particular I want to shout out to the fine
folks of the Maritime Geocaching Association. The MGA, led by
Dragoon and company does a fantastic job of keeping the geocaching
community informed of local activities and organizes events
throughout the area. And I’ll never forget the warm welcome I
received by the members at kfdcanada’s “Breakfast at
Kay’s” event and will look forward to my future
visits.

OK so this was going to be a simple cache in the Stouffville area
to honour my friends on the coast but at the last minute I decided
to add a bit of a twist. The puzzle is simple enough but
you’ll have to learn few things about “The Loyalist
City”.

Just as you thought...the cache is not at the posted coordinates but is within 1km

The cache is located at the
following coordinates:
N 43° AB.CDE
W 079°FG.HIJ

A.) Saint John is the largest population centre sitting on a bay that boasts
the highest tides in the world.
A = Number of letters in the name of the bay.

B.)  Saint
John was home to one of New Brunswick's most influential
politicians, Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley. Tilley crafted the
province's entry into Confederation and played an important role in
the development of Canada's political system. This “Father of
Confederation” rests in Saint John’s Fernhill
cemetery.
B = The third digit of the year of Sir Samuel Tilley’s death.

C.)     
&amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;Saint
John’s coat of arms features some recognizable Canadian
wildlife.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;
= The number of
beavers on the crest minus the number of moose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;![if !supportLists]&amp;gt;D.)    
&amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;Late in
the 19th century Saint John's largest fire breaks out in Portland,
and quickly engulfs most of the South End of the city. For 9 long
hours the fire rages on - leaving 13,000 people homeless,
destroying over 1,600 buildings, and consuming most of the
commercial district. When it was over, the fire had destroyed over
80 hectares (200 hundred acres) and 1612 structures including eight
churches, six banks, fourteen hotels, eleven schooners and four
woodboats in just over a nine hour period. Nearly all the public
buildings, the principal retail establishments, lawyers' offices
and all but two printing firms were burned in the
inferno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;
= Add the digits
of the year of the “great fire” then add the digits of
your total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;![if !supportLists]&amp;gt;E.)     
&amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;From
1993 to 2003 Saint John was home to AHL hockey team the Saint John
Flames. During this time the Flames went to the Calder Cup final
twice. In 1998 they 
lost to the Philadelphia Phantoms but on their next cup run they
won on home ice at Harbour Station against the
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, the farm team of the Pittsburgh
Penguins. The Flames won the series four games to two with a final
score of 1–0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;
= The last digit
of the year the SJ Flames won the Calder Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;![if !supportLists]&amp;gt;F.)     
&amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;Saint
John was one of the world's leading shipbuilding centers, so it is
no surprise that the roof of the City Market resembles the inverted
keel of a ship. Hand-hewn timbers and dove-tailed joints that have
stood fast for more than century attest to the skill and experience
of the builders. Saint John’s City Market was built prior to
the great fire. The building survived the fire and is still open
for business today. The ringing of the Market Bell every morning
and evening, a tradition at the City Market, signals opening and
closing of the day's business. Today the keeper of that tradition
is the Deputy Market Clerk who oversees day to day
affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;
= The year of the
great fire minus the year the City Market building
opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;During
their 10 years the Saint John Flames produced some NHL’s
greats including Martin St. Louis. St. Louis wears his jersey
number in tribute to his childhood hero, diminutive former Montreal
Canadiens star Mats Näslund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;J&lt;/b&gt;

digits of St. Louis or Nasland’s number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations
to Rebel10 on the FTF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/bookmarks/view.aspx?guid=af051d70-a552-4729-95ab-feabaaa16ccc&quot;&gt;
&quot;Restin'&quot;&lt;/a&gt; caches are
a series of micro-caches that take you to beautiful and some
forgotten cemeteries throughout the area. We introduce you to these
cemeteries as a way of exploring our local history, and those who
were early settlers here. While visiting we hope that you can
reflect on their lives and contributions to the communities that
they helped build into where we live today. Please respect their
resting place and ensure that extreme care is taken during your
visit. Please bring your own pen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very old
cemetery.  Some of the stones are so old that they are
unreadable and some tree roots have even caused some stones to tilt
to the side. Take some time to read the stones. I saw one stone
that I think said that the person died sometime in the 1700's and
was 50-some years old. This could mean that they were born in the
1600's!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've noticed in some old cemeteries that there
are misspellings on the stones.  I saw, at one of my other
Restin' cache locations, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=76527e2a-7c24-4c5a-9221-611b98787c8c&quot;&gt;Flinton
United&lt;/a&gt;) that they had spelled &quot;died&quot; as &quot;dide&quot;.  This
shows how many people were not educated to the standards we are
today.  On the photo below, the stone is missing the Y in
&quot;days&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;If you walk through any cemetery that's
been in operation for more than a hundred years, you'll soon
notice two things. The first is the sheer number of children that
used to die before they were old enough to crawl and how many
families had two, three, or more children that didn't live to
their tenth birthdays.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The second is an unusual obsession with
precision exhibited on many markers. I can understand marking a
dead child's age as three weeks or 22 days, but many of the
markers for older people also include precise counts of months and
days. It always seems a little odd to see a grandmother's age
tallied up in the same manner as a toddler's.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A lot of people shy away from cemeteries, but
I always find them fascinating. Taking a stroll through an old
cemetery is like walking through a highly-condensed social history
of a region. As you progress from older graves to newer ones, the
names change, occupations shift, family relationships become clear,
and tributes to achievements both major and minor abound.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The above picture is a picture of an old
tombstone in this cemetery]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">October 31, 2010 marked 1 year of Geocaching for me. The experience has been more diverse and enjoyable than I had expected so I thought I’d celebrate with a “1 year hide”. As we all know, Geocaching can be a roller coaster ride of pleasant walks, challenging hikes, frustrating puzzles, easy finds on our way somewhere and discovery of places we never would have gone. But above all it’s just plain fun and that’s what keeps me coming back so that was the thought behind preparing this cache. No tricks, just fun, so get out there and enjoy.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is not at the posted coordinates, but within 30 km. When
you figure out where the hidden village is, you'll also find a
cache there. This cache has the potential to be very difficult to
retrieve, so you might need some assistance or object to help you
(...a small child will come in handy).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Bouncy Bunny and her new Friends&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Bouncy Bunny went for a walk alone in the valley today. The
valley was filled with many trails and many hills. As she stood on
the trail looking around the wonderful valley, she spotted some
movement on the hillside of the valley near a large tree. She left
the trail to investigate, and then she saw something leaping up and
into the tree. The middle part of the tree was a little high for
her, so she took a running jump and ... “aaaahh”, she fell into the
tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Psst, come here,” said a mysterious voice. As Bouncy Bunny
approached the voice, the area around her started getting brighter.
She was amazed at what she saw. It was a vast village, but how was
that possible. And what was even more amazing was the hundreds of
small bears going about their lives, each only about a foot tall,
and each of them with vastly different coloured and patterned
fur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the bears quickly gathered around Bouncy Bunny, as most of
them had never seen a rabbit before, let alone seen the outside
world. To them, this place was their home and the only world that
they knew. All the bears were very friendly and they welcomed
Bouncy Bunny with open arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was getting late now, and Bouncy Bunny knew she had to get
home, otherwise her parents would start to get worried about her.
So as she was saying goodbye, the bears told her to wait a few more
minutes so that they could take some pictures of themselves with
their new friend. “Here are some pictures for you to remember us
by. Be sure to hang onto them if you want to visit us again,
otherwise you most likely won’t be able to find us.” said one of
the bears. The bear showed Bouncy Bunny the way out and as she
turned around to wave goodbye, the bear was already gone, and so
was the entrance way to this mystical place. So she headed home
with her pictures and many wonderful memories of this place. She
just hoped that she would be able to find her way back here one
day.&lt;/p&gt;

My buddy and I headed out at around 12:00am to find this one.  beautiful night to be out in the bush with a headlamp and nothing else!! [:D]

Made our way to the cache location with ease and was able gather the cache container, sign the log etc.

Interrupted a few non-cachers in the parking lot who were inspecting the back of their car.  I am not sure why they would come all the way out to this location just to clean out the back seat of their car? [;)]

Took knitted thingy, left Yo-Yo.

The cache is in Durham Regional Forest, the tract with an entrance and parking on Wagg Road between Concessions 6 and 7. Some very light bushwhacking is required for the last few metres. It is a very family friendly area.
The container is a small camo’d Lock n’ Lock with room for Geo Coins or Travel Bugs.
Hope you enjoy the find as much as I have my first 100. Maybe you’ll find this one and celebrate a Milestone too.
Please enjoy the little treat waiting for the FTF.
Congratulations to KDotBlueDot for the FTF! </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Vista Park in Keswick is one of the highest points of land in
the Georgina area and conveniently looks over most of Cooks Bay and
the mouth of the Holland River. This park provides one of the most
amazing views of the lake that you will find anywhere along it's
shores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being that this park faces West, you will find that this park is
quite possibly the most amazing spot to take in a sunset or watch
the stars at night time. Please try to take some amazing pictures
of the view and post them to the cache! When at the cache location.
Face North and notice the near 260 degree vista view. Such an aptly
named park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in the vicinity of the cache is Keswick's first water
tower. Although this isn't much of a &quot;Tower&quot; as such, it is a
unique landmark that can be seen from all the way across the lake
in Innisfil. You might also notice that from this viewpoint, if you
look to the North and slightly West, you can see the Barrie Tower
well in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking can be unmistakably found at the end of West Park
Heights Road at the cul-de-sac. This is the &quot;Official&quot; park
parking. Be advised that parking here is only available until 9pm.
There's no gates as such, but thats what the signs say. Just
relaying the info.&lt;/p&gt;

loved to come here to enjoy the lake, a sunset, get out onto the
ice in the winter and just to relax. It's not the best park in
Georgina, but it's a nice one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to share your pictures of the park, or a
sunset, ice fishing, or anything else that you encounter at the
park on the cache page. The cache is a small container in a
decently out-of-the-way spot (for this park). Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

walking through the forest and thinking... &quot;Man, they really are
clearcutting the heck outta this tract&quot;. Much like what was
happening to me at that point in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember walking past this particular section of the trail
which was dark, dank and enclosed and looking over and seeing light
coming through the trees. So I had to take a look!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped and stared at the light for a while in this spot. It
was simply peaceful. Several years later, I have returned to place
a cache here.&lt;/p&gt;

irrelevant, but plan for a longer trip as your canoe will be slowed
by the vegetation in the water. At times it will be more like
paddling across a flooded carpet.&lt;br/&gt;

The cachers present when this was placed were:&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Attempting this from land? Good luck with that idea.&lt;br/&gt;
You are recommended to access this cache via canoe. Motorized boats
just are not going to make it here (if you can get them in the
water!)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Two access points are provided on the listing. You can put in at 11
Concession, paddling against the (barely noticable) current and
with the typical wind, or put in at Highway 7 and paddle with the
current but against typical winds. I recommend the north put-in at
11 concession - it's quieter and more scenic.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is a &quot;protein container&quot; (courtesy of H.F.Reign) and it's
very easy to spot, once you are in the correct location.&lt;br/&gt;

I'm very happy that you decided to grab this one at night.  We were wondering if anyone was brave enough to try it after dark.  Our night cache canoe adventure was on an open river in the middle of Cambridge.  Yours was 5 times the distance on a small weed filled river in the middle of nowhere.  Way to go! [:)]

&lt;p&gt;the 4th in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;punisher series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
lives up to it's name. A crazy walk this will prove to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no tricks with this cache. Simply put, its just a
punishing Multi-cache. The provided co-ordinates are for the
starting stage for this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;b&gt;dirtbike&lt;/b&gt; trails that criss-cross these woods
and fields. They are &lt;b&gt;USED&lt;/b&gt;, primarily on the weekends, so be
alert and aware for these folks. They are &lt;i&gt;allowed&lt;/i&gt; here.
Please respect their presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of this area are gorgeous and parts of this area are
pretty dismal with trash and torn-up ground. I won't promise your
walk will be altogether pleasant, but the walk does have its
moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-ordinates will be located at each stage within plain
view. You may need to reach, crouch or climb but not in excess.
Once you find the first stage, you will understand how the multi
works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can choose to follow what limited trails there are
throughout this area to find the cache, but I cannot promise you it
will help you to each stage. I did not necessarily follow the
trails to place each stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park either on Salem Road, or at the movie theatre parking near
Bryne Drive at the very south end of Barrie. Make sure to also find
Cache a Flick which is also in these woods and
Downs North which is also nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



Thank you for considering our new series of
caches. We do not consider these caches to be for everyone. These
caches will test your mental, physical and awareness abilities
probably unlike any other cache you have previously visited.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 We have designed these caches to be difficult. We cannot imagine
that everyone will be able to find every cache in the series
however we welcome anyone to try. In some cases, the
cache-placements may be in plain sight. In others, you will have
more difficult tasks to perform. Either way, rest assured that your
caching abilities, desires and limits will be put to the test.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 For those who do not wish to attempt to find these caches, we do
understand. Please remember that everyone has an &quot;Ignore&quot; list
through their account and they are able to use that functionality
without concern or prejudice.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 For those who decide to attempt these caches, prepare to be
punished.&lt;br/&gt;

This was a lovely winter day.  Starting out about an inch of snow on the ground which was just barely covering the tracks of those who had gone before, actually yesterday based upon when “ghost” signed the log.  I stuck to the trails for much of it and this included using the road between stage 3 and 4.  Bushwhacked from 10 to the final.  Felt some burn here.  Good snow flurry after stage 10 that put about 2 inches on the ground. Spent 30 minutes at stage 8.  Found the marker 11 meters 96 degrees away.  Otherwise all other cords are bang on.  My fault for not finding it sooner here.

6325 meters includes walking/parking at the theatre.  3 hours 11 minutes including wasted time and R&amp;R stops.  Cache in good shape except pages in logbook are lose.  Took cars left pewter keychain.

Great cache and I enjoyed all the scenery and wildlife.  Did not see any trail riders.  You certainly made good use of this bush.

So what’s next?  You guys run out of ideas?

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I placed &quot;Cache a Flick&quot; in a location which I have just recently discovered.  This land is actually listed at part of the Township of Innisfil, but borders very closely with Barrie's south end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area is thankfully now listed as a &quot;Natural Regeneration&quot; area which is good news for the prevention of development from taking this area over.  Unfortunately however there has been quite a bit of debris scattered around the outlying trails in the area.  This would take a pretty hefty CITO team to fix up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area is located directly at the junction of 2 main snowmobile trails heading East, and North, and although Dirtbike traffic has been outlawed in the area, there are still tracks indicating that they are around at times, so be on the lookout!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cache is my typical smaller tupperware style container, and contains some neat trading stuff.  Any of you that have found my other caches may recognize where the cache is hidden when you see it. Bushwhacking is imminent with this cache, but I will let the terrain rating speak for itself with this one.  There is definately some effort required to make it to this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parking can be found at N44 19.416 W79 41.026 The cache name was chosen for what is within proximity of the parking co-ordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the area.  These are definately exceptional walking trails for the family, and for the dog.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">First of eleven caches today. It's an interesting area, but there was no less than a dozen trucks, car with trailers and even a cube van with a ramp behind it. The place was swarming with dirt bikes. In some spots the bikes are &quot;bushwacking&quot; and forging new trails. We removed several strategically placed beeer cans that had been attached to trees as reflectors for riding the trails at night.
Somehow we managed to find the cache &amp; get out without actually crossing paths with a bike, though that was probably due to the fact that we often avoided the trails to avoid the bikes. It was nonetheless a nice area. Took an ornament &amp; left a Canada magnet.

     in the core of Downtown Barrie? &lt;em&gt;That can't be
     possible!&lt;/em&gt; Well believe it!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although not large by any means, you will find that when you
visit this cache at Audrey Milligan Park that the significance of
this park is apparent. Beavers, Swans, Ducks, Squirrels, Turtles
and countless varieties of songbirds are only part of the wildlife
that is available to be seen at the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to plan for some time to stay and enjoy the park as it
was meant to be seen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;About Audrey Milligan
Park&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;p&gt;About 1940, Mr. Bert Young purchased the
property on the South side of Perry Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, he cleaned up the swamp behind
his property removing dead trees and trash, and built a dam to
create a wildlife pond. Trees were planted, foot paths established,
benches and bridges constructed and the first pair of Swans
introduced. With the help of neighbor Derek Jones, a dike was built
to control silt build-up and the Beaver dams monitored to control
water levels. It was a labor of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many bird and animal species and different
flora became established, the area became a favorite quiet place
for local residents. Mr. Young's vision of the park had become a
reality. Mr. Young moved away in 1981. The care and feeding of the
swans passed to his son Doug and later to Mr. Jones who continues
to supervise the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1990, Miss Audrey Milligan willed her
property on the west side of the ponds to the City for parkland.
The City purchased part of the Young property and named the area
&quot;Audrey Milligan Park&quot;. The Huronia Rotary Club built new bridges
and started a major yearly clean-up in 1992. Ducks Unlimited
installed nesting boxes and signs in 1994 and continues to monitor
wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995, City Council officially named the pond
beside Perry Street &quot;Young-Jones Pond&quot; to recognize the years of
dedication by Bert Young and Derek Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;About The
Cache&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This cache is not large, but will contain enough space for small
trade items. It is well hidden from the muggle-passer-by, but
should not be hard at all for a geocacher to locate. It is close
enough to the trail that anyone can see you doing the geo-dance so
please approach your find with caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 Cache Placer is a member of the following fine
organizations!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Got out and studied the sign comparing it to the map on the GPS and then we figured it all out and followed the trail and footprints right to the cache. This certainly is a nice area and I think the hundreds of ducks here were very curious as to what we were up to.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Bayfield Urban Lunchtime Cache!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created the BULC in the interest of people who are caching in
a relatively short time period (like on their lunch!) This cache is
located in one of the very few areas left in the City of Barrie
where actual greenery exists, and should be fairly easy to
find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you stand near the cache, its interesting to notice that
all around the area is surrounded by malls, supershoppingplexes,
Apartment buildings, yet, squirrels run by your feet seemingly
unaware of their urban prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend parking under the tallest landmark in the area. This
is unmistakable when you get near the cache area. If this is hard
to find, you can always park at the WalMart and walk across the
road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are done with this Cache, please sign one of the log
papers and rehidethe cache well in its location. This area does get
travelled frequently by people from the nearby apartments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This cache has been placed by a Central Ontario
Geocacher!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Matchedash Wetlands&lt;/strong&gt; can be accessed from
Swift Rapids Road (high clearance 4 wheel drive vehicle
recommended) and are geographically located within the southern
portion of the Canadian Shield, which is the largest shield in the
world. The area owes its present-day appearance to both a very long
period of erosion, which has worn down contours that were once
spectacular and also much more recent events which occurred during
the last glacial period which ended 10,000 years ago. Like
monstrous machines, the ice sheets literally scraped and denuded
the area, pushing loose soil ever farther in front of them.
The glaciers also greatly disrupted the watercourses, filling creek
beds and carving canals. Many poorly drained depressions as well as
natural faults in the bedrock were left behind and these formed
millions of lakes, ponds and wetlands which give this ecozone it's
distinctive character. These upheavals explain the young and
somewhat erratic character of the current hydrographic network,
with its multitude of lakes and swamps and its series of falls and
rapids. The multitude of rivers and lakes in the entire region is
caused by the watersheds of the area being so young and in a state
of sorting themselves out with the added effect of post-glacial
rebound. The area originally consisted of very large mountains
(about 12,000 meters in height) with much volcanic activity,
but over the millennia the area was eroded to its current
topographic appearance of relatively low relief and contains some
of the most ancient volcanoes on Earth. The wetlands here are
freshwater and while driving along the Swift Rapids Road one can
see at least 4 of the 5 examples of the types of wetlands indicated
below including a spectacular and very eerie example of a swamp
that goes right up to and is almost level with the road during the
Spring season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wetland is an area of land whose soil is saturated with
moisture either permanently or seasonally. Such areas may also be
covered partially or completely by shallow pools of water. There
are many different types of wetlands. The water found in wetlands
can be saltwater, freshwater, or brackish. Wetlands are considered
the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wetlands are not land or water, but a fluid combination of both,
wetlands are among the most productive habitats on Earth. Wetlands
are all built on a simple foundation: water becomes trapped, either
through poor drainage, periodic flooding or by coastal barriers
such as sandbars, and a wetland -- that unique mix of land and
water -- is born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this beginning, wetlands develop in a number of ways
depending on local climate conditions, the availability of
nutrients, and the geography and soils of a site. They also change
over time: an open marsh may dry out enough to become a wooded
swamp, only to revert back to open marsh again after heavy
flooding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wetlands represent one of the most important life support
systems in the natural environment. Wetlands provide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A water filtration system...removing contaminants, suspended
particles and excessive nutrients, improving water quality and
renewing water supplies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An irreplaceable habitat...nesting, feeding and staging ground
for several species of waterfowl and other wildlife such as
reptiles and amphibians, and also for many species at risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A high quality spawning and nursery area for many species of
fish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural shoreline protection...protecting coastal areas from
erosion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A reservoir...helping to control and reduce flooding through
water storage and retention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A source of oxygen and water vapour...playing a vital role in
the natural atmospheric and climatic cycles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recreational activities...hiking, birdwatching and
fishing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The functions and values of wetlands are becoming increasingly
clear to scientists and those who manage wetlands. However, the
difficulty faced by these individuals is how to communicate these
functions and values in a way that will be understood by land
owners, government regulators and the public. In other sectors of
the economy, the most common way of demonstrating the value of
something is to quote a price. But what is the price of a wetland? 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The five major freshwater wetlands types in Ontario
are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marshes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
These wetlands are periodically or permanently covered by standing
or slowly moving water. Marshes are rich in nutrients and are
characterized by an emergent vegetation of reeds, rushes, cattails
and sedges. Water remains within the rooting zone of these plants
for most of the growing season. Marshes are the most productive
wetlands habitat.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Swamps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Swamps are dominated by shrubs or trees. They may be flooded
seasonally or for long periods of time. Swamps are both nutrient
rich and productive. Vegetation may be composed of coniferous or
deciduous forest or tall thickets. Swamps are most common in
temperate areas of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bogs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Bogs are peat-covered wetlands in which the vegetation shows the
effects of a high water table and a general lack of nutrients. Due
to poor drainage and the decay of plant material, the surface water
of bogs is strongly acidic. Although they are dominated by sphagnum
mosses (peat) and heath shrubs, bogs may support trees. More common
in northern Ontario and rare in the south, bogs are the least
productive of all wetland types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fens:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
These wetlands are characterized by a high water table with slow
internal drainage by seepage down low gradients. Their surface
waters may be acidic or alkaline. Fens are not as low in nutrients
as bogs and as a result are more productive. Although fens are
dominated by sedges they may also contain shrubs and trees. Like
bogs, they are more common in the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shallow Open Water:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
These wetlands include potholes and sloughs (ponds), as well as
waters along rivers and lakeshore areas. They are usually
relatively small bodies of standing or flowing water commonly
representing a transitional stage between lakes and marshes, or
between spring high water levels and levels during the remainder of
the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions to Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post in your log the observations you made such as what types of animals did you see and how deep the water is. What type of wetland do you think this is an why?&lt;/p&gt;  This is a beautiful spot. Please take care of it and be respectful and observant of yoru surroundings.</groundspeak:long_description>

Ça faisait longtemps que je n'avais pas mis le pied dans ce coin là. Quand j'étais petit, nous avions un chalet au Lac Hélène et mon père m'amenait à la chasse à la perdrix dans cette forêt. Tout a bien changé depuis ce temps, je ne retrouve plus mes points de repère. Les petits chalets sont devenus des maisons, tout a perdu son cachet d'en temps. Le petit sentier étroit que j'empruntais pour aller au lac Adéline est disparu sous la pelouse d'un bungalow. On n’arrête pas le progrès... De nouveaux sentiers ont fait leur apparition. J'en ai fait le tour, vous pouvez voir le réseau sur cette carte. Pour ceux que ça intéresse, voici un lien ou vous pourrez récupérer un fichier GPX des sentiers. (visit link)
Comme ça vous n'aurez pas à passer à travers bois pour vous rendre aux caches de ce secteur.

Merci tifred pour la cache et de m'avoir fait revenir par ici.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">L’idée de cette cache m’est venue après en avoir fait quelques-unes à Québec sous le thème Les Grands Disparus.
Chaque année de nouvelles entreprises, associations et nouveaux produits voient le jour au Québec. Quelques années plus tard, ils ont disparus!
Vous souvenez-vous de : Tremblay &amp; Frères d’Évain

En 1946, Adrien et Victor Tremblay débutent par le rabotage du bois brut puis s’ajoute la mouture des céréales pour animaux. Une grange permet d’entreposer du foin qu’ils livrent l’hiver avec de l’avoine aux entrepreneurs forestiers. En retour, ils obtiennent du bois brut pour la revente l’été suivant.
Le commerce additionne les produits de quincaillerie, de plomberie, de portes et fenêtres et l’équipement agricole John Deere.
En 1962, c’est la construction de l’élévateur à grains. Au fil des ans, des entrepôts s’ajoutent. En 1979, une succursale ouvre à Val-d’Or. En 1999, Tremblay &amp; Frères d’Évain ferme ses portes.
Sous la présidence de Clément Charrette, Uni-Verre ouvre ses portes en 2003. 
Réf : Évain 1935 – 2010  75e ça se fête en famille

Bien que cette cache ait été installée avec l’autorisation du propriétaire, il est peut-être préférable de faire cette cache en dehors des heures d’ouverture du commerce.
La cache contient seulement le carnet de visite.
Apportez votre crayon.
Bonne chasse!

J'ai attendu aujourd'hui (un samedi) pour faire cette cache. La dernière fois que je suis passé ici, il y avait trop de monde pour me risquer à la faire. Bravo, belle idée de faire des caches à connotation historique. On en apprend toujours un peu plus avec ce genre de caches. Quand j'étais petit garçon, je venais avec mon père et cet élévateur à grain m'impressionnait toujours. Je me sentais petit quand on passait à côté.

Bravo Tifred pour cette cache!</groundspeak:text>

Même si cette cache porte le nom de glissade, vous n’en trouverez pas sur place. Même pas de vestige. La cache est localisée près d’un endroit où il y a plus d’une vingtaine d’années, le club de ski de fond entretenait une glissade pour amuser les enfants pendant que les parents faisaient du ski.
Comme il y a de la circulation menant à la mine Abcourt et au ski de fond, il est recommandé d’utiliser le stationnement du club et d’en profiter pour faire les autres caches des environs.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Une série de quatre petites caches sont installées pour votre plaisir au Club de ski de fond d‘Évain qui débute ses activités à l’automne 1974 et qui est officiellement fondé le 30 décembre 1976. 

Cache située près du sentier La Balade, sentier longeant le chemin menant à la mine Abcourt. Comme il y a de la circulation menant à la mine, il est recommandé d’utiliser le stationnement du club de ski de fond et d’en profiter pour faire les autres caches du secteur.
Si vous faites cette cache en hiver, S.V.P., faites attention de ne pas endommager la piste de ski de fond.
