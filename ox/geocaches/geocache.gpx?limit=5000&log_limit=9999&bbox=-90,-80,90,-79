            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a replacement to the original Cypress Hollow. This was a
great cache and deserves to stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Park and grab. Easy wheelchair access and low muggle area (with
periodic spikes in activity, of course). Note, however, that the
cache is only available between 9am and 5pm every day of the
week&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cache is a medium plastic jar container. It's just outside
the park, so there is NO admission fee required. There is no need
to climb the fence or otherwise enter the park to find the cache.
Park in the main parking lot and take a short walk to find it.
(Since there is no lockable gate to the park itself, the main gate
at the road closes around 5pm and prevents access to both the
parking lot and the cache.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cypress Gardens &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cypressgardens.info/&quot;&gt;(visit link)&lt;/a&gt; is a beautiful park outside Goose
Creek, SC and a longstanding scenic stop for visitors to
Charleston. It's been the filming location for several motion
pictures, including Swamp Thing, The Patriot (a few of the props
can still be seen if you know where to look), and The Notebook (the
full list of films is on the website).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you find the cache, take time to go inside the park ($10
admission fee) and see all the elements of the lowcountry swamps.
Take a boat (now free with the park admission or get a guided swamp
tour for $5) and ride through the cypress and tupelo swamp. Walk
through the butterfly house and see the local butterflies, birds,
and flowers. Visit the indoor (air-conditioned!) aquarium with
several lowcountry freshwater species of fish and amphibians and
the reptile center with local and international snakes, alligators,
and lizards. Stroll along some the 4.5 miles of paths along the
water's edge and through the nature trails to see the wildlife in
its natural setting.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>It's hidden in a fiberglass shelter.
If you saw The Patriot, you've seen the hiding place.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Original contents : 'Geo-note', small log, skeleton key, a Bahama Islands one cent piece, 1GB SD card, small necklace pendant and a small round magnet. Also included, as a first to find prize, is a newly activated micro-sized Geocoin. Please bring your own writing utensil. And remember, I do like magnets ;)</groundspeak:long_description>

Turn left beside the Nucor cold finish sign then make an immediate right onto Creek Crossing Rd. After the gravesite is a fork in the road and the pavement ends (after a good rain you might want to park and walk unless you have a 4x4, only about a 1/2 mile at the most, stay to the right at the fork).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a clear flip-top container. There used to be a bridge here across the creek. Nothing left now but a few post jutting from the creek. Don't know the history of the bridge or how old it is, but if anyone does please let me know. This is a good fishing spot at the right time of year. </groundspeak:long_description>

Ohhh the cache ... since Mvillian has given up most of his fishing holes, we were real glad to see this one pop up!  We like to fish almost as much as we like to cache!

We took the direct route ... Mike is one of the few to log Bushwack Bob's &quot;Directisimo Bushwacking Coin.&quot; :)  Afterall, why limit ourselves to a 2 terrain when we can do two ravines and 1/2&quot; bobbed wire (errrr briars) and turn it in to an easy 4 terrain? In the end, we SLTNLN ... thanks for a fun adventure! </groundspeak:text>

The rain wasn't helping and I took the way wrong way in to GZ.  Fought quite a bit of briars, then searched for about 30 minutes while my GPSr was jumping all over the place.  Also, I only had one small flashlight.  I finally read the hint and lowered my perspective.  There was the clue.  Would never had found this one without the hint.  Thanks.  Also at night, the free-fall fan in the nearby building makes an awesome sound that added to the strangeness of the moment.  Took a much easier, although less stealther, way out.  I love these containers.  TNLNSL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The terrain is easy enough, it is unpaved but shouldnt be a problem. If you drove then becareful where you park because people in this area love calling the cops on people who park in their yard.  Also muggles may be a problem, people like to fish and walk their dogs in this area but you shouldn't have to wait to long to get a clear opening to get it. The container shouldn't be that hard to find, it is about 7 inches long and 3 inches wide. The cache has been moved slightly but still should be a fun find&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Yes, this cache IS in my yard. Good luck trying to get this one with out being spotted. I have nosy neighbor that love to call the cops. We don't have any dogs but we do have 4 cats. Depending on the time of day they may be out and about. None of them are evil so you dont have to worry about any animal attacks.&lt;br /&gt;
This cache has plenty of room for small swag. The lid is a little picky but please make sure it is all the way on before putting it back. For the FTF there is a FTF pin that I made.&lt;br /&gt;

am not against micro caches, they have there places, but Moore

&quot;modern day treasure hunting&quot; when did signing a piece of paper
become a treasure?!? Please hide a micro when there is no way to
hide something bigger. Don't hide a micro just because you finished
a roll of film or took all your medicine. It is tough to get new
people into Geocaching when all I can show them is pill bottles and
film canisters. This is just a 2 step cache. At GZ you will find
the coords and a hint for the final location, just be sure to look
down to see the second set of coords. This cache involves some
dangerous activities, be sure to bring a friend.

It is a&lt;br /&gt;short hike back to the hiding location, and should be easy for kids&lt;br /&gt;and possibly wheelchair accessible. This is an old beautiful&lt;br /&gt;church, and we recently just found that their is a recreation area&lt;br /&gt;behind the church. You will see a sign, and I wonder if it will&lt;br /&gt;stump you as much as it did me? It just sits there and I can see no&lt;br /&gt;purpose to it. Anyway, the cache is hidden just inside the woods.&lt;br /&gt;There are few muggles on Monday thru Saturday, but Sunday's are a&lt;br /&gt;whole other story. Hope you enjoy the search. **Congrats to&lt;br /&gt;3Cbasskids for being FTF**

Please re-hide this one like you found&lt;br /&gt;it, or better if you can. I bought my motorcycle a few years back,&lt;br /&gt;and I had just brought it home from the dealership, and I had to&lt;br /&gt;get out and ride. It looked like rain, but I thought it would just&lt;br /&gt;be a quick summer shower. As soon I left Trace it got dark, and&lt;br /&gt;started to drizzle. I pulled into a cemetery and darted off into&lt;br /&gt;the woods to stay dry. 45 minutes later it was still&lt;br /&gt;raining...hard! Sucked it up and drove the bike back home. Even&lt;br /&gt;when I was sitting there in the woods I thought this would be a&lt;br /&gt;great place for a hide. So today I went out and hid one there. The&lt;br /&gt;terrain is not difficult, but definitely not handicap friendly.&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations to TEAM YO MAMA for FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

Difficulty may go up after a good rain. Stay low and&lt;br /&gt;this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;should &lt;br /&gt;be an easy grab!

Hargis always wore a tall pair of boots for walking around in the patch. People thought it kind of funny that he always had a flashlight too.&lt;br/&gt; The potato is a starchy, TuBerous crop from the perennial Solanum tUbErosum of the Solanaceae family (also known as the nightshades). The word potato may refer to the plant itself as well as the edible TUBEr. In the region of the Andes, there are some other closely related cultivated potato species. Potatoes were first introduced outside the Andes region four centuries ago, and have become an integral part of much of the world's cuisine. It is the world's fourth-largest food crop, following rice, wheat, and maize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decryption Key&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M&lt;br/&gt; -------------------------&lt;br/&gt;N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True"> In 1982 the University of North Carolina baseball team was locked in a tie with ECU in an early season matchup. The score was 5-5 in the bottom of the 12th when Jeff Hubbard hit a two run walk-off home run. The ball sailed into the dark over the left field fence as UNC celebrated their victory. A fan ran to retrieve the ball and came across a drainage tunnel in the woods behind Boshamer Field. The student had found the Ehaus tunnels and thus tunneling had been born. Thus goes the legend of tunneling at UNC. &lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a small glass jar about the size of a pickle jar.</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is about a half mile hike from the marina parking area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2007 we began geocaching in Hagan Stone park. Since that time it has become our favorite park and now that the kids are older and playing sports. We find ourselves here often for Cross Country practice. With all the extra time a began looking at the geocaching maps and wondering if there was room for another geocache. I think I have found another groundzero. Skinkboy and I spent the morning looking for the perfect place for this geocache. This container has been in the lab for several years, please replace as found since replacement would be difficult to find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in a nice
little park located near downtown Greensboro. I've been coming here
for years and decided that it would be an ideal first hide
location. Its a great place to take a stroll, enjoy a bit of nature
and maybe catch a cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need to
trample the ivy floor, tear up or destroy any part of the nature
around the cache.. You should be able to get to it from the
trail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is small
Lock-n-Lock container.&lt;br /&gt;
Original contents include
a FTF 2006 GeoCache pin.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Another year, another birthday, another
cache&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yep, another year older, and in
keeping with tradition, the old TrailDawg placed a cache to mark
the event.  There are no trails leading to this puppy,
bushwhack all the way.&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is just your basic camo'd plastic container.  As
always, remember that this is the woods and is inhabited by furry
critters, multi-legged,blood sucking varmints, and flora that will
make you scratch and itch.  &lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This bison should not be hunted after dusk. Cache location is outside of the building, but I don't recommend looking for it at night which may cause it to be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you turn your back to the building &amp; look generally to the northeast, you can see the area where a tornado wiped out 3 homes in April, 2011. It's the vacant lots near the brick house down the hill. For a better view, drive down Liberty Road to the creek. You'll see damage on both sides of the road. Twin tornadoes split to each side of this particular place &amp; the brick house beside it. It continued on northward until it crossed the county line near GCF389 (Come Visit Clarkton).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This establishment has served the area farmers, hunters &amp; locals for a great many years, changing owners only three times in my lifetime. And I've lived over half a century!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you should happen to enter within, be sure to investigate all of the antique farm &amp; home implements hanging over your head. At the appropriate times, breakfast, lunch &amp; delicious homemade desserts made in the homey lil kitchen on site could be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truckers &amp; RV drivers: You will find parking available on the south side LP Bailey HWY in a gravel lot.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is to commemorate my very first find, accidentally as it was. The terrain is uphill but not too rough, the difficulty can be as hard as you make it. The attributes for thorns &amp; poison plants can be anyone's guess since I was there in the winter &amp; wasn't able to determine the likelihood on those.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is my original log on the former Back Road Bridges series cache page. *GC1R55F* If you're interested, the replacement cache is across the road from this one. I found it when I placed this so mine wouldn't be too close to it. You're looking for a medium sized ammo can in the woods. The cache is not visible but the hint will help. It's very kid friendly, stocked full of goodies along with a log book &amp; pen. Please hide it like you found it or better.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;quote:&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Found it 12/28/2009&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I believe I am in possession of this cache. A coworker of mine found an ammo box while hunting on an island in the Banister River. It was found back in November about 2 miles downstream from the mouth of the Sandy Creek where Backroad Bridges #3 is. He was talking about it at work one day &amp; I asked to see it. Since we didn't know anyone we could contact about it, we soon forgot it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recently, another friend has started caching so I asked her about it. That spurred me to seek out this web site.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I originally thought it belonged at the #3 location until I saw that people found that one on Dec 27th.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I researched further because I knew Spring 1 was the only person to find it so far. The dates match the log for Spring 1, the wooden nickel is there &amp; no one has been able to find it since May 11th, 2009.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here's the kicker...by car, it was found approx 20 or more miles from the original location! What a journey!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If the owner will contact me, I will be more than happy to return it so it can be placed again.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I got a membership here because of this cache &amp; trying to get it returned. I have to say, I am really interested in doing some hunting myself now. Thanks for the opportunity to return this!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I've been out caching with Quilter512 right much since we first met and we've had lots of laughs, trips, falls, bug and tick bites, canoe flips and some serious conversations together. One conversation that pops up nearly every time we're together is the difference between poison ivy and poison oak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://s188.photobucket.com/albums/z233/Shay1959/?action=view&amp;amp;current=poisonivy.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have my theory on it, but we haven't arrived at any solid conclusion on it. I just keep her away from &quot;leaves of three&quot; to be safe. Unless of course, there's a cache in the middle of it.  Then, all caution is flung into the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one of my own caches, she learned what a sloe vine looks like because the container was under one. At other caches we've visited, we discussed ivy. Or what kind of tree is that? Or what flower is this? Catch where I'm going with this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, she's (and possibly you too) going to learn how to spot another plant. Maybe even two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soooo....On this particular day, I ran away from home to meet her. An unexpected incident arose and we couldn't get our caching done as planned. I went to this really nice park to do some caching. After a wonderful stroll through the woods and finding two caches easily, I happened to wander out into a clearing where there was a pond about half full of water lilies. It reminded me of another one of our conversations and I enjoyed a good laugh remembering that one. That's when I decided there needed to be a tribute cache just for my good friend Quilter512.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a great spot, checked the coords for distances to the other caches and it was acceptable. BUT, there was a nice growth of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;poison oak/ivy (whatever)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; there. I found a nice entrance to where I wanted to go and forged ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
When searching for this and you find yourself heading into a patch of &quot;leaves of three&quot;, you're going wrong. Find &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virginia Creeper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and you're on the right path. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://poisonivy.aesir.com/view/virginia-creeper.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is near the Franklin Town Park, which is where you should park. There is only one road that leads to this area, so just watch out for the sign. You do not need to cross any fences to get to this cache. I repeat, you do not need to cross any fences to get to this cache! During certain events and times of day, you will be in total view of everyone around you, so please use the utmost stealth to find this cache!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Franklin's very first cache. The town is very small, but it has some great history and beautiful historical buildings. If you don't enjoy seeing old, historical towns, it doesn't offer much else in the way of entertainment unless you like to go bowling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is set to be published during the one gem this town does offer: The Treasure Mountain Festival, which is the third weekend of September every year. In fall 2010, it will be held during September 17-19. The festival has a few things to offer, including arts and crafts, a reenactment of the burning of Fort Seybert, and lots of great food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The story behind the festival, taken directly from the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Our story begins closely after 1758, the year in which a band of Shawnee Indians attacked and burned Fort Seybert. Those settlers who escaped the massacre gave the following account of their captivity:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After leaving the site of the fort, the Indians, along with their prisoners, went northward across the mountain into Greenawalt Gap. From there, they journeyed through Germany Valley, Seneca, and on to their destination in the Ohio River Valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The valued possessions and treasures belonging to the settlers were collected in an iron kettle, a pole was inserted through the handle, and two braves carried the treasure. As trudging up the eastern slope of South Fork Mountain became more and more burdensome and the fear of pursuit made faster travel advisable, the two Indians fell behind the traveling group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When they joined the captives and Indians, they were empty-handed; apparently they had hidden the treasure in the mountain. That they later returned to claim the treasure is doubtful , as this was their last known visit to the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the years since, many locals inhabitants have believed so strongly in the treasure's existence, that they searched the still-visible mountain trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While no one has succeeded in uncovering this ancient &quot;pot of gold&quot;, treasures far more valuable and bounteous have been discovered. Underlying the natural beauty of the landscape, man can find virtually anything he is seeking. The farmer has cultivated acres and acres of fertile soil; the geologist has found in the rock a story of formation and a source of income; the biologist has encountered rare species of birds and plants; the spelunker has explored numerous caves and caverns; the sportsman has found a paradise amidst dense forests and sparkling streams; the vacationer has found camping areas complete with swimming and picnicking facilities; and the pleasure seeker has found peaceful surroundings and scenic attractions.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We would love to have you join us in celebration!</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Nice hide.  Took a little looking to find it.  Today my gpsr was a little bouncy around the large rocks.  Accuracy kept going from 28' to 45'.   Found the cache and at first my GPSr was indicating 42' at GZ with 45' accuracy.  After a few moments it indicated 20' with 28' accuracy.  That is about what I see on almost all of the caches I have found.  Short off trail walk to this one.  LN.  TFTC.  


Boy was I surprised when I opened the cache and the log book.  On line (opencachingcom) there are only two log entries for this cache.  In the paper log book within the cache container there are a number of logs.

I found within the cache container 23 of my older style Dukemartin tokens that someone felt the need to collect from caches listed on the geocaching.com web site and to dump into this cache.  I never received any notice from anyone over on the geocaching.com web site that these tokens were collected and dumped here. 

Thanks to who ever dumped them here because now I can upgrade them to my latest version and put them back out again.

I wonder why people take the time to lookup the coords on opencaching.com, go find this cache, dump my older tokens and then not take the time to make a proper log on this site as to what they have done?</groundspeak:text>

My grandfather built a split rail fence around their property. This cache container was made out of the wood from one of those fence posts by my brother. &lt;br/&gt;This Cache is located at the edge of the WVU Core Arboretum. There is a tree guide near the road at the beginning of the park, and a large variety of trees to explore.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Congradulations to trexcat for being the first to find this cache!- &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">An easy p-n-g at a spot easily overlooked.  There is a slight pullover spot nearby.  Make sure you are off the road as the few cars that go by tend to do so quite fast! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; If you look back in the woods, you can see the remains of Washington's Spring.  It's on posted private property, so don't trespass!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the old, rusty marker states, the spring is located on what was once known as Nemacolin's Trail, then later Braddock's Road.  George Washington stopped here several times and camped with General Braddock here on their march toward Fort Duquesne.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other nearby sign marks &quot;Washington-Braddock Road 1754-1756&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take a moment to imagine on what it must've been like here so long ago.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Caution: This cache is near high ledges, please use extreme caution when approaching the cache area. Children should be closely supervised.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rock Climbers Hide-a-Way is located on State Game Lands 51 in Fayette County. You can access this cache from two different parking areas. The first is located on SGL 51 at the following coordinates: N39 56.549, W079 31.293. Hiking to the cache from this parking area will involve quite an uphill climb and approximately a five mile hike round trip. If approaching from this parking area you can also find Elk Rock Playground cache as you head towards Rock Climbers Hide-a-Way. You will be following game land road for all but the last few hundred yards where you will turn right at a large rock cairn (N39 56.352, W079 32.856) onto a path with marked blazes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second parking area can be accessed from Kingan Hill Road at these coordinates: N39 55.904, W079 32.702. You will be parking at a small pull off with a gate. Please do not block the gate. The hike from this parking area will be approximately 1.5 miles round trip, mostly level. However this entrance is not on game land property. While hunters frequently park at this location, we have not received permission for parking here. Following the road from this parking area you will see a large rock cairn on your left (N39 56.352, W079 32.856). Follow the blazed trail from there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once on the blazed trail you will come to a three way split (N39 56.336, W079 32.893). You many choose to take the left trail to explore the rock base, straight to access the top of the ledge or continue on to your right to reach the cache. You will approach the rock ledges as you near the cache. Please use extreme caution around the ledges as there are deep crevices and hazardous drop offs. The cache is not located near the ledge. Enjoy the view! You may be lucky enough to see some rock climbers on the ledges while you are visiting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This cache is located on Pennsylvania State Gamelands. Please familiarize yourself with all of Pennsylvania's hunting seasons and their respective regulations. During the peak deer season (November 15 - December 15, except Sundays), you must &quot;wear a minimum of 250 square inches of daylight fluorescent orange-colored material on the head, chest and back combined or, in lieu thereof, a hat of the same colored material. The material shall be worn so it is visible in a 360° arc&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    * Parking is available.&lt;br/&gt;    * Dogs allowed.&lt;br/&gt;    * Use EXTREME CAUTION near the rock ledges.&lt;br/&gt;    * We recommend daylight hours to avoid injury.&lt;br/&gt;    * Beautiful view.&lt;br/&gt;    * You may encounter poison plants, snakes, ticks, bears, and/or          kamikaze chipmunks…it’s an SGL cache.&lt;br/&gt;    * Some very minor bushwhacking may be required depending on the season&lt;br/&gt;    * Please re-hide the cache as good or better than found.&lt;br/&gt;    * Please post a note if you have any concerns about this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      WE HOPE YOU HAVE FUN WITH THIS CACHE!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

With us was our 3 month old son and he really loves the outdoors, even in the hot summer. He was happy on the trail but not in the car. We signed the log book, and had a great time exploring on the rocks. We found some natural air-conditioning coming from some of the crevices as well!</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; this cache will take you to an old cemetery and a vantage point for
some spectacular views of the laurel highlands.i have distant
relatives buried here and the last burial here took place in
1924!the cemetery is maintained and i even seen where some of the
tombstones have been updated! the cache is a 50 cal ammo can hidden
just beyond the cemetery in the woods.wear protective clothing
theres alot of thorny plants near the cache! theres parking
available by the cemetery gate and along the fence and theres ax
men and farmers working in the area so try not to block the
road.the road leading to the cemetery is unmarked so i provided a
waypoint for it.it's in pretty good shape but careful driving may
be required depending on the time of year.directions:from melcroft
pa follow rt 711 south for 2 miles then turn right onto hopewell
rd.follow this to the waypoint provided and turn right.or you can
hike from the ICV trailhead in melcroft to the cache if you
take&quot;THE HIGH ROAD&quot;!have fun,be safe,and happy caching!&lt;a href=&quot;http://s326.photobucket.com/albums/k421/antaries_2008/?action=view&amp;amp;current=YYVDEBKXLL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HC2WE0R - hopewell cemetery lane&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 03.349 W 079° 24.284 </groundspeak:long_description>

If you are lucky enough to be here at sunset, you will see why we chose this place and time.  Our geocache is rather small, but can hold small items. We have put a trackable in it and would like to see this trackable make it some great honeymoon places. We went to the Bahamas, would love for our trackable to make it to some other places.  Bring along your fishing rod and enjoy your time here. *Congrats to Pony Girl on the FTF*</groundspeak:long_description>

FTF....on Open Caching that is!!Hitting Fayette County caches today. Was fortunate to run into the CO at the boat launch.......on the wrong side of the lake! (Think we'd know better by now!!) Had a nice visit and was directed to the correct parking area! Got to ground zero pretty quickly. It took us a few minutes to find the cache. Our GPS said it was 50 feet off...but that could have been from the heavy foliage. Swapped out travel bugs. Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

This town is lacking in geocaches, so this is our attempt to hopefully populate this town. This cache is in your typical hiding area. We pass this location very frequently and thought this place was screaming for a cache.&lt;br /&gt;

After much protest from its parishoners, the church was said to have had needed more than 2,000,000 dollars in repairs and was ordered to be torn down. This geocache is here to remind people of the destruction of this historic site in 2003. All that is left standing is the 2 parking lots that were there for the church. *** Congrats to joshberry2012 on FTF****</groundspeak:long_description>

You do not have to stick your hand in any holes, cache is in plain view.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park Avenue, a two mile (3 km) stretch of road in Monongahela, has fostered a remarkable amount of notable people, most famous among them NFL Hall of Fame Quarterback Joe Montana. Other notable residents include Carl E. Vuono, four star general and Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army; Jim Jimirro, founder of the Disney Channel; Fred Cox, all-time leading scorer for the Minnesota Vikings and inventor of the Nerf ball; and Dr. Ronald V. Pellegrini, a world renowned cardiothoracic surgeon based in Pittsburgh. A documentary about Park Avenue, titled “One Extraordinary Street” was released in 2008, produced by Laura M.

The short cut to the cache will add star and a half to the terrain. Just take the quad trail on the left side of the trail your on if this is the option you want to take. If you stay on the main trail it will take you to the Big Blue Ball and the cache.

We have allowed them (the bigger kids) to hide and make their own caches. Does it get any better than taking the whole family out for a day of caching in the woods.

They really enjoyed this and I hope you enjoy the 9 new caches we have placed along this trail.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">At Round Hill Park in Elizabeth township in the southeast corner of
the county there is a modern working farm that supplements the park
itself. The exhibit farm is open every day of the year and affords
tens of thousands of school students on field trips, and daily
visitors, an interpretive program that revolves around the farm,
and the water and food cycles of life. The 17 picnic groves reflect
the life of a farm with names like Alfalfa, Timothy, Wagon Wheel
and Quiet Acres. Bring the family and some &quot;Duck Food&quot;! Take some
time to tour the farm, there is no charge to tour the grounds on
your own. 
&lt;p&gt;Here is

a map to get to the farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will enjoy this park. There are plenty of picnic tables and
playgrounds. Cachers should start at the top of the hill in the
park. The cache is in a camo'd 50 cal. ammo can. The hints below
are very specific, and should only be used if you are having
trouble. Please take a little time and do a first class camo job
when replacing the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

We got so far when we came to a choice...we chose wrong. Instead of going back to where we knew that we needed to go, the kids went full speed down the hill, where the arrow was pointing. Us old folks followed, after we told D and Heather to head back (too slippery for their shoes). The 2 guys (Brian and Dennie) raced to the likely hiding spot and pulled out the cache. We made some trades, and hid it as well as we could (considering most of the camo was covered in snow). TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Easy parking at end of road, PLEASE do not go down the gravel driveway straight ahead.  Private Property!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &quot;neighbors&quot; on the other side of the fence may look like furry-horned-cows, however, they are Long-Horned Steer!  They are usually pretty friendly if you have some fruit or veggies, or grab a chunk of grass growing along the fence line (it's okay, the property owners ;) don't mind you trimming the edges of their grass).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container you are looking for is about the size of three 35mm canisters, contains a logbook and small trades.

I chose this trail cause it would be hard to muggle the cache, and out of the way that it won't be used as target practice by hunters. As a result it is 1.25 from parking coords to the cache with a over 500 ft elevation change, and the trail is wet / muddy in spots.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;u&gt;A walking stick will be a big help&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;take your time&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;drink lots of water&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;AND BRING A BUDDY!&lt;/u&gt; You are in the wild! There is wild animals out here! I can not stress the importance of the buddy system! I chose the cache container cause of Whistle Pig and his creed &quot; If it's worth doing, its worth over doing&quot; or how about &quot; I double dog dare you&quot;. Unsed trackable tag for FTF Prize. Odds and ends for swag I even think there is a set of golf clubs in there. Why golf clubs?

This trail is handicapped accessible and useable to all physical abilities. It's also Pet friendly as long as you keep your dog on a 6ft or less leash. None of the caches are located near the railroad tracks and at no point will you need to cross active tracks. If you cross the tracks you WILL be trespassing. All caches are placed on the far side away from the tracks. The trail is open daily from dawn to dusk. NO NIGHT CACHING! No motor vehicles except wheel chairs are permitted on the trail. Trail monitors wear yellow shirts labeled &quot;Trail Monitor&quot; if you need help or have any questions. No they can't help you find the cache. Hid this cache a little harder and made it bigger so you would stay here and figure out how this cache got it's name.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is never crowded so you don't have to fight for turns on the rides. There is also a walking trail, filled with wood chips, for your walking pleasure. My kids which are 3 and 4, were able to help hide this one so the terrain isn't bad. There is plenty of parking available and a Port-O-John on site. There are also several picnic tables so make a lunch date for this one. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

None of the caches are located near the railroad tracks and at no point will you need to cross active tracks. If you cross the tracks you WILL be trespassing.

Had a blast picking up one micro after another today. And just felt
compelled to drop this. Had it in my trunk, prepped and all ready
to go. It was planned for somewhere else, but I just gravitated to
this spot somehow. I think this turned out to be just the place for
this. Depending on the time of day, traffic can be busy through
here, just act like you belong.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Greetings from Jayhawk Country! First incorporated as a borough on June 7, 1889,Jeannette earned the nickname as &quot;the glass city&quot; in recognition of the numerous glass plants founded in the area, with those factories contributing to the city's original stature as the first large manufacturing town in Westmoreland County. In fact, the impact of the glass industry was so significant that the city's name actually comes from Jeannette E. Hartupee McKee, the wife of H. Sellers McKee, a local industrialist who cofounded the Chambers and McKee Glass Works and was a member of the elite South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club of Johnstown Flood fame. Mckee and his partner J.A. Chambers also have the distinction of naming Jeannette's main street, Clay Avenue after their financial backer, Richard W. Clay. On January 1, 1938 Jeannette became a third class city with Attorney John M. OConnell as the first mayor. In 1999 High School Football season the Jeannette Jayhawks closed the season by winning the WPIAL championship on a 550 game winning streak! The 3rd most consecutive wins in Western Pa. The Jayhawks hold 6 WPIAL titles the most in Westmoreland county! This cache should NOT be accessed from route 30. USE PARKING COORDS!

Only to find out that Filumena in ancient Greek meens beloved, and the tomb marker was from another tomb all together.

I was actually eaten by a bush once! It reached out and grabbed me and swollowed me whole. I don't remember much after except lots of leaves, sticks, and being pooped out with two soft balls. I found I lost my car keys in the endeavor and the only place they could be is back in the bush. Trip # two was less of a suprize,but more of a chore.I got my keys, but the bush kept the landyard that was atached to it as a souvenir!</groundspeak:long_description>

the tradition of marking the trees ended as a result of vandalism.
Look around at the trees, too. Several are over two hundred years
old! After you find the cache, take a moment to sit on a bench and
enjoy the peaceful tranquility of this 16-acre sanctuary.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tucked deep in the frozen mountainside on a remote archipelago
in Norway sits the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. The SGSV was built
to safeguard seeds from around the world against climate change,
wars or natural disaster. Known also as the “Doomsday
Vault,” construction was completed in February 2008 at a cost
of $9 million. The vault currently holds over 500,000 seed samples.
Seeds are stored in four-ply sealed envelopes in rooms kept at -0.4
degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache serves as a local version – on a much smaller
scale – of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. If you have some
seeds to share, bring them here (please label for identification),
and exchange them for other seeds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a .50 cal ammo can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;To minimize damage to the ground cover,
please realize you can stay on the main trail until you are
approximately 180 feet from the cache.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Please maintain the cache theme by trading
only plant or seed-related items. Thank you!&lt;/i&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

our legs! I'll give you a little haunted history! On July 5 1903 At
4:00pm a flash flood in this valley broke the Oakford park dam
killing 75 men, women and children! Oakford park had a dam in it to
feed a giant swimming pool. The Dam was 40ft high, half a mile
long, a quarter mile wide and 35 feet deep and when it broke it
sent a 20 foot wall of water down through the valley sweeping away
men, women, trolley cars and anything else in it's path. Such a
tragic and violent event and nothing to mark their passing sets the
stage for one of the creepiest caches you'll ever find.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This isn't Sparta? It's Jeannette! It is just as rich in history
though. For example Did you know, The Three Stooges used to
vacation here, and performed at Oakford Park? Yep and this is the
home town of Terrelle Pryor. He played football here as a Jayhawk!
The Jayhawks are not King Leonidas mighty 300 Spartans, but are

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Our story starts in the Lab of Dr.Nubbins. Dr. Nubbins was working on his own brand of energy drink, not wanting to be left out of the craze! He was using raw elements to create his energy drink. He said &quot;If I used raw elements in their pure form they will be the strongest! Strength to run faster, and jump higher. Tough skin to resist puncture from green briar bushes! Luminescence to be able to see through geoflage and to cache at night! Better caching through chemistry!&quot; After mixing all the ingredients together he forgot the FDA testing trials and downed the concoction. With a scream he burst from his lab and ran down the street flailing his arms wildly! He knocked down power poles and howled like a dog! He would screach like a scalded cat and threw garbage every where! HE WENT MAD!!!!!! After wreeking havoc all through town he ran into the woods. So Dear Cacher solve his recipe problem, chase him down, and get his potion!  Atomic number: N) Zirconium,Calcium,Platnum, and Helium W) Gold,Arsenic,Boron,and Bismuth

I've maxed out already. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's not been lab tested but I'm willing to bet this hide is
99.9% muggle proof. Two cachers with way more finds than me took
one look and said, &quot;That's a 4 at least!&quot; &quot;Maybe even a 5&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that increases your odds of finding above the
0.1% is that since it's 99.9% muggle proof, you know it's there!
Right? So get out there and sign that log. BYOP of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... I originally rated this a 3.5 but I have been told I
consistently under rate my hides and this one in particular. So,
upon that advice I've bumped it up a half point. Hope that makes it
easier to find now. : )&lt;/p&gt;

scroll and a pencil stub, but bring something to write with just in
case. This cache could be wheelchair accessible if you can

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Trafford's B.Y. Park Very short hike but a bit steep at the end.
Nearby are some dangerous cliffs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a great little park. They really did a good job fixing
it up. About thirty years ago I remember a friend bringing me here
and all I remember was a swamp and some dead fish. Now there is a
beautiful little lake where a lot of people come and fish. Mostly
large carp but there are also some nice catfish and I'm told there
are some bass and a few other varieties. All fishing is catch and
release only. I've seen turtles, and frogs in the swamp that feeds
the pond. The garter snakes were abundant when I did the hide. Oh
yea! There's a huge black snake near the cache. There are also
ducks and geese galore. Facilities include several pavilions, rest
rooms, a water fountain that sometimes works, a walking/jogging
track around the lake as well as some hiking trails on either side
of the park. It's up in the woods near one of these trails that
I've placed the stash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the parking circle is a foot bridge that marks the start of
a trail at N40° 23.195 W79° 45.041 This trail circles to
the left past a park bench up towards the streets above and back
down. There is also a well hidden game trail at the top of the
circle that takes you to a path across the cliff tops. This cliff
path exits the park where 8th street makes a dogleg at N40°
23.234 W79° 45.154. This is an alternate starting point but
there is no parking near here. The cache is a medium sized, flat,
camouflaged, Lock &amp; Lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial content is mostly puzzles. There is also what seems to
be an alien artifact reputed to have been stolen from a secret
government project. But don't tell anyone about that. Your GPS is
going to lie to you. The closer you get to the cliffs, the more
unreliable the readings are. I took dozens of fixes and plotted
them on Google Earth then averaged them visually so the coordinates
should be pretty close to real.&lt;/p&gt;

Creek in Wilmerding. But probably won't be. This one has turned out
to be harder than I expected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK sorry, there isn't a whole lot of concealment for the grabber
on this one, but I made at least 5 stops here sizing things up
before I made the actual placement and didn't draw much attention.
Once finding Ground Zero You should put your hands in your pockets
and observe for a while, then decide on a spot and check it. I did
have to drive by once because someone was using the swings, and
another time, a couple of kids were sitting on the concrete near
GZ. This one should be fairly obvious... although there is
something about it that may fool you if you are lazy. SCPO Rich
will probably like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So! Welcome to Wilmerding. Home of George Westinghouse inventor
of the air brake. The town proper is on the other side of Turtle
Creek. You might want to go over and check out the Castle. And
remember... There's no Winky's in Wilmerding. (Or anywhere else
nowadays for that matter.)&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Suburban Park. Trail areas were once asphalt but now badly
maintained, crumbling and overgrown in places.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;I decided to scout this Monroeville park out and see what kind
of trails it might have. At first, I was a bit disappointed. My
first start point NE of the parking revealed a few game trails and
a hole in the fence into the future archaeological digs to the
North. Near this point I spotted signs below that invited further
exploration. I proceeded South toward the ball field and pavilion.
I followed some faint game trails which led to a walking trail but
it’s been a long time since it’s been maintained.
Subsequent exploration proved that suburban wilderness has
it’s attractions. This trail starts near a cluster of pines
at N40° 23.944 W79° 47.770 and ends at the turn around
where Quarry road dead ends. N40° 23.938 W79° 47.680 I
started at N40° 23.988 W79° 47.770 which is near the
pavilion by the ball field. It didn’t take long for me to
find some ancient ruins near the gathering place of a local
indigenous tribe. Primitive art adorned the secret park bench and
the cliffs here. Nocturnal visits to this location might find the
members of this tribe gathered around the fire, engaged in rituals
which anthropologists (and the authorities) would undoubtedly have
great interest. I also found numerous signs that humans once had a
long vanished settlement here. At one point, a spring and
overgrowth has forced a detour around the original paving, I found
that going off trail here yielded the discovery of an antique glass
bottle. All in all it was a satisfying excursion and I placed this
stash for any who come after me to explore this rich deposit of
human history. Best approach in summer, is probably indirectly from
below halfway down to Quarry road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial Contents: A hand made puzzle. Matchbox car, mini slinky,
compass-thermometer-whistle, magnifier, rubber chicken,
teleidoscope , 4 laminated micro cache notes. And more…&lt;/p&gt;

completely original. Contains log only, bring your own pencil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;I drive past here nearly every day either to work or church.
Pitcairn is a train town and always has been. The creek was
diverted and part of the valley filled in, to make room for the
rail yard which is one of the major transportation hubs in the
area. Other than that, there’s not much to say except that if
you cruse through here on a warm summer night, you may spot some of
the many different examples of colorful and exotic wildlife…
at least until after 2:00AM There is a park in mid town with ball
fields, a playground, and a train car that I believe can be
examined up close. Anyway, if/when you find this cache, handle it
carefully so as not to damage the camouflage. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you like it. After a recent bad experience with some
so-called “park and grabs” I decided to challenge
myself to see if I can lay down a bunch of them but in places where
the finder is able to search discretely even if it is a public
area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules for these are; Walk around carefully, and be
observant. You may often be able to say ‘Ah Hah!’
without touching anything. I will try to leave a visible clue. No
need to trample or damage anything. You will usually be able to
take and replace the cache without being seen. When you leave,
there should be no trace you were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

43.664. I’m not sure where I’ll wind up hiding this,
there are so many possibilities, but make sure you explore all the
way down to N40° 24.555 W79° 43.345. Once you come out the other
side of the turnpike tunnel you’ll be in sight of the
companion cache to this one “Whizards Rock”.
You’ll understand why I planted that one first but waited
till this one was placed to have them published together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creek along here is beautiful and the hillsides and cliffs
are too. While exploring and searching for this cache, an
interesting thing to look for are numerous charcoal ingots
scattered about. I found dozens of them all over the area. I can
only assume they washed down, perhaps from the sewage treatment
plant upstream. I expected to find marsh areas and swamp but the
whole area was reasonably dry when I scouted it. Even so, this
whole area floods after heavy rains, so there will be times when
this cache will be difficult to approach, perhaps even dangerous.
But don’t worry about the cache, it’s high and dry.
There is a main path that follows the edge of the creek, and a maze
of game trails through the rest of the valley. I placed this in
early spring. During full summer, there is Knot Weed everywhere.
Despite that, there are few obstructions. If you lose a trail, head
toward the creek and pick up the main trail again. You will have to
negotiate off trail to get to this, please try to follow game
trails and move like an Indian through the brush rather than
mashing it down, or you may make it too easy for the next
person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final requirement. Bring a fishing pole, even if you
don’t plan to fish.&lt;/p&gt;

wasteland below. A small wooded hillside somewhat exposed to houses
and the ball field. Stealth recommended. Leave no trace. Re hide
exactly as found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is kind of a sad one for me. Turtle Creek has a few
playgrounds but no park. When I was a kid, this valley was known as
HEP park. HEP stood for “Help Establish a Park”. It
never happened. Back then it was a wild area; rocks, woods, weeds,
and beer cans. If our town elders had done their job, this would be
a nice bit of green space. Instead it was sold off and a developer
built an apartment complex, and the rest is wasteland. From the
Texaco the path led down and back up to the top of “Killer
Hill” a favorite sled riding track. It was called Killer Hill
because at the bottom you had to guide your sled carefully or else
you’d go off a small cliff and into the creek. The creek is
gone now. It’s about twenty or thirty feet down, under
thousands of tons of fill. It used to issue from a four foot
corrugated pipe pointing toward the ball fields above. We always
had plans to crawl inside and see where it went. We never did get
the courage to try it. There was a path that followed the creek
down toward where the apartment complex is now. On the left were
huge boulders nearly the size of a house. Down there still though,
on the hillside, before you get to the swing sets are some large
crumbly rocks full of fossils. I would recommend you stay away from
Valley Park Drive and it’s apartments though, they
won’t hesitate to call the cops if they see strangers lurking
about. Suggested parking is at the Hamilton Avenue Playground.
There are at least two paths down to the cache area depending on
whether or not the ball field is in use. The best is behind the
building closest to the road. The other is behind the dugout. I
would suggest stealth mode in all aspects of approaching this
cache. Perhaps though you could leave some flowers at the parks
gravestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a small, flat, camouflaged Lock &amp; Lock. FTF
prize is a hand forged puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

The original trail entrance here has been filled in and requires climbing down and over obstacles then walking up one side of Killer Hill and down the other.  Once past the first twenty feet or so, a well defined path takes you the rest of the way.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On October 20, 2008, scporich logged his first geocache!! This cache was in the great state of Texas, and since then, rich has been Truckin' his way to 1000! He has cached through the Cold Rain and Snow and in the Early Morning Rain and sometimes one might be able to hear him while he searches saying I Need A Miracle, but nonetheless, 1000 have been found!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Per his own words, he is just a normal guy who lives in Pittsburgh, travels a lot for business, and loves to geocache! At times you might find him Standing On The Corner or on the Banks Of The Ohio. He might even be seen in California! He has yet to take an Alabama (caching) Getaway, but maybe, one day soon he will, however, we know he will definitely be On The Road Again shortly! He caches alone, he caches with his daughters and he caches with friends!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations Rich on finding your 1000th cache!! This cache has been placed by members of PAGA in your honor! Although you might be going to Hell in a Bucket, we hope you (and everyone else searching for this cache) enjoy your hunt as you never know what you will find out here!! And just remember, Keep your day job, Don't give it away, Keep your day job, Whatever they say!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is an ammo can filled with typical swag and is placed in Southside slopes (or, according to wiki, Southside Park). Your walk to the cache is a decent one that might involve some elevation changes. Depending on the route you choose and the season, you might have muggles to deal with or you might have to bushwhack a little. As always be sure to practice CITO and be safe. Once again, Congrats to scporich on his 1000th find!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Possible parking coords: N 40° 25.347 W 079° 58.491  </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Located near the Westinghouse Memorial in Schenley Park. Parking is available nearby, but some of the spots are metered, so bring a few quarters just in case. Park hours are 0600-2300. No late-night caching, please. Also, stealth may be necessary when the seasonal foliage is not available for cover.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is in a serene area of Schenley Park. It is not far from Carnegie Mellon University and Phipps Conservatory, so whether you're here for school, business, or pleasure, you can take a short walk to the area.&lt;br /&gt;
Bring your lunch with you. It's a perfect place to unwind, relax, and reflect.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As of March 2009, the pond connected to the memorial is leaking too much to hold any water. You can learn more about restoration plans at the Westinghouse Memorial website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.westinghousememorial.org/restoration.htm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully it will be up and running again in the near future. Regardless, this is a beautiful place to sit a spell. So come on by, grab this cache and enjoy the Serenity in Schenley.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

There is something for everyone here; BBQ grills, a huge playground, Frisbee golf, ball field and… well, unless you are familiar with the area you will just have to see for yourself.

&lt;b&gt;This is Adams Twp Community Park is my first cache. It was a
nano near the ballfield but had to move this one and changed the
container to something a little larger BYOP.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Happy hunting.&lt;/b&gt;

great trail with lots of beautiful scenery. And if you're on it at
the right times, you'll see that lots of people take advantage of
this resource. I also have found the trails to be a great place to
practice my photography. I especially like to stop on the bridges,
watch the water flow past for a bit, and maybe try and frame up a
nice shot. Here's a bridge. Why don't you stop for a few and enjoy
the view? Watch the water, relax from your exercise, and maybe even
find a quick cache!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is across the road from Northpointe I.&lt;br/&gt;There is a wooded area that goes down over the hill. I think the&lt;br/&gt;best approach is to park in IUP's parking lot and head down&lt;br/&gt;Armstrong Drive. After a short walk, you'll spot a bit of an&lt;br/&gt;entrance into the wooded area. Then just weave around all of the&lt;br/&gt;fallen trees to GZ. Alternatively, you can follow a narrow road&lt;br/&gt;that leads down to a backup generator and a drainage pond. Then&lt;br/&gt;head back up the hill into the wooded area. It's narrow and steep,&lt;br/&gt;so I wouldn't attempt to drive down.&lt;br/&gt;If you are quiet, you'll probably see all sorts&lt;br/&gt;of birds and possibly other wildlife. I heard a lot of things while&lt;br/&gt;hiding the cache. Be careful, though, because I picked up a couple&lt;br/&gt;of ticks on the way.&lt;br/&gt;The container is a small square locking style&lt;br/&gt;box. It's big enough for small trade items and travel bugs. I&lt;br/&gt;didn't have much swag handy, so I just started off a couple of my&lt;br/&gt;new travel bugs. Hopefully I'll stock it with a few more items&lt;br/&gt;soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is listed on multiple listing services.

You'll find a pair.  One unscrews to reveal coordinates to the final.  If your eyes aren't what they used to be, you may need help seeing the numbers; they're pretty small.  One person suggested a magnifying glass and possibly a light.  To approach the first stage, I headed across the clearing and then went down to the right toward the cluster of dogwoods.  Then follow the stream bed.  The weeds have grown tremendously since I placed it, but it's still a pretty area once you get down under the trees.  There was a deer by stage one today when I placed it and got final coordinates.  I highly recommend coming back through here in the early spring when all the trees are in bloom.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN2VXD9 - GC2VXD9 Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PK2VXD9 - Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 45.387 W 079° 37.993 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is listed on multiple listing services.

He was employed as a technician at Optical Systems Technology&lt;br/&gt;in Slate Lick. Jeremy was a member of Cadogan Union Church and the&lt;br/&gt;Cadogan Sportsman's Club. He enjoyed hunting and trout fishing, and&lt;br/&gt;loved helping people in any way he could. Jeremy also enjoyed&lt;br/&gt;spending time with his wife and family, his cats, and his turtle,&lt;br/&gt;Bam.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the few years that I knew him, I couldn't&lt;br/&gt;have asked for a better friend and coworker. Known around the&lt;br/&gt;office as &quot;Hollywood,&quot; he loved to make people laugh and smile. He&lt;br/&gt;cared about everybody and always offered to help out. He also&lt;br/&gt;livened up the hacky sack circle that would form during break&lt;br/&gt;times. We had a lot of good times and all of the fun definitely&lt;br/&gt;made the work day go faster. He is missed by all and will never be&lt;br/&gt;forgotten.&lt;br/&gt;Shortly before he passed away, Jeremy and I&lt;br/&gt;discussed geocaching. His friend had found one and told him about&lt;br/&gt;it, piquing his interest. He asked me about it and I explained to&lt;br/&gt;him the basics. He wanted to borrow my GPS sometime and try it out.&lt;br/&gt;I was going to take him out and show him a few when spring came and&lt;br/&gt;the weather was nicer. Sadly, that day never came and I lost a&lt;br/&gt;friend too soon.&lt;br/&gt;I placed this cache in memory of Jeremy and&lt;br/&gt;filled it with hacky sacks. You can trade hacks or leave other&lt;br/&gt;items. If you knew Jeremy, feel free to share a memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is listed on multiple listing services.  Congratulations to the spydermunkees for finding it first.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We have caching buddies in several countries and big cities, mostly in Scandinavia or Washington DC area, so if you want your coins or bugs to go there, drop them in this cache.  This is a small container, but it will be monitored very frequently. It will be fun to watch where your geocoin end up!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun discovering the coins in the cache, but please leave them to their destinations; remember they were left here to travel long-distance! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be sure to re-hide the container well and to be very careful of muggles that might be lurking about, as this is a busy area at times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Only geocoins will travel long-distance. If you drop a travelbug in the cache it will just travel in a normal fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safety alert....beware of the poision ivy near the cache.

During ACCA 2008 some 15 or more caches was placed in mostly the northern part of the county in an initiative to introduce several new and sometimes challenging caches in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have to bring your own writing instrument as it IS a micro and will only have a log sheet in it.  I hope this will prove to be an interesting and different cache from the normal micro and I DO hope you enjoy the hunt!  Have fun and let me hear what 'ya think about it!  On August 24, 2008, I replaced the container with a newer model because the log was getting wet.  This is still a very unique and interesting hunt!  It goes without saying that this is a sacred place and PLEASE use proper conduct while searching for the cache.  It is not in the actual &quot;cemetery proper&quot;, but close by.  No need to trespass anywhere or overturn anything.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Because let’s face it: where there is a Wally-world there must be a micro. After the one that was around here for years was terminated we decided that this cannot stand, because what is better than being able to swipe a cache or two while your better half is doing some grocery shopping. Or vice versa? Sure, there are some other caches nearby but since at least one of them might possibly tick you off and one may, well, just tick you, here’s an easy one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one you can gladly bring Aunt Greta from Wisconsin along on, she may even be able to do it from the car. Then again, maybe not. At any rate it’s pretty much what you expect, only smaller and not as traditional as you first might think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a FTF prize for this one (after all, IF you do go after one of these diligently you deserve a reward). The prize is a brand new lrosell path tag. Unfortunately I was unable to squeeze it down in the container, but if you email us we’ll make sure you get it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations to HBOWSER for FTF!

I need your help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago I was on a mission to retrieve 3 artifacts that had&lt;br /&gt;previously been hidden on Earth when my vessel was attacked by&lt;br /&gt;Cylog forces. I bailed out just before my ship was hit and&lt;br /&gt;disintegrated but I’m afraid that when returning fire I may&lt;br /&gt;have accidently hit a nearby large structure. Sorry about that. At&lt;br /&gt;any rate, as I landed I hurt my current host body and was unable to&lt;br /&gt;travel for several days. I found a cylindrical, yet wet, hiding&lt;br /&gt;place where I could go through the process of healing my host, as&lt;br /&gt;well as hide from the pursuing Cylogs. It became clear to me that I&lt;br /&gt;would not be able to rescue the artifacts but instead hide them&lt;br /&gt;here on Earth and luckily I had packed some of my belongings in a&lt;br /&gt;50cal ammo box, handily borrowed from an undisclosed air force base&lt;br /&gt;somewhere outside Cleveland, Ohio. Long story, don’t ask.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I placed the artifacts in the box and hid it nearby my&lt;br /&gt;location and immediately thereafter I set my escape plan into&lt;br /&gt;motion. I had to reach an open field for my rescue locator beacon&lt;br /&gt;device to work properly, I remembered seeing one just north of some&lt;br /&gt;type of large market place that seem to sell inexpensive products&lt;br /&gt;mostly manufactured in countries far away. Very strange. On my&lt;br /&gt;journey to the field, traveling east at first, I placed clues along&lt;br /&gt;the way to provide a means to retrieve the sacred artifacts. For&lt;br /&gt;the final leg of my journey I turned north, placed the first hint&lt;br /&gt;and managed to reach the field and activate my beacon; the rescue&lt;br /&gt;ship beamed me up within minutes. The artifacts are however still&lt;br /&gt;in great peril and this is where you come in; I have learned that&lt;br /&gt;Geocachers, a previously unknown race to us, are men and women of&lt;br /&gt;great honor and integrity and can be trusted to guard these&lt;br /&gt;artifacts. These items may look trivial but the future of the&lt;br /&gt;planet may depend on them being kept out of the hands of the evil&lt;br /&gt;Cylogs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now pay attention: if you decided to pick up the artifacts&lt;br /&gt;they may only be retrieved by three different Geocachers or groups&lt;br /&gt;of Geocachers. To speak Geocachingese, see them as FTF prize, STF&lt;br /&gt;prize and TTF price. Each must be retrieved by different finders&lt;br /&gt;and whether you are alone or in a group, not more than one artifact&lt;br /&gt;can be taken at one given time. Failure to comply with these rules&lt;br /&gt;will render the artifacts reach nuclear critical mass and bad&lt;br /&gt;things will happen. Capiche?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;FTF prize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first artifact dramatically resembles a 2Gb USB drive and will&lt;br /&gt;actually work as such. I contain encrypted information vital to&lt;br /&gt;your planets survival and can only be viewed or decrypted using a&lt;br /&gt;512 core bio-dynamic CPU. Last time I checked that have not been&lt;br /&gt;invented yet so don’t bother, just use it as a regular USB&lt;br /&gt;drive. But keep it secret, and keep it safe!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;STF Prize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second artifact resembles what you may identify as a Geocoin.&lt;br /&gt;As far as I understand these are not legal tender on your planet&lt;br /&gt;but should rather be kept for its beauty or even better activated&lt;br /&gt;and put into circulation, hidden in plain sight or cache, if you&lt;br /&gt;like. I would strongly recommend the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;TTF prize&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third artifact resembles a travelbug dog tag with a very&lt;br /&gt;special device connected. However, together with the information on&lt;br /&gt;the bug barcode and the attached device it can be used to gain&lt;br /&gt;entrance and operation to a Class 3 Interstellar Blockade Runner,&lt;br /&gt;should need be. You should activate this ‘bug’ and put&lt;br /&gt;it into circulation among the remarkable Geocaching&lt;br /&gt;community!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, the future of your planet relies on You, Dear Geocacher.&lt;br /&gt;You must find the hidden artifacts and keep them out of the hands&lt;br /&gt;of the Cylogs, many galaxies depends on you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Live long and prosperous and May the Force be with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;//IC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note from I.C.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got word that all artifacts have been picked up! Thanks you!&lt;br /&gt;You may have helped save the galaxy!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">lil'KG (our daughter) wanted to make her own cache.  This is hid in our yard .   We have 2 dogs - both have shock collars that keep them within their perimeter.  They will bark at you they are a very good alarm system, but we have never had a problem with them.  For your protection and my peace of mind please DO NOT pet the dogs unless we are home and outside with you.  Our daughter thought it would be fun to add a slight twist to this -  so not for the faint of heart lol.  Since this is at our home we ask that there only be caching between the hours of 9:00 A.M. and 9:00 P.M.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is located in Butler Twp, Pa - Preston Park. Access
is from Eberhart Rd. Parking lot coordinates are N 40 51.167 W 079
57.091. The ammo can is hidden along what has to be one of the most
magnificent Dog trails around. The trail is marked well.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Since this is a dog trail I decided to name it after 2 great
GoeDogs that I know, so be sure to bring your pooch along for this
hunt. There is a main entrance to the park through the fence but
the dog park trail head is along the right hand side of the parking
area as you enter. The trail winds all around but the best direct
access to this cache is to stay left and follow the fence line down
the hill. I've started this cache full of TBs so bring some
trades.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE: Preston Park is ONLY open from dawn to dusk to NO night
caching.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK2XQMH - PK&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 51.167 W 079° 57.091 </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is placed as a part of the Northern Armstrong County Cache Avalanche of 2008 or NACCA 2008. During ACCA 2008 some 15 or more caches was placed in mostly the northern part of the county in an initiative to introduce several new and sometimes challenging caches in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The side road where the cache is located is usually only used by the Amish so it should be relatively muggler safe. Then again, some critters reside just next to the area but we are pretty sure they won’t rat you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the cache is just a few feet of the road some bushwhacking may be required here, depending on what time of year you go for this one. Then again, during the summer you should be able to pick up some raspberry on your way in. At least unless we got to them first. As always, please take care and respect the surroundings. If you do not wish to bushwhack directly to the cache there is an easier way in from either side. This would really be the approach we recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The place is picked to be the entry point to the several caches in the area placed during the North Armstrong County Cache Avalanche, or NACCA for short. Coming either from Smicksburg or Rt 85 we hope this cache will make for a nice starting point in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Caching

Some weeks during the year this town can be (believe it or not!) very busy. Also be aware of traffic, it can be busy all year long. Recommended parking at N40 52.655  W079 14.776 or at the nearby church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it is a micro there is some limited space for trading items. (Very limited) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Log was soaked after just one day out so measures has been taken to better damp proof the cache. Please return it as you found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to bring a pen!

During ACCA 2008 some 15 or more caches was placed in mostly the northern part of the county in an initiative to introduce several new and sometimes challenging caches in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just made sense to us to put a cache here since we also placed on at the other end of Main Street in Dayton. As you progress down the street however it soon start to look not so much like a town road but more like, well, outside town. Which it is. Besides, our TomTom says it’s Main Street and we’re not about to argue the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may not be able to drive all the way to the cache, Main Street or not. If it looks like the car may have problem making the last part of the trip it most likely won’t. So don’t. Besides there’s no good place to turn around by GZ anyway. Trust us, we know. The closest to the cache that we know for sure you will be able to turn around is at about N40 52.870 W79 13.213. These are not so much parking coordinates as they are turn around coordinates. This will put you about 1/3 of a mile away from the cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will still be a nice walk though and during summer there are a plentiful of berry bushes and even wildlife along the last part of Main Street. The cache is well hidden but since you know what you are looking for it shouldn’t be too much trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, a recommendation; even if you for some reason decided to drive all the way down to GZ DO NOT continue on the road after the bridge not matter what your GPS is trying to tell you. Main Street ends here (it really does) and the dirt road continuing leads to nothing but trouble. Don’t ask, just take our word for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And last-last; PLEASE put the cache back and hide it like you found it. Even if you get your shoe wet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Caching!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br /&gt;PK1ABHR - Possible Point of No Return&lt;br /&gt;N 40° 52.870 W 079° 13.213&lt;br /&gt;We don't recommend you drive a car further than here.</groundspeak:long_description>

Alas, nothing could be further from the truth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on what direction you come from you may already have noticed a sunken tractor (which is also a waymark on www.waymarking.com, WM3E54) or an interesting constellating of hay bales. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are both placed by the land owner who is known to change the hay bale art several times a year. It’s hard to tell what you will see but we can guarantee that it will be something unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, put the cache back EXACTLY as you found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Caching!

In fact, you could probably have grandma retrieve the cache for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to pay attention to the nearby ‘posted’ signs. The cache is not in the woods, no matter what your GPS is trying to tell you.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We initially planned to put a cache at the absolute highest point&lt;br /&gt;in Armstrong County, but being as that location is somewhat posted&lt;br /&gt;land we came up with this location instead. A shame really since&lt;br /&gt;the ‘real’ highpoint has no less than three waymarkers very close&lt;br /&gt;to each other. But quite frankly, the view from here is not half&lt;br /&gt;bad either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One way marker is still in view from the cache location;&lt;br /&gt;the&lt;br /&gt;spire of the church. In all honestly, the church spire&lt;br /&gt;waymarker was actually recorded when the church was located on the&lt;br /&gt;other side of the road, but it should still count!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another curious tidbit, this one to file under worthless knowledge;&lt;br /&gt;the cache container intended for the original highpoint ended up&lt;br /&gt;being the container for another of our caches,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GC1NMJT - To Boldy Go (or gently crawl)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We put a little surprise in the container for the FTF, some little&lt;br /&gt;thing to benefit a future cache!

At any rate, this is a really beautiful section of the&lt;br/&gt;Armstrong Trail. There is parking available near the cache location&lt;br/&gt;or you can ride / walk on the trail to get here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was placed during the &quot;Walk and Wow&quot;&lt;br/&gt;week-long series of guided nature walks along the trail north of&lt;br/&gt;here, sponsored by the Armstrong Rails to Trails Association. While&lt;br/&gt;it should be a quick grab, I hope that it encourages you to take&lt;br/&gt;the opportunity to ride / walk on the trail and be &quot;wowed&quot; by the&lt;br/&gt;beauty along the trail year-round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The parking area near the locks is owned by the&lt;br/&gt;Armstrong Trail and you are free to park there. The trail is open&lt;br/&gt;from dawn to dusk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is listed on multiple listing services.  Congratulations to couldbriding and altimazion for finding it first.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This hiking/biking trail is beautiful and will be extended as time and funds permit.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our series of caches on the trail are dedicated to our loyal “family” of (dogs)….don’t tell THEM they are dogs though!

Every new litter, we discover someone special that we have to keep!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lizzy is our momma “Papillon”.  She actually is the boss of the house and that includes all the dogs that outweigh her by over 100 pounds.  When she barks and bites, they run!  We placed Lizzy’s cache near the Lock#8 where you can watch the boats come and go through the lock.  It is a small pill bottle that is well camoed.  Have fun and enjoy the view!

The name ‘Tio’ is Swedish for the number “10” and Tio WAS the 10th puppy born in his litter.  If there is such a thing in dogdom, Tio appears to be a bit autistic.  When he was born, he was dead, and the Mr. had to perform CPR and bring him back to life.  Tio has one goal in life and only ONE—to play ball.  He carries his tennis ball in his mouth continuously.  He eats with it, sleeps with it, drinks with it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tio’s cache is a large pretzel jar full of goodies placed in a very nice spot.  Once again, please leave something nice if you take something nice.  That way everyone has fun.  Best of luck, have fun, enjoy the beautiful Armstrong Trail!

We are trying to help promote the beautiful Armstrong Trail in Armstrong County.  This hiking/biking trail is beautiful and will be extended as time and funds permit.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our series of caches on the trail are dedicated to our loyal “family” of (dogs)….don’t tell THEM they are dogs though!  We started breeding Golden Retrievers many years ago, but discovered our love of dogs is too big for us to be successful breeders.  Every new litter, we discover someone special that we have to keep!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache is for the youngest member of the golden family.  Brutus is the small version of his brothers and dad.  He may be small, but loves to maul and brawl with his older brothers.  I know they can’t wait for him to grow up and learn to have some ‘common sense’!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brutus’ cache is a large pretzel jar placed at one of the trail heads.  It has a very nice stash of goodies; please leave something nice if you take something.  That keeps it fun for everyone!   Enjoy the hunt and the beautiful Armstrong Trail!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have always loved the view from this&lt;br /&gt;place. In a sense you get the feeling of looking out over our part&lt;br /&gt;of Pennsylvania as it must have looked like when the pioneers first&lt;br /&gt;came by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, there are roads and other evidence of&lt;br /&gt;‘civilization’ present as you look north out over the hills and&lt;br /&gt;valleys. But with just a little bit of imagination it is not hard&lt;br /&gt;to envision what it must have looked like to those few brave men&lt;br /&gt;and women heading west.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;One also can’t help but wonder what life must&lt;br /&gt;have been like for the Native American inhabitants that hunted&lt;br /&gt;these woods and hills. And, according to local folklore, one of&lt;br /&gt;their burial grounds can be seen by standing by the tree and&lt;br /&gt;looking straight north. See the hill over there? That is what is&lt;br /&gt;said to be the Indian Cemetery in this area, and thus the name of&lt;br /&gt;this cache; Hidden Cemeteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking north-west you can even see a part of&lt;br /&gt;Mahoning Creek leading up to the dam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be careful to respect this site! Do not drive all&lt;br /&gt;the way up into the cemetery. Rather, park on the road up or just&lt;br /&gt;after it once you clear the somewhat steep climb. Do NOT attempt to&lt;br /&gt;drive up unless you have 4WD except if the ground is completely&lt;br /&gt;dry. Even under these conditions however, pot holes might take&lt;br /&gt;parts off your car that you would rather have attached. You have&lt;br /&gt;been warned; don’t blame us if your car sounds like an M1A1 coming&lt;br /&gt;off this hill…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cache itself should be fairly easy to find&lt;br /&gt;although some minor bushwhacking may be required during the greener&lt;br /&gt;part of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the swag was placed in individual plastic zip&lt;br /&gt;lock bags, as far as it is possible please keep it that way!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;All swag is more or less either nice small toys&lt;br /&gt;or functional tools; as far as it is possible we would like to keep&lt;br /&gt;it that way. The cache starts out with several goodies out over the&lt;br /&gt;obligatory log and pen;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;• LaserBuck Travel Bug – First drop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Red Jeep Travel Bug&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Rockabilly Junction CD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Pedometer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Tape measure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Mini screw drivers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Glider plane&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Toy car set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Hand grip trainer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• And much much more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please let us know any problem with this cache as&lt;br /&gt;we would like to keep it nice and dry!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy Caching!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I have always thought that this was a neat area.  There are two railroad bridges here, one that carries the Armstrong Trail over Mahoning Creek and one that carries tracks over the Allegheny.  You're looking for a micro hidden on or near the bridge over the creek.  Be careful that you don't slip, as there are a few places on the bridge surface where you can see water below :)  I left a small pencil in the cache, but you probably want to have your own writing utensil handy.  Please rehide as you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is my first hide, so I hope you enjoy it.  You can park in Templeton and ride / hike to the cache.  Or, if you're like me, you'll park in Kittanning or Ford City and ride the whole way ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Armstrong Trail is open Dawn-Dusk, so please do not attempt at night. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is listed on multiple listing services.  Congratulations to DougLisa for finding it first. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;strong&gt;The geocache hidden at the posted coordinates is a regular&lt;br /&gt;geocache, however, it is also part of the Allegheny GeoTrail (AGT),&lt;br /&gt;a publicly funded project designed to promote a pleasant and&lt;br /&gt;positive experience and image of the Allegheny National Forest&lt;br /&gt;region and its gateway communities. The AGT utilizes the growing&lt;br /&gt;interest in geocaching to assist both residents and visitors to the&lt;br /&gt;area in learning more about the unique attractions in the ten&lt;br /&gt;participating counties. This cache contains a unique self inking&lt;br /&gt;rubber stamp which you should use to stamp your Allegheny GeoTrail&lt;br /&gt;Passport to verify that you found it. When you have found a minimum&lt;br /&gt;of six AGT caches, you will be eligible to have your AGT passport&lt;br /&gt;validated and receive a commemorative AGT trackable geocoin at&lt;br /&gt;participating locations. You must have your official AGT passport&lt;br /&gt;with you when you find this cache in order to stamp it. Click on&lt;br /&gt;the Allegheny GeoTrail Logo below to visit the AGT website at&lt;br /&gt;www.alleghenygeotrail.com for complete details and a listing of&lt;br /&gt;participating locations where you may pick up and validate AGT&lt;br /&gt;passports to receive your souvenir geocoin, trackable at&lt;br /&gt;www.geocaching.com .&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Hidden at one of the last surviving drive-in theatres in&lt;br /&gt;the area. Jim Lipuma (owner) has given me permission to place the&lt;br /&gt;cache here. Please be respectful. The cache is a small ammo can.&lt;br /&gt;You do not have to go down past the gate, it is near the road. If&lt;br /&gt;you find this close to evenings, please do not block the drive&lt;br /&gt;ways. Watch for muggles. Good luck and Have fun!!! Remember to&lt;br /&gt;CITO. PLEASE PLACE CACHE BACK EXACTLY TO KEEP IT HANDICAP&lt;br /&gt;ACCESSIBLE.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Congrats to Smoky Bear 1 on the FTF!

Enjoyed the area, so much to do here, loved the trails, and quietness of the vast areas I did find, seeming I am with in a days drive, hope to make it back this way one day, fall here must be a spectacular show, so maybe then I will finish the other 7 counties, a nice set of coins!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache contents are nothing special, it's more about the cache itself. It's situated on an old railroad bridge piling about 50-60 feet off of the ground in the middle of a creek. I highly suggest you scout this one out before getting your hopes up. I have identified at least three ways to get it off its perch, and can personally vouch for one way to get it back up there. Take a friend or two. Someone will get wet, and someone will get very tired of thorns. For a good view of the cache, walk downstream to the bridge, and take a good pair of binoculars. You'll see a silver ammo can awaiting it's rescue. It's painted silver to commemorate the 500th find of my team, The Allegheny Rangers. This is a cache at YOUR OWN RISK cache!! Keep in mind that this is a potentially dangerous cache, and that you need to exercise caution in going after it. Please be careful, and know that in outdoor activities, anything can and will occur. Neither Groundspeak or I will accept responsiblity under any circumstance, should you get hurt or killed. There is a chance that you will encounter falling debris. Wear a helmet and goggles, and any other safety equipment you may deem necessary. Don't do anything you don't honestly feel you're qualified to do. Remember- THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS TO DO THIS CACHE!! Oh, and one last thing... If you plan to go after this cache, let me know when, as Sparticus and I are dying to see what people can come up with. If you let us come watch, we promise to cheer you on. Happy Hunting! Owners Note: Yes, there are, indeed multiple FTF's available on this cache. The first is for climbing, while the second is for any other method of retrieval from the ground. Others may include Non-traditional methods such as, but not limited to; aircraft, catapaults and trebuchets, NASA surplus gear, or wizardry. (NO FIREARMS OR BLASTING EQUIPMENT, seriously...) To encourage innovation and use of imagination, I'll likely award FTF's to anything I haven't seen before. Congrats to 1RoknJp&amp;Zoose, Fatwalker, Brooke The Blonde &amp; Buttons4 for their Innovative (and overall) First to Find. You guys rule! Congrats to Redtail Forester and Mountainfolk406 for the Traditional Climb FTF! Congrats to gstiglitz and Kaboss for their rope ladder FTF! Thanks to my friends at www.extreme-caching.com for adding this cache to their great site!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The cache is something I cooked up while in pursuit of a couple 5/5's. It seemed like I could go a bit more extreme, and so I did. This is a cache at your own risk type of cache, unless you are clever enough to retrieve it and replace it without getting too crazy... If anyone wants some help let me know, and I'll go with you to &quot;supervise.&quot; Thanks to Sparticus06, without whom this would have been even worse to place.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&quot;Adjusted&quot; means that the published coordinates are very accurate, and &quot;location scaled&quot; means that the published coordinates are not very accurate. The published positions for benchmarks with adjusted horizontal coordinates were computed using advanced surveying techniques and are far more accurate than even the finest handheld GPSr can get. The position of a benchmark with &quot;scaled&quot; coordinates was derived by a human in an office by estimating the location of the mark on a topographic map with a scale (ruler). As such, they can be off by 600 feet or more from the actual position though deviations in the 100 - 150 foot range are more common. Your handheld GPS may be very helpful in finding benchmarks with adjusted horizontal coordinates, but can be nearly useless for finding benchmarks with scaled horizontal coordinates. Feel free to post a picture of your GPSr at the benchmark with the coordinates. There is a micro log book near by to sign. Do not forget to log your benchmark ( MA1077 ) find! Congrats to KNAPAHOLIC for FTF. </groundspeak:long_description>

Mrs.uccacher and I were here last year but couldn't figure out how to get to the tower.  The road that we ended up taking today (with Tprints guidance) looks like someone's driveway but is also the tower road.  Quick find and another benchmark to add to the list.

Park at the trail head on Kiser-Wagner Road (N 41° 14.390 W 079° 23.863) and follow the trail to this cache.  Along the trail you will walk along fences that are meant to contain the wild pigs and rams at a hunting preserve beside the game lands.  After passing this, you will climb up a slight hill and find some very nice views as you walk along the trail.  Just before reaching the cache, you will pass some small ponds.  The cache is hidden very simply so that you don't have an enjoyable walk without a smiley.  Happy Hunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache is placed on State Game Lands so please wear orange during all hunting seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations to gstiglitz for the FTF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br /&gt;PK2BX6Q - GC2BX6Q Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 41° 14.390 W 079° 23.863&lt;br /&gt;Parking for NCT-Duck Pond's Micro</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;strong&gt;The geocache hidden at the posted coordinates is a regular&lt;br /&gt;geocache, however, it is also part of the Allegheny GeoTrail (AGT),&lt;br /&gt;a publicly funded project designed to promote a pleasant and&lt;br /&gt;positive experience and image of the Allegheny National Forest&lt;br /&gt;region and its gateway communities. The AGT utilizes the growing&lt;br /&gt;interest in geocaching to assist both residents and visitors to the&lt;br /&gt;area in learning more about the unique attractions in the ten&lt;br /&gt;participating counties. This cache contains a unique self inking&lt;br /&gt;rubber stamp which you should use to stamp your Allegheny GeoTrail&lt;br /&gt;Passport to verify that you found it. When you have found a minimum&lt;br /&gt;of six AGT caches, you will be eligible to have your AGT passport&lt;br /&gt;validated and receive a commemorative AGT trackable geocoin at&lt;br /&gt;participating locations. You must have your official AGT passport&lt;br /&gt;with you when you find this cache in order to stamp it. Click on&lt;br /&gt;the Allegheny GeoTrail Logo below to visit the AGT website at&lt;br /&gt;www.alleghenygeotrail.com for complete details and a listing of&lt;br /&gt;participating locations where you may pick up and validate AGT&lt;br /&gt;passports to receive your souvenir geocoin, trackable at&lt;br /&gt;www.geocaching.com .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This geocache will take you to a very interesting place in&lt;br /&gt;Clarion County, the Helen Furnace. The furnace is in excellent&lt;br /&gt;condition, the most significant element being the charging bridge.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, one of the structural supports for the bridge has&lt;br /&gt;cracked, making the crossing unfeasible. It would be nice if this&lt;br /&gt;condition could be repaired, permitting access to the top of the&lt;br /&gt;stack. It is not clear who has maintained the site, but the area is&lt;br /&gt;very clean, maintained, and much of the furnace remains intact. The&lt;br /&gt;foundation pit for the engine house is located to the right of the&lt;br /&gt;furnace. The right hand tuyere still has the brickwork in place,&lt;br /&gt;including the round access hole for the blast pipe. The cupola&lt;br /&gt;remains intact, and the view up the stack shows that the wooden&lt;br /&gt;covering at the top is protecting the inner stack from damage.&lt;br /&gt;History Start of Operation: 1845 Blowout: 1856 Daily Tonnage: 1,500&lt;br /&gt;tons per year - best actual output was 1,000 tons. Built By: Robert&lt;br /&gt;Barber and Packer Stack: 32 feet w/9 foot bosh Blast: Cold Type:&lt;br /&gt;Charcoal The furnace was built by W.S. Packer &amp; Company, but&lt;br /&gt;they soon ran into financial problems and sold out to David Richey.&lt;br /&gt;He apparently owned the site for a limited time, and sold the&lt;br /&gt;property to Samuel Wilson. The Wilson's were a primary player in&lt;br /&gt;the region in terms of materials - they must have owned extensive&lt;br /&gt;property in the area. Mr. Wilson operated the furnace until 1857.&lt;br /&gt;The furnace was originally named &quot;Highland&quot; furnace after Alexander&lt;br /&gt;McNaughton, who prided himself on being a highlander. However,&lt;br /&gt;owing to the strong accent, the name sounded like &quot;Hieland&quot;, which&lt;br /&gt;was adapted over time to &quot;Helen&quot;. The site has recently been&lt;br /&gt;restored by Clarion County with some improvements to encourage your&lt;br /&gt;visit. There are picnic tables, and a portajohn on site, so bring a&lt;br /&gt;lunch and explore this historical site.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Information found on Helen Furnace website at&lt;br /&gt;http://www.oldindustry.org/PA_HTML/Pa_Helen.html

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I hid this geocache on the bank on the left hand side of the Clarion River, just after Slater's Landing.  The cache is a Lock n' Lock container that has been spray painted brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This area was used by the raftmen of the Clarion River to build and launch timber rafts when Leeper Hollow was logged out during the rafting logging era of the mid 1800s.  Across the river from the cache area, you can still see the remnants of a road that was used to bring the lumber from the hillsides. (It heads at an angle upstream from the landing, and follows Leeper Hollow)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read other places, but don't know for sure, that this area was also a popular overnight area for raftmen coming from up river.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This area was also used as a place to ford the river.  If you are canoeing to this cache, and the water is low, you will see why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using a canoe to find this cache, but you can walk it, if you wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache is placed on State Game Lands.  Please remember to wear orange during all hunting seasons.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You may want a canoe, kayak or raft for getting this geocache.  You can hike to this cache, but you are on your own.  You will be able to park your boat within 1,000 feet of the cache (please remember to secure your boat with an anchor, you do not want to be stuck here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache is located along the most beautiful and remote section of the Clarion River.  You will be leaving your boat on a gravel bar at the mouth of the Maxwell Run.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closest place upstream from the cache to put in a canoe, kayak or raft would be the Gravel Lick area.  The closest place to get out would be Sarvey Mill Road on the Helen Furnace side of the Clarion River.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is up on the hillside above a camping area on the downstream side of the Maxwell Run.  To make this easy, since the adventure is the canoe ride, the cache is at the base of a tree about 10 feet uphill from the biggest rock above this campsite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your trip along this beautiful and little traveled section of the Clarion River.  You will see plenty of wildlife.  About a mile upstream from the Maxwell Run, in a large pine tree, is an eagle nest.  I actually spotted the eagle in a pine tree just before the Maxwell Run while floating down to hide this cache.  Good fishing too, so bring your pole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware that this cache is located on State Game Lands.  Please wear orange during hunting seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations to SmokeyBear1 for the FTF.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is a small lock and lock container amongst some interesting root formation along the North Country Trail.  This cache could also easily be found by someone canoeing this section of the Clarion River.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The easiest way to walk to this cache is to park at the Highland Drive trail head of the North Country Trail and follow the trail into the woods.  This is a very nice section of trail with only one hill coming back from the cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using a switchback to get down over the hillside, the North Country Trail follows an old logging road down toward the river.  This logging road was used in the mid to late 1800's to take timber from the forests above to rafts to be carried down the Clarion River.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just think about the history of this road as you are making your journey to the cache site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the cache site, you will find a boulder with multiple trees growing on it.  It is really a pretty impressive sight.  The cache is hidden amonst the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember to place the cache well hidden when you leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before leaving, head down to the river for a view of Maxwell run coming into the Clarion River just downstream (The gravel bar across the river is where Maxwell run enters the river).  Last year I took some pictures from my canoe of an eagle perched in the large pine tree just up river from the Maxwell Run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please remember that there is hunting in these woods.  During hunting seasons you must wear orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br /&gt;PK25PC4 - Parking - Clarion River - NCT meets Clarion River&lt;br /&gt;N 41° 17.956 W 079° 16.834&lt;br /&gt;Park here to get to the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Happy caching!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This area is my favorite place on the Clarion River.  I (Maria), have only actually lived in Pennsylvania for about 11 years, but I have known about this place just as long.  While we were building our house we had to haul water for everything drinking and bathing.  That is how we came to learn of the spring on Gravel Lick.  We lived in a camper and took showers from a camping shower bag.  If you've ever had to do this you know how much &quot;fun&quot; it is.  Anyway we followed a path across from the spring that lead to the river.  We soon learned that it was a great place to swim also.  When you come to seek this cache bring your swim suit!  Bring a picnic too its a great place to spend the whole day.  At this spot in the river there is a HUGE rock that spans over much of the river about three feet under the water (after about five feet in you will be on the flat rock.  No sharp rocks to hurt your feet here.) If you decide to swim here please be careful.  I have heard rumors that people have drowned here by jumping off this massive rock and being pulled under it.  I always keep to the left of the rock and NEVER EVER jump off the drop off.  The river moves fast so I am inclined to believe the stories I've heard.  Remember if you decide to swim you are doing so AT YOUR OWN RISK! If you're smart and careful you shouldn't have anything to worry about.  I even let my six yr old swim here.  Stay to the left of the drop off and you should be fine. You can also bring you fishing gear here. You will not have to venture into the river at any stage of this multicache!  However at the second stage, it is possible that your feet will get wet!  The original cache contained a train whistle, cars pen, magnesium fire starter, a pez dispenser, a bandaid container, a CITO container, log book, and a FTF Level TB!  There may have been a few other things but I can't remember.  This is a three stage multicache and they are all hidden well.  Steve watched me hide the first one and ten minutes later even he couldn't find it! HE HE!  Have fun!  It is a tough one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br /&gt;S213V81 - Stage 2&lt;br /&gt;N 41° 18.310 W 079° 14.655&lt;br /&gt;Stage 2&lt;br /&gt;S313V81 - Final Stage&lt;br /&gt;N 41° 18.308 W 079° 14.562</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">So I have had this container for over a year, it was a gift from The Graystone Gopher. I was trying to find the perfect spot and finally I found one. DevinC adopted this part of the NCT (North Country Tail) and asked me if I wanted to put a cache on it, so I decided on a night cache. It is nice down here during the day, but wait till night to see how it is. Fairly easy walk down into the cache. The hill is not very steep. You will be walking about .40 mile to get to the final.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking is at N41° 18.906 W79° 14.751&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a good flashlight with you and definitely take a friend. Walk in past the gate and follow the cords to the beginning of this night time walk. The starting point will be 3 dots in a vertical line. The rest of the way down, use your light and follow the trail of firetacks. Once you get so far down, there will be 4 firetacks in the shape of a square on the left side of the trail. You are very close to the cache. If you shine your light around you will see that you are being watched. Walk to the right up through all the eyes on your right until you see a 3 eyed critter on your right. The cache is there.&lt;br /&gt;There is no reason to go down over the steep part on the left side of the trail You will be on the trail all the way to your little forest audience. You should be able to get the cache from the side trail. There is no need at all to bushwack.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, enjoy, and have fun on the night time walk on the NCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to wear your orange during hunting season, even at night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTF - The Eye of the Tiger&lt;br /&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: FN263MB - Final Cache location&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Final location of the cache.&lt;br /&gt;PK263MB - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 41° 18.906 W 079° 14.751&lt;br /&gt;Parking area to start your hike.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is a very short walk to the cache from the trail head at Gravel Lick (about a 1/4 mile).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In it, you will find a log book, some trade items and a handmade stamper and ink pad.  PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THE STAMPER OR INKPAD.  Those who stamp their letterbox notepads will need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to find this geocache without a gps, here are the directions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Take Route 66 North From Shippenville.&lt;br /&gt;2. At Leeper, turn right onto Route 36.&lt;br /&gt;3. Follow Route 36 for approximately 3.5 miles and turn right onto Miola Road.&lt;br /&gt;4. Immediately after getting on Miola Road, turn left onto Gravel Lick Road.&lt;br /&gt;5. Follow Gravel Lick Road until you see the trailhead for the North Country Trail.  &lt;br /&gt;6. Park your car and follow the North Country Trail SouthWest of where you park (the same side of the road as the North Country Trail Sign).&lt;br /&gt;7. Follow the trail across the crick and up the hillside.&lt;br /&gt;8. After a few switchbacks up the hill, the trail will go straight for about 300 feet until it intersects with Baker Trail.  There is a log box at the intersection of the North Country Trail and Baker Trail.&lt;br /&gt;9. The Letterbox is located behind the big rock about 30 feet from the log box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure that you wear Flourescent orange when seeking this Letterbox during hunting seasons.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located about a hundred feet down the North Country Trail section that goes through the Gravel Lick area.  It is a micro hidden in a pretty normal manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on the North Country Trail through Clarion County visit the following link: http://www.northcountrytrail.org/cla/index.htm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cache is a waterproof matchstick container. Bring your own pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache is located on State Game Lands so please remember to wear orange during hunting seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations to Smokey Bear 1 for the FTF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have increased the difficulty for this cache to a 4 because of satellite reception in this area.  I have taken several readings, on several different days and you guessed it, came up with several different readings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a coordinate purist (you should really learn a thing or two about the true repeatable accuracy of civilian gpsr's, especially under this thick of cover) you probably should not attempt this cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add to the degree of difficulty, I have been told that it is a pretty unique hide so search, you don't want them all to be park and grabs do you.  If you do, stay in the city or just go after ammo cans under a pile of sticks.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocahe is part of the Venango-Forest Kidz Kache geotrail, a grant funded event designed to introduce youth to the interpretive, physical, and recreational benefits of geocaching.  This geotrail is very kid-friendly and beginner oriented and each cache location contains historical, cultural, geological, or natual value.  The Kidz Kache geotrail consists of twelve geocaches, six each in Forest and Venango counties.  This cache contains a unique self-inking rubber stamp, which you use to stamp your Venango-Forest Kidz Kache passport to verify that you found it.  When you have found a minimum of eight Kidz Kache caches, you will be eligible to have your passport validated and receive a gift bag with locally donated prizes and a commemorative pathtag.  You must have your official Kidz Kache passport with you when you find this cache in order to stamp it.  The event starts on July 15th, 2011.  For complete details and to pick up a passport, visit these locations: in Forest county - Forest County Visitor’s Bureau and Marienville Ranger District; in Venango County - Lifelong Learning Programs and Oil Region Alliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This geocache is located at a historical site known as Indian God Rock.  Indian God Rock is located on the banks of the Allegheny River.  It can be accessed by boat and also by foot or bicycle using the Allegheny River Trail/North Country National Scenic Trail which both follow the railroad bed beside the Allegheny River through this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This rock is made of sandstone. Sandstone is easy to carve and this property made it a good canvas for Native Americans to create rock art on. This rock is very significant because of one very large petroglyph (rock art) on one of its sides.  Because of the petroglyph, Indian God Rock has been an explorers' landmark, a tourist attraction, and an object of scholarly investigation for a few centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the fifty-five different figures present on Indian God Rock include geometric shapes and depictions of humans and animals in a range of positions.  One scholar has held that the resemblance between certain figures on the rock and drawings on extant birch bark scrolls indicates that the rock was used by tribal shamans, and he proposes that the rarity of martial themes among the carvings indicates that the carvers were members of a peaceful culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The date of the petroglyph is uncertain; it is believed to have been carved at some point after AD 900, but most likely after 1200. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rock was discovered by a French expedition along the Allegheny River in 1749.  At this time, the rock was plainly invested with religious meaning; according to one member of the expedition, accompanying Native American guides &quot;regarded the rock with superstitious reverence.&quot;  Besides recording the rock and their disdain for the &quot;savages&quot; who created it, the expedition placed two lead plates at the site as evidence of their presence.  During the nineteenth century, Indian God Rock became a popular tourist attraction — steamships on the Allegheny would often stop to allow their passengers to examine the petroglyph.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please enjoy your hike, bike or canoe ride to this landmark.  Also enjoy the experience of seeing this historical site.  Although you cannot actually see the petroglyph today, there is information at the site showing what it looked like at one time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THE CACHE IS LOCATED ON THE HILLSIDE ABOVE THE ACTUAL SITE OF INDIAN GOD ROCK.  THIS, AND THE FACT THAT THIS CACHE IS LOCATED 2 MILES FROM A PARKING AREA MAKES IT THE HARDEST CACHE OF THIS KIDS KACHE GEOTRAIL.  HOWEVER, MY 10 YEAR OLD HAD NO TROUBLE COMING WITH ME TO HIDE IT.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THIS IS A VERY POPULAR LOCATION ALONG THE TRAIL AND I DID NOT WANT THE CACHE TO GO MISSING.  THAT IS WHY I HAVE PLACED IT WHERE IT IS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, please be aware that there is hunting in this area so please remember to wear orange during all hunting seasons.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cache is located along Irish Rock Trail in Clear Creek&lt;br /&gt;State Park at an area known as Irish Rock. Please park at N 41°&lt;br /&gt;20.251 W 079° 06.303. To get to Irish Rock Trail, follow River&lt;br /&gt;trail. River Trail begins very near the parking coordinates. Both&lt;br /&gt;of these trails follow along the Clarion River. Irish Rock is an&lt;br /&gt;area of historic significance for the Clarion River. This area was&lt;br /&gt;used by the raftmen of the Clarion River during the rafting logging&lt;br /&gt;era of the mid 1800's. This was a spot that was easy for the&lt;br /&gt;raftmen to tie up their rafts to overnight on their long journey&lt;br /&gt;down the Clarion River. The cache is a 30mm ammo can. It is hidded&lt;br /&gt;in a very normal way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to some DNF's, and the purpose of this cache being a nice&lt;br /&gt;hike, not a hard cache, I want to help you out some. Plus I think&lt;br /&gt;the dense cover is playing havoc on people's gps's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;The cache is located just to the left of the trail as it starts&lt;br /&gt;to head up over the hill. It is under a collection of rocks between&lt;br /&gt;the trail and the big rocks by the river.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to lindlou99 for the FTF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK1Y09H - Parking for Clarion River - Irish Rock&lt;br /&gt;N 41° 20.251 W 079° 06.303&lt;br /&gt;This is the parking area for Clarion River - Irish Rock cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is on my property so, if you see someone in the yard, stop and say hi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great place to discover travel bugs and coins or help one on it's journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My neighbors know that the cache is there so they will know what you are doing, but as to not disturb them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE ONLY PULL INTO THE DRIVEWAY THAT HAS THE NUMBER 7251 ON THE MAILBOX POST (There is alot of landscaping in the front yard and the house is away from the road about 200 feet).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to park anywhere in this driveway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only rules are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Please do not walk through the landscaping. Cache is not there, it is above it. Up and above it (hint, hint.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Cache is open year round, but please only cache during daylight hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun, and feel free to stop by any time to discover or move along travel bugs or geocoins.

The AGT utilizes the growing&lt;br /&gt;interest in geocaching to assist both residents and visitors to the&lt;br /&gt;area in learning more about the unique attractions in the ten&lt;br /&gt;participating counties. This cache contains a unique self inking&lt;br /&gt;rubber stamp which you should use to stamp your Allegheny GeoTrail&lt;br /&gt;Passport to verify that you found it. When you have found a minimum&lt;br /&gt;of six AGT caches, you will be eligible to have your AGT passport&lt;br /&gt;validated and receive a commemorative AGT trackable geocoin at&lt;br /&gt;participating locations.

This was our last cache for the trip.  We ran into geO Kacher and group on our way in while they were coming out.  I agree that it was a longer walk then we were expecting and maybe the terrain is about 1/2 star too low.  I twisted my ankle pretty good on the way out.  However, it was definitely an easy find which was good because it was getting COLD.  This was our 9th stamp for Clarion County.  Very nice spot.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">From the parking lot you will travel along the Baker Trail / North Country Trail.  After about a 1/4 mile you will travel the last 300 feet to the cache along a turnpike built in just under 7 hours on November 6, 2010 by a work crew of 20 people from the Keystone Trail Association, the Clarion County Chapter of the North Country Trail Association &amp; the Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This turnpike raises the trail above the swampy ground underneath.  This section of trail was nearly impassible in very wet periods and unpleasant most other times.  Rerouting around this wet section was nearly impossible, requiring this project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cache was placed in honor of the trail work session when this turnpike was created.  It was a very impressive example of a group of people getting together to improve a section of long distance hiking trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you continue further, there are 2 more geocaches along this section of trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the hunt and please remember that hunting does happen in these woods so remember to wear orange for your own safety during all hunting seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations to HOOTnOWL for the first to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br /&gt;PK2HYGF - GC2HYGF Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 41° 24.195 W 079° 11.721&lt;br /&gt;Parking for The NCT Turnpike</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The North Country National Scenic Trail Geotrail (NCTGT) is
a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association
(NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of
the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile
apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North
Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA
66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.


&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged
individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a
commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of
the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the
inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the
100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the
corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50
NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on
the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address
to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your
North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the
real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That
treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure
that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt;
for more information on the trail and access points in the
Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At the southern end of the North Country Trail in the Allegheny
National Forest, the main attraction is the local population of
beavers. These guys, nature's engineers, are constantly building
new structures in this area and as a consequence, the trail is
constantly being reshaped to accommodate them.&lt;/p&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

Refiners discovered that refined petroleum made ideal fuel for lamps.&lt;br/&gt;Production boomed when large oil fields were discovered in Pa. The dominate producer and transporter of oil was The Standard Oil Company founded by John D. Rockefeller. In 1890, the National Transit Building was constructed to house The National Transit Co., Standard Oil's Great Pipeline Company.&lt;br/&gt;We needed light and the answer was oil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1978 the National Transit Building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Now, the Transit is home to the Transit studio artists, the Transit Fine Arts Gallery shop, the Graffiti Gallery, workshops and arts and entertainment activities.&lt;br/&gt;Everyone creates. Everyone has ideas.&lt;br/&gt;Ideas are Light.&lt;br/&gt;Oil City needed light and the answer was Art!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Find this cache and discover part of our history.&lt;br/&gt;Cache accessible during daylight only.&lt;br/&gt;Placed with permission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association
(NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of
the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile
apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North
Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA
66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged
individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a
commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of
the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the
inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the
100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the
corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50
NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on
the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address
to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your
North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the
real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That
treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure
that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt;
for more information on the trail and access points in the
Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden along a section of the trail that follows a
logging road. There are a lot of grape vines in this area so
naturally the cache is hidden near some.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocahe is part of the Venango-Forest Kidz Kache geotrail, a grant funded event designed to introduce youth to the interpretive, physical, and recreational benefits of geocaching.  This geotrail is very kid-friendly and beginner oriented and each cache location contains historical, cultural, geological, or natual value.  The Kidz Kache geotrail consists of twelve geocaches, six each in Forest and Venango counties.  This cache contains a unique self-inking rubber stamp, which you use to stamp your Venango-Forest Kidz Kache passport to verify that you found it.  When you have found a minimum of eight Kidz Kache caches, you will be eligible to have your passport validated and receive a gift bag with locally donated prizes and a commemorative pathtag.  You must have your official Kidz Kache passport with you when you find this cache in order to stamp it.  The event starts on July 15th, 2011.  For complete details and to pick up a passport, visit these locations: in Forest county - Forest County Visitor’s Bureau and Marienville Ranger District; in Venango County - Lifelong Learning Programs and Oil Region Alliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Songbird Sojourn Interpretive Trail &amp; Buzzard Swamp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buzzard Swamp Wildlife Management Area emphasizes wildlife management and recreational opportunities.  It is an 11.2 mile system of interconnecting trails offer excellent opportunities to view wildlife, cross-country ski, mountain bike, or go bass fishing.  Fifteen man-made ponds were constructed in the early 1960’s in partnership with the Pennsylvania Game Commission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This geocache can be found on the Songbird Sojourn Interpretive Trail, a 1.5 mile self-guided nature trail.  The trail starts at the Forest Road 157 trail head and is marked with gray diamonds.  The trail has been left in a natural condition.  There are rocks, roots and small stream crossings throughout the trail.  Pamplets are available at the trail head and the Marienville Ranger Station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you are there, check out Buzzard Swamp, which offers some of the best wildlife viewing opportunities on the Forest.  The area is an important link in the Atlantic flyway during the waterfowl migration.  During spring migration, 20-25 species of waterfowl can be seen around the swamp.  An observant hiker could see bear, deer, beaver, coyote snapping turtles, turkey, osprey and bald eagles.  Don’t forget your binoculars or spotting scope for great views of the native fauna.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All of the ponds have small and largemouth bass, perch, catfish, crappie, and bluegill.  Boating is permitted on the ponds, but no motors are allowed.  The nearest pond is 1 mile from the trail head, and since no motorized vehicles are allowed within the swamp, boats must be carried.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please keep in mind that this geocache is located in the Allegheny National Forest where hunting is permissible.  Remember to wear orange during all hunting seasons.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The North Country National Scenic Trail Geotrail (NCTGT) is
a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association
(NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of
the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile
apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North
Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA
66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged
individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a
commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of
the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the
inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the
100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the
corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50
NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on
the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address
to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your
North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the
real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That
treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure
that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt;
for more information on the trail and access points in the
Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This cache is located a short ways from the backpacking shelter
at Amsler Springs. This shelter is a few hundred feet into the
woods from the Amsler Springs trail head on Forest Road 145. This
backpacking shelter has been used by many an overnight hiker on the
NCT in the ANF. Stop in at the shelter on your way by it to read
the shelter's log book to see what adventures others had through
this section of the NCT.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Should be an easy cache and dash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bridge is in the tail waters of the Tionesta Reservoir.  Sometimes, when there is a lot of water, this bridge is completely under water.  Don't worry, the cache is above the area that would flood in such a situation. Just remember to come in from the south end of the road if you suspect the bridge might be under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations to Knapaholic for the FTF.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocahe is part of the Venango-Forest Kidz Kache geotrail, a grant funded event designed to introduce youth to the interpretive, physical, and recreational benefits of geocaching.  This geotrail is very kid-friendly and beginner oriented and each cache location contains historical, cultural, geological, or natual value.  The Kidz Kache geotrail consists of twelve geocaches, six each in Forest and Venango counties.  This cache contains a unique self-inking rubber stamp, which you use to stamp your Venango-Forest Kidz Kache passport to verify that you found it.  When you have found a minimum of eight Kidz Kache caches, you will be eligible to have your passport validated and receive a gift bag with locally donated prizes and a commemorative pathtag.  You must have your official Kidz Kache passport with you when you find this cache in order to stamp it.  The event starts on July 15th, 2011.  For complete details and to pick up a passport, visit these locations: in Forest county - Forest County Visitor’s Bureau and Marienville Ranger District; in Venango County - Lifelong Learning Programs and Oil Region Alliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marienville is a quiet town on the southern edge of the Allegheny National Forest.  It is named after Marian, the daughter of the founder of Forest county, Cyrus Blood.  It also has had the misfortune of having been destroyed by fire three times, in 1890, 1902, and 1914.  Other smaller fires also occurred in 1922 and 1930, the latter one destroying the glass bottle plant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 1914 fire, which may have been started by a train spark, destroyed the entire business section and made 100 people homeless by destroying 25 homes and businesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of these fires, the town saw many types of businesses in various configurations.  Historic and current businesses include the glass plant, which was one of the main industries and the largest employer in Forest county, a railroad station, appliance shop, liveries, a bowling alley, banks, hotels, barber shops, drug stores, and general stores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bucktail, where this cache is found, is a landmark of the town, and was a favorite of hunters.  The barroom at the Bucktail Hotel was the former Kifer grocery store, which dates back to the late 1800’s.  Purchased in 1937 by Frank Regina, it was transformed into the Bucktail Inn.  A dining and dancing room was built in 1937 onto the back of the building and dances were held twice weekly.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Living quarters and sleeping rooms were added in the 1940’s.  Andy Pastilock married Frank’s daughter, Jean, and in the 1950’s became the owners of the Bucktail Hotel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tom Clark purchased the Bucktail in 1979, and he and his partners made fantastic changes to the business.  They turned the back dining room into a showplace – an elegant dining area with stained glass windows, beautiful chandeliers, antique furniture, and antique pieces displayed throughout the room.  Sadly, the Bucktail closed its doors in July of 2001.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current owners purchased the Bucktail in 2002; the restaurant reopened in November of 2003 with few changes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the cache.  This cache has been placed with the permission of the owner of the Bucktail.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located a short ways down the trail as it heads
from Amsler Springs toward Kelletville. It is about half way up a
steady ascent up the hillside above the Amsler Springs area. At the
top of this hill is a pretty impressive collection of rocks. These
rocks have 2 rather large outcroppings. There is evidence that
people have used these outcroppings as shelter in the past.
Definitely worth venturing on from here to see what's at the
top.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

After finding the cache, stroll down to the creek to see this interest collection of rocks.  The rocks actually create an elevated pool of water that becomes a very good home for trout as they explore downstream after they are stocked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very popular fishing spot, as the trails around the rocks show, so be sure to hide the cache as good or better than you found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park at N41* 29.522' W079* 12.665'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is a small lock &amp; lock with a log and room for small trade items. Most of the trade items in the cache originally are oriented towards fishing.  Continue this if you wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring your fishing pole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations to gstiglitz for the FTF.

a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association
(NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of
the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile
apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North
Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA
66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged
individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a
commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of
the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the
inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the
100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the
corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50
NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on
the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address
to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your
North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the
real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That
treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure
that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This geocahe is part of the Venango-Forest Kidz Kache geotrail, a grant funded event designed to introduce youth to the interpretive, physical, and recreational benefits of geocaching.  This geotrail is very kid-friendly and beginner oriented and each cache location contains historical, cultural, geological, or natual value.  The Kidz Kache geotrail consists of twelve geocaches, six each in Forest and Venango counties.  This cache contains a unique self-inking rubber stamp, which you use to stamp your Venango-Forest Kidz Kache passport to verify that you found it.  When you have found a minimum of eight Kidz Kache caches, you will be eligible to have your passport validated and receive a gift bag with locally donated prizes and a commemorative pathtag.  You must have your official Kidz Kache passport with you when you find this cache in order to stamp it.  The event starts on July 15th, 2011.  For complete details and to pick up a passport, visit these locations: in Forest county - Forest County Visitor’s Bureau and Marienville Ranger District; in Venango County - Lifelong Learning Programs and Oil Region Alliance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This geocache is located at the courthouse in Tionesta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Situated along the Allegheny River, the small town of Tionesta serves as the county seat for Forest County.  The name Tionesta is a Native American word meaning &quot;waters meet.&quot; Tionesta was built around the confluence of Tionesta Creek and the Allegheny River. Natural resources such as lumber and oil played into the development of the community. In the mid-1800s, a simple county courthouse was established. Later, in the 1880s, the seat of local government was improved with commissioned artwork in the courtroom. Artist Henry Steiff was contracted to paint 2 fresco murals - one on each side of the judge's bench, and each over 10 feet tall. Lady Justice holds the scales of justice, and a sword, and is blindfolded to show that justice should be &quot;blind&quot;, or equal. Lady Liberty holds a shield covered in the stars and stripes of the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was thought that these incredible pieces of art were lost, since, over the decades, renovation projects obscured the frescoes. The frescoes were only recently rediscovered (2006). Luckily, the frescoes were saved, restored, and returned to their places in the Forest County Courthouse. The paintings can be viewed during business hours, as long as court is not in session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To read an article written by the person who found the murals, visit this website: http://www.freedom.org/board/articles/carlson-107.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the courthouse, the most recognizable landmark in Tionesta is the lighthouse that is on an island that is accessible from town. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forest County is famous as a rural retreat. Nearly 75% of all dwellings in the county are second or vacation homes and the county prides itself on the fact that it does not have a single traffic light.  Forest county was created on April 11, 1848, from part of Jefferson County. The county was enlarged on October 31, 1866, when part of Venango County was incorporated into the county.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the cache and take some time to enjoy town.  There are many other caches in town, including a couple on the island with the lighthouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache has been placed with the permission of the Forest County Board of Commissioners.</groundspeak:long_description>

Salmon Creek Valley. Little Salmon Creek is a secluded small stream
that empties into the larger Salmon Creek approximately a mile from

a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association
(NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of
the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile
apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North
Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA
66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged
individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a
commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of
the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the
inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the
100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the
corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50
NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on
the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address
to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your
North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the
real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That
treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure
that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

for more information on the trail and access points in the
Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This geocache is placed near a scenic overlook of the Salmon
Creek Valley. At the overlook, you can take a rest on the bench and
have lunch with a view or just take a few sips from your water
bottle while taking in the beauty of the natural surroundings. At
the exact location of the geocache is a very unique occurence.
Walking along the path, you will notice 2 trail trees. If you want
to learn a little bit about what trail trees are, just google them.
Very interesting stuff. These trail trees are pointing you to the
geocache. :)&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;The NCT travels up a small unnamed stream as it heads up a
valley away from Guiton Run. I stopped and placed this geocache in
a spot that seemed very peaceful and serene on this mid-spring day.
Stop and get this geocache and marvel at the high hillsides beside
you. You probably didn't even realize that they were getting so
big.&lt;/p&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

This cache wasn't on my route and it was a bit of an interesting find since I'd driven by here while trying to get to the Blueberry cache because the Garmin Nuvi routed me this way.  I even stopped to take a picture on it on the way out to the main road.  After finding the Blueberry cache and the AGT cache I saw this one on my GPSr and figured that it had to be the monument that I'd seen about 45 minutes earlier.  So back I went and this time someone was at the camp.  I was as stealthy as possible and made the quick find.  Thanks for bringing me here.....twice....and for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

I parked at the parking coordinates which had no parking signs but figured what the heck.  There were also signs in two places that said &quot;No Public Access&quot;.  I'm not sure what those were all about but I ignored them since I'm a cacher, not public.  There was a bike parked by the fence so apparently he wasn't part of the public either.  Found the cache in short order and removed a wet soggy log.  The container definitely needs help.  Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

This is the site of the first plantings in America by the Civilian Conservation Corps back in May of 1933.  There is a sign commemorating this at the cache site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Across the road from the cache is the road leading to the Marienville Rod and Gun Club's Trout Nursery.  They raise trout here and release them into the local streams.  The public is welcome to go back there and see the fish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cache is a waterproof matchstick container.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The North Country National Scenic Trail Geotrail (NCTGT) is
a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association
(NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of
the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile
apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North
Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA
66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged
individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a
commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of
the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the
inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the
100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the
corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50
NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on
the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address
to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your
North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the
real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That
treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure
that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt;
for more information on the trail and access points in the
Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is placed very near the trail's crossing of a forest
service road. This is also the area where the trail crosses the
hilltop and leaves, or enters the Salmon Creek valley.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located near a rock with a gorgeous view of a large valley in the Allegheny National Forest. The coordinates for the easiest way to the top of the rock are N41 32.450 W79 13.090. The route to this cache is along a dirt road between Marienville and Kelletville.  The view is beautiful any time of year, but it is best at sunset.  You may need a 4WD though if trying to get this cache with snow.  The ride on the road itself gives a pleasant trip through this beautiful piece of woods.  The cache is located on the other side of the road.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache contains numerous items along with about a dozen cache in, trash out kits. Feel free to use them to clean up some of the mess left by litterbugs who come to enjoy this beautiful view.  You will know what I mean when you look over the rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations to The Davis Family Rockstoppers for the FTF

a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association
(NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of

Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA
66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged
individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a
commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of
the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the
100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the
corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50
NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on
the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address
to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your
North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the
real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That
treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located along the trail about a mile north of
Kelletville. The section of trail that this cache is on is about
5.3 miles one way from the trail head north of Kelletville to the
trail head on FR449. This is a delightful hike. Me and stigloc, my
hiking partner for the day (and every other day it seems), did this
hike in just under 3 hours and that was with placing cache.
Wonderful section of trail with very few up and downs.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

brand new coin, trackable on geocaching.com. Please only take one
per cacher, and help us spread the word about these two great
resources in the Oil Region!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you park at the bridge on Miller farm road you will have the
shorter hike or you could park at the north or south end of the
trail and take a longer walk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As you walk towards the cache you will go right past a cemetery and
then up the ridge that has a very steep drop off on either side of
it so please keep an eye on the little ones if you have any with
you. On one side the drop off descends into the beautiful
Pennsylvania forest that fills most of the region. On the other
side at times you will be able to see Oil Creek and the tracks that
the OC &amp; T railway rides upon. There are many wild animals in
the area and in the fall the leaves are a site to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The many miles of trail that make up the Gerard Hiking Trail were
created and are maintained by a volunteer organization known as the
&quot;Over The Hill Gang&quot;. The trail gets it's name from one of the
volunteers who passed away before the completion of the project.
Make sure to say thanks if you happen to see any of them on the
trail doing there thing to make our lives a little more
enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Along with the cache there is also a &quot;Benchmark&quot; near where you
will park and a &quot;Letterbox&quot; on the other side of the bridge. No
hints will be given as they should not be needed.&lt;br /&gt;

I'd been to the cemetery before and really enjoyed the history of the place.  So after work Mrs.uccacher and I headed off to Titusville in search of &quot;The Ridge&quot;.  I think it's cool that Bussard444 got to meet my dad who is part of the &quot;Over the Hill Gang&quot;, the group that takes care of the Gerard Hiking Trail every Wednesday morning.

We parked between the railroad tracks and bridge on Miller Farm Road and after taking  photo of the benchmark, climbed the steps and headed up the trail.  I'm glad we knew the proper route to take because I don't think that I would have liked climbing up the hill from the tracks.  Once we got to the top we found the cache without any problems and I dropped off a couple of the new coins since there weren't any left in the container.

We took our time on the way down so Mrs.uccacher could photograph her favorite subject.  Fungus!  I even went down the hill to where it drops off sharply to the tracks in hopes of getting some good photos of the creek.  Unfortunately there were too many trees in the way but I did get my exercise coming back up.  Once we got back to the Jeep, I decided to go down to Oil Creek and take some pictures of the bridge since the creek was low.

I've now met my goal of finding at least one cace for 159 straight days.  The reason for the 159 is because that is the longest number of days that I'd gone without finding a cache.  Will I stop at 159?  I guess I'll find out tomorrow.  Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association
(NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of
the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile
apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North
Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA
66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged
individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a
commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of
the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the
inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the
100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the
corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50
NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on
the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address
to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your
North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the
real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That
treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure
that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt;
for more information on the trail and access points in the
Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located on the section of trail from Kelletville
to the trail head on FR449. It is hidden behind a mossy stump
beside Fork Run. This is a good size creek that the trail follows
along for a good piece. Enjoy the hike and the hide.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located along the section of trail from
Kelletville to the trail head on FR 449. It is hidden right after,
or before(depending on your direction of travel) crossing a snow
mobile trail that crosses the trail. The actual hiding spot reminds
me of the root fences that farmers used to put up way back in the
day. They would clear the woods away, creating a field and set the
roots of the trees up, without soil, and allow them to be the
fences to keep the animals in. This almost looks like that.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This cache is placed along the trail in the section that goes
north from Kelletville to the trail head on FR 449. There is an
interesting marker here from the department of agriculture that
uses three bearing trees (2 of which still have their marks also)
to confirm the location of the marker. Pretty cool to come along
the trail and all of a sudden find such an elaborate location
marker set up in the middle of nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

The&lt;br/&gt;school was built in 1925, and was for grades one through six. It&lt;br/&gt;was closed after 31 years of service in 1956. There were&lt;br/&gt;three-rooms in the school. Kids who went to school here walked or&lt;br/&gt;were brought by bus or buggy. A large coal furnace in the basement&lt;br/&gt;heated it. Many of the neighbors that are still living in the area&lt;br/&gt;went to school here. There was a small ball field next to the&lt;br/&gt;schoolhouse at one time. After it was closed down it was used for a&lt;br/&gt;Four H meeting hall for a short time. Then it was converted into a&lt;br/&gt;living house and the present occupants have lived there for 20&lt;br/&gt;years and are the ones who have given permission for the cache to&lt;br/&gt;be placed here.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The North Country National Scenic Trail Geotrail (NCTGT) is
a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association
(NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of
the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile
apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North
Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA
66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged
individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a
commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of
the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the
inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the
100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;
HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the
corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50
NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on
the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address
to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your
North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the
real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That
treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure
that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt;
for more information on the trail and access points in the
Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located along the trail section that runs north
from Kelletville to the trail head on FR449. This cache was the
last one that I hid as my contribution to this incredible
collection of 100 caches along 100 miles of trail. I am, or have
been, your cache placing guide from Route 66 in Clarion County to
FR 449 just north of this location. I hope that you enjoy this
series of caches as much as I enjoyed putting my portion of them
out.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

One hundred individual caches are hidden approximately a mile apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania. You can earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion by finding 50 of these NCTGT caches and retrieving the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seven NCTGT Bonus caches are placed along one remaining segment of the North Country Trail within the ANF that does not have NCTGT caches. Once you hike all sections of the NCT in the ANF, you can earn a “North Country Trail 95 mile Patch” offered by the Allegheny Outdoor Club. Visit the Allegheny Outdoor Club website at http://www.alleghenyoutdoorclub.org/nct_patch.html for more information on the NCT/ANF patch. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go to www.northcountrytrail.org/anf for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">*There has been some big changes to this cache. There is now at&lt;br /&gt;least temporarily mud that is so thick I had to pull my 16 year old&lt;br /&gt;Daughter out of it (the worst can be avoided if you use care in&lt;br /&gt;choosing your path.) There are a lot more places where the cache&lt;br /&gt;could be so I have upped the rating a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The cache is in an ammo box and in the woods where I used to play&lt;br /&gt;as a kid. After you find the cache you may want to continue up to&lt;br /&gt;the rocks (roughly north of the cache). This cache started life&lt;br /&gt;with a Gore change purse, a book (Lost in space), a bugs life&lt;br /&gt;figure (Flick), a New York Yankees key chain, a skeleton key chain&lt;br /&gt;and some new shoe laces. Of course there is also a log book, 2&lt;br /&gt;pencils, a couple of pens and a pencil sharpener. If you have any&lt;br /&gt;questions feel free to send me an E-mail through this site. Happy&lt;br /&gt;Caching</groundspeak:long_description>

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

This cache is 1 mile south of Minister Road on the NCT.   </groundspeak:long_description>

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

This cache is about 2 miles north of Minister Road on the NCT.   </groundspeak:long_description>

Once you hike all sections of the NCT in the ANF, you can earn a “North Country Trail 95 mile Patch” offered by the Allegheny Outdoor Club.

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

This cache is about 4 miles south from Minister Road or 1.5 miles north from FS 116 on the NCT.    </groundspeak:long_description>

There are over 1100 numbered roads and many more unnumbered oil development roads throughout the area. Without these roads a lot of caches would not be possible. Each road is built to exacting engineering specifications. Some roads are open for everyday traffic, some open only at hunting season, and some are closed for resource management. If there is no gate on the road it is generally drivable by anyone. If there is a signed gate motorized vehicles are not allowed. All roads are open for hiking and bicycling, even the gated oil and gas development roads. Enjoy the series and enjoy the roads.</groundspeak:long_description>

One hundred individual caches are hidden approximately a mile apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania. You can earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion by finding 50 of these NCTGT caches and retrieving the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seven NCTGT Bonus caches are placed along one remaining segment of the North Country Trail within the ANF that does not have NCTGT caches. Once you hike all sections of the NCT in the ANF, you can earn a “North Country Trail 95 mile Patch” offered by the Allegheny Outdoor Club. Visit the Allegheny Outdoor Club website at http://www.alleghenyoutdoorclub.org/nct_patch.html for more information on the NCT/ANF patch. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go to www.northcountrytrail.org/anf for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

There are over 1100 numbered roads and many more unnumbered oil development roads throughout the area. Without these roads a lot of caches would not be possible. Each road is built to exacting engineering specifications. Some roads are open for everyday traffic, some open only at hunting season, and some are closed for resource management. If there is no gate on the road it is generally drivable by anyone. If there is a signed gate motorized vehicles are not allowed. All roads are open for hiking and bicycling, even the gated oil and gas development roads. Enjoy the series and enjoy the roads.</groundspeak:long_description>

Mrs. uccacher and I headed south to try the new ones near Titusville.  Even though the coordinates are good, this one took a few minutes to track down.  I guess I was thinking that in this part of the state it would have been hidden where it was snow friendly.  Now that I look at the attributes I see that it isn't.  I guess that's one of the disadvantages of going paperless since my GPSr doesn't show attributes.  Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

(41 42.46-079 57.16), walk down the road 100 ft or so and just past a white post with an orange sign on your left, there is an evident trail heading NNE about 40-50 degrees, follow that through the woods until you come to a Y (41 42.64 - 079 57.08), take the right trail, about 50-75 feet down the trail, on the right side, there is a White Pine tree with three trunks, and next to that a single tree. Cache is in a two gallon white sealed bucket at the base of the triple trunk tree.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well, the rain quit so I decided to give this one another go.  Armed with a little more information courtesy of emtfire10 (mainly the part about not having to leave the roadside), I was able to find the first stage quickly this time.  The coordinates had me on the opposite side of the road, down over the bank.  I'd looked in that area before but this time I had the right angle.  WooHoo!! Off to stage 2.

This area looked familiar because there was another cache nearby at one time.  Once again I made this one much harder than it was and found it after about 15 minutes.  I don't know how I missed this on the first or second passes but the third time was a charm.  WooHoo!!! Off to stage 3.

This was definitely the hardest of the three stages and I needed a lot of help from emtfire10 and firegirl69.  I was actually looking for the right object but it seems that something happened over night making it about a 4.5 difficulty.  Thanks for the big assist Dave and Val!!!  WooHoo!!!  Off to the final.

This one was an easy one and I made a pretty quick find, grabbed the FTF coin and left a coin and TB.  I ended up with about 3 hours invested in this one and was glad to be able to complete it.  I'm not a fan of multis but this one was too close to home to ignore.  I'm also adding a waypoint for the first stage that may help if your having trouble.  They look to be about 30' from the posted coordinates. The other 3 stages were right on for me. Thanks for adventure and FTF #16.</groundspeak:text>

Each road is built to exacting engineering specifications. Some roads are open for everyday traffic, some open only at hunting season, and some are closed for resource management. If there is no gate on the road it is generally drivable by anyone. If there is a signed gate motorized vehicles are not allowed. All roads are open for hiking and bicycling, even the gated oil and gas development roads. Enjoy the series and enjoy the roads.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Canadohta Lake is the second-largest natural lake in Pennsylvania. Its tree-lined shores and spring-fed waters are located in the Keystone State's Great Lakes tourism region. This sportsman's paradise is famous for its year-round fishing and the tournaments it hosts, in particular the ice fishing tournament held every February.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Canadohta Lake is one of eight lakes in Crawford County. The waterways draw outdoor enthusiasts to the area for hiking, sailing, swimming, fishing, camping, biking, canoeing and numerous other activities. Anglers are delighted to hear that big fish stories are no lie at Canadohta Lake; the state stocks Canadohta Lake annually with pan fish, bluegill, perch, sunfish, northern pike, muskellunge, walleye, smallmouth bass, and largemouth bass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Washington Lake was the first name given the body of water. As the story goes, during the Revolutionary War, George Washington was a friend of Colonel Crawford, the namesake of the county in which Canadohta Lake rests. The name was changed in the 1800s to the more aptly descriptive Oil Creek Lake. Prospectors and developers bought and sold land around the lake until about 1900, when a group of rich men bought up all the property around the lake. They changed the name to Canadohta after Cornplanter Chief Canadaughta. A lawsuit opened up the lake to the public, relegated ownership of Canadohta Lake to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and denied the Canadohta Club private use of the water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

When I got up this morning I checked my mail and saw that it had been published about 30 minutes earlier.  Hoping that Canadohtaman wasn't going to come out of retirementb  I headed south to try my luck.  When I saw that it was hidden in the same place as the old one I figured I'd grab my gloves.  Oh crap.  I'd used them the day before and didn't put them back in the Jeep.  Oh well.  Even though I had to search through the prickly stuff I was FTF at 8:00am.  Took a couple of coins to move on.  This was my 14th AGT-Crawford stamp.  Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

There are over 1100 numbered roads and many more unnumbered oil development roads throughout the area.  Without these roads a lot of caches would not be possible. Each road is built to exacting engineering specifications. Some roads are open for everyday traffic, some open only at hunting season, and some are closed for resource management. If there is no gate on the road it is generally drivable by anyone. If there is a signed gate motorized vehicles are not allowed. All roads are open for hiking and bicycling, even the gated oil and gas development roads. Enjoy the series and enjoy the roads.</groundspeak:long_description>

Located off an oil road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh well, maybe a bit more than &quot;just&quot; off the road.  This cache is located off Grunderville Road along an oil lease road.   Pay no attention to the gate if you are walking.  It is to keep vehicles out. The lease, including the building, is located on the Allegheny National Forest.  As such you can walk anywhere you want despite what some oil producers want you to believe.  I would not drive up the road though even if the gate is open.  The cache is a medium sized snap lid food storage container that should keep things dry if the lid is replaced with care.</groundspeak:long_description>

There are over 1100 numbered roads and many more unnumbered oil development roads throughout the area.  Without these roads a lot of caches would not be possible. Each road is built to exacting engineering specifications. Some roads are open for everyday traffic, some open only at hunting season, and some are closed for resource management. If there is no gate on the road it is generally drivable by anyone. If there is a signed gate motorized vehicles are not allowed. All roads are open for hiking and bicycling, even the gated oil and gas development roads. Enjoy the series and enjoy the roads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to aftamath77 for the FTF.  I guess this just goes to show that &quot;very experienced cachers&quot; are not always the best anyway.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a replacement for the original Road Long Gone 1 that had mapping problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is placed near the long closed Grunderville Road. It was a great short cut from RT 62 to Pleasant Drive outside Warren. PennDOT closed the road in the 90's as the road was constantly sliding down the hill and required periodic major maintenance. The closed road is in the middle of the existing Grurnderville Road as the road is still open on the east and west end.  Most of the closed road is on private property so hiking from one end to the other is not a reality.</groundspeak:long_description>

My Grandkids really like the playground here so I needed to let
everyone see what this park has to offer. Bring your picnic lunch
as there are lots of places to enjoy a snack and watch a ball game.
Lots of muggles around but maybe not for the final. The coords at
the second stage are the commercial standard for coords being 4
places. Just round the 4 places to three places for your GPSr.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: AI299P5 - Final Mac &amp; Dee's Fun Place&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: BP299P5 - Stage 2 of Mac &amp; Dee's Fun Place&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

It looks like it must have rained here either last night or early this morning because the grass and undergrowth in the woods were very wet.  It didn't much matter since we spent the entire day in the wet.  We were able to track down the first two stages very quickly and Tprints made the find on the final in a spot where I'd already looked.  For those who don't use DeLorme GPSr's, just round up the next to last digit of the stage 2 number that has 4 decimal places and everything will work our fine.  Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

There are over 1100 numbered roads and many more unnumbered oil development roads throughout the area. Without these roads a lot of caches would not be possible. Each road is built to exacting engineering specifications. Some roads are open for everyday traffic, some open only at hunting season, and some are closed for resource management. If there is no gate on the road it is generally drivable by anyone. If there is a signed gate motorized vehicles are not allowed. All roads are open for hiking and bicycling, even the gated oil and gas development roads. Enjoy the series and enjoy the roads.</groundspeak:long_description>

There are over 1100 numbered roads and many more unnumbered oil development roads throughout the area. Without these roads a lot of caches would not be possible. Each road is built to exacting engineering specifications. Some roads are open for everyday traffic, some open only at hunting season, and some are closed for resource management. If there is no gate on the road it is generally drivable by anyone. If there is a signed gate motorized vehicles are not allowed. All roads are open for hiking and bicycling, even the gated oil and gas development roads. Enjoy the series and enjoy the roads.</groundspeak:long_description>

It started out as a Civilian Conservation Camp (CCC) in the 1930's.  After the war Elinor Roosevelt was instrumental in securing the site for a Girl Scout Camp.  It remained a camp until just the last few years when the Girl Scout council was moved to Pittsburgh.  That council decided to consolidate camps in their region and Birdsall Edey was closed down.  There are no current plans for the site now.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please BYOP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple micro hidden in the normal fashion please BYOP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having water available in area streams, ponds and cisterns helps a fire department only if the water is readily accessible. The needed water may be located so far away from where it is needed that a fire department's ability to control the fire is impaired. Mobile water supply vehicles can move water from distant sources, but the critical factor is whether or not the fire department can maintain an uninterrupted supply of a predictable rate of water at the fire scene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Installation of dry hydrants into nearby and developed water supplies eliminates the inefficiency and complexity of long-distance water shuttle operations. This arrangement also allows access to water sources from a roadway instead of having to work on soft ground immediately adjacent to the pond or stream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In any area without water mains and domestic fire hydrants, the dry hydrant concept can provide a simple, cost-effective solution to the need for rapid access to water sources. A dry hydrant consists of an arrangement of piping with one end in the water and the other end extending to dry land and available for connection to a pumper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dry hydrants have the following features:&lt;br/&gt;•Use a non-pressurized pipe system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;•Use relatively inexpensive piping materials and other supplies.&lt;br/&gt;•Are permanently installed in existing lakes, ponds, streams and cisterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;•Provide a means of access whenever needed, regardless of weather.&lt;br/&gt;•Allow years of simple operation with a minimum of maintenance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The GPS put me in the middle of the trail so even though that's not far off, it made for an interesting search.  I'm sure the muggles were wondering why a Fence Inspector would be working on a Sunday but I just ignored them and went about my business.  After searching for quite awhile, I decided to call the last finder who told me where to look.  Thanks Dave!  That sure wasn't what I was expecting.  I'm certainly glad I didn't try this one in the winter time.  Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

I'd say that it's going to rain 25% of the time.  8:00am it was raining.  Same at 9:00am.  10:00am....rain.  11:00am, 12:00pm, 1:00pm...more of the same.  Finally at 2:30pm I decided that I was going to get wet so off I went.  Luckily I made a quick find just as somebody in a white Blazer drove by blowing the horn.  A short time later the owner's wife called and made a harrassing comment about my backside [:O] This was my 60th straight day of finding at least one cache.  Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out grabbing a few caches with Tprints and MommyTP after the &quot;Caching with Eagles&quot; event at Kinzua.  Mrs. uccacher figured out what this one was from the comfort of the Jeep.  I think the footprints left by several other cachers confirmed her suspicions.  A quick find was made and the log was signed.  I really like this type of hide.  They can be pretty tricky for those who haven't seen them before.  Thanks for the cache.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">WooHoo!!! First to find.  I'll admit that I had help.  After searching for the first stage for 45 minutes, I called the owner for a hint.  He gave me a little one that confirmed that I was searching correctly but still couldn't come up with it after another 30 minutes.  So I called again begging for mercy and he gave a better hint.  It still took 10 more minutes to find it.  I think that it was hidden much better than intended.  I rehid it as found.

After that it was off to stage 2.  I knew about were it was going to be and knew of an easier way to get there but I wanted to check on a cache I was trying to get published.  It turns out that my cache is 475' from this one which is too close according to Groundspeak.

Fortunately the water is really, really low right now so it made crossing the water a snap.  Then it was just a matter of climbing the hill to GZ which wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  Worked my way over to where the GPSr showed the final and stood there surveying the situation.  Turns out I was standing about 3' from the well hidden container.  Signed the log at 11:26am and took the FTF coin which I will probably release since we have all of the AGT coins.  Thanks for the adventure and for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

A FTF on a cache with the same name is mine!!!  WooHoo!!!  Checked the wrong spot first and realized that the skirts don't lift.  After consulting the DeLorme, a quick find was made at 6:35am.

Just park on the side of Peterson rd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leviticus is a manual of regulations enabling the holy King to set up his earthly throne among the people of his kingdom. It explains how they are to be his holy people and to worship him in a holy manner. Holiness in this sense means to be separated from sin and set apart exclusively to the Lord for his purpose and for his glory. So the key thought of the book is holiness (see notes on 11:44; Ex 3:5)—the holiness of God and his people (they must revere him in “holiness”). In Leviticus spiritual holiness is symbolized by physical perfection. Therefore the book demands perfect animals for its many sacrifices (chs. 1–7) and requires priests without deformity (chs. 8–10). A woman’s hemorrhaging after giving birth (ch. 12); sores, burns or baldness (chs. 13–14); a man’s bodily discharge (15:1–18); specific activities during a woman’s monthly period (15:19–33)—all may be signs of blemish (a lack of perfection) and may symbolize human spiritual defects, which break spiritual wholeness. The person with visible skin disease must be banished from the camp, the place of God’s special presence, just as Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden. Such people can return to the camp (and therefore to God’s presence) when they are pronounced whole again by the examining priests. Before they can reenter the camp, however, they must offer the prescribed, perfect sacrifices (symbolizing the perfect, whole sacrifice of Christ).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I guess I didn't read the previous logs on this one or it would have been a lot easier.  My wife spotted this one as she went back out on the Gameland road.  There were about 10 cars parked along Old Wattsburg road &quot;bird watching&quot; (as JoelMart called it) trying to catch sight of the eagles that nest there.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

His stills were the biggest in the area and produced only the highest quality illegal Gin in the two state area. Through a network of sneaks and &quot;vacuum salesmen&quot; Ostergard's gin was delivered to the many back room bars and Speakeasys in the Corry and Youngsville areas along with Clymer and Findley Lake NY.&lt;br/&gt;The business was a great success for may years till one day while doing a proofing test he managed to some how set his entire setup to flame. After sending his helper to safety Ostergard was killed when one of the tanks collapsed under the heat and the ensuing blast literally blew him to pieces and shook the ground for miles. After a rather lengthily search all of the remains were found with the exception of his head. Many people said that he got what he deserved but many more drank to his memory for as long as the back stock of the great mans Gin held out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK27NTX - Ostergaurd Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 41° 59.345 W 079° 40.650&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We just had to try for first to find on this one since it still hadn't been logged when we got out of work.  Groundspeak's email server was broken so we didn't get notification of this one when it was published.  I saw that it was published last night when I checked my closest unfound caches in the morning but since this was one of three new ones in the same area, I figured some one had already grabbed them either last night or early this morning.  So after grabbing another FTF in Cambridge Springs and seeing that it still hadn't been logged, we headed toward Clymer to give it a shot.

The deer carcass that's about 30' or so away adds a nice touch.  It probably didn't smell when the cache was hidden since it was more like winter yesterday but the aroma was pretty noticeable in the scorching 60 degree heat.  We found the cache right away and saw that twhrider had been here about 40 minutes ahead of us.  After signing the log, I gave her a call and found out that she was first on the other two as well and that she was about 1 minute from passing by.  She stopped and we had a nice chat before heading for home.  We saved the other two caches for another day so that I can keep my consecutive days caching streak alive.  It stands at 55 right now.

After about 10 minutes I finally found it in the first non-obvious spot that Mrs.uccacher had checked.  She usually finds the caches in places that I've already checked.  After we signed the log at 5:45pm and rehid the container, the owner showed up.  We chatted for about 30 minutes before heading out to grab a few more local caches that we hadn't found yet.  Thanks for another FTF and a fun cache!!  At least it was fun for us since we found it.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The book of Judges depicts the life of Israel in the promised land from the death of Joshua to the rise of the monarchy. On the one hand, it is an account of frequent apostasy, provoking divine chastening. On the other hand, it tells of urgent appeals to God in times of crisis, moving the Lord to raise up leaders (judges) through whom he throws off foreign oppressors and restores the land to peace.&lt;br/&gt;With Israel’s conquest of the promised land through the leadership of Joshua, many of the covenant promises God had made to their ancestors were fulfilled (see Jos 21:43–45). The Lord’s land, where Israel was to enter into rest, lay under their feet; it remained only for them to occupy it, to displace the Canaanites and to cleanse it of paganism. The time had come for Israel to be the kingdom of God in the form of an established commonwealth on earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But in Canaan Israel quickly forgot the acts of God that had given them birth and had established them in the land. Consequently they lost sight of their unique identity as God’s people, chosen and called to be his army and the loyal citizens of his emerging kingdom.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This has some history, been stolen twice in 2 different locations. Your looking for a pill bottle in a tree have fun. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many readers of Joshua (and other OT books) are deeply troubled by the role that warfare plays in this account of God’s dealings with his people. Not a few relieve their ethical scruples by ascribing the author’s perspective to a pre-Christian (and sub-Christian) stage of moral development that the Christian, in the light of Christ’s teaching, must repudiate and transcend. Hence the main thread of the narrative line of Joshua is an offense to them. &lt;br/&gt;It must be remembered, however, that the book of Joshua does not address itself to the abstract ethical question of war as a means for gaining human ends. It can only be understood in the context of the history of redemption unfolding in the Pentateuch, with its interplay of divine grace and judgment. Of that story it is the direct continuation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joshua is not an epic account of Israel’s heroic generation or the story of Israel’s conquest of Canaan with the aid of her national deity. It is rather the story of how God, to whom the whole world belongs, at one stage in the history of redemption reconquered a portion of the earth from the powers of this world that had claimed it for themselves, defending their claims by force of arms and reliance on their false gods. It tells how God commissioned his people to serve as his army under the leadership of his servant Joshua, to take Canaan in his name out of the hands of the idolatrous and dissolute Canaanites (whose measure of sin was now full; see Ge 15:16 and note). It further tells how he aided them in the enterprise and gave them conditional tenancy in his land in fulfillment of the ancient pledge he had made to Israel’s ancestors, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Much of its legislation for people and priests is similar to that in Exodus, Leviticus and Deuteronomy. The book tells of the murmuring and rebellion of God’s people and of their subsequent judgment. Those whom God had redeemed from slavery in Egypt and with whom he had made a covenant at Mount Sinai responded not with faith, gratitude and obedience but with unbelief, ingratitude and repeated acts of rebellion, which came to extreme expression in their refusal to undertake the conquest of Canaan (ch. 14). The community of the redeemed forfeited their part in the promised land. They were condemned to live out their lives in the desert; only their children would enjoy the fulfillment of the promise that had originally been theirs (cf. Heb 3:7—4:11). &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

As his final act at this important time of transferring leadership to Joshua, Moses delivered his farewell addresses to prepare the people for their entrance into Canaan. In them, Moses emphasized the laws that were especially needed at such a time, and he presented them in a way appropriate to the situation. In contrast to the matter-of-fact narratives of Leviticus and Numbers, here the words of Moses come to us from his heart as this servant of the Lord presses God’s claims on his people Israel. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Please BYOP &amp; remember to hide it as best if not beter than before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trucking industry is a very tough job to deal with. The hours required to move all types of freight from point A to point B. Here you may see Kwhops, Big &amp; Long Nose Petes, Freightshakers, Overgrown Dodges on steroids, Cabovers and numerous other types. Some are company owned &amp; some are not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I drove out on the road, the trucks that I had seen were un real. I travelled all over the East Coast with Florida being the only state that I never drove thru.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would love to do this job again, only if the pay was right.If you bought it, drive it, wear it, breathe it, drink it, or eat it a Trucker brought it @ some point.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is in the beautiful Chautauqua Institution. Most of the year there is free entry on to the grounds and you can drive on most of the streets. During the summer months many roads are closed to motorized traffic and a gate pass is required to enter the grounds they can be purchased at the Welcome Center or you can grab one for free from a gate attendant on Sundays.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is near the Packard Mansion, BUT...&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cache is not on the mansion property. That is private property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You don’t need any cash to find this cache.&lt;br /&gt;
But a big fancy mansion you will pass.&lt;br /&gt;
Take a short walk down the promenade path&lt;br /&gt;
To the place where it is stashed&lt;br /&gt;
If you come at night there will be light&lt;br /&gt;
If you’ve gone to far you can take a seat&lt;br /&gt;
After resting take a walk back to where to trunks meet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Start Here :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
Use the North Shore Promenade at the intersection of Pratt &amp; Elm to get to the cache, and the smiley.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

It can be found at the intersection of Pratt &amp; Elm. There is absolutely no need to cross the grounds of the Packard Mansion. Thanks to Tprints for providing the info for this Waypoint.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Christ's Church in Port Maitland was built in 1841. My wife &amp; I&lt;br /&gt;were married here in 1976. Her parents and numerous relatives are&lt;br /&gt;buried in the church cemetery. There is also a public cemetery&lt;br /&gt;adjoining the Anglican Church cemetery immediately to the east.&lt;br /&gt;Parking is available at the entrance to the church at the following&lt;br /&gt;coordinates: N42o 51.502 W079o 35.235&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some interesting history related to this little country&lt;br /&gt;church. Because of its excellent harbor, the British maintained a&lt;br /&gt;naval base at Port Maitland after the War of 1812. In 1850, the&lt;br /&gt;ship Commerce sank off of Port Maitland and 25 of those who&lt;br /&gt;perished are buried here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following account is from The Grand River Naval Depot by&lt;br /&gt;John Thornley Docker, D.Min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Three steam vessels, the Minos, the Toronto, and the Despatch&lt;br /&gt;were stationed in the harbour during the following years. On May 6,&lt;br /&gt;1850 the worst disaster on Lake Erie up to that time occurred just&lt;br /&gt;outside the Port Maitland harbour. The Despatch, stationed at the&lt;br /&gt;naval depot, rammed the steamer Commerce, which was damaged so&lt;br /&gt;badly that it sank in a very short time. The Commerce had been en&lt;br /&gt;route to London with 125 officers and men of the 23rd regiment of&lt;br /&gt;the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, their wives and children. Those saved&lt;br /&gt;were put on board the Minos and taken to the naval establishment.&lt;br /&gt;The actual number of those who perished that night has never been&lt;br /&gt;definitely established. Twenty-five bodies recovered from the wreck&lt;br /&gt;were interred in a long grave in Christ's Church cemetery. A&lt;br /&gt;monument placed over the grave by the regiment remains as a&lt;br /&gt;reminder of the tragedy.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monument is still legible after all these years. You may&lt;br /&gt;find it interesting to read after you have located the cache. Also,&lt;br /&gt;be sure to enjoy the great view of the lake, the pier and the Port&lt;br /&gt;Maitland Light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; A detailed account of the sinking of&lt;br /&gt;the Commerce can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first cache I have hidden. It's a small camouflaged&lt;br /&gt;lock n lock container. At the time of hiding it contained the&lt;br /&gt;following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Log book and pencil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Geocache note&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- An Oakcoins &lt;em&gt;&quot;First to Find&quot;&lt;/em&gt; pin for the first to&lt;br /&gt;find&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A small blue toy pickup truck for trading purposes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- A new travel bug I'm releasing here&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK276P2 - Parking for GC276P2&lt;br /&gt;N 42° 51.502 W 079° 35.235</groundspeak:long_description>

This lock at Port Maitland provided access for ships&lt;br /&gt;to the feeder canal which functioned as a regular branch of the&lt;br /&gt;Welland Canal from 1845 to 1850 while the main canal was being&lt;br /&gt;reconstructed from Feeder Junction to Port Colborne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find the answers to the following questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.

Advice to anyone doing this one, TAKE LOTS OF BUG SPRAY! and watch the fields on the way in and out. After our find we were rewarded by watching a raccoon and 3 deer in the field. The deer then appeared to chase off the raccoon.

There is an issue with this cache. If a red circle on a post or fence means no trespassing (and I'm pretty sure that's what it means), the cache where it is now is located almost directly behind one of these red blazes... There is no trespassing required to get there as far as I know, and the cache can be retrieved without trespassing, but on the other side of the trail might be a safer bet so no one complains.

TFTC! enjoying your series so far:-)</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">LadyJaime and I decided it was a nice afternoon for a little caching so went out to find this one after leaving the babysitters. As soon as I turned off the main road, I realized I had been here before for a wedding a few summers back. This is the quintessential 'little country church' - beautiful inside as well as the surrounding grounds. One thing that you don't see very often is the large 'crypt-like' stones. Also noticed a very small stone on the way back from the cache - very old and hard to read, but appeared its owner had lived only 24 days... nice to see that the monument has lasted so long.

Thanks for bringing me back here and TFTC</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;The cache is NOT at the posted coordinates&lt;/b&gt;, but the
coordinates can be used for parking and for the first stop of your
tour.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To complete this cache, you will need to learn a bit of the history
of Dunnville by taking a short walking tour of the downtown area.
You should be able to complete this walkabout in 30 to 45 minutes.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Early History: The town of Dunnville owes its existence to the
building of the original Welland Canal. The need to raise water
levels in the canal was fulfilled by the damming of the Grand River
and construction of the feeder canal in 1827. A town soon grew up
around the dam but growth was slow until the Grand River Navigation
Company was formed and the Grand River began to be used as a
transportation corridor. By 1859 the town had a population of
1,800.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This walking tour will take to a number of historically significant
sites in the downtown area. At each stop you will need to find a
bit of information regarding the history of Dunnville. Waypoints
are provided below. Please be careful crossing streets which can be
busy at times and keep an eye on the little ones when walking from
stop to stop.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ready to start?&lt;/b&gt; Here we go!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stop #1: The Farmer's Market: established in 1860, the Dunnville
Farmer's market still operates from March until the end of December
every Tuesday and Saturday from 7am to noon.&lt;br /&gt;
A = the first digit of the regulation section that prohibits
animals at the market.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stop #2: The Firehall: here you will find a bell and tower erected
by the Dunnville Firefighter's Association and 2 plaques. B = the
last digit in the year associated with the &quot;Protection Co. No.
1&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stop #3: The Royal Canadian Legion: Here is a plaque commemorating
Dunnville Branch #142. There are seven numbers on the plaque. C =
the last digit of the sixth number.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stop #4: The Library: outside the library you will find a number of
plaques. One commemorates the Harvard Mark II, one of the principal
training aircraft used by the R.C.A.F. during the 2nd World
War.&lt;br /&gt;
WW = the last 2 digits of the number of British Commonwealth pilots
who received their flying training on this type of aircraft at No.
6 Service Flying Training School at Dunnville from Oct 31, 1940 to
Dec 1, 1944.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stop #5: Dunnville Mozaik Sunset: this mosaic is based on a sunset
photo of the Grand River taken by local geocacher Roadapple49 and
commemorates Dunnville's Sesquicentennial Birthday (150 years). On
the plaque below the mosiac you will see a 4 digit number
indicating the number of cells in the mosiac.&lt;br /&gt;
E = (the 1st plus the 4th digit) minus (the 2nd plus the 3rd
digit).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stop #6: Central Park: Behind the cenotaph which commemorates those
who served in 3 wars you will find an ancient cannon. Take note of
the year engraved on the top of the cannon. Now find a mate to this
cannon elsewhere in the park. Take note of the year engraved on the
top of this 2nd cannon. Subtract the year of the 2nd cannon from
the year on the first cannon.&lt;br /&gt;
D = the answer. (you can verify your answer by checking the 3rd of
the three numbers engraved above the year on the 2nd cannon).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stop #7: The Gore: defined as a triangular piece of land found
where roads merge or split, this is the center of downtown
Dunnville. This waypoint will bring you to a small statue in a
flower bed. Stand on the sidewalk near the statue and look around.
Across the street you will see one of Dunnville's oldest and one of
my favourite restaurants. If you can't see it, move east towards
the crosswalk.&lt;br /&gt;
Z = the last digit in the year this diner was established.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stop #8: The Old Bridge: here you will find a large mural depicting
the original dam and bridge.&lt;br /&gt;
X = the number of waterways or plumes that are depicted as flowing
under the bridge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stop #9: The Maple Tree Memorials: A large maple tree stands here.
Beneath it are a number of things on which are mounted memorial
plaques. There is another thing which is similar to the others but
has no plaque.&lt;br /&gt;
Y = the total number of these things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The final:&lt;/b&gt; Now that you have learned your history lesson and
have all your answers, simply plug them in to the coordinates as
follows:&lt;br /&gt;
N 42 AB.CDE&lt;br /&gt;
W 079 WW.XYZ&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note: the cache area can sometimes be high in muggles. Please be
careful not to expose the cache to muggles. The cache container is
a camo'd decon container. When re-closing the lid be sure to listen
for 4 distinct &quot;pop&quot; sounds as each corner snaps into place. Cache
contains a log sheet but no writing instrument so bring your own.
There's a loonie for FTF and a geocoin that wants to move to
Halifax.&lt;br /&gt;

Well laid out and everything works as it should - a nice little tour. I must confess I'm not sure why this is a puzzle rather than a multi? No matter. Thanks for the nice walk and the FTF  Took coin to move along.</groundspeak:text>

OK, it's not the Grand Canyon, but it's a nice spot to rest while hiking through the forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Official entrance to the Marshall Memorial Forest is at the end of Gillian Drive. But much better parking (P1) can be found at the Church on Highway 3 and another trail entrance (T1) is just a short walk to the bushline at the back of the church lawn. There are numerous paths and unmarked trails throughout the forest. To get to the cache from the trail head, follow the foot trails avoiding the ATV trails, as they can be very muddy. I've provided a waypoint (PD) to a pond which is on the way. The trails have numerous foot-bridges to assist you in crossing the swampy areas that you will encounter. Cross with care.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small decon container with a strap and clip which you can use to pull it from it's hiding spot. When re-closing the lid be sure to listen for 4 distinct snaps as each corner of the lid closes tightly. Please replace the container into it's hiding spot so that the strap and clip do not show.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a toonie in the cache so FTF can have a coffee on me as well as the &quot;Benzie&quot; 50th Anniversary geocoin to help get things started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will walk past GCZVB4 on your way this cache, so be sure to grab it while you're here. Also, GC2RRMD &quot;King Oak&quot; is a short walk through forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh yeah, - - - Bring BUG SPRAY! - - - &lt;br/&gt;And bring your own PEN or PENCIL!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to BFT6 and ldot for their FTF!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;P12QN0B - GC2QN0B Parking 1&lt;br/&gt;N 42° 54.624 W 079° 35.065&lt;br/&gt;Church parking lot - best parking&lt;br/&gt;PD2QN0B - POND&lt;br/&gt;N 42° 54.654 W 079° 34.845&lt;br/&gt;Pond&lt;br/&gt;T12QN0B - Trail head from P1&lt;br/&gt;N 42° 54.604 W 079° 35.014&lt;br/&gt;Trailhead from P1 parking</groundspeak:long_description>

I thought this would be a good&lt;br /&gt;addition to the series as it's a great example of how old&lt;br /&gt;graveyards can be preserved. This little cemetery is off the beaten&lt;br /&gt;path on a dead end paved road. Park alongside the road. It's not a&lt;br /&gt;high muggle area but it is visible from the neighbouring properties&lt;br /&gt;so some stealth is advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your visit and please remember as Dr. House would say,&lt;br /&gt;cemeteries and their headstones should be treated with respect and&lt;br /&gt;reverence for the souls within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cache and log book only so BYOP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So went after another hobo highway cache in town and met up with the SneakySeguis, who didn't have time to head out to this one today. Figured someone would pick it up today, and waited until picking my son up from school, along with his friend. So with geobabe (LadyJaime), catsrule51 and his muggle friend we headed out for an after school walk in the woods to find a couple caches. We were greeted with a blank log book around 3:27 p.m. TFTC and the FTF </groundspeak:text>

very old as well as some newer markers.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sign says &quot;Willson's Cemetery&quot; but it is often referred to
simply as the &quot;Wilson&quot; cemetery. Judging by the dates on some of
the older markers, it appears to be the final resting place of some
of the pioneers of the township. Please be respectful of the area
and for the souls who rest here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a small camo'd lock'n'lock container and should be
an easy find. Contains a log book but no writing instrument so
BYOP. There's a smiley face pathtag for FTF.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located in 30 feet of water. You will need to SCUBA to find and log this cache, or have some mad snorkeling and freediving skills. The cache is a 5.7 liter Rubbermaid container permanently attached to a submerged cinder block.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is water-filled and is designed to be opened under water. &lt;b&gt;You cannot detach the cache and bring it to the surface!&lt;/b&gt; The log is a largish dive slate and can be signed with a regular pencil. We've included a pencil, but with it being wood it won't last very long, so &lt;b&gt;bring your own pencil!&lt;/b&gt; Any regular pencil will do, as long as you don't mind it getting wet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located at the given coordinates. We used a surface buoy to determine the coordinates so they should be reasonably accurate. Obviously you can't use your GPS under water, so you can either use the GPS at the surface to determine ground zero and then descend straight down, possibly using a surface buoy to help you with that. Or you can follow the instructions given below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Welland Scuba Park is located in a section of the Old Welland Canal that's not used for commercial ship traffic any more. The Old Welland Canal is now used for recreational activities, such as boating, fishing or swimming. This particular section has been designated by the city of Welland as a Scuba Park, and local dive clubs continue to develop it into an attraction for scuba divers. Attractions include several sunken cars, a fair size tug boat, a platform for training purposes, a &quot;submarine&quot; (which really is a large revamped gas tank) and several smaller items, such as traffic signs, halloween masks, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bottom is silty, there's a bit of fish life and a small bit of vegetation (mostly along the sides). There's a minimal current that helps keep the water somewhat clear, relatively speaking. Large amounts of rainfall can bring in lots of murky water though, bringing the visibility down to virtually zero. In other times, it seems to be mostly divers who disturb the silt and affect visibility. In low season (starting around September or October) visibility can be 30 feet or more, while in high season (starting around May or June) it might be 10-15 feet on a good day, or less on bad days. Note that those are only rough estimates and reality can vary wildly either way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water temperatures will be in the low to mid 50s in May and can be in the 60s in October. During high summer temperatures can reach mid to high 70s, but visibility tends to be worse then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bright orange guidelines connect all the attractions. Certain points of interest might be buoyed, but that tends to change over time. When this cache was placed, the tug boat was marked with a white buoy, while other times we've seen the training platform buoyed and nothing else. In low season, nothing might be buoyed at all. In any case, any buoy is likely gonna get you close to one of the guidelines, otherwise just descend off the ramp and look around for a bit. The guideline is hard to miss and will be very close to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you see a scary looking Santa Claus along the guideline, you're getting close. The next thing you should encounter is an encrusted street sign, and after that a similarly encrusted snowman. After this, the guideline makes a sharp turn to the left and directly in front of you is the tug boat. From (the center of) the tug boat, take a compass bearing of about 100 degrees. The cache is only about 10-15 meters away. It's easily recognizable from its red lid and it's also clearly marked as geocache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access to the Scuba Park is free and there's plenty of free parking available at the given waypoint (which is also your entry point). Amenities include... well, nothing. There's a hole-in-the-ground style outhouse that seems to be severely under-maintained and not something you'd probably like to use, not even simply for changing into your wetsuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dive safe and remember to bring a buddy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's a video that shows how this cache was placed (SPOILER!): &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGrAQPiOd6E&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGrAQPiOd6E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Waypoints&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PE3616V - Parking and entry point&lt;br/&gt;N 42° 58.856 W 079° 15.355   </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Canby was a Quaker born in Buck's County, Pennsylvania.&lt;br /&gt;He moved to the Niagara region where by 1792 he had built a sawmill&lt;br /&gt;at 12 Mile Creek near &lt;br /&gt;St. Johns village. Later, he operated a tannery and a ferry.&lt;br /&gt;With John McGill he built the first Bridgewater Mills in the&lt;br /&gt;Dufferin Island area of Niagara Falls. Eventually Canby settled at&lt;br /&gt;the Indian Trail crossing of the Oswego Creek, later to be known as&lt;br /&gt;Canby Town. He brought in settlers and blazed trails designed to&lt;br /&gt;converge at his mill and store. He leased a 600-acre strip of land&lt;br /&gt;from Joseph Brant that now lays within the present boundaries of&lt;br /&gt;Paris. He later sold this to the first settlers of Paris,&lt;br /&gt;Christopher and William Holme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canby purchased a 19,500 acre parcel of Grand River land from&lt;br /&gt;Captain John Dochstader for £5,000 (some sources indicate that &quot;in&lt;br /&gt;some irregular manner, he managed to get possession, and refused to&lt;br /&gt;execute the mortgage as agreed upon or to pay the money&quot;). Canby&lt;br /&gt;was described in the Illustrated Historical Atlas of Counties&lt;br /&gt;Haldimand and Norfolk, as ''thrifty, energetic and far-seeing, and&lt;br /&gt;although a Quaker, not overly scrupulous in his dealings.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first settlers Canby brought in were John Byers and John&lt;br /&gt;Miller followed by Peter Swick, Matthew Smith and Peter Melnick.&lt;br /&gt;When the early settlers came to Canboro there were no roads to&lt;br /&gt;reach the township, they had to ascent the Chippewa and Oswego&lt;br /&gt;creeks by boat, bringing all their possessions by this conveyances.&lt;br /&gt;Canboro was formerly well timbered with pine and oak. A steam saw&lt;br /&gt;mill was operated at the village by Mr Crane. William Fitch , a&lt;br /&gt;relative of Canby's came from New York State in 1832 and became a&lt;br /&gt;successful man in the village, owning mills, a store and becoming&lt;br /&gt;the first Post Master. &lt;br /&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;These lands were later incorporated as a township and named in&lt;br /&gt;Canby's honour. Benjamin Canby is buried in the pioneer section of&lt;br /&gt;the cemetery at N 42° 59.458 W 079° 40.111&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find the cache, you will need to determine the final&lt;br /&gt;coordinates from the information above and on the plaque at Stage&lt;br /&gt;1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A = Canby's age when he operated a ferry at &quot;the Landing&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B = The number of years between the time that Canby and Fitch&lt;br /&gt;settled at Canby Town&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C = the year that Canby &amp; McGill built the first mills at&lt;br /&gt;Dufferin Island&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D = the year in which Canborough Township was incorporated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the Stage 1 coordinates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;North offset = subtract (A + B) / 1000&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;West offset = add (D - C) / 1000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a toonie in the cache for the FTF so you can get&lt;br /&gt;yourself a coffee on me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Kreamer&amp;BrearsKrew for&lt;br /&gt;FTF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN2KNQH - GC2KNQH Final&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S12KNQH - GC2KNQH Stage 1&lt;br /&gt;N 42° 59.504 W 079° 40.057</groundspeak:long_description>

So went to bed hoping to be well enough today to head down the road and make the find. The fresh air did me good. Took the geokids out for a FTF around 10 a.m. Will go into town later for some Timmies' hot chocolate:-) Thanks for the FTF and well researched local history lesson. Had considered stopping in here previously, now I had a reason:-) Traded TBs.</groundspeak:text>

It's a 4 km walk from the parking area at the Merritt Island Building to the train bridge - or 8km out and back.  You will enjoy the company of families, joggers, roller blades and even a few recreational cyclists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Merritt Island is host to ten wood carvings by celebrated artist JP Gauthier of Welland. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wood carvings are titled: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Vertical Farm&lt;br/&gt;My Son&lt;br/&gt;Eagles&lt;br/&gt;Remembrance Day Tribute&lt;br/&gt;Three Bears&lt;br/&gt;Lone Wolf&lt;br/&gt;Bear Hunter&lt;br/&gt;Owl&lt;br/&gt;Lion&lt;br/&gt;Hidden Heron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located in the first 1.75 km stretch of the island the carvings are a hidden gem.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The island is host to many bird species, fishing docks, &quot;Wild Flower Trail&quot; which sweeps down by the Welland River and many other treasures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The park has different closing times depending on the Season.

Very close by are the remains of what used to be a small pump house. From what I can gather the water was pulled from the canal and into the low lying area near the cache. The reason for this is unknown to me.&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located just off a well used trail. It would be nice to see a few more caches on this side of the river. It would be nice to see them every few hundred meters. I would love to spend the day walking end to end finding caches on the way.&lt;br/&gt;(HINT TO OTHER CACHERS)&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the walk.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;LP1VKKK - New cacher Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 00.742 W 079° 14.024&lt;br/&gt;New cacher parking&lt;br/&gt;RP1VKKK - Real cacher parking&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 01.922 W 079° 13.118&lt;br/&gt;Real cacher parking&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Saw this published last night and my son and I went out at the crack of dawn for what I thought would be an easy pleasant stroll through the woods at Ruigrock... but GPS signal was really wonky and had us going all directions... when it came to a decision I made a bad one and took the less used of the two paths. &quot;Two roads diverged in the yellow wood and I chose the one less travelled by, and that has made all the difference&quot;... Well, this morning that difference meant a whole lot of burrs for the poor dog, traipsing through semi-bog and a lot of unnecessary bushwacking. But it also resulted in a FTF at 7:50 a.m. when I finally smartened up. Thanks for the reminder of a lesson I should have learned long ago, but apparently need to keep relearning! TFTC and the FTF:-)

I actually stopped at the mall to pick up some skates that I put in for sharpening, and was going to replace the log, when I realized I had left my caching bag at home.  I managed to finagle a log from some paper I had in the van and went to replace it.  It was not where it was supposed to be, but that's because the tree it is in has deteriorated since the cache was placed, and it will no longer fit there.  I put it back where some other clever cacher put it.  Now I think I'll change the whole container.  Coords are still accurate according to  my GPS.

Well by the time I got to this cache I was feeling pretty sick, looked in the obvious spot and didn't find it, so looked in another and it wasn't there either.  Well I had to use teh PAF option and turns out it was in the first spot I looked, damn auto darkening glasses.

In fact it was first called the sin of sadness or despair. Sadness (tristitia in Latin) described a feeling of dissatisfaction or discontent, which caused unhappiness with one's current situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modern view of the vice is that it represents the failure to utilize one's talents and gifts. For example, a student who does not work beyond what is required (and thus fails to achieve his or her full potential) could be labeled slothful.  I usually find myself slothful after overconsumption from nearby establishment....you guess which one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keep the numbers on the inside logsheet to get the final cache in the series.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Niagara Falls Brewing Company was once Ontario's most innovative brewery, producing beers like no other in the province. However, their beer lineup underwent some changes, and three of their finest beers were discontinued, and replaced by beers not possessing the same daring spirit. I would like to commemorate the Niagara Falls Brewery and the beers that made the brewery the most innovative in Ontario. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niagara Falls Brewing's beer lineup from 1995-1996 will forever be remembered as one of the most diverse and interesting that Ontario has ever tasted. The slate included: Maple Wheat, Olde Jack Strong Ale, Gritstone Ale, Brock's Extra Stout, Apple Ale, Kriek, Saaz Pilsner, and of course, Eisbock. These beers spanned numerous flavours and styles, a rarity to find such interesting types of beer all at once, from one brewery, and all of high quality. Perhaps the brewery was ahead of its time for the Ontario marketplace in 1996, as this slate did not last, but they should be celebrated and remembered by the fortunate few who were lucky enough to taste these brews. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The discontinuation of the Maple Wheat was a great loss to Canadian brewing. The Maple Wheat was a undoubtedly Canadian brew, incorporating Ontario maple syrup with wheat from the Canadian west. The result was a very complex, flavourful brew, and when it was unveiled in 1992 it was at the time Canada's strongest beer at 8.5%. Depending on the serving temperature, the aroma and taste of the brew varied. The smell could have been malty, maple or brandy. The taste had a subtle maple flavour, but if the brew was left to warm, the maple sweetness burst onto the palate. Maple brews are rare in this country, but a few exist. Upper Canada released a Maple Brown Ale in 1998, but it pales in comparison to the original Maple Wheat from Niagara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In April 2007, Moosehead Brewery, which owns Niagara Brewing, moved its Niagara Falls brewery to Brampton. &lt;br /&gt;At the time, Moosehead said the relocation was for efficiency reasons. That brand is now only served as draft in bars and restaurants. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is saddening to reflect on what Niagara Falls once was, and what is today, Niagara Falls will soon be home to the region’s two microbreweries, following a decision by a St. Catharines brewery to relocate here.  Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original cache container was an actual micro brew magnet, but sadly, it has gone missing.  Replaced with 35mm camo a little closer to Johnny Roccos than the coordinates listed (by about 15 feet) Take that into consideration.</groundspeak:long_description>

Do not add logbooks as the cache is not missing one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Canada!  Wow, you endured the long line, the numerous questions about tobacco, alcohol, and firearms, and the unexpected cavity search when you decided to make an imprompteau joke. (Border guards are infamous for their lack of humour...it's actually in the job description.)  What better way to stretch your legs than a quick and easy cache?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go straight up Hwy 420 after clearing customs, and pull in to the Ontario Visitor Centre along Stanley Avenue.  The cache container is perfect for dropping off that cross-border geocoin or 2, but there's not much room for anything else.  There were a few Canada/Niagara Falls pins in here when it was placed.  Beware of muggles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please take note of exactly where the cache is and replace it in the same spot, not on a different side, or it will not fit properly, will be visible, and may therefore be muggled. Wow! That's the longest sentence I ever wrote!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Watch for decoys! Do not add logbooks as the cache is not missing one.  Read the card!</groundspeak:long_description>

Still out caching, and someone stops beside us and tells us we got no brake lights.  Well we are here so in we go, Willy looks for the owners manual and I grab the cache, fill out and then we try to figure out what happened to the lights!

We thought we should payback the local cachers with a plant of our own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick easy find on fairly level terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &quot;Restin`&quot; caches are a series that will take you to local cemetarys, places of great interest. From pioneers and modern people the lovely places are full of interesting information. Please take your time, walk around, visit with the past. The caches are easy to find. Please respect where you are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Camo'd Film container containing logbook only so BYOP!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with any Restin' (cemetery) series cache PLEASE DO NOT CACHE AT NIGHT !!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONGRATULATIONS to Snaggles8 and Keepinginpace for their shared FTF!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

I'm very sure I was in the right area - it just looked right. I made a search, but I might have been more thorough if I'd had someone with me. Things were pretty slippery with the recent rain and I didn't look in every place I wanted to, so I'm not logging a DNF but I'm going to have to come back to try again when things are a little drier.</groundspeak:text>

It was a nice chilly day to be out, down here in the valley it wasn't bad tho. I really like this area alot! It is so peaceful and quiet out here and it doesn't seem to get much foot traffic what a great little hideaway. TFTC and bringing me down here. Cheers!</groundspeak:text>

Well we came to the conclusion that he would leave me here for a few hours and come back later in the day after i had dehydrated a little.  I knew he would come back because he wanted the smiley.  Well sure enough him and the oldest son came back about 4 hours later and the kid came down and helped me outa the cave.  We signed the log and I sent him back in with it.

Are there two containers floating around out here?!?!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You Naughty Geocachers!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seven deadly sins are a classification of the most objectionable vices that were originally used in early Christian teachings to educate and instruct followers concerning man's tendency to sin. The identification and definition of the seven deadly sins over their history has been a fluid process and the idea of what each of the seven actually encompasses has evolved over time. This process has been aided by the fact that they are not referred to in either a cohesive or codified manner in the Bible itself, and as a result other literary and ecclesiastical works referring to the seven deadly sins were instead consulted as sources &lt;br/&gt;With that being said, the Seven Deadly Ones are generally considered to be:&lt;br/&gt;Lust&lt;br/&gt;Gluttony&lt;br/&gt;Greed&lt;br/&gt;Sloth&lt;br/&gt;Wrath&lt;br/&gt;Envy&lt;br/&gt;Pride&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Blah Blah Blah Blah..... These caches are not about a lesson in morality.  They do have a connection to their placement in some manner though.  Keep your head up and have a look around and see if you can spot it in each case for a little chuckle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have found all 7 Sins, you will have the coordinates to this final.  Don't forget to write down the numbers from each sin you find.  As some caches are missing, the cache is at the posted coordinates.&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

The second location paid off.  I thought this one was going to be harder considering the rest were a little challenging. Great series.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I only placed this cache here for one reason. I fell in love with this section of the Bruce. I have been on here in the winter but to go back during the early summer and see everything come alive was amazing. Near the cache is a small waterfalls that is dry most times of the year but can be very slick if its wet.                              I was out doing a near by zodiac series cache that caused me to re visit this area. So even though I placed the cache, it was Flick who inspired me to want to bring others back to this incredible area.&lt;br/&gt;Please have respect for the near by campsite located south of the cache. It is used often by people who are walking the trail system. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Easy walk heading out from firemans park with a few other caches along the way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I grew up riding along these trails and thought what a great place to hide my very first cache. A nice easy walk along a trail leading out from Firemans park , whether you park in the upper lot or lower lot is up to you. The upper lot is more straight forward using the trail along the back. If you decide to go and park in the lower lot which is my favorite you will have to cross a set of train tracks to get to the lower lot, just as you are about to cross the tracks you will see a trail to left side of the road, i like that trail the best.... stay to the right hand fork in the trail and you will get there . When you get close to the cache look for a trail leading up the hill on your left. Its a nice view from atop the heap to the south. Just follow the trail leading to the heap, its a bit of a climb to the top but well worth the view in my opinion. Happy hunting. Cheers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      This cache is a medium sized lock and lock style container with camo tape on it, contains log book and pencil and has enough room for small items and a few trackables.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is identified as a desire to be more important or attractive than others, failing to acknowledge the good work of others, and excessive love of self. Vanity and narcissism are prime examples of this sin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have seen a few proud geocachers in my few years of caching..  Some care about the numbers so much that they will claim a find when they haven't completed the cache.  Some will e-mail the cache owner begging for extra hints or clues, rather than log a &quot;DNF&quot;.  Come on! There's no shame in DNFing!  Put your Pride aside and revel in your mediocrity!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of you will have seen this one before, but it lasted only a short time before it was broken. If you are wondering where the key is, it is inside the container, but it can be retrieved if you are patient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take note of the numbers you find in the cache as you will need them to locate the final.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems the key may become stuck inside the container. If you don't hear the tinkle, try giving it a rap near the centre to jar it loose again. You should be able to hear the logbook (inside a 35mm container) and the key rattling around in there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PA1ZWVB - Suggested Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 08.639 W 079° 06.812&lt;br/&gt;Suggested Parking area</groundspeak:long_description>

WORD OF WARNING TO OTHER CACHERS - both the geodog and I picked up a tick either at this one or at Wrath.

These feelings can manifest as vehement denial of the truth, both to others and in the form of self-denial, impatience with the procedure of law, and the desire to seek revenge outside of the workings of the justice system (such as engaging in vigilantism) and generally wishing to do evil or harm to others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whose wrath you ask?  Hmmmm depending on your point of view, It's either yours or mine.  If you placed a pine tree micro which unfairly discriminates against the colour-blind, or your clue on a cache ever said &quot;none available&quot;, &quot;nope&quot;, or &quot;you don't need one&quot;, then it's my wrath.  Hope you enjoy....BWAH HA HA HA HA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get the password at the Sign, look at the 4th row of print.&lt;br/&gt;Take the following letters from the last word in that line. 1,5,9,11,12.  Now rearrage them into a word that fits the theme of the series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take note of the number you find within the stage 3 cache, as you will need them to do the final of the series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FI1ZWW2 - Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Final&lt;br/&gt;SI1ZWW2 - Sign&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 08.674 W 079° 08.112&lt;br/&gt;Rearrange Letters 1,5,9,11,and 12 in last word of 4th line or print to get password for stage 2.&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: ST1ZWW2 - Stage 2&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Stage 2</groundspeak:long_description>

In fact, in 1887, the Queen's Plate, the premiere racing event in Canada, was held in St. Catharines on a track located near the present Thomas Street Sports Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It wasn't until 1964 that St. Catharines received one of the finest racing showplaces in Canada. The Garden City Raceway (opened in 1964) was built on a 400 acre tract of land in the heart of Canada's Wine country. It was a modern harness racing extravaganza with a glass enclosed, climate controlled grandstand. Horsemen of the time considered the race track's limestone-cushioned strip one of the fastest tracks, and each season during its operation it attracted North America's finest two and three-year-old trotting and pacing colts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Garden City Raceway closed its doors in 1976. I invite all who visit here to share any memories or stories that they may have of this racetrack in their log entries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**** Please rehide all stages  just as you found them or better. As I have checked on this cache before and stages were left out in the open. Thanks everyone **** &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun and I hope you all enjoy this one!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 09.036 W 079° 10.597&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foundation ?&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 09.300 W 079° 10.508&lt;br/&gt;I Think this is the foundation for the original Grandstands of the raceway, I Originally wanted to hide the final here, but it was too close to another Cache, so I had to move it.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Stage one took a little bit of time to find. It was like finding a needle in a hay stack. The rest of the stages were fairly simple. Coords were dead on at all stages.

We took the hard way in to the final and the easy way out.

Great history behind this cache. 

TFTC and showing us around the area.

Sometimes I stop by out here to watch the hawks that nest nearby and in the mornings there are sometimes wild turkey that mill about here in the clearing. Many times when I have been here I have spotted deer and the odd coyote. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This once was a proposed site for the Niagara region ambulance dispatch center, but it got rejected, as it would have cost the city way to much money to bring in the services needed to accommodate the dispatch center. The city went ahead with looking into the site across the road from auto parts dealer as the home for the dispatch center and that too was squashed. In the end a nice new facility was built on Townline Rd. which is a shared crew quarters for the EMS and the Volunteer Fire Hall, located behind the a parcel delivery service building. &lt;br/&gt;The Dispatch cente is placed in the &quot;Niagara Corporate Business Centre&quot; also formerly ( Foster Wheeler ) building, which is located across the highway from this cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now this dead end road which once was the new #8 Hwy at one time;  is now just a quiet hang out for our city’s finest to do paperwork and enjoy some coffee and quiet time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope you enjoy this little quiet hang out spot, I really like the area where the cache is hidden, it really cool after an ice storm in the winter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy caching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* p.s.

Found the cache without too much problem and then took an equally difficult route back to my car.  All in all, lots-o-fun!  Dropped a couple of TB's.  Thanks for the adventure!

Enjoy! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Beware of muggles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;This park is named in recognition of the Lowrey family for their contribution to the village of St. Davids. &lt;br/&gt;David Jackson Lowrey, a United Empire Loyalist, brought his family to St. Davids in 1867. His foresight brought about the first commercial vineyards and peach orchards in the region. Future generations of Lowrey's established or operated the local canning factory, quarry and golf courses. The park is located on a parcel of the original Lowrey farm.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I placed this cache here to share a little bit of history of the people who shaped the area where I grew up.</groundspeak:long_description>

While you are here I invite you to really take just a moment and appreciate the view here, it's one of my favorites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you stop and think of the many ways that we as humans travel about our globe and now into space, what could be possibly left to play with, ... .....&lt;br/&gt;I got this idea a while back and I thought to myself hmm; I could do a short series about travel leading people back here to ponder the Idea of Time Travel! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What a great place to hide such a massive invention if there were ever to be one, cause you would need a massive power source I would think, and the focus of the grounds here would act as kind of an Ironic cover. I Love this area and the grounds keeping staff do an excellent job every year with our great attraction. If you are ever in the area at the right time look into when tours are available of Sir Adam Beck Power Generation Station it is really interesting and worth the vist. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to complete this cache you will need to first find 4 other caches in the &quot; Travel Series &quot;. Contained within these 4 caches there will be parts of the co-ords you will need to collect in order to get to the Final. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OX21GNP  Travel Series - Take Flight&lt;br/&gt;OX21GP8  Travel Series - Float your Boat&lt;br/&gt;OX21GPP  Travel Series - Ride the Rails&lt;br/&gt;OX21GPY  Travel Series - On or Off Raod&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have visited these caches you can make your way to the posted co-ords to obtain the offset. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QUESTION 1&lt;br/&gt;How many Kilometers does the Niagara Escarpment extend across Ontario from Niagara Falls to Manitoulin Island ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now take your answer and divide it by 1000 to give you your offset, now take that offset and Subtract it from the West co-ords that you have collected. This New W co-ord is where the Final is hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QUESTION 2&lt;br/&gt;How many Million years ago did a shallow tropical sea cover most of central North America ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now take your answer and divide it by 1000 to give you your offset, now take that offset and Add it to the North Co-ords that you have collected. This New N co-ord is where the Final is hidden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This takes you to the end of this short little series, I hope you have enjoyed my first series attempt and some of the sights I have brought you to. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;** Please be gentle with cache in the cold as it maybe become brittle. Thank-you **&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hmmm ..... Time Travel huh ? &lt;br/&gt;Does it make you wonder ? &lt;br/&gt;Cheers!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Return to Canada Island - Water access only cache&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of my favourite caches of all time was Canada Island by McKinley GCG9CZ Placed 7 years ago, I was sad to see it archived.  I enjoy spending time down here, Cross Country skiing in the winter, canoeing in the warmer months.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I thought a few of the newer cachers might enjoy the challenge of a great local adventure. AKA old school caching.  I'm also sure some of the old timers wouldn't mind re-visiting an area they visited oh so long ago. It would be great to hear all about your adventure getting to the cache in your log write up.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, as mentioned, this is a water access only, there is no legal way to access it from land. The surrounding lands are private property so please do not even try to come at this from the nearby shore.  (Besides its on an island, so your gonna get wet if you try)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can park on the South Service Rd and carry your canoe, kayak or dinghy down to the waters edge at N43 10.749 W79 19.642 Please be sure to follow the rules for safe boating, life jackets all around, safety kits, spare paddles etc. If you are not an experienced paddler please be sure to hook up with someone who is before attempting this cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trip is a nice 1.5km paddle to the cache.  Round trip it took 1.5 hours for me to solo out to the island with a canoe at a very leisurely pace (with plenty of stops to watch the wildlife along the way.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There appears that a group of herons have been living in this area for the past few years and they seemed very curious about my arrival making a number of fly-bys to check me out. I counted at least 6 of them on my trip.  Hopefully you will get to see them as well. The fish were jumping all over the pond while I was there so feel free to bring along your rod and reel if you are so inclined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've placed this Rubbermaid container much higher from the waterline than the original cache hoping it doesn't meet the same fate as its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please hide the container EXACTLY as you found it and make sure it is well covered by the sticks and leaves to conceal it, and please make sure the lid is on securely before re-hiding it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PIM7JQ - Canoe Put-In&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 10.749 W 079° 19.642&lt;br/&gt;Canoe Put-In point</groundspeak:long_description>

i really like those smaller bodies of water because its nice and peaceful without all the stinky motorized watercrafts around
didn't see any wildlife but i guess with the high temperatures they were all probably hiding away in the shade
thanks for the nice outing

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We had this one on our radar a few weeks ago, but on that day the weather didn't turn out so well and so we put it off. No such issues today, weather couldn't have been better, so we got the boat out and paddled off.

Nice and easy paddle across the pond and we quickly got to the island. Circled around to find a good landing spot, headed off and the good coords got us right to the cache. All in good order, but the geocoin listed wasn't there. We left one of our pathtags though.

We headed back and then attempted to reach GC19DTH from here, which made for a [b]very interesting[/b] experience [:O]

There is 100,000 tons of clay removed each season from this site and the plans here are for removal of such clay for the next 60 yrs which in the end the site will be turned into a nature reserve. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope you have fun grabbing this cache, why not give it a shot after a good day or so of rain to make it a little bit of a challenge.</groundspeak:long_description>

We looked new settlements and food sources and as time wore on a thirst for exploration of new places grew, we developed a need for a means of Travel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Probably the earliest form of travel would have to be floating a boat on water. This ideal would have opened the doors for us to travel in search of new lands, source of food, and started the beginings of trade and commerce between other communities and nations. Boats have come a long way from their creation, today they can range anywhere from small pleasure craft to trade and cargo, crusie liners to military use and massive ships that are like a floating city. Here along this trail you might get a chance to see some ships traveling through our great canal system which is the only gravity fed canal in the world dropping a considerable range in elevation from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario. &lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small camo taped jar hidden in traditional fashion.... should be an easy one. &lt;br/&gt;There is partial co-ords written on the logbook as well as the lid of the container ... don't forget to write these down as you will need them to find the final in the series .&lt;br/&gt; You will also need to visit these caches to get to the  final :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GC21GPY Travel Series -- On or Off Road&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GC21GPP Travel Series -- Ride The Rail &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GC21GNP Travel Series -- Take Flight</groundspeak:long_description>

This development has given us the opportunity to explore every corner of our planet and beyond. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is partial co-ords written on the logbook as well as the lid of the container ... don't forget to write these down as you will need them to find the final in the series .&lt;br/&gt;You will also need to visit these caches to get to the  final :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OX21GPP Travel Series -- Ride the Rails&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OX21GP8 Travel Series -- Float Your Boat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OX21GPY  Travel Series -- On or Off Road</groundspeak:long_description>

nope, and after a quick exchange of information we had a rough idea what we were looking for. we all had already poked at, or at least looked at the cache, but dismissed it. after more fruitless search i returned to the search and gave it a bit more effort - voila, there it was. turns out it just didn't open because it was somewhat stuck.

as already mentioned, the log was a total mess. we still managed to sign it, but not without ripping some parts of it. i recognize the attempt at making the container waterproof, but it obviously and unfortunately didn't work. it would be an awesome hide if it did.

Geobabe had a great time playing with a stick. Retrieved the cache, unrolled it a little bit to see that Fired Up was just here to sign the bottom of the log as first. Then I opened the log up all the way to see that the Newfies were here at 4:30 this morning. They signed both the front and back of the log as first to find. WOW, are you guys still on Atlantic time?

Sorry Fired Up, The Five Newfies beat you by two hours.

I'm concerned for the longevity of this series, the contained was plainly visible from some distance. 2 others have signed the logbook before us. One of the earlier finders even stated that had no idea what they had found but decided to sign the log book anyway. There is no info sheet telling them what they found or where to get more details. Also, just want to point out that this was not really a multi-stage, it is a traditional cache which is a part of a series, apparently with the final being a puzzle. The listings should be updated accordingly. Nevertheless, we were happy to find our first OC-exclusive cache. Thanks Lamarrevelous for placing them. They seem to be the only OC_only hides in my area.</groundspeak:text>

This portion of the St. Catharines multi use trail is 8.2 km long well paved and is great for walking with pets, friends or family. Also good to use for in-line skates, cycling, skateboards, strollers, and even cross country skiing in the winter I guess… You get the idea, oh yeah and it has a nice view too!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please use stealth and watch for muggles!&lt;br/&gt;Please return just the way you found it.&lt;br/&gt;Thank-you</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Well, when you're out walking with 3- and  4-year-old's it does get a bit boring - they just move along at their own pace. But they have fun and that makes it all worth it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of our favourite trails to meet up with friends and their kids - the section of the trail between 5th and 8th line is mostly 2 kilometer long flat boardwalk through the Vinemount Swamp which is great when strollers are still needed. The kids love running along the boardwalk and jumping down onto dry land when they can find some.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small plastic juice bottle hidden in a tree trunk, maybe a foot or less off the ground. The tree is only a few feet off of the boardwalk but you'll need to jump down from the boardwalk to retrieve it. Please bring a pen and replace the cache exactly as found, making sure it is not visible from the trail. the cache is NOT in the bird box, and I doubt any bird will nest in that box since it's so close to the trail. Nice gesture but not thought out too well I guess.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking is available on the side of Powerline Rd at 5th Rd E - please do not attempt to park on 5th or 8th Rd.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There's been a lot of talk these days about the end  Mayan Calendar. A search of geocaching.com on 12/11/12 yielded the following results: a dozen upcoming event listings and at least a handful of recently published physical caches listings referencing the end of the Mayan Calendar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It got me to thinking about the story of the ten virgins. Have a read and tell me what you think when you log the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh yeah, the cache: its a small  50 mL plastic tube, hidden among hawthorn trees - move carefully and no one will get hurt! BYOP. Terrain is flat, the 3.0 rating is due to the hawthorns. I had no problem sneaking in there to make the hide, but I'm not a big person. Located a bit off the Dofasco 2000 trail, near the 5th Rd E access point. There are no facilities or parking areas for this trail, but you can safely park along Powerline Rd near 5th Rd E. Please do not attempt to park on the shoulder of 5th Rd E or 8th Rd E, the road is just too narrow there. There are a number of benches along the boardwalk and also numerous garbage cans, please use them! please travel by foot or by bike only, no motorized vehicles allowed! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ten virgins:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish and five were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep. At midnight the cry rang out: ‘Here’s the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’ Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’ ‘No,’ they replied, ‘there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’ “But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.“Later the others also came. ‘Lord, Lord,’ they said, ‘open the door for us!’ But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I don’t know you.’ Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.&lt;br/&gt;Here's the point: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks Ian for the inspiration / idea for this listing.</groundspeak:long_description>

I'm throwing in one extra, just for good measure. Then again, I hid 6 caches in the October when I only needed 5 to earn the Skilled Hider 5 pathtag, and I never did receive it. Maybe I should just tow the line and cross-list exactly 10 of my GC.com hides, that seems to work well enough around here. Oh well, here's one more - for good measure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a small camo'd juice bottle (plastic), hidden low in a hawthorn-type tree, south-side of the path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is parking for a few cars on 2nd Rd E.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Actually B is for bees, since we saw a few while hiding this cache. Don’t worry, we selected a different spot. Cache is a small nutella container that has been painted black, containing a log sheet and some surf clam shells collected in PEI. Please BYOP. Cache is not in the rotting stump - that’s where we saw the bee. Just a few meters off the trail. Trail can be accessed from McNeily Rd. Not sure about parking, maybe at the top of McNeily? Or you could make the hike over from the Jones Rd side trail. Trail is pretty tame if coming in off McNeily but the trek from Jones Rd will be more challenging due to some narrow and steep sections of the trail. You can download trail maps from the Bruce Trail Conservancy for $3 each if you wish.&lt;br/&gt;This was our first time on this stretch of the Bruce Trail. It was more rugged that we had expected. How nice. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This could be a very simple puzzle leading to a medium sized cache on a nice trail. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Sometimes throughout life there are people that just want to be noticed or just want to be heard. It could be that they may have problems and are not sure how to deal with them or they may think that no one is paying attention to them, or they may just want to express themselves in some way. Using color may be a tool that is used to accomplish such things. Color plays a great role in many cultures in the way that it brings joy or sadness to an art form, décor, or even it may be a defining symbol of a particular nation, society or group. Color also has a very large impact in nature, ranging from anything as a warning of apparent danger in the forms of bright colors on plants or even in living creatures, or darker colors may be way of disguise or blending in with a surrounding environment. Colors can even be used as a form of expression, and sometimes when there is a voice that is being heard the use of colors can speak volumes! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now at the cache site take a look at some of the use of color by these individuals and tell me in short your opinion whether this is a form of artistic expression or just a cry out of voices that are not being heard. What’s your interpretation?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The puzzle: Find the common value of each group and input that value into the formula below: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AA:&lt;br/&gt;Ivory Tower&lt;br/&gt;Almond Paste&lt;br/&gt;Soft Suede&lt;br/&gt;Earthy Cane&lt;br/&gt;Rattan&lt;br/&gt;Wool Tweed&lt;br/&gt;Twig Basket &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BBB:&lt;br/&gt;Clear Yellow&lt;br/&gt;Bright Laughter&lt;br/&gt;Pineapple Delight&lt;br/&gt;Canary Yellow&lt;br/&gt;Golden Yarrow&lt;br/&gt;Grass Daisy&lt;br/&gt;Pollination&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CC:&lt;br/&gt;Whitewater&lt;br/&gt;Delicate Petal&lt;br/&gt;White Clover&lt;br/&gt;Green Crystal&lt;br/&gt;Mesa Verde&lt;br/&gt;Chives&lt;br/&gt;Shady Knoll&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DDD:&lt;br/&gt;Filigree&lt;br/&gt;Sentimental Lady&lt;br/&gt;Heavenly Blue&lt;br/&gt;Walden Pond&lt;br/&gt;Stormy Ridge &lt;br/&gt;Animation&lt;br/&gt;Star Spangled &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Input your answers into the following co-ords  problem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 43° AA-300.BBB&lt;br/&gt;W 079° CC-400.DDD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The puzzle is not difficult and the math is very simple, just use common sense to get the answer in the usual format.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PA2G7G4 - GC2G7G4 Parking2&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 13.078 W 079° 07.355&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PK2G7G4 - GC2G7G4 Parking1&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 13.013 W 079° 07.457</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Out for a solo night hike on the Red Hill Recreational Trail, and added another OX-exclusive cache. My kitchen is the source for many of my geocache containers - peanut butter, mayonnaise, apple juice, and in this case baking powder. I didn't get a chance to paint this one, heck I didn't even wash it out (in case you are wondering about the mysterious white powder residues inside the container)&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located in the Kings Forest, not on the golf course property. You might want to leave the trail early - a straight line from the main trail will take you through some nasty vines and thorns.&lt;br/&gt;There's lots of room for trade items - I didn't have any with me when I made the hide, maybe I will add some next time I;m over there. Bring your own pen and please pretty pretty please return the cache just like you found it, the yellow and brown container will stick out like a sore thumb otherwise.&lt;br/&gt;Cache is verifiable, QR code is attached to the log sheet. Sorry, I didn't have the number written down for manual entry.&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Added a few more opencaches to the Hamilton area today. This one was placed about 35 meters off the main Red Hill Valley Trail. It's uphilll all the way. Watch for raspberry vines, there's quite a few around. Apparently there's a trail at the top of the hill too, but it's probably easiest if approached from the bottom.&lt;br/&gt;The container is a small (50 mL) plastic tube. It holds the logsheet and a pencil, and that's about all it can hold. Please replace exactly as found.&lt;br/&gt;Should be accessible year round, will be more difficult after rain / snow.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">No problem, and don't worry about the gift thing, Carni and Tigger were FTF and they deserve it (darn those guys are good). Happy that you updated the listed so quickly, and I can't blame you for cross-listing. This site has so few users. I have 11 or 12 exclusive listings on here - only 2 of them have been logged once. My listings on GC.com get 10-20 visits a month. I'd like to see this site succeed but's an uphill battle, can;t get users interested becuase there's few unique listings and can;t get unique listings because there are few interested users. anyway, those were two nice hides, keep up the good work. This game is about hiding and finding, which sites you use, well that's just the politics of it. Check out some of my caches on here and on GC if you find yourself in the other end of the city sometime. Any of carnigrewals caches on GC.com are worth going for too, and they are everywhere!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">HHS....I sincerely apologize for the mix-up.  When I saw that it had finally been published to geocaching.com, i tried to take off the &quot;exclusive tag&quot; with my iPod, but I couldn't figure out how to do it with that thing.  Really sorry.  I would like to leave you a small gift (the same you would have received had you been able to sign first).  When I hide the gift, I will send you the coordinates for an easy grab.  Again. sorry.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This is not ox-exclusive as stated, I am quite dissapointed to learn this - I had to make an unexpected trip to Brantford this even which gave me the chance to stop on the way home and find this cache. OX-exclusive listings are hard to come by in this area, so I had the motivation otherwise its just another cross-listed cache. Found in the dark on a cold moonlit night, would have been easier if I had fully charged batteries. Found the cache after maybe 20 minutes searching and was so disappointed to see it already signed, oh well that's just the way it goes. Please remove the exclusive tag. Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

Hey Akela... the brakes on my car are touchy. No need to stop so quickly. I will let you know when the whiplash goes away and we can go caching again. :D

Thanks for the quick find, once I actually looked at my GPS. Co-ords are great on this one.

Beware of the mosquitoes and tick during the warmer months and also be prepared for mud and standing water. Early winter (before the snow accumulates) may be the best time of year to find these.

No pedestrians came by but the traffic is heavy on that bridge, not fun standing there in the dark wondering if some distracted driver (distracted y us being there) might miss the curve and hit us. We survived, only one car honked at us. Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

Yup we managed to find this with out too much trouble.  I did check the hint to see if it was of any help, all I can say is ya it helps, just that there is at least 1,000+ place that match it.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache is NOT at the posted coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To solve this riddle you will need to find all 10 of the Bow Valley caches. There is a single letter written on the underside of each lid. To solve the puzzle below, convert the letter for each cache to the number for that cache. For example, if Bow Valley #3 has the letter D written in the lid, then the letter &quot;D&quot; in the puzzle below will equal 3. Easy right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, write down the letters in the appropriate spaces below&lt;br/&gt;Bow Valley #1 = _____ = 1&lt;br/&gt;Bow Valley #2 = _____ = 2&lt;br/&gt;Bow Valley #3 = _____ = 3&lt;br/&gt;Bow Valley #4 = _____ = 4&lt;br/&gt;Bow Valley #5 = _____ = 5&lt;br/&gt;Bow Valley #6 = _____ = 6&lt;br/&gt;Bow Valley #7 = _____ = 7&lt;br/&gt;Bow Valley #8 = _____ = 8&lt;br/&gt;Bow Valley #9 = _____ = 9&lt;br/&gt;Bow Valley #10 = ____ = 10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, use the information above to solve the following equations&lt;br/&gt;Final is at N 43 13.NNN, W 79 45.WWW&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NNN = (M x T x B x M x O) plus (X x S) minus (K x T)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WWW = (((G x K) plus  S) x P)  plus A)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorry about having to write the word &quot;plus&quot; and &quot;minus&quot;, but for some reason the &quot;plus&quot; symbol keeps disappearing when I save the text.&lt;br/&gt;Don't let the math intimidate you, it's not that bad. I will update the listing soon to include checksums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you do the math you're all set to find the final. It's a small plastic bottle and only contains the logsheet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF prize for this cache is a lifetime membership to opencaching.com (kidding).  Seriously now, there's a $10 Tim Horton's giftcard to whoever finds all 10 caches and then solves for the final. There is a code phrase written on the final log sheet. Email me that code phrase (my email address is also recorded on the logsheet) and I will send you the gift card once I have verified that you have found and signed the logs in all 11 caches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy hunting&lt;br/&gt;     </groundspeak:long_description>

It is also a symbol of&lt;br /&gt;infinity, without beginning or end, perfect, the ultimate geometric&lt;br /&gt;symbol. It is a symbol of democracy and the preferred shape for an&lt;br /&gt;assembly of equals; the council circle, the campfire circle, and&lt;br /&gt;King Arthur's round table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The circle is divine. The halo, the rainbow, the ring as a symbol&lt;br /&gt;of unity. Magic rings appear in Roman and Egyptian history. The&lt;br /&gt;Catherine Wheel, Ixion, Ezekial's wheel, the Wheel of Dharma.&lt;br /&gt;References to circles are everywhere in both the ancient and modern&lt;br /&gt;worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing supremely mystical about this cache, but to find&lt;br /&gt;the final coordinates for this cache you'll need to find out a&lt;br /&gt;little information that has something to do with circles. The&lt;br /&gt;musical references are courtesy of my 16 year old son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Final coordinates are N43 14.XXX W79 48.YYY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the North coordinate, take the year the band &quot;Circle Jerks&quot;&lt;br /&gt;were formed and add it to the circumference of a circle whose area&lt;br /&gt;is 28743.5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divide this answer by 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add this to the last three digits of the original posted coordinate&lt;br /&gt;to get XXX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For West, take the year the band &quot;Pennywise&quot; released their album&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Full Circle&quot; and add it to the year the band that perform the&lt;br /&gt;theme song to the television show &quot;Cops&quot; was formed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divide this answer by the radius of a circle whose area is&lt;br /&gt;87.57&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subtract this from the last three digits of the posted West&lt;br /&gt;coordinate to get YYY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on &lt;br /&gt;Geochecker.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN12PEZ - Final&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Final location of Cache</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache has been on my &quot;to-do list&quot; ever since I started to use the opencaching.com website, but it seemed for a while like it was missing. No, it's just a hard nut to crack. I've seen the stage 2 trick a few times on multi's. happy that this one was pretty easy to understand how the numbers worked out. I saw it done once on branches, but it was only the last three numbers of each, once digit per branch, 3 pointed one way and 3 pointed the other and so the cacher had to figure out the correct order. I never did find the final on that one! Thanks</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Well, at least I think it is Stoney Creek that flows out here into Lake Ontario. Or maybe it’s Battlefield creek. The two join together not far from here and I’m not sure what it’s called after that confluence.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The container is a small conical tube hidden in a neat hollow stick that we found while swimming near by. That might make it a bit tricky to spot, so there is a spoiler pic in case you get stuck. The hint is a give-away to, use if needed. The only thing in the container is the log, so please bring a pen&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Stay a while and enjoy the view of the lake, sit a while on one of the nearby benches or skip some rocks in the lake. Keep your ears and eyes open for belted kingfishers which often patrol the creek, they have a very distinct rattling call and a distinct flight pattern as well. If you lucky you might even see a black-crowned night heron lurking on the banks when you arrive, but get a quick look because they take flight as soon as they see, giving a harsh call as they go. Can you tell that I like birds?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The area can get real busy with cyclist and rollerbladers and all sorts of muggle folk. Please hide exactly as it was found or better. Thanks. I think the best way to get here is to park far away and bike the trail, but that’s just me. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Permission to hide the cache within Confederation Park has been granted by the Hamilton Conservation Authority.

Naaah, let's go check it out. I was certainly one of the tougher nightcaches I've done (good thing our flashlights held out). I really wished we had left this one for another day, because it would be an amazing view in the daylight. 
Fortunately it was a quick find, saving us the danger of crawling around on that hill in the dark. Thanx for the adventure.

the scenery was great too, a real winter wonderland
we drove around for a while trying to find the closest access point and originally we parked at the top of the mountain, but after descending two flights of stairs and getting a full view of the rest of it, i had flashbacks from last spring's visit, going down is OK, going back up not so easy and considering the extra weight from the winter clothes we decided to head down to the parking near the golf club

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Had this one on the bucket list for a long time now and today the weather seemed to be well fitting for the short hike. It took some experimentation to find the easiest access point (with us being lazy people and all that).

Thanks to the last finder, actually finding the cache wasn't so easy. Quite some fresh snow around and all the obvious spots turned out empty. The expanded search didn't bring any success either. I decided to trust the coordinates and poke around the not so obvious spots, and success!

The container is showing significant signs of wear, but the contents are holding up surprisingly well. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Crystal spotted a deer on the way in and pointed it out to me. I laughed because there was actually two deer and from my angle I could see the front end of one deer and the back end of the other. With the large tree obstructing the  rest it looked like one really long deer. Kind of a deer dachshund cross. [:)]</groundspeak:text>

Had to decide if we were going to do this, since this was our 4th (of 5) of the day and wasn't sure if my son was still up for the long hike, but we did it and I am glad.  This was out 182nd find and both my 5 year old son and I agree that this was our favorite caching experience ever.  

--Trail and rock formations on the cliffs were cool.
--Views were amazing!
--2 waterfalls were neat!
--And to top it all off, after 182 finds, as we were returning up the trail, we FINALLY saw deer!!!!! Not just one, but a heard of 4 of them...see pictures (luckily I had my video camera with me).  We stayed there about 15 minutes watching them as they watched us. They seemed to panic a little as we tried to get closer, so we watched from a close distance.  it was right below the lookout point. This is the first time we saw any animals besides the usual birds, squarrels, rabbits, snakes and chipmunks.

Oh and the rain and wet trails didn't stop us either.  And the cache container was original too and easy to find.

So thanks for placing this cache and making our day!

It was an old friend that I hadn't seen on the trail for a long time. TrimblesTrek and I joined forces to find the cache quickly - how quickly you ask?? That will be kept a secret! The cache was well hidden and gave both our GPSr units a workout. Took memories and left my notes.

Boy these steep cliffs on the Bruce Trail are getting to me! Thanks for a great adventure, good company and hope to see TrimblesTrek again soon.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A quick visit to the final resting place of Colonel John
Butler.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 




&lt;p&gt;Colonel John Butler was the leader of Butler's
Rangers which were the early descendants of what is now the Lincoln
and Welland Regiment. Butler's Rangers were formed in 1777 after
John Butler led a strong detachment of Indians from Niagara at the
Battle of Oriskany in August of 1777. One of their goals was to aid
and rescue Loyalists trapped as a result of the American
Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Butler's Rangers were renowned for the guerrilla
warfare tactics used against the Patriot forces of the United
States. These tactics which did not conform to the &quot;Rules of War&quot;
made the Rangers a very feared and much hated force during the
American Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rangers were based out of Fort Niagara but
as the size of the Rangers ranks swelled Butler requested and
negotiated for the lands across the Niagara River for housing and
training his Rangers. Butler's Barracks are named to honour the
memory of Colonel Butler and served for many years as the training
and assembly ground. The current location of Butlers Barracks is
not the original location where Colonel Butler originally built the
barracks. The original location was on the high ground of what is
now Melville Street&lt;/p&gt;

 


&lt;p&gt;When the Ranger's were disbanded in 1784 Butler
returned to farming in the Niagara Peninsula. In his civilian life
he was still very much active in the local affairs as well as
continuing to serve with the Indian Department right up until his
death. A great deal of frustration on Butler's part grew from the
fact that he was never asked to participate in a larger political
role in the formation of Canada. Butler died in Niagara on 12 May
1796 after a lengthy illness and was interred here. While many
think that this is a military burial ground it is in fact the
Butler family plot. The front of the crypt has been backfilled in
after the door to the crypt was damaged and fears that animals may
drag the bones away from their rightful resting place. All that is
visible today is the top concrete work of the crypt as shown below.
Please be respectful as this is not only a place of internment but
is surrounded by residential homes. Daytime caching only
please.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is located along the Waterfront Trail, which is paved and
used by many people for biking, rollerblading or just a nice an
easy stroll.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I find it very relaxing to just sit on the beach so after finding
the cache you can too take a few moments to enjoy the view and the
sounds of the lake.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The muggle concentration will depend on the season and time of day,
just be aware of your surroundings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache contains a log only so BYOP.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;It is very important that you replace it
exactly as found to keep it safe from
muggles.&lt;/strong&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache is hidden in the Hamilton Cemetery. Please be respectful and observe the visitation hours posted at the gate (which I failed to record). You do not need to walk among any of the graves to get to the cache.&lt;br/&gt;We found this section of the cemetery today by accident and knew we had to place a cache down here. It was just so quite and peaceful down here. We couldn't here the highway at all, which is surprising. I'd imagine the trains can rattle the graves a bit but there were no trains today.&lt;br/&gt;The GPS signals were real poor today for some strange reason, so I'm not sure how accurate the coordinates are going to be. Getting to GZ will be a slight challenge as its up a fairly steep hill, but most geocachers should be able to do it okay. According to my GPS logs its up about 40' from the bottom but it didn't seem that far up.&lt;br/&gt;I'm including two additional waypoints. The first is for the little road that leads down to the &quot;Sunken Garden&quot;. It's a long and narrow road, so go slow. I have no idea what condition it will be in come winter, but I did not see any gates to suggest the road gets closed off. The road does not show up too well on the Bing maps but you can sort of see it there. It does show well on Google Maps.&lt;br/&gt;Access road: N 43° 16.363' W 079° 53.382'&lt;br/&gt;Park at N 43° 16.223' W 079° 53.385'&lt;br/&gt;The container is a small camo'd plastic bottle. It's pretty small and only holds the log sheet so please bring a pen. If you forget the pen you could take note of the company which makes the bottle (its on the lid) and write that in your online log to verify the find. When replacing please make sure it's not visible from below and also that it isn't going to tumble out and down the hill. Thanks </groundspeak:long_description>

while ago and enjoyed the solitude and peacefulness of the
place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are
many spots along the way where you can stop and admire the view, or
just enjoy the silence...well that's if there are no ducks around.
In the summer the place looks like a jungle, yet somehow the trail
is very much visible and easy to follow.  Although on the day
we placed the cache the ground was dry there were clear signs that
at some point it might have been quite wet around GZ.  When
the vegetation is gone is even easier to navigate around, however
the trail leading down will be more difficult. I would say the
place is not visited too often, and the chances are you will be the
only one out there, but as the saying goes &quot;never say
never&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;
Container is a small lock'n lock.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
So if you need more cowbell for your caching day this is your
chance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What to bring for this hunt: A friend, good shoes, maybe some rope,
good balance and courage. But most importantly, know your limits! A
smiley is not worth breaking your bones. Remember, you are
responsible for your own safety - if you don't feel up to it, just
skip it!&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This should be an interesting walk. It starts with a skimpy,
possibly muddy and slippery trail at the given waypoint, heading
down towards the lake, and then continues as a walk along the shore
towards GZ. You are likely to get your feet or at least your shoes
wet, &lt;b&gt;so bring waterproof shoes or, better yet, boots&lt;/b&gt;, you
will need them! In summer, you can use water shoes and shorts,
which will make for a nice refreshing walk. There's also a few
obstacles on the way that you will need to climb over (or
under).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do not try to approach this in straight line from the
cemetery&lt;/b&gt;, you're likely to break your neck. Use the provided
trailhead waypoint instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cemetery is open daily between 8:00 and 21:00. &lt;b&gt;You're
trespassing if you go after 21:00. Absolutely no dogs allowed
within the cemetery!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative access via boat is also possible if that's your
thing, but finding an appropriate launch point is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a camo'd Lock 'n' Lock containing the geocache
essentials and originally some small swag, some pathtags to take
and a TB to move along. &lt;b&gt;Please make sure the cache is secured
properly.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF gets bragging rights and is welcome to take one of the
pathtags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and have fun! Oh, and &lt;b&gt;BYOP&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Today seemed like the day, so off I went at lunch to find this cache. Circled around just a bit near GZ and then spotted the cache - it sort of stand out without any sort of camo. Looks like I am the 6th party to find the cache sign the logbook so I'm not sure why there are only 3 found-it log entries below representing two parties. After finding the cache I enjoyed a nice brown-bag lunch along a very empty beach, only saw two people off in the distance, a cat, and a bunch of ring-billed gulls. Cache is still in great shape.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This multi requires certain high-tech gadgets in order to
complete and will present you with some riddles that you need to
solve to find the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read the complete description before attempting this
cache!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;b&gt;three intermediate stages&lt;/b&gt; to this multi, plus
the final cache. The coordinates to the three stages are given
below (in the additional waypoints). You can visit them in any
order you want, but if you park at the suggested coordinates and
start from there, it's suggested that you visit them in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three intermediate stages are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of them is a &lt;u&gt;Chirp&lt;/u&gt;, a type of wireless beacon that
requires a compatible device to receive. Currently only certain
models of GPS receivers from a particular manufacturer are capable
of doing that.&lt;br /&gt;
This stage will present you with a riddle. Solving this riddle gets
you a number. Call this number A.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another one of the stages is a &lt;u&gt;QR code&lt;/u&gt;. The easiest way
to decode it is to use a smartphone with an appropriate software,
but alternatively you can use any camera to take a picture of it
and then use an online decode (at home) to get the information out
of it.&lt;br /&gt;
Decoding the QR code gets you another riddle, and solving this
riddle gets you another number. Call this number B.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yet another one of the stages requires &lt;u&gt;UV light&lt;/u&gt; to be
made readable. Note that it may be difficult to achieve this in
bright sunlight. You should be either prepared to cover up the clue
(make it dark) so the UV light can do its thing, or simply go at
night.&lt;br /&gt;
There's no riddle here, but again you will get a number from this
stage. Call this number C.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here's two important notes about the above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The stages described above are not given in the same order
as you will encounter them!&lt;/b&gt; Keep this in mind when you start
looking for one, or after you've found one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;!!! Beware of decoys !!!&lt;/b&gt; You &lt;b&gt;will&lt;/b&gt; come across
them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've found all stages and solved the riddles, you can do
a quick checksum. The combined &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root&quot;&gt;digital root&lt;/a&gt; of the
three numbers should be 2. If you get anything else (even if it's
only slightly different, like 1), you better revisit the stages and
double-check everything you've found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In any case, please make sure you replace all the stages
exactly as you've found them, and secure them properly into
place.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of simple math is required to calculate the coordinates of
the final cache. For the north coordinate, perform the following
calculation:&lt;br /&gt;
X = 18783 + A + B&lt;br /&gt;
Divide X by 1,000 and you got the minutes of your north
coordinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the west coordinate, calculate this:&lt;br /&gt;
Y = 47112 - A + C&lt;br /&gt;
Again, divide Y by 1,000 and you got the west coordinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're unsure, can't find it and/or are mobile internet
enabled, you can check your final coordinates here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=9f62f3f8347bc276540dc0ea65ab8552&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=4743324e304e4b&amp;amp;name=596f752063616e2774204d616347797665722074686973206f6e6521&quot;&gt;
Geochecker.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good luck and have fun!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note that the high difficulty rating is not only because of
the required gadgets and the riddles. The hides themselves can also
pose a challenge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There's an unactivated micro geocoin in the cache as FTF
prize!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN2N0NK - Final&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PK2N0NK - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 43° 18.449 W 079° 47.999&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S12N0NK - Stage 1&lt;br /&gt;N 43° 18.480 W 079° 47.980&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S22N0NK - Stage 2&lt;br /&gt;N 43° 18.683 W 079° 48.027&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S32N0NK - Stage 3&lt;br /&gt;N 43° 18.867 W 079° 48.043   </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">It only took 4 hours over two days, 3 PAFs, three itouch apps, four miscalculations and one ripped pair of good work slacks for me to find this cache. For a t4e/dfx, I'd say that's pretty darn good!!

Started this one yesterday with stinger503... got to stage 1, figured out the riddle no problem. Got to stage 2, got the riddle, but didn't know what to do with it. Got to stage three and couldn't get my technology to work, so had to use my lifeline (blackberry) until I found someone who did have the technology needed to get the riddle. Eventually we had all of the pieces we needed, but didn`t have the time (or, frankly, the energy) to grab the final. 

SO, we left it for our cache a day today. We teamed up with Joe.Small and Deadly Rose, and explained the puzzles to them... then they explained how some of the technology worked to me. Plugged in the final coords and off we went. 

For a terrain 2, this one was tougher than I had expected... went to find the final wearing work clothes... I should know by now (1300+ caches into this addiction) that this usually doesn`t end well. Sure enough, I slipped on some of the rocks. Oh well, guess they can be caching pants now. :)

This puzzle definitely deserves a favourite point - the creativity, use of technology and sheer effort put into it, not to mention the spectacular view, made this one very worthwhile.

Thank you so much for putting this one together. You`re very right, you`d have one heck of a time trying to McGyver it... :D</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;Numerous birds have made their home here and once you manage to ignore the noise of the highway traffic and make it just a background noise you will hear lots of pretty chirping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main pond is quite popular in the winter with hockey players, that is if its cold enough  for it to freeze, which didn't happen last winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; FTF prize is in the second cache &lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Read, understand and follow these instructions to find the
cache:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the given coordinates. There's nothing hidden there, so
don't waste your time searching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait until 3:30 a.m. (that's right, 3:30 at night).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At precisely this time, a message will start appearing in the
distance. It is over 100 meters away and quite small, so you need
keen eyes. Bad weather, especially fog, will make this very
difficult to impossible. Extra challenge during christmas
season!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you've spotted the origin, you can come a bit closer to
get a better look. Don't jump any fences though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decode the message to get the coordinates for the actual
cache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The message will get repeated for 60 minutes, which gives it
time for about 22 repetitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The checksum of all the digits of the coordinates is 52 and the
location is about 1.6 km away (straight line). Proper parking and
trailhead will be included in the message, and you will want to
drive there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cache is just slightly off the trail, so there's no need to
bushwhack. &lt;b&gt;Please make sure you rehide and cover up the cache
properly after you're done, so muggles don't accidentally discover
it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of this cache and the description should give you a
clue on what kind of message to expect. You'll want to brush up on
your skills before heading out. &lt;b&gt;Please don't leave any spoilers
in your logs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case your skills aren't up to par, having one or more of the
following items with you may save you from having to make the
night-time trip a second time (no guarantees though):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pen and paper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A smartphone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A caching buddy (much recommended in any case)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video camera or audio recorder (the latter will work, but using
it should be very interesting)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There's a few loonies and AA batteries for FTF and STF
prize!&lt;/b&gt; Choose whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good luck and have fun!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;GC Super Heros are
righting wrongs, thwarting injustice and winning their way into the
hearts of all Geocachers as we defend all that is good and just in
the name of Geocaching.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In traditional secret fortress fashion, the GC Hall of Justice is
defended by both natural and un-natural forces.  There is only
one way in and one way out for those with pure superhero
hearts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a
home, visiting and resting spot for all those loyal to the good in
Geocaching.  It also has lots of cool stuff and a really cool
First To Find Trophy (See Image).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;With your
help, more superheros will join in to defeat... da, da, da, dum...
Evil.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

It seems that the local kids have found this one. We really want to keep this one as close to the location picked by the original CO because it has some sentimental value to them, so the only way was to move it slightly and make it a micro and see how that goes.</groundspeak:text>

We were introduced to this area while doing the Bruce Almighty series of caches and have returned several times to enjoy the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; All stages are colored tags with the next stage's coordinates. There are 8 tags(stages) as well as the final, which might seem like a lot but they should be quick finds. After all, we could have placed 40 of them! At each stage there are two tags with the next coordinates. At most of the stages there will be one tag clearly visible and one that is well hidden. If the easy-to-find tag gets muggled, just look a little harder to find the other tag. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The cache is quite large and will accommodate large trading items and TB's. Please replace the final as found, or re-hide it better to keep it well hidden for the next cacher. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking is available on the shoulder of Guelph Line near the Bruce Trail trailhead at N43 23.300 W79 51.243.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN19ZP2 - Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LB19ZP2 - Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 23.300 W 079° 51.243&lt;br/&gt;Trailhead and roadside parking&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S219ZP2 - Stage 2&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S319ZP2 - Stage 3&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S419ZP2 - Stage 4&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S519ZP2 - Stage 5&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S619ZP2 - Stage 6&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S719ZP2 - Stage 7&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S819ZP2 - Stage 8&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

beautiful fall day so it turned out to be a great time to do it
we found all stages without any major issues, and within few minutes
i do have to say that coordinates were off for us on most of them but we managed
we left a Harley Davidson stuffed plush pig...didn't take anything

We were out placing some caches on this stretch of the Bruce trail, so of course we needed to know where all those stages are. No other choice than doing the whole multi... Fortunately we had no major problems finding any of the stages, some of the coords seemed slightly off, but still they were all found within a few minutes. A bit of a mucky walk to the final, but yey, nice big box (surprisingly).

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Park your car at one of the given parking waypoints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the given trail head (see waypoint &lt;b&gt;THEAD&lt;/b&gt; below).
This is just off Mainway, a relatively busy road with no roadside
parking. You'll have to walk along the road for at least a
bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your way towards the posted header coordinates. There's a
skimpy beaten path going there from the trail head and &lt;b&gt;WHITE&lt;/b&gt;
firetacks have been placed along this trail to help guide your way.
The firetacks are spaced quite far apart, so don't rely on them
alone to get to your destination!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you get to the coordinates, you have entered the Sheldon
Creek Woodlot, which extends roughly to the northeast from here.
The trail of white firetacks ends here, and generally all trails
end here. There's no trails running inside the woodlot at all,
you'll need to bushwhack your way around, which may be easy or
difficult depending on the time of year. There's also some pieces
of leftover wire fence on the ground, so be careful where you
step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Somewhere in this woodlot (which is a nicely big and open area
that's surrounded by farmers' fields on all sides), there are two
trees that are marked with &lt;b&gt;WHITE&lt;/b&gt; firetacks. Your mission is
to find those two trees. They have plenty of firetacks on all sides
of them, which makes them relatively easy to see and
recognize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the posted header coordinates, there are &lt;b&gt;ORANGE&lt;/b&gt;
firetacks to help you find your way to those two marked trees. The
orange firetacks have been placed about 30-50+ meters apart, which
again means that you can't rely on them alone to find your way.
They're merely a rough guide to aid you in your quest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you find a tree that has been marked with &lt;b&gt;TWO orange&lt;/b&gt;
firetacks, you'll know that you're close to one of your
targets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you find one of your target trees (the ones with the
&lt;b&gt;WHITE&lt;/b&gt; firetacks on them), use your GPS to mark a waypoint at
this location (at the tree). You will want to use any &quot;averaging&quot;
feature of your GPS to get a waypoint that's as accurate as
possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue following the orange firetacks until your find the
second marked tree. Again mark a waypoint here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now you have two waypoints (the two marked trees). Together
with the two given reference points (see additional waypoints
below, waypoints AAAA and BBBB - there's nothing there, don't go
there) you have four waypoints total.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using those four waypoints: &lt;b&gt;X marks the spot!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get it? There's several ways of doing this, and it's up to you
to figure out how. Some involve mathematics, others involve
technology. With any half decent handheld GPS device, all you
should need is your GPS (and some braincells). It's highly
recommended that you find a usable method that you can use in the
field &lt;b&gt;before&lt;/b&gt; you head out and attempt this cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a night time only cache!&lt;/b&gt; You will have to use
your flashlight to locate the firetracks mentioned above. Firetacks
are thumbtacks with reflective tape on them. They become visible by
shining your flashlight onto them and will then light up quite
brightly. Since they reflect the light back the same way that it
came from, you will see them best if you hold your flashlight as
close to your eyes as possible. Headlamps are recommended.
Obviously it needs to be dark for this to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a small Lock &amp; Lock container, painted brown.
There's an unactivated geocoin as FTF prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just love driving around in the country. There's less traffic,
fewer stop lights, nicer scenery and cleaner air than in the city.
Sometimes it's about finding a great spot. Other times it's more
about getting there than the destination. That's what this series
is about, an excuse to get away from the hustle and bustle of the
city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of my favourite driving roads. This one has lots of
twists and turns as it goes through the valley. The stream nearby
hops back and forth from one side of the road to the other. Just
north of the cache is a scenic spot where it crosses under the
road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch out for traffic as the road is busy at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK28NN2 - Northbound Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 43° 25.067 W 079° 55.775&lt;br /&gt;Safe place to pull off.</groundspeak:long_description>

Today, we were headed to the Hamilton mountain for some caching, and this cache was still unclaimed. Might as well make a go for it. Missed it by about an hour and a half, being 3rd to sign I believe at 10:28. Nice hide.

William Parkway. GZ is right at the edge of a drop-off so keep an
eye on the kids as you approach the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1827, Colonel William Chisholm purchased 960 acres of land
from the Crown at the mouth of the Sixteen Mile Creek and planned
out the Town of Oakville and the harbour. The first brick building
on site was erected c.1835, and served as a storehouse and possibly
an early Custom House. Later in its' life the Custom House was
converted into the Chisholm family home know as Erchless Estate.
William developed the harbour and invested heavily in shipping and
shipbuilding. He spent his final years in the family estate, living
with his son, Robert Kerr. Despite his dreams and determination,
William declared bankruptcy in 1842, dying shortly after at the age
of 54. William is buried in Oakville St. Mary's Cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just love driving around in the country. There's less traffic,
fewer stop lights, nicer scenery and cleaner air than in the city.
Sometimes it's about finding a great spot. Other times it's more
about getting there than the destination. That's what this series
is about, an excuse to get away from the hustle and bustle of the
city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fun twisty spot on Britannia Road as briefly joins up
with Walkers Line because of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The only reason this is a Difficulty 4 is because the cache slipped a couple inches too deep into it's hiding spot and hence you will need something with a hook to coax it out. A coat hanger would work well or something that is a few inches long with a hook at the end of it or maybe you will be able to get it out if you have skinny fingers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage 1 (posted coordinates)&lt;br/&gt;Here you will find a plaque for COLONEL WILLIAM CHISHOLM. Directly below his name is 2 years. What is the difference between the 2 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage 2 (N43 26.534 W79 39.981)&lt;br/&gt;Here you will find a cairn with a plaque on it. How many words are on this plaque?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage 3 (N43 26.516 W79 40.047)&lt;br/&gt;Here you will find some animals. How many moose and wolves are here?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage 4 (N43 26.491 W79 40.044)&lt;br/&gt;What is the last digit of the year that Bill died? This is also a good place to sit down and do the math to figure out the final as the cache is closeby.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Final&lt;br/&gt;Add the 4 values that you obtained from the first 4 stages and add it to the decimal minutes portion of both the following north and south coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;N43 26.410 W79 39.968</groundspeak:long_description>

The 1877 Historical Atlas of Halton shows the land owned&lt;br /&gt;by the Campbells at that time. This may account for the joint&lt;br /&gt;cemetery name. Often early settlers would set aside a corner of&lt;br /&gt;their farm for a cemetery. A small frame Wesleyan Methodist Church&lt;br /&gt;was also located on this lot. It may have been first known as&lt;br /&gt;Cline's, but later referred to as Davidson's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Little&lt;br /&gt;online History can be found here (Thanks Rockharder for picking&lt;br /&gt;up my slack)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch your step, there's not much room here. This cache was placed&lt;br /&gt;to give a Scout Troop some experience caching while hiking their&lt;br /&gt;way back to Mount Nemo Scout Camp from a morning of rappelling at&lt;br /&gt;Rattlesnake Point. The container is small, camo'd and possibly&lt;br /&gt;fragile. Please let me know if the cache needs maintenance and it&lt;br /&gt;will be dealt with quickly. Please exercise caution and reverence&lt;br /&gt;when searching.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a 2 stage multi cache located along Sixteen Mile Creek in Oakville. Final is a 300ml plastic bottle with a green lid. It is waterproof and is one of the best containers that can be used for geocaching to keep the contents dry. However, not only will it keep moisture out, if the contents get wet, it would have the opposite effect too and keep moisture in. Keep that in mind when finding the cache. I wanted to add the attribute “Special Tool Not Required” as I feel that is a key attribute in finding this cache, however this option was not available when selecting the attributes for this cache. I suggest reading the entire cache page and also printing out a copy of the cache page and take it with you. The posted coordinates will bring you to an octagon information kiosk where you will need to find some additional information from the panels there. You’ll then have to do some math (remember order of operations and / = divide, * = multiply, and ^ = exponent). Enjoy the following story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Former Two Star Michelin Chef Donald Harcroft had been one of the chefs of the well known Mince restaurant located just a couple kilometers away on Lakeshore Rd overlooking Sixteen Mile Creek in Oakville. Word got around pretty quick and people from all over would make sure to make a stop at Mince to taste the fine cuisine and in hopes that Donald would be working there that day and hopefully be the chef that prepares their meal. Lineups waiting to get into Mince were common and it wasn’t unusual to have to wait up to several hours for a table to become available and often by the end of the day many potential customers unfortunately had to be turned away each day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Donald did not own Mince however and had simply been working there since 2001. You see, Donald used to be a well respected chef and owner of the prestigious Petrios restaurant in London, England until one day the unthinkable happened. We’ll leave it at that as it shamed Donald right out the country he had called home for his entire life. Petrios closed down overnight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Donald wanted to disappear and wound up getting a job working on a cruise liner within the Mediterranean and worked there for a short period. Then one day Alberto Bruscanni was on vacation in the Mediterranean aboard the very cruise liner that Donald was working on. Alberto was the owner of two restaurants in Toronto and was soon to open a new fine dining restaurant in Oakville, which would be known as Mince. After a couple of bites of his meal he was impressed with the taste of the food and knew this was well superior of a meal that he had ever tasted on any previous cruise that he had been on before. He demanded to speak to the chef who prepared his meal and it was Donald. He offered Donald a job at his new Oakville restaurant on the spot. Donald who had been feeling pretty down, accepted the offer without hesitation, since afterall anything would be better than working in the galley of a ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Donald came to Canada, and two months later, Mince opened up. Donald at this point was just one of many chefs who worked at Mince, however he formed a close relationship with Mince owner, Alberto Bruscanni. They became friends both within their work life and also hung out outside of work. Alberto had a hot wife Gabriella who was also a former model and actress. She did not always appreciate the time that her husband spent with Donald. Gabriella tried constantly to get her husband to let Donald go, but Alberto’s reasons for keeping Donald always came back to that meal he ate on the cruise liner while on vacation in the Mediterranean. Gabriella also felt that Donald had eyes for her, but she wanted nothing to do with him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gabriella tried to do what she could to keep her husband away from Mince restaurant and tried to get him to focus on their two restaurants in Toronto. She also tried to continually suggest that they open a new flagship restaurant in Montreal, which would take them away from Mince. She also planned many vacation far away from Mince until one day to her surprise Alberto had invited Donald along on what was supposed to be another one of their personal getaways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back to Donald again, he never revealed to Alberto of his former pride of being a Two Star Michelin Chef. Alberto did ask many times what Donald had done or worked at before working the galley of the cruise liner where they had first met. Donald always made up some story and just expanded on it as time went on. Gabriella knew something wasn’t right, but Alberto had no clue at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the first several years of Mince being open, word got around of how great the food was and became the most popular restaurant in Oakville and eventually even surpassed the popularity of the Bruscannis’ two Toronto restaurants. Alberto knew that he had a priceless find in Donald, however his wife never allowed Alberto to give him a promotion or set him apart from the other chefs who worked for Mince. Donald could easily be head chef, but Gabriella never allowed it, so Donald remained just another chef. Other chefs came and went, but Donald remained, as he really had no other place to go, nor had he any desire to go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Donald knew he could never go back to his home in England nor could he display any prominence or headline his own restaurant again, so he was quite content as simply a number among many, but he did have an ego and felt that he deserved being head chef of Mince. It never would happen though. He remained in the position where he was first hired.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Donald lost his respect with what happened in his famous Petrios restaurant, it was all over the media, not just in England but the entire Europe. Not much however was ever said about it within any North American media as even the Bruscannis did not know of Donald’s past. However if it ever did get out that Donald was working for Mince, it would probably ruin Mince as well as Alberto’s other restaurants. So the fact that Gabriella tried to squash Donald’s advancement within their restaurant, it turned out to be a good thing for everyone concerned. If Alberto ever found out that Donald Harcroft was a disgraced Two Star Michelin Chef and the reasons behind it, he would surely fire Donald and also end their friendship, which of course Gabriella would like nothing better and would be really ecstatic about it but of course she doesn’t know anything about anything of this either, although she still continues to have the feeling that something is just not right about Donald, but her husband still remains blind to this and doesn’t listen to his wife about anything she has to say with this matter and this is a run on sentence, but that’s ok as you get the point, I hope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other than Donald’s friendship with Alberto, he really had no other close friends and just the odd acquaintance but nothing more, so when he was not spending time with Alberto, he pretty much just spent all his time to himself. Donald probably wanted it this way since he certainly wouldn’t want anyone to find out about how he once was a Two Star Michelin Chef who became disgraced. Donald also did not make a habit of going out in public too much for fear that perhaps once day someone might recognize him from his former glory days. However, one place where he would go for some quiet time outside would be here where you stand right now. He would read the information board and admire the old machine that was once used along Sixteen Mile Creek. He even researched as much information as he could about it. If some new people came by he would try and start up a conversation with them and tell them all about this area. Some people would listen, while others would just walk away thinking that maybe he was some lonely crackpot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One day while sitting here, an elderly couple in their 60s came along and it soon was revealed that they were on vacation here in Ontario, from England. This made Donald become very nervous as pretty much everyone in England knew of his disgracement. Suddenly Donald wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible and started stuttering his words. He quickly ended the conversation and wandered off. The couple from England, Marshall and Bernadette did not recognize Donald and thought he wound up acting quite strange in the end before he excused himself and disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Days went by, then weeks, then months. Donald did not venture outside except to report to work for his shifts. He did not even hang around Alberto much anymore and most definitely not in public, but they still spent time together and more so now at Alberto’s home than ever before. This annoyed Gabriella even more so she contacted Captain Kirk of the Enterprise and had him beam Donald up as Kirk promptly commanded Scotty to do so. Worf quickly grabbed Donald while Spock did one of his Vulcan neck grips on Donald to render him unconscious. In the meantime, Alberto had left the room for a washroom break, so when he returned he wondered where his friend Donald had disappeared to. His wife made up an excuse that Donald suddenly didn’t feel well and had to leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At Mince restaurant the next day, Alberto was puzzled that Donald did not show up for work and in fact this was the first time that he had ever missed work. He had never even been so much as a minute late before either. Donald had not called either and remembered back to the day before when Donald had to suddenly leave. A few days later Donald was still absent for work. This worried Alberto even more. His wife however seemed to be in a much more happier mood. Alberto had tried calling Donald on the phone but there was no answer at all since his sudden disappearance from their home. Alberto decided to go over to Donald’s place, but realized he did not know where Donald lived. After knowing each other for several years, Alberto had never been over at Donald’s place and just now he thought that this was odd. He checked up the employee records and there was no address listed, so he decided to do a reverse phone number look up and got an address, but it turned out to be just a vacant lot. He did know where Donald liked to hang out and went over there and sat around for a bit. Interestingly the elderly English couple that Donald had spoken too some time ago suddenly showed up and started talking to Alberto. The couple said how they were from England and asked if Alberto came by often. They had quite the lengthy and enjoyable conversation and somehow got onto the topic of Donald. They all made the connection and Alberto told them how Donald had not shown up for work all week. Alberto enjoyed their conversation and liked the fact that the couple had previously conversed with his good friend Donald that he invited the couple to his Mince restaurant for a complimentary VIP meal. They could come right in and did not have to wait for the long lineup outside the restaurant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marshall and Bernadette were immediately seated by a table that had a stunning and beautiful aussicht an Sixteen Mile Creek. Alberto sat down and joined them for the meal and also summoned his wife over to join them. Now take good note of everything that is said here as it may be very important. He whispered to the waiter to bring over their finest bottle of wine, a 1999 Louie Magnien Pinot Noir. This was from Alberto’s personal stock. Marshall ordered a Bacon Wrapped Chicken Breast filled with Mushrooms, Cheese, Onion and Garlic. Bernadette ordered the Beef Tenderloin stuffed with Mushrooms and Shallot Dressing served on a Tomato Garnish. Gabriella ordered the Seafood Salmon which is baked and served on a Potato Galette with Tomato Beurre Blanc. Alberto ordered a Cheeseburger and Home Fries. Everyone enjoyed their meal and time just flew by as Alberto monopolized the conversation and mostly discussed his companionship with Donald. Gabriella kept giving her husband strange looks like she wanted him to talk about something else since, as you remember, Gabriella was not fond about Donald at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marshall and Bernadette complimented their hosts on how good the meal was and made a point of saying how they never have had such a scrumptious and palette pleasing meal in a very long time. It reminded them greatly on a place they used to frequent on special occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries just to name a few in their home town of London, England. Marshall and Bernadette told Alberto and Gabriella all about the restaurant saying how it was called Petrios and how great the food was there. Alberto asked more about the restaurant and their experience their as he was always open to trying no things within his own restaurants. Money was no object for Alberto and he had a bright idea that maybe he should contact Petrios and steal the chef away from them to work at Mince, now that Donald seemed to have dematerialized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marshall and Bernadette said that this was not possible as there was an incident with the chef and the restaurant was closed permanently, never to reopen again and that the chef was never seen from or heard from again after this incident. They said how it was all over the papers and was quite the news for quite some time. They said how the chef used to be a Two Star Michelin Chef and he was so disgraced. There were many things said and many rumours on what had happened to the former Two Star Michelin Chef. Since no one had ever heard from him again, there were even rumours that he had taken his own life as he could not live with the shame of his actions. They explained how the chef’s name was Donald Harcroft and at this point the look on Alberto’s face was that of shock and Gabriella suddenly got an OMG GMWAS IDBI FUSS ITGTBT moment. Marshall and Bernadette were just as shocked when they saw the varied expressions on their hosts’ faces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alberto leaned forward over the table and told them that his chef that he had discovered on a cruise liner in the Mediterranean many years ago was named Donald Harcroft and how Donald have become his good friend as a star chef within Mince, but how Donald had disappeared suddenly from their home earlier in the week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alberto was curious as to what had happened and Marshall and Bernadette told him the whole story as had been reported in all of the papers. Albert could not believe that he had befriended someone like Donald and allowed him to work in his fine establishment. Albert had a bag full of feelings from rage to heartfelt disappointment. What if the same thing had happened to his prized Mince restaurant. It would have affected all of his restaurants including the two in Toronto. Alberto stood up and left the restaurant. His wife chased after him and they could be seen having a detailed discussion in front of the restaurant and in front of hundreds of people in line waiting to get in. What would they do if anyone ever found out that Donald had worked for them for so many years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next day as people started to arrive and line up, they were greeted with a sign on the front door of Mince that said closed until further notice. Everyone certainly was surprised to see this as this was the first time Mince ever closed down in all its years. This went on for a whole week and then finally Mince opened its doors again but to a much much smaller crowd. Mince was full staffed that day that it reopened, but as the weeks went on, there was no more lineups outside of Mince and staff had to be let go. Business had definitely slowed down. Was it because Mince had closed its doors for a week or was it something else like maybe word got out about Donald and what happened in his home town of London many years ago. That certainly would be devastating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alberto was in a bit of a pickle now. His pride and joy in Oakville was in trouble, although he did have a happy wife for the first time in many years. If nothing was done then Mince would probably have to be closed as it was no longer making the money it once used to and now was losing money week after week. And the clientele that ate at Mince was changing too and this definitely was not the picture that Alberto wanted to paint. The quality and taste of the food was also changing without Donald around. It was clear to Alberto that something needed to be done so he got out his rolodex and looked through all his contacts until he found the business card of Tim who he had met a couple years ago while on a Caribbean cruise. Tim was the president of the Greek consulting firm TML who set up business in the GTA back in 2009 when he brought his family along with his successful business to Canada as they saw the potential to help companies get out of all kinds of problems and there really was no one in Ontario that was able to deal with “problems” like Tim and his firm could. Alberto called up Tim and had a lengthy discussion on what had happened. Tim however was out of the country dealing with a much bigger issue right now but he was confident that he could provide help and ensure that Mince did not go the way of the do-do. They got off the phone and just 30 minutes later two men showed up at Mince and to see Alberto. They introduced themselves to Alberto and they got right down to business setting up an action plan. The two men were Mike, Vice President of Business Affairs at TML and Louie, Vice President of Operations at TML. They guaranteed to Alberto that they would have things turned around and all loose ends tied up within the month. Of course this came with a hefty price, but Alberto was more than willing to pay as his reputation, both personal and business, were on the line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mike took immediate action related to the restaurant operations. He called in some favours and managed to get top Greek chef, Paul Delios to fly into Toronto immediately and Paul was made the head chef of the restaurant. A name change was also in order but just a slight one. Mince turned into Mincee. The addition of the E was very important. Mike also initiated the change in décor to give Mincee a fresh new look. He managed to purchase a rare print entitled, “The Mill on the Sixteen” by Frederick Arthur Verner which hangs prominently still today in the dining area of the restaurant. It would also be useful to know that the value of E is the year that “The Mill on the Sixteen” was taken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Louie also started the task of finding out everything he could about Donald Harcroft, the former Two Star Michelin Chef who became probably the most disgraced chef ever in the history of restaurateurism. There certainly was a lot of information available from the British and European media, but Louie had his ways of finding out more. He also wanted to track down Donald to ensure that Donald would never again work at another restaurant or anywhere else for that matter as what he did was inexcusable. Donald starts with a D and D would also represent the year when the price of Wheat dropped dramatically. Finding Donald however would prove to be very difficult as he did in fact just vanish into thin air and the only person that would have any kind of idea of where Donald went to would be Gabriella and I doubt that she would say anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So thanks to TML coming through with great success as expected, Alberto and his wife Gabriella were very pleased with the renewed success of Mincee and also with that success came a rejuvenated passion within their marriage and would give birth to their 1 year old son who they proudly name Justin after Alberto’s great uncle Justin Bendito. Justin we are sure will one day take over the Bruscanni restaurant empire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for Donald Harcroft, no one knows his whereabouts or if he decided to boldly go where no man has gone before. However you may want to take a walk along Lakeshore Rd just east of Sixteen Mile Creek and the famous Mincee restaurant and look for a small bakery. Inside you may meet a man and on his nametag it says “Cake Boss Don”. Could this be the former Two Star Michelin Chef Donald Harcroft, now reduced to the job of a cake baker in a small bakery that goes by the name of Let Them Eat Cake?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to find the location of this geocache you need to find some information from the panels on the octagon information kiosk at the posted coordinates and from the story above. Once you find out the required information, then you will need to do some math to figure out X and add X to the decimal minutes of the meaningless coordinates indicated below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A = On the information panel entitled Industrial Change, there are 2 years prominently displayed near the top in large letters just below the words Industrial Change. What is the differencw between these 2 years?&lt;br/&gt;B = In the 1890s, within how many hours would it take the Oakville Basket Company to turn a sawlog into finished baskets?&lt;br/&gt;C = How many times is Donald’s last name mentioned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X = A B-(C 3)/2-(E-D)*2 B/1-B*B*C-1*1/1 A/5-B^B&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meaningless coordinates that you need to add X to.&lt;br/&gt;N43° 27.000&lt;br/&gt;W79° 41.021&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now go find the cache and enjoy the other multis that I have hidden in the area too.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just love driving around in the country. There's less traffic,
fewer stop lights, nicer scenery and cleaner air than in the city.
Sometimes it's about finding a great spot. Other times it's more
about getting there than the destination. That's what this series
is about, an excuse to get away from the hustle and bustle of the
city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorite driving roads. I usually start from
the south and then do a left onto Sideroad 3 for more nice scenery.
I've been wanting to start this series for a while and when I drove
by this spot I just had to put the first one here.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;An interesting spot where the main flow of traffic is diverted
to the south. A great view of the escarpment on the north side.
I've taken some nice sunset photos just west of here on this road.
Going east on this road after crossing Regional Road 25 there's a
valley with a single lane bridge.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
There is an admission fee to get into the conservation area.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Crawford Lake is a meromictic lake located in Crawford Lake
Conservation Area. Go back in time as you enjoy an educational
stroll along the boardwalk that encircles this rare lake. As an
added bonus, be sure to check out Mr. Twister and how it’s
formed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Crawford Lake is small but deep with limited circulation and little
oxygen below 15 meters. Most living things cannot exist in the
bottom 9.4 meters of the lake and so the sediment lies unchanged in
its depths. A meromictic lake is one which lacks complete
circulation. In meromictic lakes the deepest water contains no
dissolved oxygen. Sediments are relatively undisturbed and
therefore offer a detailed record of the history of the lake.
Normally lakes in the temperate zone mix completely during the
spring and autumn when water temperatures are approximately the
same from top to bottom. In meromictic lakes there are no periods
of overturn or complete mixing because seasonal changes in the
thermal gradient are either small or overridden by the stability of
a chemical gradient, or the deeper waters are physically
inaccessible to the mixing energy of the wind. Most commonly, the
vertical stratification is stabilized by a chemical gradient in
meromictic lakes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The upper stratum of water in a meromictic lake is mixed by the
wind and is called the mixolimnion. The bottom, denser stratum,
which does not mix with the water above, is referred to as the
monimolimnion. The transition layer between these strata is called
the chemocline. Of the hundreds of thousands of lakes on the Earth,
only about 120 are known to be meromictic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;In order to log a find on this cache, you will need to walk
along the boardwalk that surrounds this lake. Based on the
information given and using your own GPS to obtain measurements of
the lake, approximately how many litres or gallons of water are in
the bottom 9.4m of this meromictic lake. Additionally, based on
what was once in this area, what kind of things can one expect to
find in the lake sediment?&lt;br /&gt;
As a bonus, how was Mr. Twister formed?&lt;/strong&gt; 

You may post your answers in your log and compare it those the results that others have found and posted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Permission has been granted for the placement of this cache by Conservation Halton. Conservation Halton does not permit physical caches here due to the environmentally sensitive area. </groundspeak:long_description>

After running around Rattlesanke for the day we were too tired to make the trek to this one. Glad That I finally got around to doing it with the end to end crew. This place is great. Wandered around, did some math and discussed what would still be at the bottom of the lake which brought up some interesting items in the conversation including Jimmy Hoffa.

going down was easier than expected and while i was on the way, t4e read the hint out to me. ok, sounds easy enough, and i started looking around. and i was looking and looking and looking... nothing. after having exhausted all options, i decided to get back out and give the phone another chance to load those pictures.

more luck with that this time and soon we were looking at the spoiler picture and the pics posted by the penguin. by comparing those with what we could see around us we could confirm that it was indeed the right cave. i went back down a second time, this time with the phone in hand, with the spoiler image loaded, and with that i could determine the approximate location where the cache should be. i had looked there before, but went and looked again, even more closely. still nothing! argh!

defeat. i got back out to make room for t4e's attempt. while she was heading down, i started reading the description and hint myself. that's when i figured out my mistake, i misinterpreted the hint (damn that punctuation) and had been looking for the wrong thing all along! t4e and me exchanged some thoughts and new ideas (she was still down there) and it was only a few minutes later that she made the find. yey!

we figured we should take advantage of the beautiful weather and make the descent somewhat safer due to dry ground and warm weather
while dfx was searching and searching i kept looking at the gps and recalling from memory the picture from avernar's trip i was 99.99% certain we have the right cave
when search proved fruitless dfx came up and we got a chance to look at the picture and confirmed that was indeed the entrance to GZ
off he went back down but no luck again so he returned
i was determined that we will not leave here with a DNF
after observing him descend twice i knew its not too hard to get down 
we have established before where the location of the spoiler picture is but still meticulously checked every possible hiding spot as i descended 
meanwhile dfx got a revelation about the hint so i went to that spot
checked all around and few minutes later something caught my eye and YEESSSSSSSSSS ...BINGO! [:D]
awesome place for this hide and the hint is very accurate

Once in the correct location it didn't take too long to find that cache although I wouldn't describe it as being easy.

Thanks much for the cache, this was my 100th.  </groundspeak:text>

This one seemed much tougher than Troglosheep and some time was also taken to explore the other nearby caves/crevices, especially by the 3 kids who went deep into the other cave. Nothern Penguin was the one that came up with the find on this one once he went deep enough. Seemed much more challenging of a cache than Troglosheep was.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Came here with the Baker's Dirty Dozen - 13 cachers that all hit Troglosheep and then this one. 

Don't know how anyone would have convinced me to enter this cave. I don't like heights. Really - I don't. Zoeker Bill and Dreadnaught searched every reasonable nook and cranny and eventually decided it was time for someone else to look. I was the only cacher willing to enter the cave, but you can imagine I had a vice grip on every foothold and handhold in there. Searched in the reasonable places and was coming up empty handed until Crystal Dawns started reading another cacher's log entry aloud and I decided to search deeper. Man, I would sure hate to slip in here, or worse... to drop the cache in here. That's a long trip around to pick the cache up if it happened. 

What a blast though! Quite fun, and the cave was nice and cool. Perfect for a warm summer's day. Everyone had fun looking, even the ones in the wrong cave. There were non cachers exploring the caves too, but not this one.</groundspeak:text>

Section of the Bruce Trail duing GCZZZ0. This is just down the
trail from the exact point the Toronto Club starts (at the Fence).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was a large group of us that started our hike from here,
intending to finish the entire Toronto Bruce Club in one day. Four
people made it: Psychocyclist, Res2100, Tomtec and Jeff-Trex. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is a medium sized lock-n-lock container. Parking on Appleby
Line is not permitted - you should have someone drop you off, or

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wanted to get out for some excercise today and just walk around a bit somewhere, so Tylor and I decided to go to Kelso. Large parking lot near the cache was completely empty when we go there so started down the trail. As we started searching, some muggles start walking down the trail (very slowly), then another set of muggles, just as slow...sheesh! So we wait and wait and wait, they disappear eventually and then more muggles show up and more again. They pass slowly towards the end of the trail so had a couple minutes in between the next 2 sets of muggles to search and luckily found the very very well concealed cache, and then the muggles start up again so we grab the cache and also walk to the end of the trail as we open and sign the log. Then make our way back to the cache hidng spot and rehide it just before the next set wander down here. Never seen so many muggles is a such out of the way nothing to see or no place to go spot than we did today. Just glad we found it and got it back undetected. Afterwards we explored the items on the outside of the museum, wandered down to the lake, which was very dry as the water level was several meters lower and the edge of the water was now about 100m from the beach. Hard to believe that this is a nice full lake that people go swimming in in the summer. We wondered if they drop the water level in the off season or if it just all dried out due to lack of rain this year. After that we ventured over the overpass of the tracks and then back through the old tunnel. Really enjoyed our couple hours in the park.</groundspeak:text>

My Cub scouts had gone home from our Family Camp so I went off to grab a couple 'BT' caches before I left.  I knew this one had been replaced so I thought I'd try to find it.  No luck so I went after the next on the list (GC11XRJ) which I got no problem (once I mustered enough strength to remove it from it's hiding place).
Back I go to this one, root about for longer than I probably   should have and still came up empty.  I widened my search a bit more, still no luck. As I was about to give up and walk away brokenhearted, I spotted a container lying out in the open at the base of a tree. Shaking off the disbelief that it was not possibly the cache I opened it up to find a log book with a FTF entry from Psychocyclist!  I appear to have found the original cache that had gone missing.  I rehid it a short distance away under some cover and have sent a co-ordinates and pictures to NorthernPenguin.  I'm still not sure where the new cache container is, but I think I'm OK to log this with a clear conscience.</groundspeak:text>

Mills, and look at that hill over there. Yes, you have to climb
that thing! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Stop at this micro and ponder your decision to proceed. Few have
made it to the end in one day.... maybe you should just give
up!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 On the other hand, you'll miss all the fantastic views from the
Escarpment... you'll miss the Hole in the Wall, Lime Kilns and the
old Mill at Limehouse. You won't see the beautiful autumn scenery
at Terra Cotta. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You could drive to these spots, but parking's a pain, and you won't
get that end-to-end patch. You know you want it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what are you still doing here? Get a move on - daylight's a
wasting - or did you give up and go home?&lt;br /&gt;

Trail, you'll find yourself tired and more than happy to stop for a
cache hunt here, as you've just climbed up the Escarpment. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The trail is typical Bruce Trail, rocky bumpy and definately not
wheelchair friendly. Bikes are NOT allowed on this section of the
trail, please hike in. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can park at Hilton Falls conservation area if you're not thru
hiking the trail. The cache is very close to the trail and it's a
medium sized lock-n-lock (camouflaged). Please ensure the cache is
not visible when you rehide it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not winter friendly. &lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We heard that MythicLionMan was hiking the Hilton Falls Loop today, and figured we'd head out and try and meet him on the route. We parked at the end of Dublin Line and hiked up the trail. Elf brought the big metal detector, so she elected to stay at the crossroads and play while R@inbow and I hiked the loop backwards looking for signs of MLM. We found him after he DNF'd one of the Esquesing me series caches, so we went back to assist. We then collected Elf, the metal detector and continued along the loop with MLM and Dakota. Over the bridge and past some great caching memories we went, finally arriving at this spot. I was here back when it was placed, so I was nice to finally return to make the find.

After much searching, reading of logs, hints and cache info, R@inbow came up with the find! Opening the soggy container and reading what we could of the log, it turns out this was the original cache container that went missing in 2007. Well, we found it, so I broke out the space pen to sign the wet log book at 23:23h. So, that means there still could be another container... Our search continued... and continued... and finally we decided to call it off so MLM could finish the loop before passing out.

I packed out the old soggy container at the owner's request, and we continued on our way. Thanks for the fun!

So we decided, why not go to Hilton Falls and find our 9th closest to home unfound cache. It's about time that we go find this one. Made our way over to it from Hilton Falls, which was quite the hike. Then afterwards we headed towards the Hilton Falls viewing area, but first we made a stop at the other falls which were just as spectacular at the top end of the reservoir. Took lots of pictures and then took even more at Hilton Falls. The water sure was moving stongly today over the falls. last time we were here in the fall, there wasn't even a drop. Had a great time here today. Oh, took about 5 minutes of searching before spotting the cache.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just love driving around in the country. There's less traffic,
fewer stop lights, nicer scenery and cleaner air than in the city.
Sometimes it's about finding a great spot. Other times it's more
about getting there than the destination. That's what this series
is about, an excuse to get away from the hustle and bustle of the
city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes take 6th line instead of Trafalgar when I tired of
just going in a straight line. The road does a neat S turn here as
it crosses the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK28NN5 - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 43° 30.956 W 079° 46.711&lt;br /&gt;Room for one or two cars</groundspeak:long_description>

Since I live so close I just had to put in a cache of my own here.  This time however it's a two stage multi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get to the first stage you can either take the direct route through the woods right from the parking or you can go around a bit and enter closer to the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final is located a short distance from the paved trail that snakes through the other wooded area in the park.  Watch out for muggles walking by when finding this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is room for geocoins and small trading items.  Please don't damage the cache container trying to stuff something too big into it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF prize is a $5 tim card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park closes at 11PM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking available at  N 43° 31.674 W 079° 41.900&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">i'd love to say that this was a quick find, but it really wasn't, especially the first stage took forever to find. after a long time we found the decoy, didn't see it at first because the hint didn't match. at least it told us that we were close, so after a few more minutes i spotted the container, lying on the ground, right next to a spot that we had checked at least 3 times before and several meters from where we got GZ.

the final luckily didn't take as long. the hiding spot is pretty much disintegrating, the cache is still in good shape though. tftc.</groundspeak:text>

just as i was about to call it quits, dfx found the decoy, even though my hands were frozen, didn't take gloves because for some reason i thought this wasn't going to take long, now we had to keep poking
finally dfx found it on the ground in a spot that i checked quite a few times, i may have stepped on it lol
before going to the final we took the gloves from the car just in case, but of course it didn't take long to find
cache was sitting out in the open, as mentioned before the original hiding spot is pretty much non-existant

Stage 1 caused us some problems even though we were searching in the right area...Found the container...ooops...no...that one wasn't it...but luckily found the right container in the next spot I searched along with a number of potato bugs that were crawling around the container. At one point as we were searching my GPS said we were 950m away from stage 1 even though we were realy only a couple meters away.

On to the final. I searched a number of spots and then my wife Ellesche finds it nicely tucked away in a spot I guess I missed. Cache was stuck in place but managed to get it out with some wiggling. Left a TB and a nice geocoin. 

Enjoyed this multi.</groundspeak:text>

A muggle came over and asked if we were geocaching during the hunt. Looks like the locals know all about our hobby here.

Both stages hid better than found - as per the owner  [}:)]

 Cache is accessible from Highway 25 - head into the Carpool Lot
(follow the signs with the &quot;P&quot; inside a green circle).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since you can park within a few metres of this cache, please do not
do something foolish like parking on the 401, or Highway 25. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache was placed here, where you can get a lovely view of
Milton's Licence Plate Factory. The other name this facility goes
by is the Maplehurst Jail. This facility is one of Ontario's
'megajails'. The Ontario government describes Maplehurst as : &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;Medium to maximum security correctional facility for adult

incarceration and for those remanded in custody pending appearance
in court. A variety of programs and services are provided to
inmates that are not accessible to the general public. Programs and
services help inmates develop positive skills and attitudes for
successful adjustment in the community after release. Volunteers
help to deliver many programs, including literacy, life skills,

Aboriginal services and individual counselling.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

I do note they don't specifically mention licence plates, but I'm
free to speculate on that one all I want :). Don't climb that fence

This was the first stop for us this afternoon and our GPS took us right to the cache. 

This was a really neat spot. I never knew that we had a Licence Place Factory here in Halton and it looked like quite the modern establishment from the outside. We also wondered if this ws the secret location of the Milton RCMP. What was even more neater was the excellent view of the Niagara Escarpment/Kelso. Thanks for bringing us here today for a well placed cache with a great view. I highly recommend this cache to everyone.</groundspeak:text>

The next reflector I went to, I was in the circle and cleaned up more. There must be more reflectors out there but I didn't see more, I guess we got lucky.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tachyonic Antitelephone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tachyonic antitelephone is a hypothetical device
in theoretical physics that could
be used to send signals into one's
own past. Such a device was first contemplated
by R. C. Tolmanin 1917[1] in
a demonstration of how faster-than-light signals can lead to
a paradox of
causality (a.k.a. Tolman's paradox).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The example of the antitelephone is a thought experiment intended to
demonstrate how any faster-than-light communications capability
could lead to causality violations. According to the current
understanding of physics, no such faster-than-light transfer of
information is actually possible. For instance, the
hypothetical tachyon particles which give the device
its name do not exist even theoretically in the standard model of
particle physics, due to tachyon condensation, and there is no
experimental evidence that suggests that they might exist. The
problem of detecting tachyons via causal contradictions is
considered in Ref.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;- Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posted co-ordinates are for the location of the BFL Command
Centre on October 30, 2010. There is no geocache to be found there,
but on the event night you will encounter geocachers there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are two ways you can visit this geocache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Option One: Visit the final cache before any of the required
stages, by simply remembering to send the information into your own
past when you visit the stages in the future. You should remember
to visit the stages eventually, or you may end up causing a paradox
and end life as we know it in this temporal plane, or worse, you
may disrupt the Temporal Prime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Option Two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 
BFL Boot Camp V - Devilluminati event on October 30,2010 this
cache and 9 other caches were placed. You can choose one (or both)
of the two lists of 5 geocaches to visit and obtain the codes for
the final. One you have the codes, complete the math puzzle shown,
and you will have the co-ordinates of the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there are 9 caches, one of the caches is listed in both
tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

I only needed to find one more from the alpha track to get my final code before I could locate this one. Once I put together all the pieces I thought the coords were wrong but they were at least worth a shot. There were other caches down this trail so I figured my odds were a little higher. About 15m away from GZ we heard a pack of coyotes off in the distance. This was a sence of accomplishment and I cannot wait for BFL VI.

The rest of the CREW headed to the Alien cache, while alli-oop and I were tired, and headed to this final. After a short hike, we arrived at GZ to find about 10 people searching. We joined the hunt, and eventually, after about 20 minuted the caches was found about 30 m from the co-ords. Later, at the BFL Command Centre we found out why it was off.  Thanks for all the effort that was put into the BFL event and caches.

The final here was very straight forward although we kept expecting there to be some twists or turns along the way. Thanks for a fun series of caches. Glad we stayed as a small group today instead of doing the caches in larger groups like previous years. Our smaller group definitely enhanced our overall experience with most of the caches tonight. Looking forward to next year.</groundspeak:text>

It was an enjoyable multi and almost stroller friendly as there was still a little bit of snow left on the trails. We only had the small umbrella stroller with us today so it was fairly easy to lift baby TK over the snowy patches. Stage 2 was the only one we needed the hint for and I actually missed spotting it the first time I looked in that spot. Walked the loop and took the sidewalk back to the car.</groundspeak:text>

complete &quot;Blind Man's Bluff&quot; follow the trail from the posted
coordinates, approximately 100m to where the trail turns right as
indicated by the blue blazes. At this point turn to your left, and
follow the white reflectors as you would in any traditional
nightcache. You'll find the first stage when you see three white
reflectors. The first stage is a lock 'n lock with instruction
sheets which you'll need to complete a task at stage 2. Completion
of that stage leads to the final cache.


 Please
only take one sheet per person or group 


**** Parking is limited at
the trailhead, with only room for a couple of cars just south of
the driveway to get safely off the road. DO NOT block the driveway as it is
private property. There is lots of parking 850m south of the
trailhead on the Sixth Line for those who don't mind the walk.
Carpooling with other cachers from the parking to the south is also
a great idea as well.

A lot of thought and planning went into it.My favorite cache of the BFL series this year.We were managing to solve all of the clues as a group effort. After getting all of the clues together we had a heck of a time figuring out what to do with them. We did discuss what we could do to Goju with a white cane but that's another story and not printable here. Finally figured out the cords and off to the frinal. TTC</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">this one took quite a lot of time to complete, mostly stage 2 figuring out e final coordinates
the instructions to stage one seem a bit off as the &quot;left turn' is not quite a left but more of a &quot;turn around&quot;
once we got the instruction sheet at the posted coordinates we met what seemed to be half the attendees of the event
definitely a busy place, quite impossible to get to the &quot;translation&quot; so Bruce made good use of his iPhone and figured it out quite quickly
getting the coordinates was a different story with all the commotion and chatter going on, but we got it and off we went to the final, not absolutely sure we do actually have the right GZ
after quite a bit of bushwhacking, since we didn't seem to find the trail, we looked and looked and some more cachers showed up and soon after dfx spotted it and we were signing the log
IMO this deserves a higher difficult rating and perhaps terrain too, i can't honestly imagine doing this one in the summer with buzzers swarming around, nor in the winter at any bellow 0C temperatures

At stage 2 we started the decoding and the figuring and the searching and so on. Checking once, twice, thrice and maybe more and me saying several times, stop telling me that it's a letter R. In the end we had what was needed and a few thoughts on what could be done and then it made sense and we had what seemed like plausable coords and sure enough it led us and the others who showed up on to the cache. Excellent group effort on this one and again thanks for something really unique and appreciated that it actually made us think in order to figure out the coords for the final.</groundspeak:text>

Great job Team Goju!  This was a lot of fun to do.  We had some challenges when we tested as a result of using the provided conversion tool.  Once we sorted that out we were able to start our search.  What a camo job!  Those things are tricky to find.  After some searching, many hands make light work, we headed off to find the final. 

This cache was a lot of fun.  </groundspeak:text>

The original deed&lt;br /&gt;reads: &quot;This indenture made this 26th day of Sept 1835. Witnesseth&lt;br /&gt;that I, Richard Bloomfield of the Township of Trafalgar, County of&lt;br /&gt;Halton, and District of Gore, yeoman, of the first part, doth and&lt;br /&gt;by these presents doth for himself, his heirs, executors,&lt;br /&gt;administrators and assigns, for every one of them both in law and&lt;br /&gt;equity, lease the lot or plot of ground on the south-east corner of&lt;br /&gt;Lot No 13 on the Sixth Concession of the Township of Trafalgar, New&lt;br /&gt;Survey, now occupied as a burying ground for the term of 999 years,&lt;br /&gt;to Andrew Cunningham, William Forest Snr and Allen McDougal,&lt;br /&gt;trustees for said burying ground of the second part, or to their&lt;br /&gt;successors in office, for the above term of nine hundred and&lt;br /&gt;ninety-nine years on the following consideration. First, the said&lt;br /&gt;burying ground to be used for that purpose and nothing else, and&lt;br /&gt;second, that the above mentioned trustees shall not prevent or&lt;br /&gt;hinder directly or indirectly the building or erecting a house of&lt;br /&gt;worship of Almighty God, on the following limitation or conditions&lt;br /&gt;if built. First to be for the use of the Canadian Wesleyan&lt;br /&gt;Methodists and to be open for other denominations when not occupied&lt;br /&gt;by said Methodists, with free access to it at all times in and for&lt;br /&gt;the consideration, to be paid yearly when demanded of each of the&lt;br /&gt;trustees. In witness whereof I set my hand and seal this 26th day&lt;br /&gt;of September, 1835.&quot; Witnessed by Robert Cunningham and Alex&lt;br /&gt;Alderson and signed by Richard Bloomfield, Andrew Cunningham,&lt;br /&gt;William Forest and Allan McDougal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wooden church was built in 1836 serving as a Methodist Church&lt;br /&gt;until about 1876 when a new church was built at Hornby. The old&lt;br /&gt;Bloomfield Church was split in two to build two driving sheds on&lt;br /&gt;neighbour's farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1963 the Oakville Cemetery Board restored the old cemetery,&lt;br /&gt;setting some stones in concrete.

I read about the wasps this morning, but decided to try anyways. I saw the cache in it's hiding spot and removed it with a couple wasps hovering around below, but not bothering me. Signed us all in and put it back. Then made sure I gave the hiding spot a few good swift wacks before running...Looked over my shoulder as I ran, but they didn't follow so I stopped and watched the 2 wasps hovering around the middle. I guess I didn't annoy them enough. I am sure the wasps will be gone by winter.</groundspeak:text>

Congrats&lt;br /&gt;Cool_easy_cache!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update: April 4th 2009 - cache location changed so as not to&lt;br /&gt;bother a bird nesting in the tree. Hint changed to suit new&lt;br /&gt;location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update: April 28th 2009 - removed parking waypoint. The new&lt;br /&gt;cache location is a hop, skip, and jump away from Sapling Trail so&lt;br /&gt;the parking spot off of Saratoga Way is kind of pointless. Sorry&lt;br /&gt;Buttons and Beaux!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update: Jan. 23rd 2010 - new parking waypoint right next to the&lt;br /&gt;cache. New logsheet.

Nassagaweya-Esquesing Town Line.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just love driving around in the country. There's less traffic,
fewer stop lights, nicer scenery and cleaner air than in the city.
Sometimes it's about finding a great spot. Other times it's more
about getting there than the destination. That's what this series
is about, an excuse to get away from the hustle and bustle of the
city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road here goes between a small pond and a scenic wetlands
area. Continue going south and you'll go through a nice forested
area and end up at a parking area for the Bruce Trail.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

As 15SR is a very common route into Georgetown, I saw this one just off to the left. Took the 800 metre detour to snag the find -- spotted the cache from the car, so that part didn't take very long at all. Was tempted to crack out the Nikon here, as the neighbouring wetlands were rather scenic. I'll have to come back and spend some quality time here. </groundspeak:text>

No climbing over anything required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halton's Scotch Block Reservoir was built in 1971. It provides flood control and low flow augmentation in the Sixteen Mile Creek watershed.  For a nice scenic view visit in late spring, summer or fall during daylight hours. The reservoir is home to ducks and Canada Geese. The geese tend to stick around during the winter months and can be heard honking even at night. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are no parking signs along that stretch of road. The two parking coordinates are where the signs end. It's a 200m walk from the north one and a 240m walk from the south one. The road goes down hill slightly from the south parking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please put the cache back exactly where and how you found it. Bring your own pen or pencil.

Found suitable parking and made out way over to the cache. After admiring the complete lack of water in the reservoir, we turned around and spotted the cache right away. I carefully extracted and signed the almost completely full log. Probably room for one or two more signatures. Thanks for the quick find.

Parked north of the cache right beside where ted went into the ditch. Enjoyed the walk to the cache and suprisingly found it right away although it certainly blended in nicely with it's surroundings. Took lots of pictures too and continued on down the road and enjoy the area...in total we did a 1.5km round trip hike from car to cache to further to cache to car...you get the point. 

Anyways, great hide with this one and this is the first time I have ever driven down this road past the Reservour in the past 12 years since I lived here.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The active caches in this series (more to follow)&lt;/i&gt; 

&lt;br /&gt;
If you are an amateur radio operator, each cache contains the
callsign and frequency of a repeater that can be heard from the
cache area, so you can chat with some of the local hams on your way
back to the car, or on your way to the next cache. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a code word and repeater call sign on the first page of
the log book. Save this information if you want to go for the final
later. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Park at N43 34.700, W 079 59.780 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Follow the Vanderleck Bruce Side Trail until you get to N43 34.625,
W079 59.676, at which point the cache is on the left hand side of
the trail (if you approached from the parking co-ordinates). It is
within 35 metres of the trail, and within 200M of the parking
co-ordinates. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you continue down 17th sideroad to Highway 25, you will see the
repeater site for the Milton area. The repeater is at N43 35.410/
W79 59.184. This tower is tall and on a hill - repeaters like that
sort of thing, as it helps to extend their range. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This repeater is used for the Milton and Halton Hills Amateur Radio
Emergency Service. The ARES service is described on the Radio
Amateurs of Canada website: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;ARES is composed of licensed radio amateurs who have
voluntarily registered their qualifications and equipment for
communications duty in the public service, when disaster
strikes.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Basically, they're the people that will be very handy to have
around when the Internet and the phone system fails. ARES members
will typically be sending messages to/from emergency shelters and
other emergency services (Police, Fire, Red Cross) or sending
health and welfare messages (read: &quot;I'm OK Mom!&quot; type messages).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once a year, ARES groups stage a simulated emergency to practice
their skills. Throughout the year, they help out at community
events like marathons, bike races and the Santa Claus parade. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Four L.E.D. October event&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you will need to visit the caches in
the BFL Boot Camp IV series, and obtain the codes from the
logbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 5 code numbers, scattered among 10
geocaches placed for the event. These caches will be activated on
Oct 4, after the event has passed.&lt;/p&gt;

To find the start for the final, add all five codes together then
divide by 5000.  This will give you a value, we will call
“F”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Take all the codes and reverse the digits for each code. Add these
numbers together then divide by 5000, which will give you a value,
we will call “G”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add F to 27.4152.  This is your north
coordinate.&lt;br /&gt;
Add G to 52.4276.  This is your west coordinate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N43 and W79 are assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

proceed here to start the final journey to the L.E.D.

one way to proceed - but there's only one route to the cache&lt;/li&gt;

Was here with the CO one night and it took us forever to find a OK spot.  When we came back to place the reflectors I stumbled upon a GREAT spot just 10 meters from the old one.  Once I managed to get penguin to come over to it we quickly pulled the reflectors from the old spot and moved the final over here.  How did we miss this the first time around???</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">It was already 4am by the time we even got around to starting this one and our team now dwindled down to just Emzernask and myself. The caches we did to get to this point were from CM, Ave, Goss, Dread and KOTH. Had no problems finding the first few reflectors and started following them. We hit several dead ends and some of them more than once. Back tracking I think was the hardest part for us and then trying to locate the reflectors again going backwards. Then after several orange ones, hopefully not all the same that we already found, we chose correctly finally and found our path to the final thankfully. I think we picked every path but one. It was a fun evening and I'll have to get out another time to do the remaining caches in this series as I am really looking forward to all of the creativity on them.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a beautiful spot, complete with a rather large pond and koi
fish. The large bell is actually called &quot;The Friendship Bell&quot;. A
lot of people come here for their wedding photos (the owners of
this cache included). Bring a camera and come early in the day for
the best photos. Be sure to spend some time wandering and enjoying
this place; it is very special to us. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;This park closes at night and is monitored. No night caching
for this one.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 You can reach this cache without stepping on any plants or
otherwise harming the garden. This is a rather busy place with
people milling about enjoying the view in the warmer months. Please
use discretion.&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Back again to this familiar park for another cache. Definately a tough one to find even with the hint. Nozzletime was telling me about this cache earlier in the week and I had the impression that I actually had to stick my hand behind the waterfall...glad I didn't though, although I tried. Tylor enjoyed playing with the water on top of the waterfall...who knows what mischief he was up to...while Ellesche and I searched for the cache. Eventually spotted it after quite a bit of searching. Pretty easy to see if you look right at it from the right direction, as I looked in that very spot a few times until spotting it, but usually closer to the ground.

Luckily the park was pretty much deserted too, except for 2 people walking towards the pond, but they quickly changed direction and went elsewhere when they saw us.</groundspeak:text>

Permission was granted but security may stop if they are not sure
what you are doing. I find it is always good to be prepared to
answer a few questions about geocaching.

It is a long-lived oak of the Fagaceae family, native to eastern North America and found from southern Quebec west to eastern Minnesota and south to northern Florida and eastern Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Normally not a very tall tree, typically reaching 65–85 feet (19.5-25.5 m) at maturity, it nonetheless becomes quite massive and its lower branches are apt to extend far out laterally, parallel to the ground. The tallest known white oak is 144 feet (43 m) tall. It is not unusual for a white oak tree to be as wide as it is tall, but specimens growing at high altitudes may only become small shrubs. White oaks have been known to live up to six hundred years. The bark is a light ash-gray and peels somewhat from the top, bottom and/or sides.</groundspeak:long_description>

Quercus, native to North America in the eastern and midwestern United States and south-central Canada. This plant is also called Mossycup oak and Mossycup white oak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It occurs from the Appalachian Mountains west to the middle of the Great Plains, extending to central Texas, across southernmost Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, east to the Atlantic Coast in southern New Brunswick and down the coast to Delaware. Bur Oak is the state tree of Iowa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a large deciduous tree growing up to 30 m (100 ft), rarely 37 m (120 ft), in height, and is one of the most massive oaks with a trunk diameter of up to 3 m (10 ft); reports of taller trees occur, but have not been verified. It is one of slowest-growing oaks, with growth rate of 30 cm (1 ft) per year when young. A 20-year-old tree will be about 6 m (20 ft) tall. It commonly lives to be 200 to 300 years old, and may live up to 400 years. [1] The bark is a medium gray and somewhat rugged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The leaves are 7–15 cm (3–6 in) long and 5–13 cm (2–5 in) broad, variable in shape, with a lobed margin. Most often, the basal 60% is narrower and deeply lobed, while the apical 40% is wider and has shallow lobes or large teeth. The flowers are greenish-yellow catkins, produced in the spring. The acorns are very large, 2–5 cm (0.8–2 in) long and 2–4 cm (0.8-1.5 in) broad, with a large cup that wraps much of the way around the nut, with large overlapping scales and often a fringe at the edge of the cup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bur Oak is sometimes confused with Overcup oak and White oak, both of which it occasionally hybridizes with.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is letterbox-hybrid cache - you'll find it at the posted coordinates. Make sure to bring along your own personal stamp for the logbook. The caches in this series are on a 4-5km trail loop that can be accessed from 15 or 17 Side Road (I personally recommend 15 Side Road). Sadly this forest doesn't contain many oaks but if you keep your eyes peeled you'll see one in the distance or the leaf from an oak on the path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;******************************************************&lt;br/&gt;******************************************************&lt;br/&gt;DO NOT remove the ink pad or hand-carved stamp from the cache. They are not to be traded.&lt;br/&gt;******************************************************&lt;br/&gt;******************************************************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quercus rubra, commonly called northern red oak or champion oak, (syn. Quercus borealis), is an oak in the red oak group (Quercus section Lobatae). It is a native of North America, in the northeastern United States and southeast Canada. It grows from the north end of the Great Lakes, east to Nova Scotia, south as far as Georgia and states with good soil that is slightly acidic. Often simply called &quot;red oak&quot;, northern red oak is formally so named to distinguish it from southern red oak (Q. falcata), also known as the Spanish oak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In forests, the northern red oak grows straight and tall, to 28 m (90 ft), exceptionally to 43 m (140 ft) tall, with a trunk of up to 50-100 cm (20-40 in) diameter. Open-grown trees do not get so tall, but can develop a stouter trunk, up to 2 m (6 ft) in diameter. It has stout branches growing at right angles to the stem, forming a narrow round-topped head. It grows rapidly and is tolerant of many soils and varied situations, although it prefers the glacial drift and well-drained borders of streams.[2] It is frequently a part of the canopy in an oak-heath forest, but generally not as important as some other oaks.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I've been wanting to hide a cache in here for a very long time, and
I finally got my chance during the Bruce Club Hike Event (GCZZZ0).
I particularly liked this section of the hike which features some
lovely evergreens, and there are little ponds and creeks scattered
all over the place. You'll get the best hike if you park along 15th
Sideroad instead of taking the smash-n-grab approach from 17th SR.
I strongly recommend you stick to the Bruce Trail, or one of the
Side Trails to access this cache. It is surrounded by very pretty
creeks and ponds. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Speyside Side Trail interects with the Main Trail, leading to
the impression that there are trails everywhere here! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trail conditions can be a little muddy during the spring thaw.
Cache container is a small rubbermaid container. You should bring
something to write with. &lt;br /&gt;

As I was getting out of the Jeep a couple of other Jeeps were coming out of the 17th sideroad road allowance.  Wonder if they tried going through the giant lake I found in the middle of the road allowance later on.

Enjoyed the hike and the great scenery.  Lots of water everywhere.  Muddy in spots.  Walked right past the cache without noticing it.  Doh!  A helpful hint from the CO proved how blind I can be sometimes.

Tylor and I went in off of 17th Sideroad, but it was still quite the walk to the cache. It was a cool day, but despite that, the mosquitos were out, but only got 1 bite and it didn't live to tell about it. Lots of water and puddles on the trails today and it brought back some memories of the hike. Took about 20 minutes to find the cache and I could never get the GPS to get before 3m and it usually said 10+ meters away. Had to resort to the hint after awhile, and the hint made me think it was some kind of sneaky hide, but then once I read the description more closely and thought about the hint, I guessed right as to what it meant and then spotted it as I got deeper. Container had some water in it, which we emptied out, but everything inside was nice and dry. Took the other trail out to make a nice loop. Thanks for the very enjoyable hike we had today and seeing parts of the Bruce Trail that we have not visited too often...Before geocaching, Tylor and I actually got lost in these woods for 2 hours and that is what prompted me to buy a GPS and also how I found out about geocaching.

As we got to where we parked, there were 3 jeeps there, and one had one of it's wheels on top of one of the large boulders blocking the trail. Not sure if they were trying to drive onto the trail or just taking some pomorotional videos as 2 of the guys had video cameras with them and on the side of 2 of the jeeps it said something like Overland Adventures or something like that.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Locating the cache&lt;br/&gt;This is letterbox-hybrid cache - you'll find it at the posted coordinates. Make sure to bring along your own personal stamp for the logbook. The caches in this series are on a 4-5km trail loop that can be accessed from 15 or 17 Side Road (I personally recommend 15 Side Road). Sadly this forest doesn't contain many oaks but if you keep your eyes peeled you'll see one in the distance or the leaf from an oak on the path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**************************************************&lt;br/&gt;**************************************************&lt;br/&gt;DO NOT remove the ink pad or hand-carved stamp from the cache. They are not to be traded.&lt;br/&gt;**************************************************&lt;br/&gt;**************************************************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pin Oak (Quercus palustris)&lt;br/&gt;From Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Pin oak] is native to North America, mainly in the eastern United States from Connecticut west to eastern Kansas, and south to Georgia but not Florida, across to eastern Oklahoma; it is also native in the extreme south of Ontario, Canada. The Pin Oak is also well adapted to life in Australia (where it has been introduced) and is quite widespread across the Australian continent especially in the cooler southern States such as Victoria and New South Wales. Is also well adapted to life in Argentina especially in the Río de la Plata region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing to 100+ ft tall, with a trunk up to 1 m (3 ft) diameter. It has an 8-14 m (25-45 ft) spread. A 10-year-old tree will be about 8 m (25 ft) tall. The crown is broad conic when young, with numerous small branches radiating out from a central leader. When older, some upper branches become quite large and the central leader is lost, while the lower branches gradually droop downwards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The leaves are 5-16 cm long and 5-12 cm broad, lobed, with five or seven lobes. Each lobe has 5-7 bristle-tipped teeth. The sinuses are typically u-shaped and extremely deep cut. In fact, there is approximately the same amount of sinus area as actual leaf area. The leaf is mostly hairless, except for a very characteristic tuft of pale orange-brown down on the lower surface where each lobe vein joins the central vein. Overall autumn leaf coloration is generally bronze, though individual leaves may be red for a time. The acorns, borne in a shallow, thin cap, are hemispherical, 10-16 mm long and 9-15 mm broad, green maturing pale brown about 18 months after pollination. The acorn is unpalatable because the kernel is very bitter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The species usually lives only 90 to 120 years. It is naturally a wetland tree, and develops a shallow, fibrous root system, unlike many oaks, which have a strong, deep taproot when young. It is confined to acidic soils, and does not tolerate limestone or sandy Florida soil, and grows at low altitudes from sea level up to 350 m. The specific name palustris means &quot;of swamps&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A characteristic shared by a few other oak species, and also some beeches and hornbeams, is the retention of leaves through the winter on juvenile tissue. Young trees under 6 m (20 ft) will often be covered with leaves year-round, though the leaves die in the fall, remaining attached to the shoots until the new leaves appear in the spring. As with many other oak species, dead Pin oak branches will stay on the tree for many years.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A miniature version of the classic &quot;A Cache A Day&quot;
Challenge. This challenge cache is one of a series of 12 challenges
focused on finding a cache on every day for a specified month. All
caches in this series have been placed by members of the Golden Horseshoe Monthly Geocaching
Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache IS at the posted coords. You may not
claim a find on this cache until you have met the requirements of
this Challenge cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rules
Summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find and log (at least) one
cache for every day of the month specified on this mini
challenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finds do not need to be during the
same year. I.e., your qualifying find for October 1 may be from
2008, for October 2 from the present year, for October 3 from 2004,
and so on. As long as at some point in your caching career you
found a cache on every day of the specified month.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;All past, present and future finds
count.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;No editing logs or logging your finds
on a different day. The day you physically found the cache is the
day you write your found it log as. Of course just like with
everything to do with geocaching, you are on the honour
system.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Provide some kind of list, chart,
bookmark, etc as proof of completing the challenge portion of this
cache. You may find the calendar on this link
useful.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please try the other caches placed as part
of the GHMGC A Cache A Day - Mini Challenge

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is hidden on the Brown Property section of the Bruce
Trail. It is a great section of the trail to hike, with a wonderful
forest and two wetland areas. Be sure to check out the new side
trail just west of the cache. The trail is not particularly
challenging to hike - it's generally level terrain, but it could
pose a problem for strollers. Bikes are not recommended on the
Bruce Trail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Rock wall on the north side of the trail. Head to the west side, about 5 feet above the trail in a crevase that is not visible from the trail.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

We decided to approach from 4th Line this time. No problems finding the cache as there were footprints from 2 days ago leading right up to it. Getting it out and putting it back required some bending and twisting since there was a baby attached to me and I couldn't lean over onto the rocks. Below are the dates used to meet this challenge...This is the first in this series that I am logging.

&lt;br /&gt;
An easy hike along a new side trail in Speyside. The trail is
accessed off the main trail, about 500 meters east of the Third
Line road allowance. You can expect the shortest approach to be
about 1.2km for a round trip.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will see a couple wetlands in the area, and the trail gets
rockier as you leave the main trail. As you are hiking, take note
of the small valleys that form on either side of the trail. This
will be a fantastic trail to hike in Autumn.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
To find the cache, follow the Blue Blazed side trail - if you are
hiking northbound, the erratic is on the left hand side of the
trail, about 200 metres from the main trail. The cache is tucked
underneath this lonely boulder. The cache is a medium sized
rubbermaid container. While you are here, sit quietly for a bit and
listen to the birds in the trees, or the frogs off in the
wetlands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Take your time, and enjoy this quiet landscape

Another quick find, could see it before we even got there. The contents are quite wet, I guess the seal in the lid doesn't function properly or maybe a baggie got caught out in it at some point. Not sure how that camera is holding up.

This time we decided to come in from 4th Line. After doing your nearby challenge cache, we continued on and totally missed the side trail as the start of it wasn't really marked yet. Once we found the trail (we were just on it a couple weeks ago) it was easy to find the erratic and no problems finding the cache either. I was worried that it might be buried in snow, but that definitely wasn't the case. Left a Penguin TB.

Thanks for a couple of enjoyable caches.</groundspeak:text>

&quot;Hey what are those two up to?&quot;
&quot;Dunno, but I guess those idiots dont think we can see them behind the vines&quot;
&quot;Ok let's check this out&quot;
&quot; What are you doing?&quot;
 That's when we had to explain geocaching. Now we just hand them a card and keep looking. We were told  that the side of the fence we were on is private property. They waited while we drove around just to see if we could  find the cache. Found it right away and talked with the cops while we signed us and them into the cache.Always fun explaining geocaching to the cops.My favorites include being surrounded by four cruisers in Buffalo and tellling the cop that the reason we were caching in the U.S. was because we found them all in Canada. Or a about a dozen cachers neaby looking for a cache and a cop pulls up and asks why all those people were on the bridge and Goju's reply was &quot;mass suicide&quot; he just laughed.
Thanks for the fun.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A fairly easy cache to find, however may be considerably harder to
retrieve due to muggle activity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be sure to use stealth and replace the cache so that it
does not slip under too far to retrieve and that it is hidden using
natural camo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache may or may not be available during the winter months,
depending on the amount of snow and/or ice build up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is a 1 litre round lock and lock.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a several other caches spread across the islands, for you
to find as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF: The cost of your ferry ride to the islands awaits you in
this cache.&lt;br /&gt;

The lid is damaged and there was a [b]lot[/b] of dirty, stinky water inside the cache. Everything was soaked, luckily the log was only moderately moist and so still usable. We moved the two TBs into drier realms. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

Wake Up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Follow the white rabbit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What is the Illuminatrix? Follow the white rabbit to find your
answer. Once you find the rabbit's den you will choose - you can
stay in Wonderland, wake up in your bed and believe whatever you
want to believe - or you can see how far down this rabbit hole
goes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
About this geocache. This is a night cache, you will require a
flashlight – preferably a smaller one, like a headlamp. This
cache is not optimized for a large “BFL” - you'll have
the best results with a flashlight that's bright and about one inch
across the lens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the posted co-ordinates, you will arrive at a trailhead for a
Bruce Trail Side Trail. You will find the White Rabbit's trail on
the west side. Parking is along the road. DO NOT block, or walk up
the nearby driveways. These driveways are private property –
please respect the individuals that live near here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please remember to get the code you need from the final for this
cache if you will be pursuing GC2G0NA: BFL Boot Camp V :: Tachyonic

Cache plays out as follows:

Arrive at posted co-ords - white reflector trail leads cacher to ammo can with two laminated cards. One has co-ords to parking area (blue pill) and the other leads to Stage 3 (red pill).

Stage 3 - ammo can with the &quot;Illuminatrix Device&quot; where cachers calculate the location of the final. 

Final as mentioned above.</groundspeak:long_description>

Stage 2, is very cool and difficult if you don't read the instructions. After signing the cache we headed back to the command center.

One of the things we discovered we decided to ignore for now, but would check on later. We had a good understanding of what we had to do and it was just a matter of getting it to work out and give us coords that seemed plausible. We kept getting an extra light for the west I think it was, but we tried a few numbers, expanded our search a bit to places that made sense and came up with the find with enough eyes searching. In the end round trip was only about an hour. I can see that this cache is not for the average cacher or even average person, as it definitely introduces one to some new concepts.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Geopuzzle Project&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
by res2100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How it works&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I provide the blank hexagon puzzle pieces. You get one and decorate
it however you want, including your geocaching username. Return the
puzzle piece to me in person, by mail, or drop it into the
Geopuzzle Project - Hexagon Dropoff cache. All of the completed
hexagons will be put together to form one giant puzzle mosaic.
Pictures will be posted to show the progress as the puzzle
grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Puzzle Pieces&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The puzzle pieces are hexagon shaped. A hexagon is a 6-sided
figure. Each side is 2 inches in length. I have cut them from
thicker paper stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What can I put on my puzzle piece?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Personalize it however you want.&lt;br /&gt;
Draw something by hand.&lt;br /&gt;
Design something on the computer and print it out to fit the puzzle
piece.&lt;br /&gt;
Design something on the computer using one of the templates and
email it to me.&lt;br /&gt;
It could be something geocaching related or something that is of
interest to you.&lt;br /&gt;
Make sure you include your geocaching username somewhere on it
too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where can I get a blank puzzle piece?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
From the Geopuzzle Project -
Hexagon Pickup cache at N 43° 38.167 W 079° 53.904.&lt;br /&gt;
From me directly.&lt;br /&gt;
I can also send you the hexagon puzzle piece template through
email.&lt;br /&gt;
Randomly inserted into other geocaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I return the completed puzzle piece to you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Leave it in the Geopuzzle
Project - Hexagon Dropoff cache.&lt;br /&gt;
Return it to me in person.&lt;br /&gt;
Mail it to me (ask me for my mailing address).&lt;br /&gt;
If you created your puzzle piece on the computer using the template
I provide, you can email it to me and I will print it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Geopuzzle Project Website&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Geopuzzle Project -
Hexagon Pickup cache contains some letters in the
maple leaf of the log book. These letters are needed in order to
figure out the location of the Geopuzzle Project - Hexagon Dropoff cache. Optionally and to take part in the fun, at the Geopuzzle Project - Hexagon Dropoff you should to take home and decorate one of the hexagon
puzzle pieces if you haven't done so already and deposit it into
the cache. Your completed puzzle piece may serve as your log.&lt;/p&gt;





In order to find this cache, you will need to obtain the
letters located within the maple leaf of the cover of the log book
from the Geopuzzle Project -
Hexagon Pickup cache. Take the associated values of
these letter and add them together, then subtract 900 and then add
the result to the decimal minutes of both the North and West of the
posted coords in order to locate this cache and deposit your
hexagon puzzle piece.&lt;br /&gt;
You can find parking at the posted coords.

Yes signing the log is enough. Decorating a hexagon piece is optional and I have updated the description to add appropriate wording. Can you point me to the link where it mentions this guideline though so I have it for future reference as it is not in the guidelines that is linked when creating a new cache.
I wonder why opencaching does not save my reviewer notes or certain updates some of the time.</groundspeak:long_description>

It replaced a log church built in 1821. Another&lt;br /&gt;surviving building that is a remnant of Britannia is the&lt;br /&gt;schoolhouse further south on Hurontario.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Geopuzzle Project&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;by res2100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How it works&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I provide the blank hexagon puzzle pieces. You get one and decorate
it however you want, including your geocaching username. Return the
puzzle piece to me in person, by mail, or drop it into the
Geopuzzle Project - Hexagon Dropoff cache. All of the completed
hexagons will be put together to form one giant puzzle mosaic.
Pictures will be posted to show the progress as the puzzle
grows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Puzzle Pieces&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The puzzle pieces are hexagon shaped. A hexagon is a 6-sided
figure. Each side is 2 inches in length. I have cut them from
thicker paper stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What can I put on my puzzle piece?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Personalize it however you want.&lt;br /&gt;
Draw something by hand.&lt;br /&gt;
Design something on the computer and print it out to fit the puzzle
piece.&lt;br /&gt;
Design something on the computer using one of the templates and
email it to me.&lt;br /&gt;
It could be something geocaching related or something that is of
interest to you.&lt;br /&gt;
Make sure you include your geocaching username somewhere on it
too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where can I get a blank puzzle piece?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
From the Geopuzzle Project -
Hexagon Pickup cache at N 43° 38.167 W 079° 53.904.&lt;br /&gt;
From me directly.&lt;br /&gt;
I can also send you the hexagon puzzle piece template through
email.&lt;br /&gt;
You can download a hexagon puzzle piece template from the website
indicated below.&lt;br /&gt;
Randomly inserted into other geocaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I return the completed puzzle piece to you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Leave it in the Geopuzzle
Project - Hexagon Dropoff cache.&lt;br /&gt;
Return it to me in person.&lt;br /&gt;
Mail it to me (ask me for my mailing address).&lt;br /&gt;
If you created your puzzle piece on the computer using the template
I provide, you can email it to me and I will print it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Geopuzzle Project Website&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
http://geocaching2100.bravehost.com/geopuzzle/geopuzzle.htm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Geopuzzle Project -
Hexagon Pickup cache contains some letters in the
maple leaf of the log book. These letters are needed in order to
figure out the location of the Geopuzzle Project - Hexagon Dropoff cache. &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I think we hiked over 6km today, and the mukluks worked perfect! Warm feet the entire way. Walked right past the cache and only noticed it was there while checking the topo map on the GPS. We hiked back and made a quick find. Elf and I took the last 2 hexagons, so you might want to drop a few more in soon. Spike didn't really care, (like normal) and kept looking for good snowball snow. We continued on our way, enjoying the perfect day! Thanks for the hide.

3&lt;br /&gt;
(Ontario Mini-Fizzy 9 Challenge)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A miniature version of the classic 81 &quot;Fizzy&quot; Challenge. This
challenge cache is one of a series of nine mini-fizzy challenges
focused on a specific difficulty level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache IS at the posted coords. You
may not claim a find on this cache until you have met the
requirements of this Challenge cache. This actual physical cache
has a Difficulty/Terrain rating of 3/1.5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original idea for this cache came
from &lt;b&gt;GC1MCZZ - Five Fives (Eatonville Mini-Fizzy Challenge) by
K2D2&lt;/b&gt; and is also based on &lt;b&gt;GC11E8N - Well Rounded Cacher (The
Fizzy Challenge) by Kealia&lt;/b&gt; in honour of the cacher
&lt;b&gt;FizzyMagic&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &quot;Challenge Cache&quot; and hence must
meet all of the Groundspeak guidelines in regards to a Challenge
Cache. In order to log this &quot;Difficulty 3&quot; Mini-Fizzy Challenge
cache as a find, you MUST find nine separate Difficulty 3 caches.
Each of the nine caches must have a different Terrain rating from 1
to 5. In order to level the playing field, only caches which you
have found AFTER the publication of this cache will qualify towards
this Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rules Summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;All 9 caches must have a Difficulty
rating of 3.0.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Each of the 9 caches must have a
different Terrain rating.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Only new finds, found on or after
September 9, 2009 (09/09/09), will qualify for this
challenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Each of the 9 caches must have a
different cache owner.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are a premium member, you
should create a public Bookmark which includes your caching name in
the title. It must also include the 9 qualifying caches that you
have found which meet the requirements of this challenge. You
should then link your Bookmark to the cache page. In the comments
field of each of the caches in the Bookmark, state the Terrain
rating of the cache along with the date that you found the cache
on. Alternatively, if you are not a premium member, in your Found
It log, please include the 9 qualifying cache names, GC codes,
Terrain ratings and dates for when you found each of the 9
qualifying caches.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;This Challenge cache can not be used
as one of the qualifying caches.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find this physical cache and sign the
log book after you have met the requirements of this
cache.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are unsure of any of the rules
or requirements for logging this cache as a find, please feel free
to ask one of the nine participants.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**As an optional extra
Challenge, see if you can find 9 different cache types to represent
your 9 qualifying caches for this Challenge Cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please try the other caches placed as part of the Ontario
Mini-Fizzy Challenge series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This is the 4th closest unfound cache from home for me, so it was nice to finally get it. I don't remember this part of the Bruce trail being here. Cache was well hidden and took us a bit of searching to find it. The coords were right on. Below ar emy qualifying caches.

The terrain got a bit more hilly, but that was OK. I like the fact there were no bugs,  this is a good time to be on the Bruce. Once we got to GZ it was a quick find. There was a child's sandbox toy near GZ, I wonder what that was about?

We started along the Bruce Trail, but with 190m to go the trail went in a different direction so we continued to follow it for another 100m or so, but we kept getting further away, so we backtracked and took the other trail straight to it. Nice east find and that sure is one big birth tree that you found here. 

Back in Limehouse CA, they were clearing the trees and shrubbery around the large draw kiln and restoration work will start on it soon. I am surprised however that a conservation authority would actually cut down perfectly healthy trees.

After noticing some likely cachers wander past the house, I snuck outside to see if I missed them find the cache. Nope, no logs yet today... Back in I go. Minutes later, they return (likely after reading the cache description) and make the approach. Elf was off like a shot, but forgot to bring along the camera. I was soon to follow. It is always fun to meet cachers at the cache. Today I figured I'd finally sign the book. So yes, I officially found the cache today at 15:20h accompanied by Elf.

Guess I better shovel a path to the cache through the snow this winter... or maybe just raise the terrain rating! Photos of the logbook will be posted soon. Thanks everyone for visiting. Your favourite points really show how much you enjoyed yourselves. It makes all our hard work worth it!

Had we not known who lived here, seen the smiley balloon and the TOMTEC license plate in the driveway, would never have had the nerve to attempt it. Found the cache and as we were signing the logbook, the cache owners arrived on the scene, including Elf, the finder and keeper of lost socks! To the sounds of &quot;Reunited&quot;, LadyJaime's socks were a pair once more. LJ then traded a couple packs of soothers ('cause those are for sucky babies) for a little pair of baby hiking shoes, and off we went to the BFL so the Rainbow Connection could continue their Hallowe'en costume preparations. Nice to meet you both and thanks for the amazing cache! </groundspeak:text>

Started with this one after dinner. As we drove up we could see the cache owners darting around the inside of their house, probably in excitement of getting visitors. We had the pleasure of meeting all 3 of the Treehouse Gang that live here. On we ventured into the great unknown, and saw many good hiding spots, but the bunny gave it away. I think this is most largest cache I have ever seen. Opened the container and my 2 year old daughter was eager to venture in. She seemed to be intrigued by the 2 badminton rackets. However in the end we decided to trade for the premade camo cache container which we know we will put to good use very soon and left an Orange shirt, since we know the cache owners love orange shirts. I think the cache also must hold a record for the most trade items and very well sorted by type. I am sure there must have been atleast a thousand items to trade in there. We might just have to come back to trade some more, which I am sure our daughter would love to do. Or maybe find some large TBs to leave in the cache. Had a nice chat with the cache owners and then continued on to Norval. Thanks for the unique and memorable cache and experience. And I wonder what you will do with Money in the freezor.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just love driving around in the country. There's less traffic,
fewer stop lights, nicer scenery and cleaner air than in the city.
Sometimes it's about finding a great spot. Other times it's more
about getting there than the destination. That's what this series
is about, an excuse to get away from the hustle and bustle of the
city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scenic spot near a small creek. Just to the south is Limehouse
which has a neat single lane bridge.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Searched and searched, but just couldn't find the cache. As I stepped off the rock wall I banged my knee on it as I landed on round rock. Found an interesting &quot;thing&quot;...not really sure what it is or what it's used for...some kind of metal sled\vehicle in the ditch on the opposite side of the road from the cache. Continued the search and looked over every bit of the guard rail and still nothing. Went back to the car and got my wife's GPS while she gave TK her bottle and continued searching. My wife's GPS zeroed right on the spot and mine was close. Eventually, just by luck I suppose, I finally found it after 20-30 minutes of searching. Honestly, I should have found it in the first minute as I really don't know how I or anyone could miss the container even with the camo on it. Well done. Left something special in it for another cache.</groundspeak:text>

This came up on the radar on the way out, and I needed a cache-a-day square filled in, so parked the car within a metre or so and got to searching. Within seconds I was nose to nose with a hornet climbing out of it's nest in one of the bridge railings - yipes! Backed away, and wondered why Avernar would put one so close to a nest like that. After a couple minutes of pondering, I decided Avernar wouldn't do that so I tried a different approach and voila! Tupperwhere! 

Taking a few minutes while logging, I notice the creek is rather scenic here. Nice. Makes up for the hornets. I think.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The tiny hamlet of Hanlan was named for the famous oarsman Ned&lt;br /&gt;Hanlan, whose name also adorns a certain clothing-optional beach in&lt;br /&gt;the Toronto Islands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The settlement's first postmaster was George Johnson, who is said&lt;br /&gt;to have chosen the name Hanlan because it was short and easy to&lt;br /&gt;remember. George Johnson was the son of blacksmith D.W. Johnson who&lt;br /&gt;built his shop at the corner of Tomken and Britannia in the&lt;br /&gt;1830's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Methodist settlers living in the area originally travelled to Derry&lt;br /&gt;West to make use of Carter's Anglican Chapel. Sometime in 1840, the&lt;br /&gt;Anglican congregation no longer allowed the Methodists to use their&lt;br /&gt;space, so a new church was built where the southeast corner of&lt;br /&gt;Dixie and Britannia can now be found. Hunt's Chapel, named for the&lt;br /&gt;original owners of the land sold to the Methodists, lasted until&lt;br /&gt;1867, when it was replaced by a larger building and renamed Trinity&lt;br /&gt;Wesleyan Methodist Church. This latter church closed in 1925.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that remains of the hamlet of Hanlan is the Trinity Wesleyan&lt;br /&gt;Methodist cemetery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;To find the cache:&lt;/b&gt; Go to the posted coordinates. Look for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Baldock&lt;/b&gt;. You need two pieces of information: where was&lt;br /&gt;Thomas when he died (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;) and how old was he when he passed&lt;br /&gt;(&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;London, England (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;=279)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calgary, Alberta (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;=289)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;North Bay, Ontario (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;=299)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take the correct value for &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; and add it to &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;. Divide&lt;br /&gt;the total by 1000 and add it to this North coordinate to get the&lt;br /&gt;North coordinate of the final location:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;N 43 39.000&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now look for &lt;b&gt;Garbutt&lt;/b&gt; (west of Baldock).

for a GO Station to have.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 If you look around here, you should find a marker for the
   
Canadian Gravity Standardization Net, which is a type of
Geodetic Survey marker. Your first step will be to find the marker,
and also the three digit number contained on it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 This will be a fun job for you if you come during rush hour, or on
a Tuesday night (the marker can be blocked on Tuesday nights).
Watch as the muggles try to figure out what on earth you are
doing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 When you have the number, divide it by 1000 and add it to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 N 43 38.704&lt;br /&gt;
W 079 54.617&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The result will lead you to the micro. Please try to be discreet
lest the cache get muggled. You will need to bring some form of pen
or pencil, as the container is way too small to facilitate one of
these. &lt;br /&gt;

We started it back on January 2, 2012, but the snow clearing crews were not kind to us, and the final was beyond reach. With our current &quot;winter&quot; weather, we figured the cache would be accessible again in a few days... and we were right! Snuck by tonight while the station was deserted and made the find... but not without requiring a fair bit of contortion to reach it. Thanks for the re-find!

A few weeks ago I walked over after a family &quot;do&quot; and got the first stage. I had trouble reading the last digit of the number, so I was a bit off for the final. I looked around a bit but did not find it. I walked back to the house, and on the way home drove over and got out the BFL to get the number exactly. Just as I got back to the car, the heavens opened up with a huge rain storm, so I did not attempt the final that day. Today, we had dinner at the brother in laws, and headed over to the cache on the way home. Today it was a quick find, I think I had even looked there the first time and missed it. I grabbed the cache and took it into the car to sign. The train was due soon, so there were a few muggles around the station. Just after I got into the car, a group of teen muggles decided to sit around the cache site for a while. We drove to the other side of the lot, to look like we were waiting for the train. After about 10 minutes the muggles finally left, and I could get the cache back in place unseen. 

So all in all an interesting cache.

The co-ords sent us to a nearby trail a couple of hundred meters north of the tracks. Everything seemed okay until the GPS  was pointing to what we figure would be someones living room in a house off the trail. Went back to make sure I took the number down correctly. Fastest way back was via the tunnel at the station. Fell down the stairs. Checked the clue...correct. Used the calculator again. Got the same coords as last time.Hmmm.  Checked the math. Looked at the calculator again and realized it had a burned out section of LED. Went back, via the stairs to the car on the other side of the tracks, drove back around to the correct spot and had the cache in hand in a few minutes.
Thanks for the &quot;quick&quot; multi.</groundspeak:text>

This is a little spot I've known about for years. It's a hidden gem
in the middle of Georgetown's industrial section. As you drive down
Armstrong Avenue, you will see a bunch of depressing factories and
a dirty recycling depot. But as you pass the intersection at
Sinclair an Oasis appears, briefly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you visit in Autumn, and you're a &quot;Leaf Peeper&quot;, you'll find the
location particularly enjoyable. You can park your car on the north
side of Armstrong, and wander back toward the cache. The cache is
on a slope that overlooks the Credit River Valley, and the Credit
Valley Footpath. This area is a very steep valley, that is almost a
gorge in parts. It's flanked with a combination Carolinean / Great
Lakes - St. Lawrence forest system and looks stunning during
September/October.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located a short distance down the slope. It is larger
than a film canister but still qualifies as a micro. Please take
care getting to the cache as the slope drops off rather suddenly
after the cache location. There a few good spots to sit down and
take in the view.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Look for a geocaching.com georock tucked under one of the concrete slabs. Pick the slabs that are higher up on the hill to check.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Visited a couple other stores at the mall and then as the sun was setting we decided to grab this cache. Even convinced the boy to come along. Spent some time scrambling around eliminating spot after spot and then having fun hurling some rocks down the hill, listening to the thump, thud, boink and to see if it would make a splash at the bottom. That was becoming fun, but we still had the cache to find. There were so many possibilities of where this cache could be hidden. One more toss...wait no not that one, unless I wanted the wrath of a penguin on me. Hid it nicely back as we found it and decided on no more tossing rocks down the hill. I bet this will be a nice place to see the fall colours. I did have the urge to go down to the river to do some exploring but that would have to wait until another day.</groundspeak:text>

a hide. Co-ords may stray a little if you are too close to the
building.
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a camo'd pill bottle with room for small items and
is starting out with a USB Air Ionizer for the FTF and a travel bug
too. This would be fun to do at night if you are into spooky night
caches.&lt;/p&gt;

This is just a fun, easy cache for when you need a good warm up on your way to the harder ones.

The cache is a bison tube with just a log inside, so please bring a pen/pencil and possibly tweezers access the log.  

Parking will be tricky here if you are going to try parking close, especially during the day, but there is additional parking about 250 feet away.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The active caches in this series (more to follow)&lt;/i&gt; 

&lt;br /&gt;
If you are an amateur radio operator, each cache contains the
callsign and frequency of a repeater that can be heard from the
cache area, so you can chat with some of the local hams on your way
back to the car, or on your way to the next cache. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a code word and repeater call sign on the first page of
the log book. Save this information if you want to go for the final
later. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bring a writing instrument (pen, pencil) as the geocache container
does not have one inside. This cache may not be easily accessible
if there is a lot of deep snow in the area. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Park at 43 40.667 / 079 59.301&lt;br /&gt;
If you look up the hill from the parking, you will see the repeater
site for the Halton Hills area. Follow the Bruce Trail to access
the geocache. The cache is within a few metres of the trail. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Radio Spectrum Services Center is within 10 kilometers (at 43
39.239 / 080 03.618 ), on 32 sideroad. This is one of the places
that Industry Canada uses to monitor radio frequency use in the
Greater Toronto Area. I guarantee they can hear that conversation
you just had on FRS channel 2, but they probably didn't pay any
attention to it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Decided to do some caches in the local area today and this one was the closest to home. This was the first one of 3 for today with Tylor and Ellesche. Before we left today I decided to grab my trusty cache extraction tool (weed remover thingy for the garden, which has never been used for the garden, just for winter caching), figuring it may come in handy and sure enough it did on a couple caches today. It was a very cold day, but luckily there was no wind and it was an easy walk to the cache. There was a lone set of fresh foot prints along the trail, so we were guessing someone was there earlier today, but the foot prints just continued past the cache site. Definately a tough one to find. GPS luckily took us to the right spot and spent about 15 minutes poking and digging through the frozen snow in various spots. Next spot and I hear a strange thud as I was poking with the cache extraction tool. Yup it was the cache and managed to free it from it's icy tomb. Definately a tough one in the winter, but the Satellite Gods were with for all 3 caches us today. on to the next one in the series.</groundspeak:text>

It's small camouflaged, 2-way&lt;br /&gt;locking type tupperware container. It is off the ground so the hide&lt;br /&gt;itself is winter-friendly.

Found the cache without much difficulty.  Keith bonked his head ducking under a fallen tree on the way back.  He didn't see the second fallen tree right after it.  He ended up with just a bump so it wasn't that bad.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a true 5/5 cache. You will need a motor boat to access the final which is a considerable distance from the posted coordinates. You will also be visiting the shipwreck of the Alexandria that is featured in the cache description. You should be an experienced Scuba Diver. This cache may require multiple visits to complete. You are responsible for getting all certifications, permissions and papers which may be needed in order to complete this cache. The final will probably be frozen in ice during the winter. There is nothing at all special about the container at the final and there are no trade items in it. As for the Alexandria, I first found out about it because of geocaching many many years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALEXANDRIA Side wheel steamer, ran ashore in a storm on Lake Ontario August 3, 1915 at Scarborough Bluffs, Lake Ontario, and became a total loss.&lt;br/&gt;The Marine Review, February 1916&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. . . . .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HEROIC WORK SAVED CREW OF &quot; ALEX&quot;&lt;br/&gt;At 2 o'clock Wednesday morning, August 4, 1915, Captain William Bloomfield was the last man to leave the meager wreckage of the well known Picton steamer ALEXANDRIA.&lt;br/&gt;The &quot;ALEX&quot; as she was familiarly called in Picton, came to grief late Tuesday afternoon, August 3, off Scarborough Heights about 12 miles east of Toronto.&lt;br/&gt;The Toronto Globe of August 4, 1915, gives the following story: &quot;Battling hopelessly with the terrific storm that swept Lake Ontario, the stout steamer ALEXANDRIA of the Canada Steamship Lines was driven ashore at Scarborough Heights late yesterday afternoon. She was bound from Montreal to Toronto.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Twenty-two of her crew were saved in a thrilling and dramatic manner during the darkness of last night. Wheelsman Frank Twaddle, Sam Schriver and Alex Boy of Picton were among those rescued.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;The wreckage is lying in the breakers 200 yards out from the Scarborough Cliffs, almost opposite the terminus of the Markham Road.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Early distress signals brought scores of farmers, and radial railway employees to the top of the 50 foot cliff, but they had no means of reaching the pounding vessel. The surf was running too high to permit the launching of any small craft. Messages were rushed to Toronto and other points, and the local staff of the company, crews from the life-saving station and other agencies for aid were hurried to the scene.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;When they arrived, however, the position of the stricken vessel grew more perilous. Putting on life-belts the sailors jumped from wet decks, and set out through the breakers for shore. Their battle for life was a terrible one, even the strongest swimmers being tossed about helplessly at the time. But headway was made.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Meantime the men on the shore were preparing to do their share. They scrambled down the high and treacherous embankment and waded out into the surf. Desperately fighting the wild waves to retain their footing and the forming of chain by the holding of hands, they seized the sailors one by one as they were flung almost helplessly towards the shore.&lt;br/&gt;:There is but a narrow strip of land at the bottom of the cliff and great difficulty was encountered in getting the men up. Mrs. Crew of the Half Way House was informed of the wreck and had 22 beds prepared and fires lighted in the hotel, that the men might be comfortable. Later, however, a number of the rescued were taken to Toronto.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;The ALEXANDRIA was formerly a passenger steamer, but had carried no passengers in recent years. She came to the Canada Steamship Lines at the time of the steamship merger. Hepburn Brothers of Picton formerly owned her.&lt;br/&gt;At one o'clock this morning the vessel was a complete wreck, fifty feet having broken away from the bow and about forty feet from the stern. Waves dashing completely over the wreck, tumbled out her 300 ton cargo of sugar, vinegar and tomatoes in to the surf.&lt;br/&gt;A persistent stream of the curious and thrifty went back and forth from the Bluffs bearing trophies of every conceivable nature. Nearly everything of value above the water line was taken. Many a cellar was stocked with vinegar and canned goods.&lt;br/&gt;The engines were working until the boat struck. All machinery was in good order, &quot;but the weather was too much for her&quot; said Capt. Bloomfield. The crew did everything in their power to save her, but headway could not be made. The stricken vessel encountered the storm after leaving Port Hope. All the way it was a strong fight with the elements.&lt;br/&gt;Captain Bloomfield expressed appreciation and thankfulness for the heroic work of Mr. Middleton, who swam to an overturned lifeboat with a line. Middleton was the means of saving six or seven men when swam out with the line.&lt;br/&gt;In her disappearance Picton lost an old favorite passenger steamer in the wreck of the ALEXANDRIA. For years the steamer was a regular arrival at Picton She was built at Hull in 1866 and at that time was called the ALEXANDRA. For a number of years she was used as a freight carrier and in 1883 she was taken to Montreal where she was built up and a cabin put on her. The boat passed through a number of hands and finally was taken charge of by the veteran lake captain, Capt. Smith of Picton. The steamer was cut in half on &quot;the Ways&quot; on Picton Bay and lengthened thirty feet. The ALEXANDRIA was also placed on the Rochester- Quebec run during the summer months and during the rest of the season was in service from Brighton to Montreal.&lt;br/&gt;On the Canadian register the ALEXANDRIA was No. 85,768, being 173.7 feet in length, 30.6 feet in breadth, and 8.4 feet in depth. Her gross tonnage was 863 and her registered tonnage 508. She was propelled by paddle wheels and her engines were 50 horsepower. Her maximum speed was 13 miles per hour. The vessel was insured for $75,000 in thirty different companies in America and England.&lt;br/&gt;from&lt;br/&gt;Marine Memories&lt;br/&gt;by Willis Metcalf&lt;br/&gt;(Published by the Picton Gazette, 1975)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SOUVENIR HUNTERS STRIP WRECKED BOAT&lt;br/&gt;=======&lt;br/&gt;Anything From a Cork to a Bag of Sugar is Taken - Very Little Left&lt;br/&gt;Capt. Foote Warns Looters That Action Will be Taken&lt;br/&gt;=======&lt;br/&gt;The wrecked steamer Alexandria, reposing helplessly a short distance from the debris-strewn shore of Scarborough Bluffs, presented a scene of animation all day yesterday and today swarming with curious, half-baked souvenir hunters. During the course of the last two days thousands have visited the scene of the wreck both by radial car and boat, and very few have failed to take away some relic of the wreck, whether it was merely a piece of cork or reached the proportions of a sugar barrel. A persistent stream of the curious and thrifty went back and forth from the Bluffs bearing trophies of every conceivable nature.&lt;br/&gt;The Star reporter arrived at the scene at a time this morning when the whole city slept. Already the industrious residents of the community were providing against the coming winter by taking away barrels of vinegar and sugar. One man was, he said &quot;doing his duty by his family&quot; by appropriating several bags of sugar and innumerable baskets of crockery. Altogether it is estimated that twenty-six barrels of sugar and almost as many barrels of vinegar, furniture, cutlery, lifebelts, brass work and provisions of all sorts were among the prizes.&lt;br/&gt;The Alexandria, with her bow and stern gone, broken in the center, and open fore and aft on both sides, looks more like a mass of painted debris than a lake steamer. Only the row of cabin window holes, the projecting rock-arm, the barely discernible funnel, and the bold letter Alexandria squarely facing the cliffs, remind you that she once sailed the lakes.&lt;br/&gt;The naked throng, which included the inquisitive newspaper men, were startled in their search about 9 o'clock by the appearance of the tug Earl King, with a wrecking crew under Captain Foote, towing a scow.&lt;br/&gt;The party with Captain Foote, which had left the Canada Steamships Lines' dock, consisted of Mr. H. W. Cowan, of the steamship line, and Messrs. Weisbeck, and Stith, representing the underwriters.&lt;br/&gt;The value of the cargo and vessel, in their hopelessly damaged condition hardly seems to warrant the work of salvage.&lt;br/&gt;Collingwood Bulletin&lt;br/&gt;August 12, 1915&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: The ALEXANDRIA was originally called ALEXANDRA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paddle wheel steamer ALEXANDRA.

Contains log sheet and pencil. Dificulty is based on proximety to a busy road, as well as being visible to the surrounding houses. There is no paved path it is all grass so it may be uneven or muddy in wet weather. There is also a small body of water... more like a big puddle near the cache so please don't go swimming.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We have tried this cache on Sunday and we could not find it. Instead we found another one in a small yellow plastic container. We checked the location for over an hour and the GPS was right on target - 1 metre away. 

We are wondering if this cache still there.

&lt;br /&gt;
The BAPS Shri Swaminarayan
Mandir complex in Toronto has become the focus of interest and
wonder for local citizens and visitors to Toronto. The complex
consists of the first traditional hand carved Hindu Mandir (Hindu
place of prayer), Haveli and the Understanding Hindu Dharma
Exhibition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fusion of traditional Indian architecture with
modern technology has attracted people from all walks of life;
including students on field trips, accomplished architects and
engineers and visitors from all over the world who come to enjoy
the experience. All visitors have been awestruck by the unique
architecture and the detailed intricacy of the carvings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mandir is a masterpiece of intricate design and
workmanship of ancient Indian arts, traditions and philosophy. The
Mandir was constructed in a record 18 months. It is a testimony to
the sheer dedication and devotion of over 400
volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On July 22, 2007 the Mandir was dedicated to the people of Canada
by the spiritual leader of BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha and the
inspirer, His Divine Holiness Pramukh Swami Maharaj. Present at the
dedication ceremony were: The Right Honourable Stephen Harper,
Prime Minister of Canada, Hon. Dalton McGuinty, Premier of Ontario,
His Excellency Rajamanjinarayan, High Commissioner of India to
Canada and His Worship Mayor David Miller, Mayor of Toronto.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Open to visitors from 9am – 6pm daily throughout the year.
Admission is FREE.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

We wanted
to visit this place for a very long time and finally we made it in
the area. We were surprised to see that there's no cache placed
here, so we fixed that.&lt;br /&gt;
While the hide is nothing spectacular, the intention is to bring
you to an amazing local attraction and if you have time, we
strongly recommend you go in and visit it.&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located across the street from the Visitors
Entrance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Mandir is a Meditation Zone, thus
all visitors are required to maintain utmost silence.&lt;br /&gt;
Be prepared to take off your shoes upon
entering.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you plan to
visit the Mandir you can park free within the complex, otherwise
you can park on the Huddersfield Road, about 100 meters away.&lt;br /&gt;
Cache contains log only BYOP.&lt;br /&gt;
There is a toonie for FTF.&lt;br /&gt;
We hope you enjoy the location.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is one of the oldedest cemeteries in the Town of Caledon.
The first person to be buried here was Welsh pioneer David Williams
in 1823. He was only 29 years old when a tree fell on him while he
was clearing his land. It's rumored that he was buried in the bark
of the tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land was formally deeded much later in 1858. The property
was expanded in 1896 and 1908. The stone and iron gate entrance to
the cemetery was built in 1930. In 1966 the adjacent school
property was added to the cemetery and the single room school house
became the mortuary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;TH264AQ - Stone and Iron Gate&lt;br /&gt;N 43° 46.410 W 079° 55.623</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The area has been identified as an Earth Science Area of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSI) by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. The Badlands are also part of Ontario’s Niagara Escarpment, which was designated a UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) World Biosphere Reserve in 1990.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where you are now standing was once the edge of a warm, shallow sea. Far to the southeast, a mountain range the size of the Himalayas was building, and rivers from these mountains were sending red, iron-rich sediment from the mountains into the seas, forming a large, muddy delta. The sea was teaming with life, but on land, no plants or animals had yet developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formation of the Badlands Queenston Shale is a very soft rock, in comparison to the harder sandstone, limestone and dolostone that make up the rest of the Niagara Escarpment. Erosion of the shale can occur rapidly if layers of other rock or vegetation are removed, and particularly if the area is impacted by grazing and large number of people. The Badlands probably began to form in the early 1900s when the trees were cut down to allow for a cattle pasture. The protective layer of vegetation was removed and the shale began to erode; although farming at the site ended in 1931, erosion of the badlands has continued to its present-day state. The Badlands are part of Ontario’s Niagara Escarpment, which was designated a UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) World Biosphere Reserve in 1990. The property contains one of the best examples of “badlands topography” development in southern Ontario, and has been identified as an Earth Science Area of Natural and Scientific Interest (ANSI) by the Ministry of Natural Resources. Badlands topography is rare in Ontario because in most areas the shale is protected from erosion by overlying hard rock (limestone, dolostone or sandstone), sand or gravel. The Badlands lie within the Inglewood Slope Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA), which is an important groundwater discharge area. The coldwater stream on the property at the foot of the badlands is a tributary of the Credit River. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The posted coordinates will take you to the information sign. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Indicate how many layers of soil you see and any other interesting things you observe or facts that you learn. What did you like about this location?</groundspeak:long_description>

Of course, every time I come here people are tromping all over the place. When we were leaving, there were several youths treating the place like it was their own private mountain biking facility. *sigh*

Was fun to come back here with Kitten on the Hunt again, and we went down to score the physical geocache hidden nearby. This is a great place to come at sunset.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE: Cache is rather small, and did not accomodate a writing instrument. You should bring something to write with. Cache will handle small items (like geocoins)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two ways to access the trail system. The cache is located in a brand new park located at the end of Port Union Road. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a pedestrian tunnel under the railway tracks. Please use the tunnel at N43 46.545/W 079 08.093. Crossing the very active, very high speed railway line elsewhere is just a plain stupid thing to do.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Near the tunnel, you'll find a wonderful trail system, with a 'lookout' hill with a great view of the city, and of the nearby Pickering Nuclear Generating Station. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was placed while I was on a walk with Kitten on the Hunt's family. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trail extends out beyond the Rouge Hill GO Station (which has a geocache in it) There is parking at that end of the trail, but there is a gate blocking the trail entrance. It would appear there may still be construction at that end of the trail, so access the path from the tunnel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The path itself is paved, and would be great for rollerblading, or riding your bike here. Wheelchairs should be able to get fairly close to the cache, but may need assistance for the last few meters.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;THYT25 - Tunnel&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 46.545 W 079° 08.093&lt;br/&gt;Recommended Trailhead is a tunnel that goes under the high speed rail line&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We were out for a walk today. It's good to see that the tunnel is finally open after 6? years. Everytime we've come by here, it's been blocked. This time instead of walking, we drove to the end of Pt Union Rd. I grew up not too far from here, and boy has the area ever changes. So many new houses, where the former asbestos plant (with contaminated land) used to be.

A very enjoyable cache, park and walk. I know we will be back here to walk the trails some more.</groundspeak:text>

FERN VIEW RELOCATED IS NO WHERE NEAR THE ORIGINAL FERN VIEW HIDING SPOT. WE SIMPLY WANT TO CONTINUE THE LIFE OF ONE OF OUR FIRST CACHES AND SO HAVE REUSED THE CACHE, LOG BOOK AND NAME**&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;This cache was previously located in Morningside Park but retrieved due to storm damage. After doing a physical check of the location and area following a storm. We discovered what is often referred to as a widow maker. A large, heavy branch hanging well above the cache location. This branch had broken of from its tree and was being held, precariously above the cache location by very thin branches. In order to avoid any serious injury to cachers we have relocated it further south along highland creek. Much of this area is still in a state of repair since the flooding in August 2005 and many of the park entrances are still closed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is now located in an area that wasn’t to heavily damaged by the flooding (ENTIRELY SAFE LOCATION). However if you follow the paved path further west from the cache location, you will find lots of damage. Two bridges either washed away or damaged by the flooding. A tennis court ravished by the high water and many trees broken or placed along the shore line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking can be found at the following co-ordinates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N43 46.785&lt;br/&gt;W079 10.570&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a quick 800m round trip along a paved path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also visit our other nearby cache Fern View Relocated from the same parking area. Roughly a 800m round trip hike.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">‘Twixt Crick &amp; River is a single re-direct multicache
located in the Glen Rouge Park at the border of Toronto and
Pickering. It takes its name from the nearby merging of the Little
Rouge Creek and the Rouge River.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We
decided to make this a multicache since
the final cache is close to the main parking lot, and would not
pose much of a challenge as a standalone cache. There are other
caches in the area. If you plan properly, you can find the stage
one container, keep hiking to other nearby caches, and retrieve the
final cache on the way back to the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you really wanted to though,
this cache could be done within half an hour as a standalone. The
coordinates for the final cache are found in the first stage
container. Pretty straightforward, though the container can be
difficult to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The final cache container was
replaced in February 2010. It is now an ammo can with a home-made
camo paint job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The final cache location is off
of the trail, so some bushwhacking is required. In summer, the
growth can get pretty thick, and there are some prickly plants. It
is much more easily accessed in winter. Please leave the cache well
hidden!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

My GPS was also quite accurate and I found it after KW instructed me to believe my expensive satellite based navigation system over my own less expensive, and flawed intuition in this case. So many obvious - but wrong - spots to look around here.

Came back after getting some much needed pub-grub a few km away [man, I needed that with all these hills today]. The final was found in pretty short order with Kitten on the Hunt and we took a quiet moment to stargaze while we waited for the others to find the cache. Great fun!</groundspeak:text>

Being completely drenched and not wanting to give up I suggested a &quot;brute force&quot; search of the area beyond the trailhead (Tequila, could have used your expertise here). 20 minutes into the search we decided to call it a day (or night).

Returned this evening and walked right up to the first spot and grabbed the container without even turning on the flashlight! It was in a spot I had returned to a few times last night. On to the final and whadda know, looking at my track log our brute force attempt was pretty darn good. Take away one of the negative forces such as darkness, wet or time of night and we would have found it.

Signed the logbook and traded TBs.

BTW, I wasn't FTF.</groundspeak:text>

home-made camo paint job courtesy of the cache owner.
 &lt;p&gt;I have been looking at the ammo cans that
   have been accumulating in the garage just waiting to be
   hidden.  It's now
   officially spring, though the cache was placed on a rather gray
   day, with temperatures only a bit above freezing, so the trails
   were muddy in places, and still icy in others.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located only a few metres from
the trail.  There are
no really steep climbs or descents required, the trails are pretty
friendly.  The cache container is pretty tucked into its
hiding spot, and may be a little difficult to remove, but I have
seen worse.  Please take care to re-hide the container
well.  I have rated the cache a 3.5 difficulty due to the
hiding spot, but the terrain should not be much of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite what
your mapping software may tell you, this cache is located
&lt;b&gt;NORTH and EAST&lt;/b&gt; of the Little Rouge Creek.  If you park at the recommended
coordinates, you will &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; want to cross the bridge before
hitting the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cache started with some decent swag, and a couple of geocoins and a
travel bug. &lt;/p&gt;

I've been meaning to hide a cache here since I hiked here with the
BT Hike crew on the way to Glen Haffy. The posted co-ordinates will
take you to the entrance. Look for a 4 digit number below a sign
and this will guide you to the cache. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is technically a micro, so it does not contain a pen.
Geocoins *may* fit inside, but not much else will. Rehide the cache
the way you find it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To find the NORTH co-ordinate, add all the digits together and add
5. Divide this number by 1000, and add it to the posted
co-ordinate. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To find the WEST co-ordinate, add all the digits on the sign
together, then add 4. Divide this number by 1000, and subtract it
from the posted WEST co-ordinate. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That's all there is to it. The hint is specific, so don't decode it
unless you want to know where it is. Good luck, and happy hunting.

After walking the 3.5km to the Bailey Bridge in the park, we were thankful that Rideau Rangers were able to give everyone a ride back to their cars. One more cache before heading home and this one was it. Did the calculations using the 4 digit # for the north and then the calculations using the 10 digit number from the sign (since the description said to use the sign) for the west. This put us about 30m too far east I think as we weren't finding the cache. Even stuck my head in the &quot;other&quot; tunnel on the other side of the road on the other side of the tunnel...if that makes any sense. So we had no choice but to resort to the clue which helped greatly in finding the cache. I have a feeling we were supposed to use the same 4 digit # that we used for the North as opposed to the phone # on the sign about the 4 digit number...I'm sure you'll set me straight on that. Had fun making noises in the tunnerl...off to head home now after a fulfilling day.</groundspeak:text>

This series of geocaches will take you to some of my
favourite childhood playgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bring your dog, your kids, and anything else that
likes to run around and have a picnic and enjoy the
day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every
cache in the series is a film canister (excluding the ones that
specifically say so in the hint).  Some have camouflage tape
and some do not.  Please watch out for muggles as there are
usually lots out and about in these areas.  Please put the
caches back where you found them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This
cache used to be the final for my now archived cache &quot;Options:
Miller's Creek&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you
have already done Options: Miller's Creek, then you have already
found this container. I have just &quot;converted&quot; the cache to a
traditional.&lt;/p&gt;

posted co-ordinates.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When writing your log, please
follow the guidelines below:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;(Step 3 is very important)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.  Write a log
that is at least 150 words long. [please do not use to much slang
or contractions (can't, didn't, etc.)]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Tip:  You can lie
about your adventure if nothing exciting at all happened to
you.  Make up a story about how you battled off a dragon or
nearly drowned in the creek until a little native boy raised by
fleas rescued you and took you to his home in a tree trunk. 150
words is only a rough guideline.  Just don't write something
really short.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.  Run your log through an
online translator from English into any other language and then run
the translated text back through into English. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Some translators good
are:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://babelfish.yahoo.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
           
&lt;a href=&quot;http://translate.google.com/translate_t?hl=en&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;       &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldlingo.com/en/products_services/worldlingo_translator.html&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;http://translation.babylon.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3)
Fix the log, making sure you can understand what is being said but
still keeping grammatical errors intact.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4)
Publish your log, including the original English version
also.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5)
Read other people's logs to hear about their &quot;crazy&quot;
adventures!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;That's all there is to it!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for info on the cache and how to
get to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¤  You can access the park from the
posted Trailhead waypoint.  Parking is available on McCullock
Cres. in Ajax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¤ DO NOT try to access the cache from
Rossland Road.  You will be trespassing on PRIVATE PROPERTY
and that is not good. ONLY access from the supplied Trailhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¤ Terrain rating is 3.5 because of some
seasonal muddy patches and many trees to climb over and a
moderately steep hill to climb up part of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¤ Cache is in a large peanut butter
container (with camouflage tape).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¤ Please be stealthy if there are people
around and re-hide very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have fun Caching and writing your
log,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

This series of geocaches will take you to some of my
favourite childhood playgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bring your dog, your kids, and anything else that
likes to run around and have a picnic and enjoy the
day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every cache
in the series is a film canister (excluding the ones that
specifically say so in the hint).  Some have camouflage tape
and some do not.  Please watch out for muggles as there are
usually lots out and about in these areas.  Please put the
caches back where you found them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Have Fun Caching!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      Cache A Day&lt;br /&gt;Mini
      Challenge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A miniature version of the classic &quot;A Cache A Day&quot;
Challenge. This challenge cache is one of a series of 12 challenges
focused on finding a cache on every day for a specified month. All
caches in this series have been placed by members of the
Golden Horseshoe Monthly
Geocaching Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache IS at the posted coords. You may not
claim a find on this cache until you have met the requirements of
this Challenge cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rules
Summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Find and log (at least) one
cache for every day of the month specified on this mini
challenge.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finds do not need to be during the
same year. I.e., your qualifying find for March 1 may be from 2008,
for March 2 from the present year, for March 3 from 2004, and so
on. As long as at some point in your caching career you found a
cache on every day of the specified month.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;All past, present and future finds
count.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;No editing logs or logging your finds
on a different day. The day you physically found the cache is the
day you write your found it log as. Of course just like with
everything to do with geocaching, you are on the honour
system.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Provide some kind of list, chart,
bookmark, etc as proof of completing the challenge portion of this
cache. You may find the calendar on this
link
useful.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please try the other caches placed as part

It is a bit of a hike to get to this cache...2.4km one way from the
front gate of the Cold Creek Conservation Area. Make sure to look
up the 3 earthcaches there as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I have been enjoying visits
to Saint John New Brunswick for several years and decided to honour
this fair Canadian city with a cache. As Canada’s oldest
incorporated city, Saint John is rich with historical sites and is
also full of fun geocaching opportunities. In 2010 I had the
pleasure of meeting some of the local cachers and got to experience
some of their hides. In particular I want to shout out to the fine
folks of the Maritime Geocaching Association. The MGA, led by
Dragoon and company does a fantastic job of keeping the geocaching
community informed of local activities and organizes events
throughout the area. And I’ll never forget the warm welcome I
received by the members at kfdcanada’s “Breakfast at
Kay’s” event and will look forward to my future
visits.

OK so this was going to be a simple cache in the Stouffville area
to honour my friends on the coast but at the last minute I decided
to add a bit of a twist. The puzzle is simple enough but
you’ll have to learn few things about “The Loyalist
City”.

Just as you thought...the cache is not at the posted coordinates but is within 1km

The cache is located at the
following coordinates:
N 43° AB.CDE
W 079°FG.HIJ

A.) Saint John is the largest population centre sitting on a bay that boasts
the highest tides in the world.
A = Number of letters in the name of the bay.

B.)  Saint
John was home to one of New Brunswick's most influential
politicians, Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley. Tilley crafted the
province's entry into Confederation and played an important role in
the development of Canada's political system. This “Father of
Confederation” rests in Saint John’s Fernhill
cemetery.
B = The third digit of the year of Sir Samuel Tilley’s death.

C.)     
&amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;Saint
John’s coat of arms features some recognizable Canadian
wildlife.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;
= The number of
beavers on the crest minus the number of moose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;![if !supportLists]&amp;gt;D.)    
&amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;Late in
the 19th century Saint John's largest fire breaks out in Portland,
and quickly engulfs most of the South End of the city. For 9 long
hours the fire rages on - leaving 13,000 people homeless,
destroying over 1,600 buildings, and consuming most of the
commercial district. When it was over, the fire had destroyed over
80 hectares (200 hundred acres) and 1612 structures including eight
churches, six banks, fourteen hotels, eleven schooners and four
woodboats in just over a nine hour period. Nearly all the public
buildings, the principal retail establishments, lawyers' offices
and all but two printing firms were burned in the
inferno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;
= Add the digits
of the year of the “great fire” then add the digits of
your total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;![if !supportLists]&amp;gt;E.)     
&amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;From
1993 to 2003 Saint John was home to AHL hockey team the Saint John
Flames. During this time the Flames went to the Calder Cup final
twice. In 1998 they 
lost to the Philadelphia Phantoms but on their next cup run they
won on home ice at Harbour Station against the
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, the farm team of the Pittsburgh
Penguins. The Flames won the series four games to two with a final
score of 1–0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;
= The last digit
of the year the SJ Flames won the Calder Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;![if !supportLists]&amp;gt;F.)     
&amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;Saint
John was one of the world's leading shipbuilding centers, so it is
no surprise that the roof of the City Market resembles the inverted
keel of a ship. Hand-hewn timbers and dove-tailed joints that have
stood fast for more than century attest to the skill and experience
of the builders. Saint John’s City Market was built prior to
the great fire. The building survived the fire and is still open
for business today. The ringing of the Market Bell every morning
and evening, a tradition at the City Market, signals opening and
closing of the day's business. Today the keeper of that tradition
is the Deputy Market Clerk who oversees day to day
affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;
= The year of the
great fire minus the year the City Market building
opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;![if !supportLists]&amp;gt;G.)    
&amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;&lt;b&gt;         
G&lt;/b&gt; =
The number of oars showing on the flag of New Brunswick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;![if !supportLists]&amp;gt;H.)    
&amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;Actor
Donald Sutherland, one of New Brunswick’s favourite sons was
born in Saint John in 1935.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;H&lt;/b&gt;
= Month of Donald
Sutherland’s birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;![if !supportLists]&amp;gt;I.)      
&amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;Canadian icon, Stompin’
Tom Connors was born in Saint John in 1936.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;
= The day of the
month on which Connors was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lt;![if !supportLists]&amp;gt;J.)      
&amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;During
their 10 years the Saint John Flames produced some NHL’s
greats including Martin St. Louis. St. Louis wears his jersey
number in tribute to his childhood hero, diminutive former Montreal
Canadiens star Mats Näslund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;J&lt;/b&gt;
= Sum of the
digits of St. Louis or Nasland’s number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy your journey
and remember...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;![endif]&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Not all those
who wander are lost…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations
to Rebel10 on the FTF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/bookmarks/view.aspx?guid=af051d70-a552-4729-95ab-feabaaa16ccc&quot;&gt;
&quot;Restin'&quot;&lt;/a&gt; caches are
a series of micro-caches that take you to beautiful and some
forgotten cemeteries throughout the area. We introduce you to these
cemeteries as a way of exploring our local history, and those who
were early settlers here. While visiting we hope that you can
reflect on their lives and contributions to the communities that
they helped build into where we live today. Please respect their
resting place and ensure that extreme care is taken during your
visit. Please bring your own pen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very old
cemetery.  Some of the stones are so old that they are
unreadable and some tree roots have even caused some stones to tilt
to the side. Take some time to read the stones. I saw one stone
that I think said that the person died sometime in the 1700's and
was 50-some years old. This could mean that they were born in the
1600's!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've noticed in some old cemeteries that there
are misspellings on the stones.  I saw, at one of my other
Restin' cache locations, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=76527e2a-7c24-4c5a-9221-611b98787c8c&quot;&gt;Flinton
United&lt;/a&gt;) that they had spelled &quot;died&quot; as &quot;dide&quot;.  This
shows how many people were not educated to the standards we are
today.  On the photo below, the stone is missing the Y in
&quot;days&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;If you walk through any cemetery that's
been in operation for more than a hundred years, you'll soon
notice two things. The first is the sheer number of children that
used to die before they were old enough to crawl and how many
families had two, three, or more children that didn't live to
their tenth birthdays.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The second is an unusual obsession with
precision exhibited on many markers. I can understand marking a
dead child's age as three weeks or 22 days, but many of the
markers for older people also include precise counts of months and
days. It always seems a little odd to see a grandmother's age
tallied up in the same manner as a toddler's.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A lot of people shy away from cemeteries, but
I always find them fascinating. Taking a stroll through an old
cemetery is like walking through a highly-condensed social history
of a region. As you progress from older graves to newer ones, the
names change, occupations shift, family relationships become clear,
and tributes to achievements both major and minor abound.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The above picture is a picture of an old
tombstone in this cemetery]&lt;/p&gt;

Forest, Tottenham tract, but most of the others have been archived for some time.
Enjoy a nice hike through the forest!&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The cache is in a clear L&amp;L container. The cache was originally
placed with: a deck of cards, dice, guitar picks, golf tees,
stickers, a tic-tac-toe game, led flashlight, log book and pencil,
and some other small items.
&lt;p&gt;There is logging being done in the forest from time to time, but
there will be signs indicating if there is logging activity
happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking at N43 59.399 W079 47.819&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're up for a longer hike, you can park further North on
Tottenham Rd., just South of the train tracks and enter the forest
there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are allowed to mountain bike in the forest, but it would be
difficult. Many of the trails are sandy and there are tree remains
all over from logging that has been done in the forest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some parts of the trails are lower in elevation and could be
wet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those of you with ragweed allergies (like foxorama) be sure
to take an allergy pill!&lt;/li&gt;

The experience has been more diverse and enjoyable than I had expected so I thought I’d celebrate with a “1 year hide”. As we all know, Geocaching can be a roller coaster ride of pleasant walks, challenging hikes, frustrating puzzles, easy finds on our way somewhere and discovery of places we never would have gone. But above all it’s just plain fun and that’s what keeps me coming back so that was the thought behind preparing this cache. No tricks, just fun, so get out there and enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK2HGV6 - GC2HGV6 Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 59.513 W 079° 12.199&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

In 1915 (at the age of 39) he did his duty for King and Country and enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, to serve in what was called &quot;The Great War&quot; He left a wife and 4 children behind. 1916 Found him sent to the front lines of France where he was taken prisoner of war. He remained a POW in Germany until the end of the war. He was liberated and sent home in 1919 where he was released from his service for medical reasons. Most likely injuries he sustained as a POW. He went home (back to Newmarket) and raised his family. Not much else is known about what happened to him or his decendants. In 1922 he was awarded the Victory medal and the medal for the War for Civilisation.The Memory Project is now in possession of these medals and hopes to one day track down his kin and return the medals to where they belong. As you can imagine with a last name of JONES it is not an easy task. As you search for this cache take a moment to think about Pvt. Jones and the sacrifices he made for us all. Take a look around, the area may have changed a lot but there are still things around that would have been here when Pvt. Jones lived in this area. Thank you for taking the time to Remember and Honour their service.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Some very light bushwhacking is required for the last few metres. It is a very family friendly area.&lt;br/&gt;The container is a small camo’d Lock n’ Lock with room for Geo Coins or Travel Bugs.&lt;br/&gt;Hope you enjoy the find as much as I have my first 100. Maybe you’ll find this one and celebrate a Milestone too.&lt;br/&gt;Please enjoy the little treat waiting for the FTF.&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to KDotBlueDot for the FTF! </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Vista Park in Keswick is one of the highest points of land in
the Georgina area and conveniently looks over most of Cooks Bay and
the mouth of the Holland River. This park provides one of the most
amazing views of the lake that you will find anywhere along it's
shores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being that this park faces West, you will find that this park is
quite possibly the most amazing spot to take in a sunset or watch
the stars at night time. Please try to take some amazing pictures
of the view and post them to the cache! When at the cache location.
Face North and notice the near 260 degree vista view. Such an aptly
named park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in the vicinity of the cache is Keswick's first water
tower. Although this isn't much of a &quot;Tower&quot; as such, it is a
unique landmark that can be seen from all the way across the lake
in Innisfil. You might also notice that from this viewpoint, if you
look to the North and slightly West, you can see the Barrie Tower
well in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking can be unmistakably found at the end of West Park
Heights Road at the cul-de-sac. This is the &quot;Official&quot; park
parking. Be advised that parking here is only available until 9pm.
There's no gates as such, but thats what the signs say. Just
relaying the info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This cache has been placed by a Central Ontario
Geocacher!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

loved to come here to enjoy the lake, a sunset, get out onto the
ice in the winter and just to relax. It's not the best park in
Georgina, but it's a nice one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to share your pictures of the park, or a
sunset, ice fishing, or anything else that you encounter at the
park on the cache page. The cache is a small container in a
decently out-of-the-way spot (for this park). Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

walking through the forest and thinking... &quot;Man, they really are
clearcutting the heck outta this tract&quot;. Much like what was
happening to me at that point in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember walking past this particular section of the trail
which was dark, dank and enclosed and looking over and seeing light
coming through the trees. So I had to take a look!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped and stared at the light for a while in this spot. It
was simply peaceful. Several years later, I have returned to place
a cache here.&lt;/p&gt;

Drive by this place often. Great speed trap spot!

irrelevant, but plan for a longer trip as your canoe will be slowed
by the vegetation in the water. At times it will be more like

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Attempting this from land? Good luck with that idea.&lt;br /&gt;
You are recommended to access this cache via canoe. Motorized boats
just are not going to make it here (if you can get them in the
water!)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two access points are provided on the listing. You can put in at 11
Concession, paddling against the (barely noticable) current and
with the typical wind, or put in at Highway 7 and paddle with the
current but against typical winds. I recommend the north put-in at
11 concession - it's quieter and more scenic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a &quot;protein container&quot; (courtesy of H.F.Reign) and it's
very easy to spot, once you are in the correct location.&lt;br /&gt;

I'm very happy that you decided to grab this one at night.  We were wondering if anyone was brave enough to try it after dark.  Our night cache canoe adventure was on an open river in the middle of Cambridge.  Yours was 5 times the distance on a small weed filled river in the middle of nowhere.  Way to go! [:)]

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Another cache on the south shore of lake simcoe in Willow Beach
near a cottage I provide maintenance for. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The great paddle boat disaster of '07 occured when someone did not
secure the boat properly and when the following major storm passed
through it was smashed up onto the rocks in the bank. The Paddle
Wheeler sank and with yet another storm buried it into the
shoreline. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have tried to dig it out several times to no avail. I have even
tried to use a 4000 lb winch, but alas, it just won't budge. It has
now become a landmark for boaters as they pass by. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This can be a very high muggle area in the summer, especially on
the weekends. There is no parking and no stopping along lake drive,
this is highly enforced in the summer months, not so much in the
winter, but don't blame me if you do it and get a ticket. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is parking at the park just a short distance to the east that
is an easy walk even in the winter. &lt;br /&gt;
Update: It has been brought to my attention that the parking area
has been closed off for the winter. (must be a new thing?) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a camo taped 35mm film cannister that is also covered
with natural camoflage that you will find on the ground. Please
make sure that you replace the cache as you found it and cover it
as needed. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Angus being close to CFB Borden I figured this was as a good a location as any.  There seem to be good gaps in the hide.  I wonder if they are caused by all the geocachers looking for the cache?  I did like that there is an obstruction that blocks the view from the street.  Makes it easier to retrieve the cache.

&lt;p&gt;the 4th in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;punisher series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
lives up to it's name. A crazy walk this will prove to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no tricks with this cache. Simply put, its just a
punishing Multi-cache. The provided co-ordinates are for the
starting stage for this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;b&gt;dirtbike&lt;/b&gt; trails that criss-cross these woods
and fields. They are &lt;b&gt;USED&lt;/b&gt;, primarily on the weekends, so be
alert and aware for these folks. They are &lt;i&gt;allowed&lt;/i&gt; here.
Please respect their presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of this area are gorgeous and parts of this area are
pretty dismal with trash and torn-up ground. I won't promise your
walk will be altogether pleasant, but the walk does have its
moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-ordinates will be located at each stage within plain
view. You may need to reach, crouch or climb but not in excess.
Once you find the first stage, you will understand how the multi
works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can choose to follow what limited trails there are
throughout this area to find the cache, but I cannot promise you it
will help you to each stage. I did not necessarily follow the
trails to place each stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park either on Salem Road, or at the movie theatre parking near
Bryne Drive at the very south end of Barrie. Make sure to also find
Cache a Flick which is also in these woods and
Downs North which is also nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



Thank you for considering our new series of
caches. We do not consider these caches to be for everyone. These
caches will test your mental, physical and awareness abilities
probably unlike any other cache you have previously visited.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 We have designed these caches to be difficult. We cannot imagine
that everyone will be able to find every cache in the series
however we welcome anyone to try. In some cases, the
cache-placements may be in plain sight. In others, you will have
more difficult tasks to perform. Either way, rest assured that your
caching abilities, desires and limits will be put to the test.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 For those who do not wish to attempt to find these caches, we do
understand. Please remember that everyone has an &quot;Ignore&quot; list
through their account and they are able to use that functionality
without concern or prejudice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 For those who decide to attempt these caches, prepare to be
punished.&lt;br /&gt;

This was a lovely winter day.  Starting out about an inch of snow on the ground which was just barely covering the tracks of those who had gone before, actually yesterday based upon when “ghost” signed the log.  I stuck to the trails for much of it and this included using the road between stage 3 and 4.  Bushwhacked from 10 to the final.  Felt some burn here.  Good snow flurry after stage 10 that put about 2 inches on the ground. Spent 30 minutes at stage 8.  Found the marker 11 meters 96 degrees away.  Otherwise all other cords are bang on.  My fault for not finding it sooner here.

6325 meters includes walking/parking at the theatre.  3 hours 11 minutes including wasted time and R&amp;R stops.  Cache in good shape except pages in logbook are lose.  Took cars left pewter keychain.

Great cache and I enjoyed all the scenery and wildlife.  Did not see any trail riders.  You certainly made good use of this bush.

So what’s next?  You guys run out of ideas?

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I placed &quot;Cache a Flick&quot; in a location which I have just recently discovered.  This land is actually listed at part of the Township of Innisfil, but borders very closely with Barrie's south end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area is thankfully now listed as a &quot;Natural Regeneration&quot; area which is good news for the prevention of development from taking this area over.  Unfortunately however there has been quite a bit of debris scattered around the outlying trails in the area.  This would take a pretty hefty CITO team to fix up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area is located directly at the junction of 2 main snowmobile trails heading East, and North, and although Dirtbike traffic has been outlawed in the area, there are still tracks indicating that they are around at times, so be on the lookout!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cache is my typical smaller tupperware style container, and contains some neat trading stuff.  Any of you that have found my other caches may recognize where the cache is hidden when you see it. Bushwhacking is imminent with this cache, but I will let the terrain rating speak for itself with this one.  There is definately some effort required to make it to this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parking can be found at N44 19.416 W79 41.026 The cache name was chosen for what is within proximity of the parking co-ordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the area.  These are definately exceptional walking trails for the family, and for the dog.&lt;/p&gt;

It's an interesting area, but there was no less than a dozen trucks, car with trailers and even a cube van with a ramp behind it. The place was swarming with dirt bikes. In some spots the bikes are &quot;bushwacking&quot; and forging new trails. We removed several strategically placed beeer cans that had been attached to trees as reflectors for riding the trails at night.
Somehow we managed to find the cache &amp; get out without actually crossing paths with a bike, though that was probably due to the fact that we often avoided the trails to avoid the bikes. It was nonetheless a nice area. Took an ornament &amp; left a Canada magnet.

     in the core of Downtown Barrie? &lt;em&gt;That can't be
     possible!&lt;/em&gt; Well believe it!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although not large by any means, you will find that when you
visit this cache at Audrey Milligan Park that the significance of
this park is apparent. Beavers, Swans, Ducks, Squirrels, Turtles
and countless varieties of songbirds are only part of the wildlife
that is available to be seen at the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to plan for some time to stay and enjoy the park as it
was meant to be seen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;About Audrey Milligan
Park&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;p&gt;About 1940, Mr. Bert Young purchased the
property on the South side of Perry Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, he cleaned up the swamp behind
his property removing dead trees and trash, and built a dam to
create a wildlife pond. Trees were planted, foot paths established,
benches and bridges constructed and the first pair of Swans
introduced. With the help of neighbor Derek Jones, a dike was built
to control silt build-up and the Beaver dams monitored to control
water levels. It was a labor of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many bird and animal species and different
flora became established, the area became a favorite quiet place
for local residents. Mr. Young's vision of the park had become a
reality. Mr. Young moved away in 1981. The care and feeding of the
swans passed to his son Doug and later to Mr. Jones who continues
to supervise the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1990, Miss Audrey Milligan willed her
property on the west side of the ponds to the City for parkland.
The City purchased part of the Young property and named the area
&quot;Audrey Milligan Park&quot;. The Huronia Rotary Club built new bridges
and started a major yearly clean-up in 1992. Ducks Unlimited
installed nesting boxes and signs in 1994 and continues to monitor
wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995, City Council officially named the pond
beside Perry Street &quot;Young-Jones Pond&quot; to recognize the years of
dedication by Bert Young and Derek Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;About The
Cache&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This cache is not large, but will contain enough space for small
trade items. It is well hidden from the muggle-passer-by, but
should not be hard at all for a geocacher to locate. It is close
enough to the trail that anyone can see you doing the geo-dance so
please approach your find with caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Cache Placer is a member of the following fine
organizations!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Got out and studied the sign comparing it to the map on the GPS and then we figured it all out and followed the trail and footprints right to the cache. This certainly is a nice area and I think the hundreds of ducks here were very curious as to what we were up to.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Bayfield Urban Lunchtime Cache!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created the BULC in the interest of people who are caching in
a relatively short time period (like on their lunch!) This cache is
located in one of the very few areas left in the City of Barrie
where actual greenery exists, and should be fairly easy to
find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you stand near the cache, its interesting to notice that
all around the area is surrounded by malls, supershoppingplexes,
Apartment buildings, yet, squirrels run by your feet seemingly
unaware of their urban prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend parking under the tallest landmark in the area. This
is unmistakable when you get near the cache area. If this is hard
to find, you can always park at the WalMart and walk across the
road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are done with this Cache, please sign one of the log
papers and rehidethe cache well in its location. This area does get
travelled frequently by people from the nearby apartments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This cache has been placed by a Central Ontario
Geocacher!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We came to Barrie today to pick up some travel bug tags, and couldn't leave without doing at least one cache. The snow was quite deep, but that didn't stop Leona from running ahead (in the wrong direction...hehe) and trying to beat me to the cache. She managed to spot it despite the snow. Took Lemony Snicket button, left compass carabiner.

Use caution (especially in low light) when approaching this cache
as there are a number of trees in the area with low branches.&lt;br /&gt;

Special equipment is NOT required to reach the cache container, but if you doubt your abilities or are acrophobic, you may want to use some sort of safety protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The challenge of this cache is to actually reach the container, not having your buddy sign your name! I would appreciate it if finders would respect the spirit of the cache, but, in the end, how you play the game is entirely up to you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obviously, posting photos/videos of you actually signing the cache, and any other hilarious shenanigans are always appreciated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a sanitized olive green Decon container hidden over 10m up a tree. The container has been secured to ensure it does not fall out. Please do not tamper with the attachment mechanism!</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Typha latifolia has also been recently introduced into fresh water
creeks and lakes. A wide variety of parts that are edible to
humans. The rhizomes, underground lateral stems, are a pleasant
nutritious and energy-rich food source, generally harvested from
late autumn to early spring. These are starchy, but also fibrous,
so the starch must be scraped or sucked from the tough fibers. The
bases of the leaves can be eaten raw or cooked, in late spring when
they are young and tender. As the flower spike is developing in
early summer, it can be broken off and eaten like corn on the
cob[clarification needed]. In mid-summer, once the male flowers are
mature [2], the pollen can be collected and used as a flour
supplement or thickener. Typha has also recently been suggested as
a source of oil.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Kinsmen Trail, a parallel paved surface, follows Chippewa Creek as it meanders down the escarpment and empties into Lake Nipissing. The parkway presents countless opportunities for recreation, education, and alternatives in transportation.  It's the perfect paved surface for bikers and in-line skaters.  The trail's easy grade makes walking comfortable for those who are young or young at heart.  The trail crosses a busy Main Street via an overhead, free-span bridge on its way to linking up with the Kate Pace Way.  The trail has an asphalt surface and has partial wheelchair access.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Can park at these Coordinate: N46 24.898 W079 18.817 McGruthers Rd to the North starts at Widdifield Station Rd and is a walking trail / ATV trail. It takes you to the old McBurney Saw Mill site at Otter Lake via the 'spur' that follows the concession line to the lake. This used to be an important colonization road that brought settlers from North Bay to this area in the late 1800's. There is an old cement bridge dating back to the early 1900's on this road spanning the North River. Just past the bridge there is a trail on the left that takes you to the Little North River on a section of the Nekik Waterway.

Ça faisait longtemps que je n'avais pas mis le pied dans ce coin là. Quand j'étais petit, nous avions un chalet au Lac Hélène et mon père m'amenait à la chasse à la perdrix dans cette forêt. Tout a bien changé depuis ce temps, je ne retrouve plus mes points de repère. Les petits chalets sont devenus des maisons, tout a perdu son cachet d'en temps. Le petit sentier étroit que j'empruntais pour aller au lac Adéline est disparu sous la pelouse d'un bungalow. On n’arrête pas le progrès... De nouveaux sentiers ont fait leur apparition. J'en ai fait le tour, vous pouvez voir le réseau sur cette carte. Pour ceux que ça intéresse, voici un lien ou vous pourrez récupérer un fichier GPX des sentiers. (visit link)
Comme ça vous n'aurez pas à passer à travers bois pour vous rendre aux caches de ce secteur.

Merci tifred pour la cache et de m'avoir fait revenir par ici.</groundspeak:text>

Quelques années plus tard, ils ont disparus!&lt;br/&gt;Vous souvenez-vous de : Tremblay &amp; Frères d’Évain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;En 1946, Adrien et Victor Tremblay débutent par le rabotage du bois brut puis s’ajoute la mouture des céréales pour animaux. Une grange permet d’entreposer du foin qu’ils livrent l’hiver avec de l’avoine aux entrepreneurs forestiers. En retour, ils obtiennent du bois brut pour la revente l’été suivant.&lt;br/&gt;Le commerce additionne les produits de quincaillerie, de plomberie, de portes et fenêtres et l’équipement agricole John Deere.&lt;br/&gt;En 1962, c’est la construction de l’élévateur à grains. Au fil des ans, des entrepôts s’ajoutent. En 1979, une succursale ouvre à Val-d’Or. En 1999, Tremblay &amp; Frères d’Évain ferme ses portes.&lt;br/&gt;Sous la présidence de Clément Charrette, Uni-Verre ouvre ses portes en 2003. &lt;br/&gt;Réf : Évain 1935 – 2010  75e ça se fête en famille&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bien que cette cache ait été installée avec l’autorisation du propriétaire, il est peut-être préférable de faire cette cache en dehors des heures d’ouverture du commerce.&lt;br/&gt;La cache contient seulement le carnet de visite.&lt;br/&gt;Apportez votre crayon.&lt;br/&gt;Bonne chasse!&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

J'ai attendu aujourd'hui (un samedi) pour faire cette cache. La dernière fois que je suis passé ici, il y avait trop de monde pour me risquer à la faire. Bravo, belle idée de faire des caches à connotation historique. On en apprend toujours un peu plus avec ce genre de caches. Quand j'étais petit garçon, je venais avec mon père et cet élévateur à grain m'impressionnait toujours. Je me sentais petit quand on passait à côté.

Bravo Tifred pour cette cache!</groundspeak:text>
