Most of the homes and roads in this area would not have been possible without him and a lot of heavy equipment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is placed on an undeveloped lot owned by friends of mine who were recently introduced to geocaching. There will be no trouble accessing this cache. Please be respectful of the area and for crying out loud WATCH OUT FOR BEARS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While in the neighborhood you will really want to seek out another nearby cache GC14F56. It is worth the effort and will remain as one of my all time favorite caches. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

No muggles on the return.  Was able to find the cache a little quicker than expected.  It blends in really well.  Decided to grab a bite to eat while here.  Figured it would be good because who puts a cache near someplace they don't like?  Enjoyed our pizza and the brownies.  Thanks for the multitasking stop.</groundspeak:text>

That's OK, because I committed the photo to memory and I recognized the area once at GZ.
45 minutes later, I was about to call it quits, when Klondike Kate mentioned that NorthWes made the last find.
NORTHWES found it ? Well if HE found it, ANYBODY can, so we're going to camp here until we find it, if we have to stay here all week.
Fortunately we didn't have to.  Got dirty, SL.

Well guarded, I am sure glad the guards were sleeping somewhat today but they still made it difficult to get to the cache, but at this point I already had grabbed a couple of these so my hands hurt and will be digging the stuff out I am sure anyway but at least we had no leaves to worry about!  Didn't have new log to put in but the write in the rain log broke apart pretty easy as it was frozen and a warm hand made it soak in the ink very nicely!

After the quick hike back in we did find this cache first by sound of the ski pole strike and after a little digging I even had my hands on the handle of this ammo can. The earth had a better grip with the recent thaw and refreeze we had, making this a cache that is not going to be coming out without a jack hammer or a piece of dynamite! So instead we left it alone and covered it with the stuff that was there and CH took a picture to prove we had the right location. What a great way to end my birthday with what was gonna be a DNF, to a cache find!  TNLN, TFTC li1gray

The terrain is challenging so wear good footwear and be prepared.  Due to the terrain and trees it may take a bit for the GPS to settle so be patient.  I've triple checked the coordinates and averaged at both locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You MUST sign the log at the final.  Bring 2 pens if that is what it takes.  I will delete any log that doesn't have a signature at the final.  Log signed = smiley!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those who served in our armed forces will recognize this term, as will many of those who pledged fraternities or sororities in college.  I was describing this one to my son, complete with a detailed description of what a snipe looks like and how to spot them after dark (which is the best time to hunt snipe) and what it takes to capture one.  Then I explained why he should never hunt snipe.  I left this snipe for you and recommend you conduct your hunt during the daylight. I'm pretty sure it won't run away if you get close but I can make no guarantees.  Our wildlife don't always follow our wishes! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I saw several piles (for lack of better word) of bear scat and a few moose droppings while placing these caches.  The caches were placed under cloudy skies and averaged at both locations at least 500 times with 8ft accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are not familiar with the options on your GPS, or your GPS is a very basic model with no options you might run into trouble here.  Bring your instruction manual.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Placed under Chugach permit 11-007&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats Cavyguy on the FTF!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN2K0PZ - GC2K0PZ Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

I picked this area because of the amazing scenery, from the rock wall in front of me to the loud roar of the rushing water and the amazing view of the creek.  It is impressive that the water moves that fast and strong for such a distance.  It was well worth the hike to get there.  Be prepared for the hike and enjoy it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is not on the ground.  It is hanging and the suspending device is a color that is very different from the surrounding materials although you may only get a tiny glimpse of it.  Look for red!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thought I would try for this cache using just my sense of smell, so I blindfolded myself and drove up to the Chugach State Park Trailhead and parked in the handicap parking slot. It took a while to acclimate myself to the overload of odiferous smells being processed by my nostrils, but I soon found the first stage and deducing that it was a multi-cache, took off the blindfold and was surprised to see MTboy and Ridgeseeker.  I asked them if they would like to go up to Flattop with me and MTboy replied that it was beyond his capability, and besides, Keri had told him to do the dishes. Ridgeseeker said that now that he was retired, he only did drive-up caches.  
Well, I had stage 2 to find so I left them and headed down the trail and looked down and found an old pocket watch. I was thinking that this would be good swag for a cache when I met a fellow on the trail who had lost it and was overjoyed when I returned it to him. So overjoyed in fact that he gave me 10 Billion dollars! (I know, I couldn’t believe it either) Most of it was in $1 dollar bills, so I’m wondering what time the Bush Company opens.  Then I thought that I should share my good fortune with others. 
Klondike Kate’s parents always wanted her to marry rich, so they were deeply depressed when she married me … they still cry themselves to sleep at night.  When we first got married people would ask if we had kids what would we name it if it was a boy. I replied that with my Greek ancestry and with her Polish ancestry, we could name him Zorba the dumb$hi@.  So with my newfound wealth, I may move up to #1 son-in-law!
So I’ve decided to share the wealth! 
I offered a new motorized wheelchair, with chains for winter caching, to tomanoble but he declined saying that he was getting along pretty well with crutches … so I took one of the crutches and broke his other leg at which time he reconsidered my offer. Other gifts include:
LBK – A six pack of dogs, because sometimes 8 isn’t enough.
Scobey- A six pack
Trove Rover- A new George Forman Grill so she can have us over for a BBQ.
Tinman- A can of WD-40
Deke Rivers – A new comb
Malcore- A Spell Checker
Capra Hircus – A herd of goats … Walk the walk bucko!
Bike&amp;Ski –New bike of course, with training wheels
I can’t remember if I found stage 2 or not, but I must have or I wouldn’t be writing this.

Extra mobility probobly would have gone a long way too. The caching kidlets were wanting to place something a little more &quot;devious&quot; and out of the ordinary and had seen a placement like this before and wanted to give it a try. Its VERY winter friendly. Its a nice warm up to the other caches farther in or....you can wait to do this one on your way out. Cause I am sure you 'gotta go' and we even found a place for you!

I'll place a larger cache around here soon, I didn't have an appropriate one for this location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While here, If you haven't found &quot;Deception&quot; by Omonra, give it a try.  They are masters of inventive and whimsical caches.  I haven't found it yet but I should have it in hand before the first snow files....maybe.

Ski trails and hiking trails abound but littered with bears, moose and sometimes scary two legged critters. We love to spend time here as well as the BLM, however, as much as we love it, it makes our hearts pound when a tree rustles or, we think we hear a low growl or catch a faint whiff of a funny smell that can only be associated with something large, furry with sharp teeth and claws. Our hearts leap out of our chest when we round a bend or sharp corner and are face to face with a Cow and Twins....&lt;br/&gt;We love to ski, skijor, cross country and sled but fear we are on the wrong trail, in the wrong track or we are on the &quot;expert&quot; trail when our novice hiney's shoulda been on the kid trail on the other side of town.&lt;br/&gt;We educate ourselves, we pay attention, we do what we think we are supposed to and don’t do what we know we aren’t supposed to do. We take precautions, we carry our bear spray and we read the trail signs and ski trail legends and somehow some way something sometimes goes wrong.&lt;br/&gt;Here is your Heart of the Dragon...he is keeping watch over you and scaring away anyone who doesn't want you on their trail and he is keeping an eye on the cow with twins who are intentionally hiding around the bend and he is perched ready to breathe fire on any bruin that wants to mistake you for a tasty moose calf.&lt;br/&gt;When you find him, sometimes, if it’s dark enough and he sees the good “light” of your heart he will glow and remind you he is watching…..&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Many people use that trailhead in the winter late into the evening!) &lt;br/&gt;This is AKRambo's Revenge on AKBfly. AKBfly went to Vegas and I got to stay home with ALL the kids (c: Since AKBfly has been gone I have gotten texts, phone calls and pictures of what a great time she and her husband are having....This is my revenge (okay not really; her kids are easy and I dont have to do much except feed and water them and make sure they don't burn the house down.....)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AKBfly HATES kittens and rainbows and the ONLY time I can get her into their territory is in the winter. She misses out on the pretty things we come across in the boonies in the spring and summer so I thought I would bring AKBFly a little summer via a newly placed winter cache (when kittens are sleeeeeeppiiinnggg).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you KNOW AKBfly you know what she loves. But we didn't want to make it to easy on her so we made sure she put a LOT of what she loves at ground zero. Please don't take them, admire them and think of summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ONE of them contains the log....just one. Please treat what you find with care. They are delicate for out in the open and braving the winter elements but we thought we would give this idea a try and see if it lasts the winter. Don't wait to long to find this cache. The more it snows the harder it will be. Feel free to shake the winter off so they can stretch their wings!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope you have as much fun finding this cache as I had placing it. Its whimsical and cute, no macho ammo can or a container buried in a log. When you happen upon ground zero you will know you are there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring your own pencil, it contains a log only and you may want to bring tweezers as its one of them darn contraptions that make extracting the log difficult.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well went out early this morning and decided to grab a few of the stages today on this one. Figure with no fresh snow I should be able to get to GZ of the stages pretty easy by following on the coat tails (foot steps) of tinman and omonra and meljo. Sure glad the hike to the few I found this morning were close to were I could park, it was -8 degrees at my place this morning and the Campbell Creek area is always colder then any part of town. I think I had a little temp inversion on one of the stages as it felt warmer or it might have been that I was working hard pulling the sled with the gas ice auger. At least the hard stage is done. Now to the lighter work. Not sure where I put my led zepplin sheet and my printer ran out of ink so later today after the hot chocolate warms me up I may try to get back out and find a few more of the stages! But by reading Tinmans log it looks like I may need a spot so I will try to get a hold of him, figure the CO won't go help me on the few I have left as that wouldn't be fair. This is a fun cache though, hope others get out and start grabbing a few of the stages! li1gray

We got out the power tools and set out to explain the answer so that all would understand.  After we had finished we had tools strung out everywhere and still had all of our fingers!  With no battlescars on us, we decided we needed to share the proof of our handiwork and the age old question with...You!  Please be gentle with the camo since we are far from pros at this and it may be delicate.  We hope you get a chuckle out of this as you realize what the question was and that you now have the proof of the answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats Fuzzybelly on the FTF!

This cache is placed in honor of those of us practicing patience for the one we long for most. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is also the starting home for my first TB.

Now that the snow has melted it does appear this area is in quite the state. In fact, if you are looking for a free couch there appears to be one available here. Please practice CITO when you come for my cache. I lugged out quite a bit today but a lot more work could be done. What a mess!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please re camo exactly how you found it otherwise this is a high muggle risk!

This cache is outside the 50' buffer zone as requested by Ft. Richardson conservation officers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trail system close to here is on U.S. Army land and requires a USARTRAK recreational use pass. You can request a pass at the main gate visitors center at Ft. Richardson.  If you choose to make use of these trails or any other Ft. Richardson trails please visit the USARTRAK link listed near the top of this page under &quot;related web page&quot; or just click here: http://www.usarak.army.mil/conservation/REC_USARTRAK.htm It is very easy to do and makes the land managers happy which benefits all outdoor enthusiasts. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This Torturous Slog Mission, if you decide to accept, brings with it the possibility of getting damp or wet depending on the time of the year you want to do this cache. You may run in to bears, moose, foxes or other critters so be careful and be bear aware! You’re in the woods! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the winter you'll enjoy the fact there are no bugs and snowshoes will make it easier.  In the summer a head net will be nice, along with a pair of water proof shoes or boots.  Due to wet summer of 2010, waders are appropriate!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you decide to tackle this mission you will need to bring the following: a bright lighting device to light your way as you will need to find your way following some really neat items called firetacks. Your foot gear and headgear for the time of year and I'd recommend gloves all the time just vary the weight of them! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to act like an ungulate at one point on your travels so plan accordingly large bulky items may make it more difficult for you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little more information will be helpful to know as you slog down the trail of firetacks.  When you find a tree with 2 or more reflectors it is a good idea to inspect this tree for a clue you will need!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We want to wish all good luck and dry feet on you journey! This is a Torturous Slog thru the Park that you will remember for a while we hope!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring batteries, lots of them! Please post in the log how long it took to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrats to Tinman4x on the FTF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find issues on this cache with homeless camps please report them to the Anchorage trailwatch program using the following link, http://www.muni.org/TrailWatch/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New parking update 18 October just off the Dowling Road extension.

(Just kidding) Actually I'm glad we attacked this cache in force,as 14 eyes are alot better than two. 
Also, No bears or bugs although I thought I saw an aligator as we were crossing that &quot;bridge&quot;.
Thanks for the cache.

Almost grabbed the shovels that were in the area of GZ and dug a hole around each tree I searched so I could get to the next one. Didnt come up with anything here except some mosquito bites! Enjoyed the walk back to the geo-rig and walked over to the nearby benches to see the dragonfly monument and little park that was dedicated in 2004. But I think it is more of a mosquito breeding ground though! 2-4-2 on this series of hides, will I get lucky on the last one? So the questons I have are is the cache on backside of the trees away from the main trail? Is it hanging knee high to a grasshopper? Can you come and sign the log for me so LBK doesn't ask me which DNF # this is for me? Thanks for the very good hide. I will bring more bug dope when I come back here again and maybe an electromagnet to pull the cache to me!    li1gray

As always, be on the look out for wildlife.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Cavyguy for the FTF!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: LE2KJ5T - wooley swamp&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

It contains a log book only so bring your own signing utensil.  I really enjoy these trails and walk my dogs on them quite a bit.  In the summer the mosquitoes are horrendous so be prepared.  When the snow flies, there are some pretty steep hills nearby so travel can get interesting to say the least.

This was another cache that took awhile to locate.  AK Jace made the find at 9:40 AM for us.  And wouldn't you know it it was in a place I had already looked and missed it.  We also found a fairly fresh pile the a bear had left in the close by area..

There are no railings, fields of flowers, Coffee shacks or trail maps affixed to wooden frames! Snowshoes are a great idea (in the winter)....and a hiking stick doesn't hurt to help yank your body up the Mountain either. Plan to use the backside God gave you a few times as a sled and you may throw a snowshoe every now and then. When you return, plan on picking devils club out of your gear and hopefully not your skin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come summer, the usual Alaska State bird repellent is a must and if last year was any indication, a shot gun would be great &quot;special equipment&quot;.

&lt;p&gt;The cache is a true park-n-grab, be vigilant while exploring
the&lt;br /&gt;
area, it will be obvious just how many&lt;br /&gt;
opportunities there are to become injured here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most people go about their days visiting retail centers,
sipping&lt;br /&gt;
caramel macchiatos, and picking the kids up from soccer
practice.&lt;br /&gt;
Off the beaten path are places a little more wild than
others,&lt;br /&gt;
places seldom spoken of, yet visited often. These places exist
but&lt;br /&gt;
you'll never find them sticking to your safe, suburban
lifestyles.&lt;br /&gt;
Come explore an area very unlike the &quot;always&quot; caches and &quot;off your
rocker&quot; caches that inundate American suburbia.
&lt;p&gt;A little further down Knik-Goose bay road, along an unmarked
dirt&lt;br /&gt;
road is an abandoned military base. It was built in the 1950s
and&lt;br /&gt;
housed missiles in case of attack from Russia. Cement missile
silos&lt;br /&gt;
and various other buildings still stand. Beware of hunters
and&lt;br /&gt;
paintball gun toting locals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is very near the area where the military working
dogs&lt;br /&gt;
were housed. I thought the construction methods were
interesting&lt;br /&gt;
being concrete over wood. These buildings have only been
abandoned&lt;br /&gt;
less than 30 years but appear to be much older. Inside the
larger&lt;br /&gt;
battery buildings you can still see the steel tracks and
mechanisms&lt;br /&gt;
used to roll out the nike missiles, gigantic boilers and
other&lt;br /&gt;
critical pieces of infrastructure all vandalized to the
fullest&lt;br /&gt;
extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CITO doesn't even begin to describe the work needed on
this&lt;br /&gt;
site. An embarrassment for the state of Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;

HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cache Across America Series:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a
series of caches that will take you on a caching tour of the entire
United States. One cache is hidden in each of the 50 states. These
caches each contain a numeric clue that will lead you to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/bookmarks/view.aspx?guid=945ad12c-cf93-4d79-99ad-c3d727f767da&quot;&gt;
one final cache&lt;/a&gt; located in our nation's capitol upon completion
of the series.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About this cache:&lt;/strong&gt; The Alaskan Cache is placed
along the Reflection Lake Trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the south is the Chugach Mountains which are included in the
Chugach State Park &amp; the Chugach National Forest, America's 2nd
largest national forest. To the southeast is the Knik Glacier and
the northeast is the Matanuska Glacier. To the north is the
Talkeetna Mountains. Gold was discover there in the early 1900's.
The village of Knik, along the Knik arm sprung up as an unloading
point for supplies to be hauled up to the mine. Unloading could
only be done on high tide, so incoming boats would wait at the
mouth of Ship Creek, which become known as the Knik Anchorage. In
1916 when the Alaska Railroad was being built they chose this area
as their construction headquarters and the name was shorten to just
Anchorage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflection Lake is part of the Palmer Hay Flats State Game
Refuge. Cache is winter accesible, but a little more
challenging...&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logging Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; Enjoy this cache as you
would any other. If you are searching this cache as a participant
in the Cache Across America series, please post a photo of yourself
or a member of your group with the cache in your online log. If you
for some reason are unable to meet the photo requirement, please
make alternate arrangements to verify your find with the individual
cache owner. There is no photo requirement for non-challenge
participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual verification of all 50 state finds will be required
before logging the series final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If participating in the series, please take note of the three
digit code located inside this cache. Save this code in a secure
place. When you have visited all 50 caches, and have collected all
50 codes, you are welcome to seek and find the final cache! Good
luck!&lt;/p&gt;

To the south and east is the Chugach range.  To the east and north is the Talkeetna range.  To the west is Mt. Sustina.  To the north and west is the Alaska range, including Mt. McKinley 110 miles away.  The dead trees seen on the way to the cache are reminders of the Miller Reach Fire of 1996, one of Alaska's most destructive wild fires.  Martin Buser, an Iditarod champion, has his kennels just down the road.&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to hixfromthestix on the FTF.  Enjoy the Travel Bug!</groundspeak:long_description>

Some are easier than others...&lt;br/&gt;Depending on snow depth, the cache may not be accessible year round.&lt;br/&gt;Please replace cache as found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I originally planned to place this cache at the Observation Deck located at N 61 34.775  W 149 13.785. But, there was another cache already near there. So I went a little further along and found the perfect spot for a cache. And after some research I realized it was exactly far enough away from the surrounding caches to place mine. As I went to place the hide, I lifted a bush to find the final stage of a multi in that exact spot... I guess great minds think alike...&lt;br/&gt;So I came back a little bit and place this cache on the edge of the the MatSu College Arboretum.  You can read the Frontiersman article about that here: http://m.frontiersman.com/articles/2011/05/31/sports/mat_su-outdoors/doc4ddf4ef570f7a310487798.txt&lt;br/&gt;A map for the extensive MatSu Greenbelt Trails can be found here: https://sites.google.com/site/matanuskagreenbelt/trail-maps&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK36DB2 - GC36DB2 Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 61° 34.689 W 149° 14.306 </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This full size cache is just an easy walk from the end of
buffalo mine road. An uphill hike and a river crossing make it a
little challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A foot bridge to cross Moose Creek is located about 500'
downstream from where the old bridge pilings are at. This will for
sure help keep your feet dry&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Back in the day, (which was a Tuesday) it was not uncommon for Indians to drive small herds of buffalo off such cliffs as highly effective hunting technique. The Buffalo would be rushed into a stampede and vectored over a cliff, effectively breaking their legs and rendering them immobile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While it probably didn't happen at this spot it is still an interesting piece of native american history. What better place to have a Buffalo Leap than at Buffalo mine?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take great care when approaching this location to be sure you do not suffer the same fate as the Buffalo. As with any Alaskan cache always be bear aware. Good Caching! &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a popular spot in September but otherwise pretty quiet the rest of the year. Take some time to hunt down the other caches in this &quot;favorite spot&quot; of mine, 4 wheelers and off-road vehicles welcome on this huge chunk of public land. Keep an eye out for bears, yes, they live here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original contents include: 1 wicked big headlamp, an extra large Rubik's Cube, 5 really big CITO bags, Numerous toys, A pair of huge bear bells, several large white jeeps, and of course an oversized pencil to sign the spacious log book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Bring your large sized swag along, this one has room to spare. Please do your best to hide this special cache container well. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
