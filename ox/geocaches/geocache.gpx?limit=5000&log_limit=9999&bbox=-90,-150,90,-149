Most of the homes and roads in this area would not have been possible without him and a lot of heavy equipment. 

The cache is placed on an undeveloped lot owned by friends of mine who were recently introduced to geocaching. There will be no trouble accessing this cache. Please be respectful of the area and for crying out loud WATCH OUT FOR BEARS!

While in the neighborhood you will really want to seek out another nearby cache GC14F56. It is worth the effort and will remain as one of my all time favorite caches.

If you are lucky enough to get a few pictures of these birds please post them on this cache page.

The high canopy can make the signal weak but not impossible, just let your device settle down a bit. Please take care in replacing the container as you found it &amp; be on the look out for bears. We don't need another Timothy Treadwell story.

Congrats to MTboy for braving the many nearby hazards to earn the FTF on this cache. I may eventually reevaluate the diff/terr rating for this cache, it is not for the faint of heart or novice woodsman.

Keep your eyes open for future CITO events both in Anchorage and along our newly adopted stretch of highway!

There is little in the way of parking but a few close spots exist. Be careful, prying eyes are everywhere. The cache itself is pretty muggle proof but you might get spotted crossing the road on the way to GZ. As usual, please rehide cache exactly as you found it. Thanks and Good Caching!

It appeared to be just another unnamed social trail leading to a undocumented grow operation or hippy camp. Instead we found a sweet trail system loaded with caching opportunitys. The recommended start is from the California Creek trailhead. 

As usual, watch for lions, tigers, and bears!

That's OK, because I committed the photo to memory and I recognized the area once at GZ.
45 minutes later, I was about to call it quits, when Klondike Kate mentioned that NorthWes made the last find.
NORTHWES found it ? Well if HE found it, ANYBODY can, so we're going to camp here until we find it, if we have to stay here all week.
Fortunately we didn't have to.  Got dirty, SL.
Thanks for the challenge.

Use extreme STEALTHLYNESS....Not only is Girdwood known for Alyeska, they also have some pretty good food around here. A lot of the caches on Turnagain arm bring you to a spectacular view.... This cache brings you something a little &quot;different&quot; in regard to spectacular. Watch out for Limo's and Prom Dresses.....

Congrats KMags for FTF!! 
A large ammo can hidden in Moose Meadow. Cache will be easier to retrieve in the middle of summer then the wetter months. This area can be marshy. I placed this cache in an combined effort with Foshiz_AK and AKBfly to increase Girdwoods Cache population. Girdwood is such a short but beautiful summer or winter drive when you are looking to get out for just part of the day or evening.

FTF Prize Cold Stone Gift Card
Cache's original contents:
15 dollar Cold Stone Gift Card
Tissue x 2
Alaska's 50th Anniversary Pin
&quot;Nano Stapler&quot;

Refridgerator Notepad
Lightening McQueen Colored Pencils

The Ammo can also contains a bottle of Mosquito Spray. Please use it then place it back in the cache for the next guy who is being attacked!

While exploring the rainforest check out Abe's Trail or follow California Creek Trail all the way to the end.

Like all caches in the Alaskan woods be sure to watch out for bears and other wildlife. 

Enjoy the hunt.

After the quick hike back in we did find this cache first by sound of the ski pole strike and after a little digging I even had my hands on the handle of this ammo can. The earth had a better grip with the recent thaw and refreeze we had, making this a cache that is not going to be coming out without a jack hammer or a piece of dynamite! So instead we left it alone and covered it with the stuff that was there and CH took a picture to prove we had the right location. What a great way to end my birthday with what was gonna be a DNF, to a cache find!  TNLN, TFTC li1gray

Be careful stepping off the trail in the snow. There are all kinds of surprises under the snow. In the summer this one will be well protected by devil's club.

This cache will test your imagination more than your caching prowess. The easy yet considerable walk between stages will give you time to come up with an interesting &quot;Liar's log&quot;. 

I'm hoping for some real doozys, with one tall tale topping the last and so on to make for some of the most interesting, creative liars logs ever read. It could for example have to deal with a natural disaster, a muggle mugging, or the rabid marmots you encountered while on the hunt. The sky is the limit here folks.

While I would never delete a log for not following the &quot;rule&quot; of this cache (not to mention that would be against groundspeak rules), please try to come up with something good to keep with the spirit of the game.

Flex your imagination; I know there are some local cachers with the creative flare to make this a fun one. Happy hunting!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Thought I would try for this cache using just my sense of smell, so I blindfolded myself and drove up to the Chugach State Park Trailhead and parked in the handicap parking slot. It took a while to acclimate myself to the overload of odiferous smells being processed by my nostrils, but I soon found the first stage and deducing that it was a multi-cache, took off the blindfold and was surprised to see MTboy and Ridgeseeker.  I asked them if they would like to go up to Flattop with me and MTboy replied that it was beyond his capability, and besides, Keri had told him to do the dishes. Ridgeseeker said that now that he was retired, he only did drive-up caches.  
Well, I had stage 2 to find so I left them and headed down the trail and looked down and found an old pocket watch. I was thinking that this would be good swag for a cache when I met a fellow on the trail who had lost it and was overjoyed when I returned it to him. So overjoyed in fact that he gave me 10 Billion dollars! (I know, I couldn’t believe it either) Most of it was in $1 dollar bills, so I’m wondering what time the Bush Company opens.  Then I thought that I should share my good fortune with others. 
Klondike Kate’s parents always wanted her to marry rich, so they were deeply depressed when she married me … they still cry themselves to sleep at night.  When we first got married people would ask if we had kids what would we name it if it was a boy. I replied that with my Greek ancestry and with her Polish ancestry, we could name him Zorba the dumb$hi@.  So with my newfound wealth, I may move up to #1 son-in-law!
So I’ve decided to share the wealth! 
I offered a new motorized wheelchair, with chains for winter caching, to tomanoble but he declined saying that he was getting along pretty well with crutches … so I took one of the crutches and broke his other leg at which time he reconsidered my offer. Other gifts include:
LBK – A six pack of dogs, because sometimes 8 isn’t enough.
Scobey- A six pack
Trove Rover- A new George Forman Grill so she can have us over for a BBQ.
Tinman- A can of WD-40
Deke Rivers – A new comb
Malcore- A Spell Checker
Capra Hircus – A herd of goats … Walk the walk bucko!
Bike&amp;Ski –New bike of course, with training wheels
I can’t remember if I found stage 2 or not, but I must have or I wouldn’t be writing this.

CONGRATS Meljo and Omonra for a CO-FTF Glad you liked it, the kids will be ecstatic! 

If I had another adult with me I could have made this more &quot;clever&quot; but I think the kids and I did pretty good without even without extra help. Extra mobility probobly would have gone a long way too. The caching kidlets were wanting to place something a little more &quot;devious&quot; and out of the ordinary and had seen a placement like this before and wanted to give it a try. Its VERY winter friendly. Its a nice warm up to the other caches farther in or....you can wait to do this one on your way out. Cause I am sure you 'gotta go' and we even found a place for you!

CONGRATS Meljo and AKBike&amp;Ski for your CO FTF! Your logs are great and made me laugh (c: Glad you had a fun day! 
TomANoble you DO get extra points for spotting me at the cache site (c: Whats fun about this placement is I have a addiction for the &quot;dark roast&quot; in the area so you have a good chance of finding me along with the cache....

Not tough. Not hard. Pull up, get out, grab it and sign the log, put it back...

I am in this parking lot at least once a day for my cheap coffee and found the perfect birthday present for Manpie across the street...I hear another local cacher frequents this area too (c;

It is a small container. The cache can handle TB's if it’s not too large. However, I wouldn’t put travel bugs in this container as it is a pretty busy spot with LOTS of muggles. In fact the cache really may be too large for this area and I may replace with a smaller bison next weekend to make it a little less conspicuous.

Cache on Geobuddies!

CONGRATS TEAM MEISTER for FTF! And on a VERY cold snowing morning...Brrrrrr you get extra points for that! 

Not a night cache, but would be &quot;fun to find in the dark with a flashlight&quot;
The area is a place many of us love and love to hate. Ski trails and hiking trails abound but littered with bears, moose and sometimes scary two legged critters. We love to spend time here as well as the BLM, however, as much as we love it, it makes our hearts pound when a tree rustles or, we think we hear a low growl or catch a faint whiff of a funny smell that can only be associated with something large, furry with sharp teeth and claws. Our hearts leap out of our chest when we round a bend or sharp corner and are face to face with a Cow and Twins....
We love to ski, skijor, cross country and sled but fear we are on the wrong trail, in the wrong track or we are on the &quot;expert&quot; trail when our novice hiney's shoulda been on the kid trail on the other side of town.
We educate ourselves, we pay attention, we do what we think we are supposed to and don’t do what we know we aren’t supposed to do. We take precautions, we carry our bear spray and we read the trail signs and ski trail legends and somehow some way something sometimes goes wrong.
Here is your Heart of the Dragon...he is keeping watch over you and scaring away anyone who doesn't want you on their trail and he is keeping an eye on the cow with twins who are intentionally hiding around the bend and he is perched ready to breathe fire on any bruin that wants to mistake you for a tasty moose calf.
When you find him, sometimes, if it’s dark enough and he sees the good “light” of your heart he will glow and remind you he is watching…..

CONGRATS TEAM MEISTER for FTF!
(I came back by at 8:21 and the gates were closed too...I plan on giving a &quot;call&quot; to find out what is going on. Many people use that trailhead in the winter late into the evening!) 
This is AKRambo's Revenge on AKBfly. AKBfly went to Vegas and I got to stay home with ALL the kids (c: Since AKBfly has been gone I have gotten texts, phone calls and pictures of what a great time she and her husband are having....This is my revenge (okay not really; her kids are easy and I dont have to do much except feed and water them and make sure they don't burn the house down.....)

AKBfly HATES kittens and rainbows and the ONLY time I can get her into their territory is in the winter. She misses out on the pretty things we come across in the boonies in the spring and summer so I thought I would bring AKBFly a little summer via a newly placed winter cache (when kittens are sleeeeeeppiiinnggg).

If you KNOW AKBfly you know what she loves. But we didn't want to make it to easy on her so we made sure she put a LOT of what she loves at ground zero. Please don't take them, admire them and think of summer.

ONE of them contains the log....just one. Please treat what you find with care. They are delicate for out in the open and braving the winter elements but we thought we would give this idea a try and see if it lasts the winter. Don't wait to long to find this cache. The more it snows the harder it will be. Feel free to shake the winter off so they can stretch their wings!

Hope you have as much fun finding this cache as I had placing it. Its whimsical and cute, no macho ammo can or a container buried in a log. When you happen upon ground zero you will know you are there.

Bring your own pencil, it contains a log only and you may want to bring tweezers as its one of them darn contraptions that make extracting the log difficult.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well went out early this morning and decided to grab a few of the stages today on this one. Figure with no fresh snow I should be able to get to GZ of the stages pretty easy by following on the coat tails (foot steps) of tinman and omonra and meljo. Sure glad the hike to the few I found this morning were close to were I could park, it was -8 degrees at my place this morning and the Campbell Creek area is always colder then any part of town. I think I had a little temp inversion on one of the stages as it felt warmer or it might have been that I was working hard pulling the sled with the gas ice auger. At least the hard stage is done. Now to the lighter work. Not sure where I put my led zepplin sheet and my printer ran out of ink so later today after the hot chocolate warms me up I may try to get back out and find a few more of the stages! But by reading Tinmans log it looks like I may need a spot so I will try to get a hold of him, figure the CO won't go help me on the few I have left as that wouldn't be fair. This is a fun cache though, hope others get out and start grabbing a few of the stages! li1gray

Took the energy gel from the cache so it wouldn't attract animals, particularly bears and left a TB.

This is my first hide so go easy on me. It is an Ammo Can and full of swag. This cache is placed in honor of those of us practicing patience for the one we long for most. 

This is also the starting home for my first TB. Please pick it up and send it on it's way. It is very important to me for it to get to its final destination.

CONGRATULATIONS AK-DSP for FTF
The cache was placed at -11, so FTF at -12 beat my &quot;being a man&quot; factor! LOL

CONGRAUTLATIONS to Tex AK for 2nd TF

Wanted to post a note regarding what I &quot;Found&quot; today. Now that the snow has melted it does appear this area is in quite the state. In fact, if you are looking for a free couch there appears to be one available here. Please practice CITO when you come for my cache. I lugged out quite a bit today but a lot more work could be done. What a mess!

Please re camo exactly how you found it otherwise this is a high muggle risk! It will be an easier camo once it snows or spring time hits...whichever comes first!

The trail system close to here is on U.S. Army land and requires a USARTRAK recreational use pass. You can request a pass at the main gate visitors center at Ft. Richardson.  If you choose to make use of these trails or any other Ft. Richardson trails please visit the USARTRAK link listed near the top of this page under &quot;related web page&quot; or just click here: http://www.usarak.army.mil/conservation/REC_USARTRAK.htm It is very easy to do and makes the land managers happy which benefits all outdoor enthusiasts.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This Torturous Slog Mission, if you decide to accept, brings with it the possibility of getting damp or wet depending on the time of the year you want to do this cache. You may run in to bears, moose, foxes or other critters so be careful and be bear aware! You’re in the woods! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the winter you'll enjoy the fact there are no bugs and snowshoes will make it easier.  In the summer a head net will be nice, along with a pair of water proof shoes or boots.  Due to wet summer of 2010, waders are appropriate!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So if you decide to tackle this mission you will need to bring the following: a bright lighting device to light your way as you will need to find your way following some really neat items called firetacks. Your foot gear and headgear for the time of year and I'd recommend gloves all the time just vary the weight of them! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need to act like an ungulate at one point on your travels so plan accordingly large bulky items may make it more difficult for you. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A little more information will be helpful to know as you slog down the trail of firetacks.  When you find a tree with 2 or more reflectors it is a good idea to inspect this tree for a clue you will need!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We want to wish all good luck and dry feet on you journey! This is a Torturous Slog thru the Park that you will remember for a while we hope!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring batteries, lots of them! Please post in the log how long it took to finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Tinman4x on the FTF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you find issues on this cache with homeless camps please report them to the Anchorage trailwatch program using the following link, http://www.muni.org/TrailWatch/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New parking update 18 October just off the Dowling Road extension.

(Just kidding) Actually I'm glad we attacked this cache in force,as 14 eyes are alot better than two. 
Also, No bears or bugs although I thought I saw an aligator as we were crossing that &quot;bridge&quot;.
Thanks for the cache.

BYOP While out cache hunting with a geobuddy we passed by this place on our way to a woody find. Impressed by this midway point it became clear a cache MUST be placed. As luck would have it I had a cache ready to go in my pack and McGyvered the rest. This is a certainly a terrain &quot;1&quot; in the winter and a &quot;5&quot; come spring. 

This cache is placed in honor of all those that &quot;drew first blood&quot; before me.....for all those cache's I have scratched my head at, thinking, &quot;How am I going to get THERE?&quot;

CONGRATULATIONS to AK4Me and Kmags as the FTF Team. </groundspeak:long_description>

Almost grabbed the shovels that were in the area of GZ and dug a hole around each tree I searched so I could get to the next one. Didnt come up with anything here except some mosquito bites! Enjoyed the walk back to the geo-rig and walked over to the nearby benches to see the dragonfly monument and little park that was dedicated in 2004. But I think it is more of a mosquito breeding ground though! 2-4-2 on this series of hides, will I get lucky on the last one? So the questons I have are is the cache on backside of the trees away from the main trail? Is it hanging knee high to a grasshopper? Can you come and sign the log for me so LBK doesn't ask me which DNF # this is for me? Thanks for the very good hide. I will bring more bug dope when I come back here again and maybe an electromagnet to pull the cache to me!    li1gray

When the snow flies, there are some pretty steep hills nearby so travel can get interesting to say the least. Watch out for wildlife and if you spot me and my dogs we don't count as wildlife!

Not long ago, when I first learned to use my GPS, I was told to enter my name and phone number in the set up page.  The guy telling me this said to count on honest people in the world and if my GPS was ever lost, this would give that honest person a way to contact me to return it.

Well, sure enough.  I was hiking up Flat Top last week and somehow dropped my GPS without realizing it. (?????)  Anyway, I couldn't find it anywhere and just hoped against hope that whoever might have picked it up would have an interest in finding its owner.  It was my lucky day, because the guy who found it did indeed turn it on, saw my name and number, and gave me a call before I had even gotten back down off the mountain.

His voicemail said,  &quot;My name is Guido and I have your GPS&quot;.  Music to my ears!  [:)]

THANK YOU GUIDO!!!!!!!

On another subject:  I wasn't sure how to rate the difficulty of this hide.  I was thinking a 3 for summer and maybe a 2 for winter, so I picked a 2.5.  I'll be happy to move up or down the scale as feedback comes in.

Thanks for the update on coordinates from &quot;Allinone&quot; for this cache. I ran into him up in earthquake park while he was doing some caching nearby. 
Then met &quot;mr.fixit and family as they were out caching in the area as well. Hope to see them both back out on the cahing trail again soon! 
Ran into a cow moose and 2 calves coming down the trail from the parking lot and some lady from &quot;down under jusrt rode slowly by the moose and mom charged her! Pretty scary to see but she didn't even look back and didn't realize she could have been very seriously hurt! TFTC Li1gray

If you have been here fishing, then you know the hazards of the terrain.  If you haven't, beware!  Muddy area, deep (about 4-6 ft) stream beds.  Can be treacherous during high tides. Normal tides are generally OK.

On the way to this cache you will not find any bathrooms, pavement, gravel, or resting benches at look out points. There are no railings, fields of flowers, Coffee shacks or trail maps affixed to wooden frames! Snowshoes are a great idea (in the winter)....and a hiking stick doesn't hurt to help yank your body up the Mountain either. Plan to use the backside God gave you a few times as a sled and you may throw a snowshoe every now and then. When you return, plan on picking devils club out of your gear and hopefully not your skin.

Come summer, the usual Alaska State bird repellent is a must and if last year was any indication, a shot gun would be great &quot;special equipment&quot;. Basically, as usual, bear aware.

We may make this the beginning of a new series called &quot;Bragging Rights&quot; We felt pretty darn proud of ourselves for accomplishing this and you should too!

Please do not attempt this cache in the dark even with your night caching &quot;flood lights&quot;. There are a few bluffs and I don't want anyone falling off of them.

Parking: If you park at the end of River View Drive please note this is a Fire Truck Fill Site. There is no parking allowed except for parallel to the chain link fence 150 ft or so from the end.

Thank you AK4me and Kmags for making this Trek with me. I couldn't have done it without my geobuddies (c:

Please make sure to re-hide the cache well, for some reason this little patch of rocks gets a lot of foot traffic.

This one will remain available in any season but keep in mind the avelanche dangers during Winter months and of course bears during the warmer months.

Cache placed I.A.W. Chugach State Park permit 09-076

Make sure to hunt the other two caches along this fun ridge run before calling it a day!

Congrats to cavyguy for hunting this one down 4 months after publishing for a memorable FTF!

&lt;p&gt;The cache is a true park-n-grab, be vigilant while exploring
the&lt;br/&gt;
area, it will be obvious just how many&lt;br/&gt;
opportunities there are to become injured here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Most people go about their days visiting retail centers,
sipping&lt;br/&gt;
caramel macchiatos, and picking the kids up from soccer
practice.&lt;br/&gt;
Off the beaten path are places a little more wild than
others,&lt;br/&gt;
places seldom spoken of, yet visited often. These places exist
but&lt;br/&gt;
you'll never find them sticking to your safe, suburban
lifestyles.&lt;br/&gt;
Come explore an area very unlike the &quot;always&quot; caches and &quot;off your
rocker&quot; caches that inundate American suburbia.
&lt;p&gt;A little further down Knik-Goose bay road, along an unmarked
dirt&lt;br/&gt;
road is an abandoned military base. It was built in the 1950s
and&lt;br/&gt;
housed missiles in case of attack from Russia. Cement missile
silos&lt;br/&gt;
and various other buildings still stand. Beware of hunters
and&lt;br/&gt;
paintball gun toting locals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is very near the area where the military working
dogs&lt;br/&gt;
were housed. I thought the construction methods were
interesting&lt;br/&gt;
being concrete over wood. These buildings have only been
abandoned&lt;br/&gt;
less than 30 years but appear to be much older. Inside the
larger&lt;br/&gt;
battery buildings you can still see the steel tracks and
mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;
used to roll out the nike missiles, gigantic boilers and
other&lt;br/&gt;
critical pieces of infrastructure all vandalized to the
fullest&lt;br/&gt;
extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CITO doesn't even begin to describe the work needed on
this&lt;br/&gt;
site. An embarrassment for the state of Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;

The Buffalo would be rushed into a stampede and vectored over a cliff, effectively breaking their legs and rendering them immobile.

While it probably didn't happen at this spot it is still an interesting piece of native american history. What better place to have a Buffalo Leap than at Buffalo mine?

Take great care when approaching this location to be sure you do not suffer the same fate as the Buffalo. As with any Alaskan cache always be bear aware. Good Caching!
