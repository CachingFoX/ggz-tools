hispano portuguesa na maior parte de seu percurso, afluente da
margem direita do &lt;a href=&quot;http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Tejo&quot;&gt;
Tejo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

de &lt;a href=&quot;http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alc%C3%A1ntara&quot;&gt;
Alcántara&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;







&lt;p&gt;

O rio Erges corre aproximadamente de Norte para Sul, afluindo na margem direita do
rio Tejo. O seu vale, em V, é relativamente estreito e profundo, e,
principalmente nas cotas inferiores, devido à acção erosiva do rio,
pode observar-se uma esteira de afloramentos xistosos no interior
dos quais corre. Durante o Verão o caudal é fraco, restando os
pegos por vezes longos e profundos. No Inverno, a situação
inverte-se e pode transformar-se num curso de água com algum
significado.&lt;/p&gt;

 
&lt;p&gt;

No vale do rio Tejo as margens são abruptas, encontram-se
revestidas por denso matagal, sendo de difícil acesso. Toda a
margem primitiva, com maior probabilidade de conter
gravuras rupestres,
encontra-se submersa pelas águas da albufeira criada pela barragem
de Cedillo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

A jusante de Salvaterra do Extremo, o curso do Erges banha o
Parque Natural do Tejo Internacional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

O canhão fluvial do rio Erges, caracterizado por possuir o maior
afloramento rochoso de origem granítica na região do Tejo
Internacional, assume especial relevância por constituir um
importante local de nidificação e de repouso para várias espécies
de aves necrófagas e
rupícolas como o britango Neophron percnopterus, a águia de
Bonelli Bonelli Hieraaetus fasciatus, a águia-calçada Hieraaetus
pennatus e a águia-cobreira Circaetus gallicus. Neste singular
património paisagístico, onde os efeitos da erosão das águas do rio
Erges formaram três gargantas numa curta distância, podem ainda
observar-se diversas espécies de andorinhas Hirundinidae, o
melro-azul Monticola solitarius, o borrelho-pequeno-de-coleira
Charadrius dubius, o guarda-rios Alcedo atthis, o abelharuco Merops
apiaster, bem como diversos passeriformes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;






&lt;p&gt;

A CACHE&lt;/p&gt;
O desafio desta cache é muito simples, navegar até ao Erges, o nome
diz tudo.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Como geocacher exemplar deve fazer algum trabalho de casa e depois
fazer algum trabalho de campo, para que a navegação possibilite um
found sem problemas.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
O emaranhado de caminhos pode gerar algum desespero, mas o GPS'r dá
sempre uma boa ajuda.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Chegados ao local disfrutem ... 
&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 







&lt;p&gt;O
Castelo de Peñafiel
encontra-se assente numa penha que lhe serve de pedestal e de onde
se vê o vazio do desfiladeiro sobre o rio Erges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supõe-se que este
castelo teve a sua origem na época em que os muçulmanos dominavam a
Península Ibérica, as primeiras construções são do Séc.IX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antigamente chamavam-lhe Castelo de
Racha Rachel numa alusão ao tipo de rocha com a qual foi
construído.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esta edificação, a partir do Séc.
XI, ganhou força e importância por muita da sua gente se dedicar ao
mundo militar. Esta importância aumentou a partir de 1166 porque os
árabes entenderam organizar uma cadeia de castelos, que controlavam
a fronteira entre o reino árabe e o reino cristão.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foi conquistado, em 1212, pelo rei
Alfonso IX o qual passou a denominá-lo por Castelo de Peñafiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Até ao ano de 1410 o Castelo de
Peñafiel era um lugar muito povoado, a partir desse ano este, e
outros povoados dos castelos vizinhos, viram a sua população
mudar-se para a Villa la Zarza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No ano de 1640 já se encontrava em
ruínas devido à Guerra da Independência, mas nunca perdeu o seu
porte altivo. Mesmo nessa época, devido à lenda de que existe um
tesouro de ouro, do tempo dos mouros, escondido nas suas ruínas,
muitas pessoas o visitavam para o procurarem entre os seus
escombros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Descrevendo um pouco como era o
Castelo: existia uma muralha unida por uma calçada de pedra à porta
principal do recinto interior. Hoje não resta nada desta muralha
que olhava o vizinho Portugal, foi substituída por um precipício
com o Rio Erges ao fundo e que ainda hoje separa as terras destes
dois países.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outras dependências que existiam
neste recinto: cozinha, cavalariças, forno, armazém, cisterna e
casa de amassar. Outra parte do recinto estava dedicada à horta e à
terra de cultivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;






&lt;p&gt;Mas, o
que é realmente espectacular nesta fortaleza, é a Torre de
Menagem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tem
três níveis de altura: o piso inferior, ao qual se tinha acesso por
uma porta e que estava dividido em duas partes, um forno e um
calabouço, cujo acesso era feito por uma abertura no primeiro piso;
o primeiro piso, cuja entrada era feita pelo exterior por um aporta
oposta à anterior e à qual se acedia por uma escada em cantaria que
já não existe; o segundo piso, ao qual se chegava por uma escada de
cantaria construída com as reformas do séc.XVI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O
tecto que separava o primeiro do segundo piso era de
madeira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;






Os elementos
arquitectónicos a destacar na Torre de Menagem são a Janela Gótica
do segundo piso e a abóbada com adornos em granito que se
concentram num escudo, que se diz ser Português.


&lt;br/&gt;







&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Torre termina
num terraço, estava decorada por dois parapeitos aos quais já
faltam alguns elementos. Esta torre gótica data de meados ou da
segunda metade do séc XIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Este é um dos
castelos melhor conservados de toda a província de Cáceres, em
parte porque se encontra afastado das populações vizinhas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Hoje
é uma reserva biológica. Pertence a particulares e encontra-se à
venda, mas o seu acesso é livre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
RECOMENDAÇÕES


&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O local onde se
encontra a cache é de fácil acesso, no entanto é necessário algum
cuidado porque se encontra relativamente próximo de uma falésia,
assim, devem ter extrema atenção se a tentarem encontrar durante a
noite e/ou acompanhados de crianças.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levem binóculos e
observem as imensas aves de rapina que habitam nas imediações&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Não se esqueçam
de observar com atenção a abóbada da Torre de Menagem onde existe
uma colónia de morcegos, que nos pediram para continuar sossegados,
por favor!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devem ter cuidado
com o estado de ruína de algumas estruturas, pelo que não arrisquem
a vossa integridade nem a do monumento.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ACESSOS:&lt;/b&gt; O acesso a esta cache pode ser feito por
dois itinerários diferentes&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Acesso 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na estrada que
vai para Salvaterra do Extremo seguir a indicação à esquerda para
“Vale de Idanha” e “Rio Erges” (N39 53,065 e W06 55,666), até
chegar ao açude (N39 53,718 e W06 54,263), aí deve atravessar a
fronteira e dirigir-se para N39 53,007 e W06 52,413, onde encontra
as indicações para “Castillo de Peñafiel”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Este último
percurso exige algum cuidado, embora tenha zonas mais irregulares é
passível de ser feito por uma viatura normal (4x2). Chegados ao
local de Estacionamento (N39 52,908 e W06 53,408) vai
encontrar  uma cancela de gado que pode
abrir, passar e voltar a fechar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O percurso final
até à cache é cerca de 1000m, demorando aproximadamente 15 minutos
(a andar devagar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Acesso 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Este acesso tem
&lt;b&gt;Terreno 4&lt;/b&gt; pelo que é necessário ponderar a sua
utilização.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Em Salvaterra do
Extremo estacionar em N39 52,926 e W06 54,657 e seguir para N39
52,920 e W06 54,538 onde se encontra a indicação de um Percurso
Pedestre que deve seguir até chegar ao Rio Erges. A partir daqui é

TERMAS DE
MONFORTINHO




&lt;br/&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Nas faldas da
serra de Penha Garcia, onde o rio Erges a rompe na corrida para o
Tejo, situa-se a Fonte Santa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Os romanos,
nas andanças por estas terras, interessaram-se pelas
águas da serra de Penha Garcia. Sem um fim medicinal,
tiveram termas na Mansatela, Salvador, Ramiro, Penha Garcia, Foro,
Badanais, Brejos, Gorgolão, Monfortinho e Fonte Santa.
Parece que as termas romanas, na Fonte Santa, tiveram a sua plena
actividade, um pouco mais acima, junto do rio Erges, ao fundo da
Veiga do Cravo.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;br/&gt;









&lt;br/&gt;




Antes das guerras da
restauração, Monfortinho era uma
povoação de certo valor social. Além de uma
igreja paroquial tinha um convento. Desses tempos, temos ainda a
capela da Senhora da Consolação e as antigas imagens
da Senhora da Consolação, de S. Pedro, do
Espírito Santo e de São Sebastião. Foi
destruída pelos espanhóis depois de 1640. Monfortinho
tornou-se uma propriedade rural de um só dono.




&lt;br/&gt;






Na história das Termas de
Monfortinho, toma particular relevo o médico Dr. José
Gardete Martins, que, com abnegada dedicação e
sacrificando toda a sua vida e haveres, obteve a concessão
da “exploração da indústria
crenoterápica e a exploração das nascentes de
água minero-medicinal de Monfortinho” por
alvará publicado em 20 de Dezembro de 1906, primeiro passo
para a fundação da  Companhia das Águas
da Fonte Santa de Monfortinho no dia 19 de Dezembro de 1907.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Até esta data, e depois durante longos anos, o Dr.
José Gardete Martins lutou com sérias dificuldades
para angariar capitais, no desejo de fazer de Monfortinho umas
Termas dignas de poderem ser famosas e úteis à
humanidade do ponto de vista clínico, sem conseguir
encontrar quem o compreendesse. Por fim, a Providência trouxe
à sua presença o ilustre beirão e
incansável batalhador, o Sr. Conde da Covilhã, que
enfrentando uma terrível tarefa realizou o que pode
chamar-se um milagre, transformando o que era quase selva, neste
aprazível oásis, apreciado por todos.




&lt;br/&gt;




É uma obra do Arquitecto
Vasco Pereira de Lacerda Marques. O projecto inicial tem a sua
assinatura e é datado de 1938. Em 1940, foi inaugurado o
edifício que agora se remodelou bem como o Hotel da Fonte
Santa. Com essas obras deu-se a grande explosão termal que
há muito se tornava necessária.
&lt;p&gt;O
belíssimo balneário das termas foi sujeito, em 2001,
a uma profunda remodelação, efectuada pelo Arquitecto
José Luís Teixeira Pinto. Toda a infra-estrutura foi
reorganizada e modernizada criando um novo ambiente de bem-estar
com áreas modernas de repouso e relaxamento.&lt;/p&gt;










As
águas da Fonte Santa de Monfortinho são águas
termais hipossalinas, tendo como características
químicas dominantes: elevada percentagem de sílica e
alto teor de anidrido carbónico. O caudal atinge os 25
l/segundo. 
&lt;p&gt;Estas
águas são aconselhadas para doenças
crónicas da pele (psoríase, eczemas, acne, celulite,
úlceras), hepato-vesiculares e intestinais,
reumáticas (artrose, espondilose, tendinite, fibromialgia,
etc), das vias respiratórias (rinite, sinusite), litiase
renal.&lt;/p&gt;

O VAU:
 
 
 
Uma praia fluvial, usada frequentemente pelas gentes da
 nossa terra é um sitio optimo para relaxar, especialmente no calor
 do verão onde nos podemos refrescar nas aguas do rio Agueda, um dos
 afluente do Douro, que nele desagua em Barca de Alva.
 
 
 
O acesso faz-se atravez de um caminho mais ou menos alcatroado a meio da estrada nacional 221 de Escalhão para Barca de Alva.
 
 
 
È aconselhável prudencia ao descer o caminho sempre com o carro engatado a fim de evitar sobreaquecer os travões porque o declive e muito acentuado.
 
 
 
A Cache:
 
A cache e um pequeno recipiente de plastico
 embrulhado num saco azul. Contém inicialmente uma log sheet, lapis
 e os habituais presentes para troca.

El dominio del es­tra­té­gico &quot;pasillo de Grado&quot; en su punto más crítico, el puente de Pe­ña­flor, fue ob­jeto de en­co­nada de­fensa y desen­fre­na­dos ata­ques que lle­ga­ron a de­jar más de 600 víc­timas en un sólo día. Al va­lor re­me­mo­ra­tivo de este lu­gar, im­preg­nado de His­to­ria, se une el pa­tri­mo­nial. Aban­do­nado el campo de ba­ta­lla, la ve­ge­ta­ción ocultó y pre­servó durante tres cuar­tos de si­glo las obras de­fen­si­vas que hoy son un ex­tra­or­di­na­rio ejem­plo de la in­ge­nie­ría mi­li­tar de la época, tes­ti­gos de la pér­dida de tan­tas vi­das que for­man parte de nues­tra his­to­ria más ín­tima, vin­cu­la­dos como están a un con­flicto bru­tal que en­frentó a nues­tros antepasados.
En este escenario se halla el cache. Para acceder a él se debe estacionar el vehículo en el aparcamiento del área recreativa de &quot;La Degollada&quot; y ascender por una pista al pico Pedroso, siguiendo el itinerario señalizado como &quot;Ruta 3&quot; que parte del misma área recreativa. Al llegar a la cima veremos un sendero de gravilla que sale a nuestra izquierda (hacia el Este). Ya estamos muy cerca. Nada más llegar a la zona arbolada veremos un amontonamiento natural de grande piedras. Bajo una de ellas está escondido el &quot;tesoro&quot;.

&amp; also introduce you to a bit of the history of the town of
Dromore. The initial coordinates are to a parking area that you may
choose to start your search from.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Trilateration&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is the
use of geometry to find the positions of objects by their relative
distances, rather than using angles as in trigonometry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to complete this cache, you will need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) Motorised transportation (or be a seasoned cyclist or
hiker!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) A compass and Ordnance Survey Discoverer Sheet 20
(Craigavon) 1:50000 Map&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(c) Paper &amp; pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would also be useful to have plenty of time, good skill in
handling a GPS receiver, and some knowledge of applied co-ordinate
geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each waypoint will give you a &quot;range&quot; in metres which is it's
distance from the final cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit the four supplied waypoints (in any order). At each
waypoint follow the instructions to obtain the distance in metres
from that waypoint to the final location of the cache. Once you
have obtained at least three of these you can use these to
establish the location of the final cache at the point where the
distance arcs intersect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final coordinates will take you to a parking point very
close to the cache. The parking point is on private property.
Permission has been sought &amp; given from the owner for this
purpose. Please allow access to &amp; from the property for
vehicles &amp; take care on the main road as, depending on the time
of day, &amp; season, traffic can be heavy &amp; travelling at high
speed alongside the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;YOU DO NOT NEED TO ENTER THE PROPERTY
TO FIND THE CACHE&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Waypoint will lead you to the &lt;b&gt;&quot;The Pinnacle Meadows&quot;&lt;/b&gt;
where a memorial to Bishop Percy was erected by his friend Thomas
Stott. What remains today is the base of the memorial but this
illustration shows the original memorial as having a tapering
pillar on the top of what exists today. The base remains in what
has now become the Town Park and the name still survives in &quot;The
Pinnacle Youth Club&quot; which exists in connection with the High
School across the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This waypoint will lead you to &lt;b&gt;The Cowan Heron Hospital&lt;/b&gt;
at Dromore, a building steeped in history. A plaque above the
entrance door, states the hospital was erected in 1898 by William
Cowan Heron, D.L., J.P., who in those days had his home at
&quot;Altafort,&quot; Skeogh, about three miles from the town. Below the
plaque is a heron and the words &quot;Avec Ma Vie&quot; (with my blood), and
above the door is this quotation from the Book of the Prophet of
Isaiah: &quot;Comfort ye my people, saith your God.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Waypoint will take you to the &lt;b&gt;Town Hall&lt;/b&gt; &amp; the
Town Clock. Some four years after the present Town Hall was built
the Clock was installed in the turret as a gift to the townspeople
by Mr. William Cowan Heron. In January 1891 Cowan Heron was
presented with an illuminated address by the people of Dromore as a
thank you token for his generous gift of the clock. The address
hangs inside the Cottage Hospital along with his portrait. It would
appear from the text of the address that there were several reasons
why the gift of the clock gave pleasure. As to why the clock was
not installed in the tower when the building was completed in 1886
becomes apparent as the address is read in full. It would appear
that even with the powers granted to the Town Commissioners they
hesitated at incurring any further expense to the townspeople by
purchasing a clock for the tower and thus providing a benefit to
the town. The text goes on to thank the Cowan Heron Family for the
gift of the clock and to say that as time flies, the added
appearance to the Town Hall will serve as a reminder of the
donor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 125 years after its installation the clock is still going
though it has had a long and sometimes arduous history as many down
through the years have sought to keep this time piece going with a
degree of accuracy. A series of articles entitled &quot;Historic Clocks
of Down&quot; by W. H. Carson and published in the Mourne Observer
carries a feature on the Dromore Town Clock in its' issue dated
11th May, 1978. From that article we glean that Berringer Bros., of
Belfast were the contractors who erected the clock in the turret
and M. Byrne of the Fountain Head Bell Foundry, Dublin, cast and
hung the clock bell. Whilst Berringer Bros. were not turret clock
makers it is presumed that the clock would have been brought in
from one of the turret clock makers in England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The style of the clock consists of four white faces each having
a diameter of 44 inches and the black hands measuring 18 in and 12
in. The hours are in black roman numerals. The clock faces light at
night and the clock strikes the hours in a light tenor note. The
dial facing Church Street has a patch between the hours of 3 and 4
believed to date from a night in 1920 when it is said that the &quot;B&quot;
Specials put a bullet into the clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maintenance of such a timepiece has not been easy and it is
a tough piece of mechanism to wind up. This particular clock was
fitted with a heavy winding action not to mention the fact that
access to the machinery necessitated climbing two perpendicular
iron ladders into the turret. Part of the recent history of the
clock can be traced from the names written upon a wooden beam in
the turret where the clock sits inside a glass fronted cupboard
below the bell. Sharman D. Neill, the large Belfast jeweller of a
bygone age carried out an alteration to the dial in November 1949
and mechanical repairs on the 14th December, 1949. At one time the
clock custodian was Herbert Silcock who was waterman and water rate
collector to the former Urban District Council. Mr. Silcock's name
together with that of T. R. Armstrong and his son Bertie, jewellers
and watchmakers of Market Square, Dromore appear on the turret
timbers. One other inscription reads &quot;Clock repaired July 1963&quot; and
simply signed with the letter &quot;H&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one time it was suggested that a possible electrification of
the clock would overcome the weekly climb into the turret to crank
up the old timepiece. Herbert Silcock was in favour of the proposal
and Albert Cairns the town clerk agreed with him but before a
decision was taken Mr. Cairns called David McClenaghan of
Drumbroneth, a mechanical clock expert who saved the timepiece from
the final indignity of electrification. Mr. McClenaghan altered the
weight on time mechanism, ground in new bearings and overhauled the
drive. The clock had got a new lease of life though for those who
maintained it may have thought that electrification would have made
life a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one time the Town Hall could boast of having two bells.
During the days of the pig market a bell that hung at the rear of
the Town Hall on the outside back wall was rung every Wednesday at
9 a.m. to announce the opening of the market. The Market Bell had a
hanging chain attached to a bracket on the wall and Willie Corbett
and Willie Bradshaw were the bell ringers. The Market Bell was also
used in former days to call out the Fire Brigade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the many problems facing those who looked after the Town
Hall clock was the difficulty in keeping all four faces giving the
same time. No doubt the saying, &quot;He has as many faces as the town
hall clock&quot; arose from this situation. Over the years the clock had
developed a ten minute time variation between the four dials, a
common complaint with four faced turret clocks usually caused by
the friction of dust mixed with lubricating oil on the moving
parts. In the mid 1970's repairs were undertaken by John Curl from
Lisburn who had a particular interest in mechanical clocks. The
timepiece was dismantled and cleaned and since that time the four
faces have been in close agreement. When the new library was being
fitted out in the Town Hall one of the cables holding the timing
weight was knocked off its pulley and the cable snapped. Again Mr.
Curl was called in and he carried out the repairs. During the 70's
the caretaker of the Town Hall was Samuel Gribben of Maypole Park.
Every Thursday at 12.30 p.m. Sam climbed the turret to wind the
clock. Today the clock is still going and that tenor note still
rings out from the bell though the faces do not appear to be lit at
night. The maintenance of the clock is now the responsibility of
Banbridge District Council and the timepiece that has served
Dromore for over 100 years still chimes out the hours giving the
time and calling to remembrance the donor William Cowan Heron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Waypoint will take you to a &lt;b&gt;&quot;Toll House&quot;&lt;/b&gt; was built
in the 1740's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction, by the Turnpike Trust, which existed between
1733 and 1857, of a new stretch of road between Dromore and
Hillsborough, did not affect the site, or the use of, the
building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the townland of Backnamullagh, the remains of this turnpike
road cross the present dual-carriageway from N.E. to S.W.
continuing on towards Dromore by way of Mile Bush Road. - formerly
the old Hillsborough Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toll house sits in the angle of this crossing and it is
thought to have continued to operate as such until the Turnpike
System was abolished in the 1850's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, once you are close to the GZ there is a 'Chirp'
enabled that will confirm the final coordinates plus provide a
further clue to the location of the final cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(More detailed information on how 'Chirp' works &amp; what GPS
devices can use it can be found via Google or Wikipedia)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find logs should be worded in such a way that the final location
is not pointed to. Good luck&lt;/p&gt;

Terrain is good here with parking available right alongside GZ. Moving onto the side-road is advisable as any traffic that does pass this point does so at a brave wee lick!

This really should just be a cache &amp; dash.

Any rumours that either Samuel L Jackson or Angelina Jolie have been seen in the vicinity of this cache are no more than that - rumours! Even rumours of Vinny Jones driving past here are still only more rumours!

Given that this area is free from the ever bothersome tour buses, on a clear day you have great views of Slieve Croob to the left &amp; the Mourne Mountains in the distance as you stand on the South Side of the Redhills, that lie between Dromore, County Down &amp; Moira. On an inclement day, well ... just enjoy the cache!

There are quite a few other well-established caches local to here - so if you've made the effort to come this far why not search out the remainder too!

Hope you enjoy this, our first cache!</groundspeak:long_description>

See rare species in their natural habitat

Our property is significant for biodiversity with red grouse, stonechats, skylark, snipe and other upland breeding birds, while kestrels, peregrine falcons and ravens feed in the area. There are several occupied badger setts and on a walk through this habitat you may encounter a hiding Irish Hare or see a Marsh Fritillary butterfly flitting about. The mountains comprise a mosaic of grassland heath and bog. The heath is made up mainly of heather species but a closer look reveals some interesting flora such as the heath spotted orchid. Along the short grasses on the river banks you may unearth the many colours of waxcaps during the autumn and winter months. Thirteen species of waxcap fungi have already been identified on the site; one of them is a new record for Northern Ireland. A number of species found here in the mountains are identified as Northern Ireland Priority Species. 

Divis and the Black Mountain came into the care of the National Trust in November 2004 and opened to the public in June 2005. There are walking trails along a variety of terrain – through heath, on stone tracks, along boardwalk and road surface, including the start of the 10km Divis Mountain to Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park Trail.  

The property is a working farm with free roaming cattle between April and November.

Please wear suitable footwear and clothing for walking in the area. The mountain environment can change rapidly. Please keep dogs under close control at all times.

Parking and entrance is free, but please note that the car park closes at 8pm - car park co-ordinates are N54' 35.950 W006' 02.530.

All of the caches can be done as part of the Divis and Black Mountain Series. The whole series will take approximately 7 hours to complete so ensure you have adequate snacks and water to sustain you.

This cache is also not far off the 10 mile Divis to Dixon Walk, so can be incorporated into that route.

The Cache

This cache can be accessed either from the main entrance on Divis Road or, for a quick find, through the yellow gate opposite the Glenside Community Woodland on the Upper Springfield Road. 

If parking at the lower yellow gate, please do not obstruct the entrance. Allow yourself 45 mins to an hour to find this cache and return to the yellow gate or approximately 2 hours from the Divis Road car park and back.

The cache is a medium sized camouflaged lockable lunchbox with geocache label on the lid. A small selection of usual swaps were available at the time of placing the cache as well as a National Trust Divis and the Black Mountain marker - if you're going to visit a geocache anywhere else in the world why not take it with you? There are also some information pamphlets included - feel free to take one with you.

This cache will take you to a wonderful vantage point for you to sit and take in while the sounds of nature jostle with the sounds of the city. The views from here are stunning across the Collin Valley to Collin Mountain and down to the Mournes. Pick out the Cooley Mountains in the far distance on a good day. On the journey to the cache, look out for some of our spectacular wildlife from insects to plants and from Irish Hare to Kestrels. Look around water pools and puddles for newts and keep an eye out for lizards basking in the summer sunshine. This location is wonderful during the summer for wildflowers, and orchids in particular. Follow the sound of grasshoppers to find them hiding amongst the grasses and flowers and keep an eye out for the rare Marsh Fritillary butterfly which has been recorded in the vicinity of the cache.

The difficulty rating of this cache is determined by approach. Walking from the yellow gate, the trip is suitable for children as the route is well established and relatively easy to follow uphill along a tarmac road and then turning downhill onto an older lane just before reaching the TV mast. For the more fit and adventurous who are approaching the cache via the National Trust car park, or following the series, the terrain is more difficult, is off the beaten track for most of its’ length and is wet underfoot in places, so come prepared.

Good Luck and enjoy your trip to this little patch of heaven! </groundspeak:long_description>

See rare species in their natural habitat

Our property is significant for biodiversity with red grouse, stonechats, skylark, snipe and other upland breeding birds, while kestrels, peregrine falcons and ravens feed in the area. There are several occupied badger setts and on a walk through this habitat you may encounter a hiding Irish Hare or see a Marsh Fritillary butterfly flitting about. The mountains comprise a mosaic of grassland heath and bog. The heath is made up mainly of heather species but a closer look reveals some interesting flora such as the heath spotted orchid. Along the short grasses on the river banks you may unearth the many colours of waxcaps during the autumn and winter months. Thirteen species of waxcap fungi have already been identified on the site; one of them is a new record for Northern Ireland. A number of species found here in the mountains are identified as Northern Ireland Priority Species. 

Divis and the Black Mountain came into the care of the National Trust in November 2004 and opened to the public in June 2005. There are walking trails along a variety of terrain – through heath, on stone tracks, along boardwalk and road surface, including the start of the 10km Divis Mountain to Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park Trail.  

The property is a working farm with free roaming cattle between April and November.

Please wear suitable footwear and clothing for walking in the area. The mountain environment can change rapidly. Please keep dogs under close control at all times.

Parking and entrance is free, but please note that the car park closes at 8pm - car park co-ordinates are N54' 35.950 W006' 02.530.

All of the caches can be done as part of the Divis and Black Mountain Series. The whole series will take approximately 7 hours to complete so ensure you have adequate snacks and water to sustain you.

This cache is also not far off the 10 mile Divis to Dixon Walk, so can be incorporated into that route.

Allow yourself approximately 2.5 hours to find this cache and return to car park - but why not find cache 5 in the series on the way to this cache?

The Cache

The route to this cache offers some of the most spectacular scenery to be found anywhere in Northern Ireland. On a day when the visibility is good you’ll be able to see England, Scotland, Wales and the Isle of Man along this route.  

The cache is a large sized camouflaged lockable lunchbox with geocache label on the lid. A small selection of usual swaps were available at the time of placing the cache as well as a National Trust Divis and the Black Mountain marker - if you're going to visit a geocache anywhere else in the world why not take it with you? There are also some information pamphlets included - feel free to take one with you.

We recommend that you approach this cache by heading to the Black Mountain summit, and then walk down to the fence line following it towards the Black Hill. The cache is in the vicinity of the Windy Gap. This route to this cache is along a tarmac road, wooden boardwalk and a well established path until you reach the Black Mountain summit where the route to the cache goes off the beaten track and the terrain can be difficult and boggy in places, so come prepared. 

The cache is hidden near the remains of an old dwelling, whose inhabitants have long gone. You can still make out the lazy beds where vegetables would have been grown near the dwelling. Sit for a minute and think about how life must have been for the people living at this location. 

At the Long Barn there are toilet facilities, hot drinks and a picnic area for you to stop at as you head out on your journey. You can also borrow one of our Garmin eTrex Venture GPS navigators from the Long Barn with all of our geocaches pre-loaded for your convenience.

Please be careful when uncovering the cache, muggles can come up to the cache site behind you so please be discreet when taking out the cache and hiding it again. If you see anything you like in the cache box, please trade up or even so everyone can enjoy the contents. 

Good Luck and enjoy your trip to this awe inspiring location!</groundspeak:long_description>

The Cache

Allow yourself at least 30-45 mins to find this cache and return to car park - but take it at a dander and why not sit a while when you get there enjoying the peace and tranquility of this special place.

A small selection of usual swaps were available at the time of placing the cache as well as a National Trust Divis and the Black Mountain marker - if you're going to visit a geocache anywhere else in the world why not take it with you? There are also some information pamphlets included - feel free to take one with you.

Shhh...What was that...?

This cache will take you to a hidden site of notoriety. The cache is hidden in the remains of an old dwelling that is believed to be the site of a horrific double-murder. The culprit was never caught and may still be roaming the hills...(although they’d be very old!)

There are two ways of approaching the cache, either from the Long Barn (N54' 36.120 W006'01.916) and Divis Lodge, or over the gate on the right of the tarmac road before you reach the Long Barn, but we would recommend doing a loop going from Divis Lodge and out through the lower gate. Some of the trip to this cache is off the beaten track, so come prepared. This is a great place for a walk with the kids (especially around Halloween) and goes off road without being too strenuous. The scenery here is beautiful and on the journey to the cache look out for some of our spectacular wildlife, from insects to plants and from Irish Hare to Kestrels. Look around water pools and puddles for newts and keep an eye out for lizards basking in the summer sunshine. 

At the Long Barn there are toilet facilities, hot drinks and a picnic area for you to stop at as you head towards the cache. You can also borrow one of our Garmin eTrex Venture GPS navigators from the Long Barn with all of our geocaches pre-loaded for your convenience.

Please be careful when uncovering the cache, muggles may be able to see you from the main walk so please be discreet when taking out the cache and hiding it again. If you see anything you like in the cache box, please trade up or even so everyone can enjoy the contents. 

Good Luck and enjoy your trip to this spooky place! </groundspeak:long_description>

The Cache

Allow yourself at least 45 mins to an hour to find this traditional cache and return to car park - but why not take longer and enjoy your surroundings on the way?

The cache is a medium sized camouflaged lockable lunchbox with geocache label on the lid, best approached by heading to the information point at N54' 36.175 W006' 01.696 and following the stream down to the mill race. 

A small selection of usual swaps were available at the time of placing the cache as well as a National Trust Divis and the Black Mountain marker - if you're going to visit a geocache anywhere else in the world why not take it with you? There are also some information pamphlets included - feel free to take one with you.

This cache is located in the vicinity of a hidden site of historical interest. 

In the 18th and 19th centuries the industrial revolution came to Belfast and many mills and factories sprang up around the base of the hills. Initially they relied on water power to run them and they also needed water for the processes of making linen and other industries such as brewing and dyeing. The many rivers and streams flowing down from the hills were harnessed to run Belfast’s mills, and several dams were constructed to the south of Divis Lodge, below Whiterock and at Ligoniel.

The cache is located close to a former dam which once powered McCance's Mill in Suffolk. Look around to see the lapping stones of the dam. The dam is on the Collin River which, apart from the Lagan, is the only unculverted river in Belfast. 

The trip to the information point is along a tarmac road and the second stage is across the fields, so come prepared. This is a great place for a walk with the kids and goes off the beaten track without being too strenuous. The scenery here is beautiful and on the journey to the cache look out for some of our spectacular wildlife, from insects to plants and from Irish Hare to Kestrels. Look around water pools and puddles for newts and keep an eye out for lizards basking in the sunshine. 

At the Long Barn there are toilet facilities, hot drinks and a picnic area for you to stop at as you head towards the information point. You can also borrow one of our Garmin eTrex Venture GPS navigators from the Long Barn with all of our geocaches pre-loaded for your convenience.

Good Luck and enjoy your trip to this hidden treasure! </groundspeak:long_description>

Our property is significant for biodiversity with red grouse, stonechats, skylark, snipe and other upland breeding birds, while kestrels, peregrine falcons and ravens feed in the area. There are several occupied badger setts and on a walk through this habitat you may encounter a hiding Irish Hare or see a Marsh Fritillary butterfly flitting about. The mountains comprise a mosaic of grassland heath and bog. The heath is made up mainly of heather species but a closer look reveals some interesting flora such as the heath spotted orchid. Along the short grasses on the river banks you may unearth the many colours of waxcaps during the autumn and winter months. Thirteen species of waxcap fungi have already been identified on the site; one of them is a new record for Northern Ireland. A number of species found here in the mountains are identified as Northern Ireland Priority Species.

Divis and the Black Mountain came into the care of the National Trust in November 2004 and opened to the public in June 2005. There are walking trails along a variety of terrain – through heath, on stone tracks, along boardwalk and road surface, including the start of the 10km Divis Mountain to Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park Trail.

The property is a working farm with free roaming cattle between April and November.

Please wear suitable footwear and clothing for walking in the area. The mountain environment can change rapidly. Please keep dogs under close control at all times.

Parking and entrance is free, but please note that the car park closes at 8pm - car park co-ordinates are N54' 35.950 W006' 02.530.

All of the caches can be done as part of the Divis and Black Mountain Series. The whole series will take approximately 7 hours to complete so ensure you have adequate snacks and water to sustain you.

This cache is also not far off the 10 mile Divis to Dixon Walk, so can be incorporated into that route.

The Cache

This is a great place for a walk with the kids and goes off the beaten track without being too strenuous. Allow yourself at least 30-45 minutes to find this cache and return to car park - but take it at a dander and why not sit a while when you get there enjoying the peace and tranquillity of this special place.

The cache is located in the vicinity of Tipperary Rocks. Follow the Tipperary Road out and then head off the beaten track towards the ancient quarry site. We don't know how the Tipperary Road got its' name - maybe due to soldiers who were based here during WWII who were marched out the road - maybe it was 'A long way to Tipperary...' The Tipperary Rocks are believed to be a site of archaeological significance where the stone was quarried for the nearby stone enclosures and cashel.  Look out for markings on the stones - some perhaps due to bullet holes from MOD training activities, some markings may even date back to ancient times – some of the markings on one of the boulders may even indicate that it was a sacrificial stone.  We're going to get our National Trust archaeologists to take a look and will keep you posted.

Life on the hills dates back to around 9,000 years ago, when people lived in groups, moving around in search of food that they could hunt or gather. Gradually, around 4,500 – 2,100 BC, there was a change away from this lifestyle to the beginnings of farming. This meant people living in one place and keeping domesticated animals such as cattle and sheep and growing crops. As well as farming, these early people used flint from the mountains to make tools and weapons. 

Just like today, the mountains have been used for cattle grazing for hundreds of years. There is an interesting site, visible to your left when heading from Tipperary Rocks across the stream towards the Black Mountain, of the remains of a fortified farm or ring fort, dating to the Early Christian period in Ireland of 1000 AD. This is the only one of its’ kind found on the entire island of Ireland.

The views from the cache site are stunning down the Collin Valley to the Mournes and you can pick out Ram's Island on Lough Neagh from here too.  Listen and look out for the numerous skylarks which call this place home. 

A small selection of usual swaps were available at the time of placing the cache as well as a National Trust Divis and the Black Mountain marker - if you're going to visit a geocache anywhere else in the world why not take it with you? There are also some information pamphlets included - feel free to take one with you.

Please be careful when uncovering the cache, muggles may be able to see you from the main walk so please be discreet when taking out the cache and hiding it again. If you see anything you like in the cache box, please trade up or even so everyone can enjoy the contents.

At the Long Barn there are toilet facilities, hot drinks and a picnic area for you to stop at as you head out on your journey. You can also borrow one of our Garmin eTrex Venture GPS navigators from the Long Barn with all of our geocaches pre-loaded for your convenience.

Good Luck and enjoy your journey to this ancient site! </groundspeak:long_description>

Allow yourself approximately 1.5 hours to find this cache and return to car park. 

The Cache

The route to this cache is relatively easy along a tarmac road for most of the way, but may be boggy in the vicinity of the cache. Head straight for the TV transmitters and then go off the beaten track to find this cache.

The cache is a medium sized camouflaged lockable lunchbox with geocache label on the lid. A small selection of usual swaps were available at the time of placing the cache as well as a National Trust Divis and the Black Mountain marker - if you're going to visit a geocache anywhere else in the world why not take it with you? There are also some information pamphlets included - feel free to take one with you.

This is a great place for a walk with the kids and goes off the beaten track towards the end without being too strenuous. The scenery here is beautiful and on the journey to the cache look out for some of our spectacular wildlife, from insects to plants and from Irish Hare to Kestrels. Look around water pools and puddles for newts and keep an eye out for lizards basking in the sunshine. You will also pass some of our unique archaeology on your way out to this cache.

The cache is in the remains of an old gamekeeper’s house which was used by a Mr Millekin in 1901 and later by a shepherd named Robert Moorhouse. This cottage is now little more than heaps of stones, but it’s possible to see outlines of a cottage garden. The dwelling is also said to have connections with both Mary Ann and Henry Joy McCracken. It is said that Mary Ann and another female companion stayed at the cottage in late June 1798 after bringing news to Henry Joy from Belfast following the Battle of Antrim. 

The cottage also sits close to the headwaters of the Ballygomartin River, the same river that famously flooded the Westlink at Broadway. 

For more information on this cottage do an internet search for the Ulster Archaeological Society Field Survey Report. If you are interested in learning more about the area, National Trust volunteer Liz McShane has written a book entitled 'Divis and the Black Mountain: Local History and Memories' which is available to buy locally and at the Long Barn here on the mountain  - a steal at only £3.99.

Please be careful when uncovering the cache, muggles are frequent near this cache site so please be discreet when taking out the cache and hiding it again. If you see anything you like in the cache box, please trade up or even so everyone can enjoy the contents.

This cache is also not far off the 10 mile Divis to Dixon Walk, so can be incorporated into that route.

Allow yourself approximately 2 hours to find this cache and return to car park if travelling along the tarmac road to Divis summit - but why not include caches 8 and 9 in the series on the way to (or from) this cache?

The Cache

This is a great place for a walk with older children and goes off the beaten track towards the end. The route to this cache can be travelled along a tarmac road for most of the way as far as the summit of Divis Mountain. Alternatively, you may wish to approach (or return from) the cache along the Tipperary Road by following the right fork to the famine wall which you can then follow to the summit. This route can be boggy and wet underfoot, so come prepared. To find the cache, head down from the summit in the direction of Lough Neagh and the Sperrins.

The cache is a large sized camouflaged lockable lunchbox with geocache label on the lid. A small selection of usual swaps were available at the time of placing the cache as well as a National Trust Divis and the Black Mountain marker - if you're going to visit a geocache anywhere else in the world why not take it with you? There are also some information pamphlets included - feel free to take one with you.

The cache is at an aeroplane crash site, one of many in the same vicinity. At this time we cannot be certain which specific aeroplane crashed here, but there were 18 military crashes which happened in the Belfast Hills between 1937 and 1948 as follows:

RAF Hawker Fury at Ballygomartin - 12th June 1937
RAF Consolidated B-24 Liberator on Divis – 4th May 1942 
RAF Bristol Beaufort on Collin Mountain – 20th January 1943
RAF Westland Lysander on Carnmoney Hill – 17th March 1943
RAF Bristol Beaufort on Aughrim Hill – 29th March 1943
RAF Bristol Beaufort at Ballyutoag – 18th June 1943
RAF Supermarine Spitfire near Clady Corner – 11th September 1943
RAF Supermarine Spitfire at Ballyutoag – 11th September 1943
USAAF Consolidated B-24 Liberator on Divis – 10th October 1943
RAF Vickers Wellington on Divis – 24th November 1943
RAF Airspeed Oxford on Squire's Hill – 5th December 1943
RAF Vickers Wellington on Rushey Hill, Dundrod – 31st December 1943
RAF Avro Anson at Bo Hill – 27th March 1944
USAAF Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress on Cave Hill – 1st June 1944
RAF Consolidated B-24 Liberator on Standing Stones Hill – 30th January 1945
RAF Consolidated B-24 Liberator at Hannahstown – 19th March 1945
RN Supermarine Seafire on Aughrim Hill – 5th November 1945
RN Grumman Avenger on Divis – 3rd November 1948 

You will note the debris from the crash at this location – please do not remove any of it.  There is a display of some of the debris in the Long Barn visitors centre. The views from the cache site, like most on the property, are absolutely stunning.

Please be careful when uncovering the cache, muggles are frequent near this cache site so please be discreet when taking out the cache and hiding it again. If you see anything you like in the cache box, please trade up or even so everyone can enjoy the contents.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Divis and the Black Mountain rest in the heart of the Belfast Hills which provide the backdrop to the city’s skyline. They are rich in wildlife, archaeology and history, with spectacular views across Northern Ireland and beyond.

See rare species in their natural habitat

Our property is significant for biodiversity with red grouse, stonechats, skylark, snipe and other upland breeding birds, while kestrels, peregrine falcons and ravens feed in the area. There are several occupied badger setts and on a walk through this habitat you may encounter a hiding Irish Hare or see a Marsh Fritillary butterfly flitting about. The mountains comprise a mosaic of grassland heath and bog. The heath is made up mainly of heather species but a closer look reveals some interesting flora such as the heath spotted orchid. Along the short grasses on the river banks you may unearth the many colours of waxcaps during the autumn and winter months. Thirteen species of waxcap fungi have already been identified on the site; one of them is a new record for Northern Ireland. A number of species found here in the mountains are identified as Northern Ireland Priority Species. 

Divis and the Black Mountain came into the care of the National Trust in November 2004 and opened to the public in June 2005. There are walking trails along a variety of terrain – through heath, on stone tracks, along boardwalk and road surface, including the start of the 10km Divis Mountain to Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park Trail.  

The property is a working farm with free roaming cattle between April and November.

Please wear suitable footwear and clothing for walking in the area. The mountain environment can change rapidly. Please keep dogs under close control at all times.

Parking and entrance is free, but please note that the car park closes at 8pm - car park co-ordinates are N54' 35.950 W006' 02.530.

All of the caches can be done as part of the Divis and Black Mountain Series. The whole series will take approximately 7 hours to complete so ensure you have adequate snacks and water to sustain you.

This cache is also not far off the 10 mile Divis to Dixon Walk, so can be incorporated into that route.

The Cache

The cache is located along the Clady Water, one of the main tributaries of the Sixmilewater. The Clady Water rises within Divis and the Black Mountain property and is totally natural and unmodified along its length. Follow the Tipperary Road out along the left fork and head downhill and to the left when you reach the end of the track. Follow the Clady Water from here, criss-crossing it all the way towards the back gate of the property. This is a lovely spot for a picnic as you listen to the Clady Water bubble its way towards Lough Neagh. Be aware that the river may rise significantly following rainfall. This cache is approximately a 4 mile round trip from the car park and, depending on fitness levels, will take approximately 2-3 hours return

The route to this cache is relatively challenging and is off the beaten track for much of the way with boggy conditions underfoot in places. 

The scenery here is beautiful and on the journey to the cache look out for some of our spectacular wildlife, from insects to plants and from Irish Hare to Kestrels. Look around water pools and puddles for newts and keep an eye out for lizards basking in the sunshine. Look out for fish and other water dwellers in the Clady Water.

Muggles are rare in the cache location. However, please be discreet when taking out the cache and hiding it again. If you see anything you like in the cache box, please trade up or even so everyone can enjoy the contents. 

At the Long Barn there are toilet facilities, hot drinks and a picnic area for you to stop at as you head out on your journey. You can also borrow one of our Garmin eTrex Venture GPS navigators from the Long Barn with all of our geocaches pre-loaded for your convenience.

Good Luck and enjoy your meandering journey through this wonderful National Trust property!</groundspeak:long_description>

All of the caches can be done as part of the Divis and Black Mountain Series. The whole series will take approximately 7 hours to complete so ensure you have adequate snacks and water to sustain you.

This cache is also not far off the 10 mile Divis to Dixon Walk, so can be incorporated into that route.

The route to this cache can be travelled along a well established route for most of the way, although the latter stage of the route is off the beaten track, so come prepared for this. Allow approximately 3 hours to find this cache and return to the car park. Alternatively, why not combine this cache with cache 6 in the series, dropping down to it from the summit of Divis?

The Cache

The cache is a medium sized camouflaged lockable lunchbox with geocache label on the lid. A small selection of usual swaps were available at the time of placing the cache as well as a National Trust Divis and the Black Mountain marker - if you're going to visit a geocache anywhere else in the world why not take it with you? There are also some information pamphlets included - feel free to take one with you.

If following the route along the Standing Stone Road, this is not a particularly challenging walk in terms of terrain, but is one of the longer walks offered here. The scenery here is beautiful and on the journey to the cache look out for some of our spectacular wildlife, from insects to plants and from Irish Hare to Kestrels. Look around water pools and puddles for newts and keep an eye out for lizards basking in the sunshine. You will also pass some of our unique archaeology on your way out to this cache and you will pass the standing stone which gives this road its’ name, reputedly a meeting place for the United Irishmen. The road will bring you as far as the back gate to the property and to find the cache, follow our fence line, staying within our property, from here to the left towards the old quarry munitions hut(with Belfast at your back). The cache is near the headwaters of the Forth River.

Please be careful when uncovering the cache, muggles may approach from either direction so please be discreet when taking out the cache and hiding it again. If you see anything you like in the cache box, please trade up or even so everyone can enjoy the contents. 

At the Long Barn there are toilet facilities, hot drinks and a picnic area for you to stop at as you head out on your journey. You can also borrow one of our Garmin eTrex Venture GPS navigators from the Long Barn with all of our geocaches pre-loaded for your convenience.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Fans of the sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot; will appreciate this cache&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Father Dougal Maguire &lt;i&gt;(played by Ardal O'Hanlon)&lt;/i&gt; was
banished to Craggy Island following the notorious 'Blackrock'
incident in which the lives of many nuns were irreparably
damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dougal is the cause of most of Ted's embarrassment. With no
grasp of the religion he professes to practice, a belief that
Bishops love sci-fi and fumigate houses, and an inability to
understand most of real life (Dougal has charts listing the
difference between Dreams and Reality and various things that do
not exist)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dougal continually infuriates Ted. Nevertheless, he is Ted's
best friend and immortal sidekick, even if he shouldn't be allowed
to do funerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brought to life by Ardal O'Hanlon, Dougal is probably best
summed up in one scene, where Ted shows him some model cows and
looks out of the window - &quot;now one last time. These are small, but
the ones out there are far away&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You are now posed with the same dilemma; one of these is
close &amp; one is far away - but which is which?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose wisely &amp; you'll be closer to discovering the
cache!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please replace the cache in EXACTLY the same position as you
find it. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is near the road but requires scrambling a rocky bank in order to reach it.

This cache was due to be place on Ardnamurchan but due to bike we never reached there so it was placed here instead.

Could one of the first people to find please write the cache name and coordinates in the log book because we forgot to do so when placing it.
