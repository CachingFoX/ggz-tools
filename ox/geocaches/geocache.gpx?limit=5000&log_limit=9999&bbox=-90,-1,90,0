St Catherine's Church is a Grade II listed building with the original part of the building dating from 1875.

The area is easily accessible and wheelchair friendly.

High muggle area in the summer months, so stealth may be required.

You are looking for a 35mm film canister which contains a log book and a toy for the First to Find.

&lt;p&gt;A half kilometre walk each way but the terrain rating is quite high because the majority of the walk is on a mud path which is a bit squidgy in wet weather and is quite narrow and can be overgrown in places making it unsuitable for pushchairs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to see for anyone interested in boats or birds (bring your binoculars).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cache is a tupperware type container which we have started off with various items including earplugs, car air-freshener, lampies pen/torch, TY Jingle Beanie Baby, pair of AA batteries, Bubble liquid and other bits I can't remember. The cache will only hold small swaps.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please enjoy our first cache. &lt;/p&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

2nd cache of the day...

Had brief moment while on the way to this cache after doing 'Dog Paddle', of considering 'Billy's Bridge', but then took one look at it and decided that it really must be virtually impossible without some sort of additional equipment, and carried on to find this one!

Found quickly, fortunately, as it was bucketing with rain and not entirely too pleasant!

Took Telegraph DVD, Left a set of coasters.

Thanks! :)</groundspeak:text>

As you look across the park to Slindon House, behind you runs the mediaeval ‘Park Pale’ – an earth bank once topped by a deer-proof palisade. Before the Great Storm of 1987 the woods around the park &amp; its pale were largely of the famous and enormous Slindon beeches – seed from which were exported all over the World. A few survive, the dead trunks of a few more provide wildlife refuges.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Like Petworth, Parham, and Cowdray, Slindon was a self-sufficient country estate centred on a Great House and parkland, surrounded &amp; supported by farms and workmens’ cottages. The Elizabethan Great House is now home to Slindon College.  Like many of the buildings in Slindon that have changed their use with the times, the pottery building was once the estate carpenters’ and wheelwrights’ workshops.  </groundspeak:long_description>

The Regency summer house also known as the ‘Tea House’ once looked slightly grander then the walls that are left today. It was unfortunately accidentally destroyed by Canadian troops during the Second World War, leaving a soft curve of brick, now a windbreak for a bench.

In 1865 the plough-team of heavy horses based here were: Boxer, Valiant, Draggon, &amp; Captain; looked after by a ploughman and an eleven year old ploughboy, Jimmy Dean. Rows Barn gives fine views across the shallow cultivated valley of the northern part of Slindon Estate, broadening out to Downland sheep-pasture as it rises up to your right hand side.

Most would have a simple bed and table, a small stove for chilly nights, a place to store tools and medicines, and an emergency pen for sick or orphaned lambs.  There mobility allowed them to be freely moved with the flock.

Much of North Wood was cleared during the First World War by the Canadian Forestry Corp for pit props and trench supports and is now farmland.  This is the remains of an incinerator they built as part of their camp.  Near here was a WWI airship station, a base for long patrols over the Solent to spot German submarines.  </groundspeak:long_description>

You are standing on the remains of the Roman road Stane Street.  The road was a direct route from Noviomagus (Chichester) to Londinium (London), built in the 1st century AD. The raised causeway known as the ‘agger’ served as the express lane.  The Slindon Estate has one of the best remaining stretches of Roman Road in Britain, now challenged by tree-roots and badgers excavating their sets.

Traditionally, both coppicing and pollarding were carried out to produce accessible and regular wood harvest for firewood, fences and poles. In coppicing young tree stems are cut down to a foot or less from the ground. In doing so, a multitude of new shoots grow back. Pollarding is carried out around 2m from the ground, to prevent grazing  of the new shoots by deer and livestock.  This tree is a fine example of an old Ash coppice stool. </groundspeak:long_description>

The cache was a VERY easy find because it was in full view on arrival. We hid it a little bit better so there is at least a search involved for the next seekers!

Thanks to &lt;b&gt;explorer_olway&lt;/b&gt; for giving permission to add to his series - I loved the idea ever since I came across the others in his series. Plenty of times I've passed under a bridge in a seemingly insignificant location and wondered how to get to it, and this is one of those places.

This cache can be accessed from several different trails running through Cowplain and Horndean. Fairly nearby is Hazelton common, a popular dog-walking area and a nice walk in itself. Note that the far side of the bridge opens onto private land (hard to miss, with the amount of barbed wire) but there is a small footpath that goes around it.

The cache is a medium sized lock-lid Tupperware container. It contains a logbook, camera, and pen. Please feel free to take some picture of yourself and the area!</groundspeak:long_description>

It stopped and looked at us for quite a while, while we stopped and looked at it.
It did not seem at all alarmed by the encounter, and calmly left after a couple of minutes.
Well it made our day.
The Cache was found shortly after the encounter.
Took a mock TB to move on and left Armed and Ready TB for the next cacher.

As the nearby plaque denotes, this site was once home to several historic features, including Iron Age, Roman and Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, as well as a Bronze age disc barrow. You can read all about them and other local sites with a quick googling of &quot;snell's corner clanfield&quot;.

The cache is a black magnetic nano. You know the drill. If you don't: think small. Drift Road is quite steep so the cache is most likely not wheelchair-accessible.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is on the route of the old A3 before the pass was deepened in the 80s.

The piece of abandoned road is what's left of the old, higher route. It's accessible from a road starting in Buriton, and also through Queen Elizabeth Country Park.

I'm too young to remember driving it, but have spoken to friends who do. The presence of the Butser Hill Lime Works, as well as the single solitary house (both interesting to see but unfortunately fenced off) provide anchors for the imagination when trying to visualise the past.

Going even further back, the &quot;Road of Assassination&quot; (as it became known due to the prevalence of murders) was renowned for the activities of highwaymen and other bandits - especially this area between Petersfield and Horndean. A notable rogue was James Allen of Graffham, who became known for firing at anyone who did not immediately submit to being robbed. More information about the history of the Portsmouth Road can be found here: (visit link)

The route itself has an almost sheer drop down to the current A3, so do be careful close to the edge and keep an eye on any kids if you bring them (NOT recommended!).

The cache itself is a small plastic lock-lid container. At time of placing it contained a disposable camera, a RAM stick keyring, a LED flashlight keyring, and a mood ring.

Feel free to take a picture or two with the camera, and please include how many pictures are left in your log on this site, especially if it's finished.</groundspeak:long_description>

Anyway as this afternoon was such a lovely day I got my bike out and came for a ride. I managed to do it all without getting off to walk. Found the cache easily, and took a picture of myself (22 left), then enjoyed the freewheeling back down the hill after the find.

Thanks

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This gecocache trail takes you through the beauty of Petworth park as landscaped by 'Capability Brown' in the 18th century. The park is open 8am till dusk 365 days each year. Petworth House with it's luxurious interiors and amazing art collection, looks over the Upper pond in the park. The house and pleasure grounds are open to visitors, along with the gift shop, Audit Room restaurant and Servants' Hall cafe, please check website for details of opening times: www.nationaltrust.org.uk/petworth. 

This trail is aimed at families and is approximately 3 miles. 

Hazards: This trail will take you to areas with water in them and there are hillocks that make the ground uneven – please keep an eye on children. Your GPS may suggest you take a direct route that is not suitable (eg. through a pond), just head in the rough direction but stay safe, you can home in as you get closer.

This Geocaching trail starts in the North car park for Petworth park. o to the following co-ordinates:

1) N51 00.367 W000 37.459

What time do charges apply from? = A
How much is it to park? = B

Substitute A and B into the co-ordinates below to get your next point: 

2) N50 59.A65 W000 37.B16 

When you get to these co-ordinates you should be on a hill and can see a wooden box around a tree with green mesh at it’s base. Now look at the wooden box and count how many upright posts there are that are actually still in the ground.  Take this number and divide it in two = C 
Look North East to see a house. 
How many chimneys does the house have? = D

3) N50 59.C33 W000 37.D73 

Be careful when you get here as there is lots of water about. You should be standing near an old low wall which makes a shape on the ground.  
How many sides does this shape have? = E
Now divide your answer in two = F

4) N50 59.50F W000 37.2E1

Now you should be standing by a gate. 
Count the number of bobbles you can see on the crown = G
Count the number of points you see on the star = H

5) N50 59.50G W000 37.12H 

Now you should be standing by another gate. 
Look at the middle circle and count the number of times you see a “p” = J. Count the number of times a pole touches the circle  = K.
 
6) N50 59.34J W000 36.99K 	


Look at the stone animal you are standing close to, what is it?
If you have guessed correctly then it should have 3 letters in it’s name.
Now write down the first letter and the last letter of your animal.
Take the first letter and using the following code, work out the number it is equal to:

A=1  B=2  C=3  D=4  E=5  F=6  G=7

The number you get = L
Then do the same for the last letter of your animal, using the same code and the number you get this time = M

7) N50 59.L20 W000 36.M84

Root around to find the cache.

nightime hunt!
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I decided to place this Cache with people who take public transport
in mind. The Sidetracked series is great, but often most caches are
quite far away from the station so I wanted to create one
closer.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache itself is a black magnetic nano and well hidden. There
will be lots of muggles during rush-hour, so try find the cache at
a quieter time. This Cache could be done at night, though, you
might want to bring a torch.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
As this is a nano, there is no pen or pencil. You are more than
welcome to dip Travel Bugs™ and other trackables.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It is suitable for wheelchairs as it is paved.&lt;br/&gt;

Parking recommended at the end of Pedlar's way (Southwater Street).

There is a pond near the cache - please be careful with children.


The cache is a tupperware container. Inside there is a log-book, 2 pens, 2 crochet stars, a toy truck, and a candle.</groundspeak:long_description>

a green box, small size in about 20 yd height. The log book and the
cap of the box are secured against falling down. But you have to
bring your own pen.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oak tree has two main branches. The cache is on the southern
branch (the one towards the parking place).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be careful. I used two independent ropes to reach the
top. If in doubt, please don't try this really difficult
cache!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11/7/10: changed height from 15 to 20 yd.&lt;/p&gt;

Polesden Lacey, a 1400 acre estate, is situated on the North Downs and  commands some of the finest views in Surrey. The Edwardian Garden  extends to 30 acres with 10 acres of lawns and elegant grass  terraces,including a walled rose garden,summer border and winter  displays.
There has been a house on this site since at least 1336. The  name 'Polesden' is Saxon and belonged to the earliest recorded owner  Herbert de Polesden, who was selling land here in 1198. The 'Lacey'  suffix probably derives from the family of John Lacy, who owned  Polesden in 1387-93, but it is first described as 'Pollisdon Lacy'  only in 1562.

Polesden Lacey was later purchased by Mrs Greville, a  legendary Edwardian hostess, and her husband in 1906. The house was  converted by Mewes and Davis, the architects of the newly built Ritz  Hotel.
Mrs Greville bequeathed Polesden Lacey to the National Trust in  1942 in memory of her father, William McEwan an Edinburgh brewing  millionaire and philanthropist.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A pretty walk around Polesden Lacey of a bit over two and a half miles.

Polesden Lacey, a 1400 acre estate, is situated on the North Downs and  commands some of the finest views in Surrey. The Edwardian Garden  extends to 30 acres with 10 acres of lawns and elegant grass  terraces,including a walled rose garden,summer border and winter  displays.
There has been a house on this site since at least 1336. The  name 'Polesden' is Saxon and belonged to the earliest recorded owner  Herbert de Polesden, who was selling land here in 1198. The 'Lacey'  suffix probably derives from the family of John Lacy, who owned  Polesden in 1387-93, but it is first described as 'Pollisdon Lacy'  only in 1562.

Polesden Lacey was later purchased by Mrs Greville, a  legendary Edwardian hostess, and her husband in 1906. The house was  converted by Mewes and Davis, the architects of the newly built Ritz  Hotel.
Mrs Greville bequeathed Polesden Lacey to the National Trust in  1942 in memory of her father, William McEwan an Edinburgh brewing  millionaire and philanthropist.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A pretty walk around Polesden Lacey of a bit over two and a half miles.

Polesden Lacey, a 1400 acre estate, is situated on the North Downs and  commands some of the finest views in Surrey. The Edwardian Garden  extends to 30 acres with 10 acres of lawns and elegant grass  terraces,including a walled rose garden,summer border and winter  displays.
There has been a house on this site since at least 1336. The  name 'Polesden' is Saxon and belonged to the earliest recorded owner  Herbert de Polesden, who was selling land here in 1198. The 'Lacey'  suffix probably derives from the family of John Lacy, who owned  Polesden in 1387-93, but it is first described as 'Pollisdon Lacy'  only in 1562.

Polesden Lacey was later purchased by Mrs Greville, a  legendary Edwardian hostess, and her husband in 1906. The house was  converted by Mewes and Davis, the architects of the newly built Ritz  Hotel.
Mrs Greville bequeathed Polesden Lacey to the National Trust in  1942 in memory of her father, William McEwan an Edinburgh brewing  millionaire and philanthropist.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A pretty walk around Polesden Lacey of a bit over two and a half miles.

Polesden Lacey, a 1400 acre estate, is situated on the North Downs and  commands some of the finest views in Surrey. The Edwardian Garden  extends to 30 acres with 10 acres of lawns and elegant grass  terraces,including a walled rose garden,summer border and winter  displays.
There has been a house on this site since at least 1336. The  name 'Polesden' is Saxon and belonged to the earliest recorded owner  Herbert de Polesden, who was selling land here in 1198. The 'Lacey'  suffix probably derives from the family of John Lacy, who owned  Polesden in 1387-93, but it is first described as 'Pollisdon Lacy'  only in 1562.

Polesden Lacey was later purchased by Mrs Greville, a  legendary Edwardian hostess, and her husband in 1906. The house was  converted by Mewes and Davis, the architects of the newly built Ritz  Hotel.
Mrs Greville bequeathed Polesden Lacey to the National Trust in  1942 in memory of her father, William McEwan an Edinburgh brewing  millionaire and philanthropist.

Polesden Lacey, a 1400 acre estate, is situated on the North Downs and  commands some of the finest views in Surrey. The Edwardian Garden  extends to 30 acres with 10 acres of lawns and elegant grass  terraces,including a walled rose garden,summer border and winter  displays.
There has been a house on this site since at least 1336. The  name 'Polesden' is Saxon and belonged to the earliest recorded owner  Herbert de Polesden, who was selling land here in 1198. The 'Lacey'  suffix probably derives from the family of John Lacy, who owned  Polesden in 1387-93, but it is first described as 'Pollisdon Lacy'  only in 1562.

Polesden Lacey was later purchased by Mrs Greville, a  legendary Edwardian hostess, and her husband in 1906. The house was  converted by Mewes and Davis, the architects of the newly built Ritz  Hotel.
Mrs Greville bequeathed Polesden Lacey to the National Trust in  1942 in memory of her father, William McEwan an Edinburgh brewing  millionaire and philanthropist.

The cache is place in Edgebarrow woods about .4 of a mile from the parking spot and should be easy to reach using the many paths avalible in the woodland. The site it self is popular with walkers and familys as the three Castle path runs right through the middle of the woods on its way out of the black water valley.

A lot of caching water has flowed under the bridge since then, with 3,404 Groundspeak caches, 228 OpenCaches (that's opencaching.org.uk, not Garmin), 86 TerraCaches, 57 NaviCaches and 28 Garmin caches found :-)

Here is my earlier log:

What a lovely place, albeit a bit prickly :-) . It seems bigger on the ground than it looks on the map.

Took a bit longer than previous visitors to find it, but I did get there in the end.

This could be used as a cache and dash or as part of a longer walk-but it is very popular so keep a look out for those pesky Muggles.

The road is quite flat but unmade (unadopted?) and can get muddy.It is also used by vehicles so please be carefull.Please replace as you find it as it may be easily seen from the path. It is also close to a main road.

Due to the heavy tree canopy, the gps may go crazy!

pencil

telescope

The area is a nice place for walkers and mountain bikes, with a large number of small trails and large paths around the place.
A short walk on from the cache is a good view point at N51 23.021 W000 46.054 which looks out over bracknell and the surrounding countryside. Mud is a continuing feature of these woods, even in the summer- you have been warned!

This was an archived cache some years ago.

At placement cache includes:
Log (!)
Pencil
FTF badge
Small swaps
5 travel bugs

Hopefully coordinates are spot on (checked with 2 GPSr)but heavy tree foliage may send your gps crazy!

Please replace EXACTLY as you found, watch out for muggles and mountain bikes!

PLEASE READ THE HINT!

A huge thank you to the Forestry Commission for the permission for this one.

Hope you enjoy this one!

I was visiting Swinley Forest to do cache maintenance on my OpenCaching caches (that's the original OpenCachingUK, not the more recent Garmin OpenCaching) and TerraCaches. This one had appeared since my last visit to these parts, so I made the small detour to find it.

The area was much the worse for the recent fires, which was the reason I was doing my own cache maintenance in the first place. Though it was a lovely morning, the overnight rain meant the area round the cache was wet cinders - very mucky. But it looked like the fire had mostly burnt off the undergrowth and maybe the trees survived - let's hope so.

Took the Tasmanian Devil TB.

Thanks for the cache,

across the small river &quot;The Cut&quot; and adjacent to a flood balancing
pond. Very limited parking is available close by, just off Harvest
Ride, at N 51°25.779 W 000°45.170 however you will most probably
have it to yourself and be undisturbed during your visit. Safety
first: please be aware that children should be actively supervised
at this location - the river is shallow but may have a strong flow
at times and access to it to rescue a fallen child is not
straightforward due to undergrowth. The balancing pond may just be
boggy ground, or it may have water in it.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please make an effort to replace the cache well so that it is not
in plain sight for the next visitor. Thanks.</groundspeak:long_description>

This should be a quick cache and dash, and shouldn't require a hint (but we've given you one anyway!)

The Cremorne Bridge (commonly known as the Battersea Railway Bridge) was named after the pleasure grounds in Chelsea and originally referred to as the Battersea New Bridge - is a bridge across the River Thames in London, between Battersea and Chelsea and forming part of the West London Line of the London Overground from Clapham Junction to Willesden Junction.

The bridge was designed by William Baker, chief engineer of the London and North Western Railway, and was opened in March 1863 at a cost of £87,000. It carries two sets of railway lines and consists of five 120-foot (37 m) lattice girder arches set on stone piers. Within Network Rail, this bridge is also referred to as &quot;Chelsea River Bridge&quot; (Engineers Line Reference WLL, Bridge No. 9).

The bridge was strengthened &amp; refurbished in 1969, and again in 1992. During a high tide in late 2003, the structure was struck by a refuse-barge, and some of the lower structural elements damaged significantly. Until the repairs in early 2004, the up line (normal direction from West Brompton towards Clapham (Latchmere junction)) was blocked to locomotive hauled freight traffic, which in turn caused extensive delays to passenger services on the West London Line. Upon completion of the repairs by Edmund Nuttall Ltd, all restrictions were lifted.

The bridge was declared a Grade II* listed structure in 2008, providing protection to preserve its special character from unsympathetic development.

The view from this cache is of Lots Road Power Station, which is a disused coal and later oil-fired power station on the River Thames at Lots Road in Chelsea, London. The power station supplied electricity to the London Underground system until 21 October 2002. Since then, all power for the tube system is supplied from the National Grid.

It is sometimes erroneously referred to as Fulham Power Station, a name properly applied to another former station a mile up river.

It is now set within a stone surround and iron grille on Cannon Street, in the City of London. This artefact is sometimes called the Stone of Brutus. Popular legends include the stone being the remains of an ancient stone circle that is alleged to have stood on Ludgate Hill and even the stone from which King Arthur withdrew the legendary &quot;Sword in the Stone&quot;.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The old Wembley stadium, which opened in 1923 as the Empire Stadium and was often referred to as &quot;The Twin Towers,&quot; was one of the world's most famous football stadiums until its demolition in 2003.

The new Wembley Stadium opened in 2007 on the site of the previous 1923 structure. The 90,000 capacity venue is the second largest stadium in Europe and serves as England's national stadium. It is the home venue of the England National football team and is owned by English footballs governing body, the Football Association.  

Designed by Foster and Partners, it includes a partially retractable roof. A signature feature of the stadium is the 134 metres (440 ft) high Wembley Arch. With a span of 317 metres (1,040 ft), this steel arch is the longest single span roof structure in the world. The stadium was built by Australian firm Multiplex at a cost of £798 million and, after delays, was completed in time to host the 2007 F. A. cup final.

After a short walk up the hill from the parking area you need to cross the style and enter the woods.

You are looking for a cammo tube slightly longer than a film can

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A nano cache outside the very busy Edgware Station.

The station was opened on 18 August 1924 as the terminus of the second phase of the Underground Group's extension of the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway from Golders Green. It was designed by architect Stanley Heaps. There are three platforms, an island lying east of a single platform (platform 1). A trainshed covers the island platforms (2 and 3).
Despite having already had a railway station since 1867 (Edgware station on the London and North Eastern Railway), Edgware was, in 1924, still very much a village in character. The new Underground station was built on the north edge of the village in open fields and, as intended, the new line stimulated rapid suburban expansion along its length. By the end of the decade, what had formerly been fields was quickly being covered with new housing.

The site of the station is very close to the location intended for the unbuilt Watford and Edgware Railway's (W&amp;ER's) station, which was intended to be built on a branch from the existing single-track LNER branch before the terminus and run through to Watford Junction via Bushey.

On 27 July 1946, an accident occurred at Edgware when the driver (James Lofting) of a northbound train suffered a heart attack while entering the station. The train did not stop within the area of the platform, and struck the buffers at approximately 5 mph. No passengers were seriously injured, but Lofting died as a result of his heart failure before he could be removed from the wreckage. It appeared from the condition of the controls that Lofting had disabled the deadman's handle while the train was still moving. The circumstances of this accident were similar to those of the Moorgate tube crash of 1975.

This cache is hidden in a *very* muggely area. Enormous stealth is required to retrieve this without alerting suspicion.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is all the more tragic because the Watford Tunnel was only built because local landowners were worried the railway would spoil the view from their lands. 
 
In 1940 a woman was killed when a landslide engulfed a train at the Kings Langley end of the tunnel.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Robert
Snooks&lt;/b&gt; (about 1761-1802) was
the last man to be executed in England for highway robbery, on 11
March 1802.
&lt;br/&gt;
Born in Hungerford in
Berkshire, he was christened as James Blackman Snook on 16 August
1761. The fact that his name is commonly quoted as Robert Snooks is
perhaps due to a corruption of his identity as the
“Robber” Snook.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Crime&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
Post Boy John Stevens was
travelling from Tring to Hemel Hempstead late one Sunday evening in
May 1801. On reaching an isolated part of Box Moor, he was
threatened by a highwayman who subsequently stole £80 from the
mail.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
Investigation&lt;/b&gt; &amp; Trial&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
A reward of £200 was
offered by the Postmaster General in addition to the £100 offered
by Parliament for the apprehending of highwaymen. The London
Chronicle reported on the 11th March 1802 that the highwayman had
left a broken saddle at the scene of the crime and this mistake
later identified Snook as the culprit. Although the Post Boy
couldn’t identify Snook due to the darkness at the time of
the robbery, one of the stolen bank notes was traced back to
Snook’s possession and a chain of circumstantial evidence led
to a guilty verdict at his trial in March 1802.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
Punishment&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
A small memorial stone in
Boxmoor, Hemel Hempstead, England marks the approximate spot where
he was hanged and buried.
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
Legacy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
A bar in the nearby
Dacorum Pavilion in Hemel Hempstead (since demolished) was named
after Snooks, and used the silhouette of a mounted highwayman as
its sign. One of the local Explorer Scout Units is also named after
him.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is situated at Whipsnade Heath. The Heath is common land now overgrown with Hawthorn and Blackthorn scrub, although many remnants of its heath land past still exist including Gorse bushes.  

There is a small car park and picnic glade (junction of B4540 and B4541). A circular route around the Heath starts from the car park. The site is owned by Central Bedfordshire Council and leased to the National Trust.

In addition to swag and a logbook, each of our countryside caches (Tree Cathedral; Motte and Bailey; Beech Woods and Chalk Hills; Picnic Glade; Hazel Coppice and Hill Fort) contains an ink stamp. Bring a piece of paper with at least three different stamps on it to the Chilterns Gateway Centre (N51’52.906, W000’32.261,) to exchange for a ‘geocaching genius’ certificate. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is one of five at National Trust sites around South Bedfordshire (A further 10 caches are located at Dunstable and Whipsnade Downs).

Situated on the edge of Whipsnade Village green, the Tree Cathedral is composed of different varieties of trees and shrubs laid out to the plan of a cathedral, with a nave, transepts, chancel, cloisters and chapels.

 This incredible tree cathedral was created after the First World War in a spirit of 'faith, hope and reconciliation'.

Owned by the National Trust, but managed by Trustees, much of the care and maintenance is done by volunteers

In addition to swag and a logbook, each of the five countryside caches (Tree Cathedral; Motte and Bailey; Beech Woods and Chalk Hills; Picnic Glade; Hazel Coppice and Hill Fort) contains an ink stamp. Bring a piece of paper with at least three stamps on it to the Chilterns Gateway Centre (N51’52.906, W000’32.261,) to exchange for a ‘geocaching genius’ certificate.

We have great plans for this area so why not stop in and see what new trails and activities we are building?   

The cache is a clip lunch-box covered in camouflage tape, not immediately visible but quite easy to uncover.

Dunstable Downs is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and a kite-flying hotspot. Acres of space to enjoy with fabulous views over the Vale of Aylesbury and along the Chiltern Ridge. Chalk grassland, rich in wildlife, provides prime walking country – spot the gliders soaring over the glorious landscape!

An easy walk from the Chilterns gateway centre, this cache is hidden slightly off the multi user trail, an easy access track that runs along the top of the Downs with stunning views all year round.

The cache is a clip lunch-box covered in camouflage tape, not immediately visible but quite easy to uncover.

Dunstable Downs is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and a kite-flying hotspot. Acres of space to enjoy with fabulous views over the Vale of Aylesbury and along the Chiltern Ridge. Chalk grassland, rich in wildlife, provides prime walking country – spot the gliders soaring over the glorious landscape!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the fourth in a trail of caches telling some of the history of Dunstable Downs. An pleasant walk from the Chilterns Gateway Centre (LU6 2GY), this cache is hidden a few hundred yards beyond the end of the multi user trail, an easy access track that runs along the top of the Downs with stunning views all year round. This cache is also easily accessed from the Northern end of Whipsnade Road (B4541) 

The cache is a clip lunch-box covered in camouflage tape, not immediately visible but quite easy to uncover. This can be a busy area so some stealth will be required.

Dunstable Downs is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and a kite-flying hotspot. Acres of space to enjoy with fabulous views over the Vale of Aylesbury and along the Chiltern Ridge. Chalk grassland, rich in wildlife, provides prime walking country
 
GPS devices are now available to borrow from the Chilterns Gateway Centre so you can introduce your friends and family to geocaching too!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is one of five at National Trust sites around South Bedfordshire (A further 10 caches are located at Dunstable and Whipsnade Downs). It is situated at Totternhoe Knolls which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, a Scheduled Ancient Monument, common land and Open Access Land.

The nature reserve is split into three distinct habitats: The Beech wood; The Castle Mound which consists of the remains of a motte and bailey castle built in the late 11th or early 12th century together with remnants of cultivation terraces; and The Little Hills. Once a medieval stone quarry, the Little Hills are managed by the Wildlife Trust and are an important site for a wide range of chalk grassland flowers and butterflies, including rare orchids. 

The surrounding area is criss-crossed by a network of bridleways and footpaths and there is a car park and picnic area.

The cache is best approached from 'inside' the motte and bailey not the track that runs alongside it as it is a bit of a scramble otherwise. Try starting by walking towards the mound (there is a fantastic view from the top of here) and then circle around to the correct co-ordinates.

In addition to swag and a logbook, each of our countryside caches (Tree Cathedral; Motte and Bailey; Beech Woods and Chalk Hills; Picnic Glade; Hazel Coppice and Hill Fort) contains an ink stamp. Bring a piece of paper with at least three stamps on it to the Chilterns Gateway Centre (N51’52.906, W000’32.261,) to exchange for a ‘geocaching genius’ certificate.  </groundspeak:long_description>

Much of Sundon Hills is a Site of Special Scientific Interest that encompasses chalk grassland, woodland and derelict quarry areas. 
There is a car park and picnic area on the road between Upper Sundon and Harlington.
The National Trust acquired Moleskin and Markham Hills in February 2001. It forms the link between Sundon Hills and Sharpenhoe Clappers. The steep slopes are Scheduled SSSI and include Chalk grassland with scrub and beech woodland.	

The Icknield Way path passes through this area on its route along the chalk ‘spine’ of England.

In addition to swag and a logbook, each of our countryside caches (Tree Cathedral; Motte and Bailey; Beech Woods and Chalk Hills; Picnic Glade; Hazel Coppice and Hill Fort) contains an ink stamp. Bring a piece of paper with at least three stamps on it to the Chilterns Gateway Centre (N51’52.906, W000’32.261,) to exchange for a ‘geocaching genius’ certificate.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is one of five at National Trust sites around South Bedfordshire (A further 10 caches are located at Dunstable and Whipsnade Downs).

The steep slopes and Beech woods have been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The Clappers Wood was planted between 1830 and 1840 on the site of an Iron Age Hill Fort which is designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. 

Hazel woods on surrounding hillsides have previously been coppiced, a form of woodland management where trees are periodically cut at ground level to stimulate growth and to allow a crop of wood to be taken.

In addition to swag and a logbook, each of the countryside caches (Tree Cathedral; Motte and Bailey; Beech Woods and Chalk Hills; Picnic Glade; Hazel Coppice and Hill Fort) contains an ink stamp. Bring a piece of paper with at least three different stamps on it to the Chilterns Gateway Centre (N51’52.906, W000’32.261,) to exchange for a ‘geocaching genius’ certificate.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the Statistics examination from the MK Schooldays series
of caches. The series is based very loosely around GCSE examinations.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The puzzle icon is shown at one of Milton Keynes' educational
establishments, in this case Leon Sports College &amp; School in
Bletchley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the cache is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; at this location. Please do not
attempt to park or search there. It is private land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all of this series, we are available for mentoring and
support by email on request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCSEs were introduced into secondary schools in England in 1986
to replace the previous GCE &quot;O&quot; Levels and CSEs. They are available
in a bewildering array of different subjects in a number of
distinct categories. Statistics sits in the Mathematics
category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing this examination will reveal Bonus Code A for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2FXN1&quot;&gt;MK Schooldays: Graduation Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Round all values down to the nearest integer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North (SD+Median)(Median-SD)
(Max-Median)(Max).(Max+Mode-Median)(Mode-Median)(Mode+SD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West (Min)(Min)(Min)
(Mode)(Median).(Mode-Median)(SD+Median)(Mode-Median)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can mark your own exam papers at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=ea49beaf2e75fd5f9f5653095991e1c2&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=47433247584432&amp;amp;name=4d4b205363686f6f6c646179733b2053746174697374696373&quot;&gt;Geochecker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final cache is a 450ml clip lock box covered in black duck
tape. It contains a small log book and pencil/pen. Please, as ever,
take care to replace the cache as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you will most likely solve this at home before venturing out,
the final cache is placed where the calculated coordinates appear
to be on GoogleMaps. This may be a few feet from where your GPS
thinks it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy your studies and that you get the grades you
need.&lt;/p&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, they are all small, so definitely bring
your own pen.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This one is in the green space separating the houses from the
industrial zone on the south side of Tattenhoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to record the colour of the cache container so you

&lt;p&gt;The location can be approached from several directions, but my
recommendation is to take the green lane between the trees as you
exit the Linear Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be pretty much muggle free at all times but will be a
bit muddy if it's been wet.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

The cache you are searching for is a small plastic box, which when first placed contained a number of small items, log book and pencil. 
I hope you enjoy this short walk through a fine piece english of woodland.

Do keep a lookout for tea pots, there are a number of them fixed to some of the larger tree's as bird boxes. </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Second iteration of this one so please take coordinates from
30/04/2011 maintenance log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, they are all small, so definitely bring
your own pen.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This one is placed amongst the playing fields in the middle of
Tattenhoe. It is placed away from prying eyes, so should be fairly
easy to retrieve without causing suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to record the colour of the cache container so you
can find the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2QGFJ&quot;&gt;Tatty-Nanos: Bonus&lt;/a&gt;. Please don't upload photos of the cache container into your log.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The final one of a short series of caches around Tattenhoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The others in the series are all very small, but this one is
large enough to contain a pencil, a few trinkets and a
logbook..&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be able to find this cache you will need first to find the
six others in the &quot;Tatty-Nanos&quot; series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing complicated to do, simply find the other six
and record the colour of the container. You can then use the
information below to establish the location of this one. Some of
the original containers are losing their paintwork, so if the
colour is not obvious please mail me. A number of people have,
however, managed to guess the Bonus once they have about 4 of the
others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply substitute the information you have found into :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North 51 59.ABC West 000 47.DEF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Red = 5&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2QGDW&quot;&gt;Tatty-Nanos: Tall Trees&lt;/a&gt; (Bonus Code E)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Gold = 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green = 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange = 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red = 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silver = 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final location is fairly secluded so you should have time
and space to breathe here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are intending to complete all of the Tatty-Nanos in one
go we would recommend parking at the St Giles Church Car Park to
minimise the total distance you will need to cover. You can walk
around Tattenhoe in a vaguely clockwise or anti-clockwise direction
- it won't make a difference. The St Giles Car Park is closest to
the actual bonus location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking at&lt;br/&gt;N 51° 59.886 W 000° 47.667    </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;It is overlooked by houses at a distance, but should be OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't believe this has been so popular, but one month old and
the paper log needed replacing. Thanks to everyone who has done our
little series in Tattenhoe and we are very happy most loggers are
enjoying them.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the European Languages examination from the MK
Schooldays series of caches. The series is based very loosely around GCSE examinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The puzzle icon is shown at one of Milton Keynes' educational
establishments, in this case Lord Grey School in Bletchley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the cache is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; at this location. Please do not
attempt to park or search there. It is private land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all of this series, we are available for mentoring and
support by email on request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCSEs were introduced into secondary schools in England in 1986
to replace the previous GCE &quot;O&quot; Levels and CSEs. They are available
in a bewildering array of different subjects in a number of
distinct categories. European Languages sits in the Modern
Languages category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing this examination will reveal Bonus Code E for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2FXN1&quot;&gt;MK Schooldays: Graduation Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;European Languages Examination: Time Limit 10 Minutes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache can be found at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North (vijf)(dva)
(nulla)(noll).(nic)(cinco)(osm)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West (náid)(nol)(cero)
(chetri)(fyra).(hat)(kahdeksan)(tlieta)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can mark your own exam paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=6dda7284c24de936989f4687c846e636&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=47433247563647&amp;amp;name=4d4b205363686f6f6c646179733a204575726f7065616e204c616e677561676573&quot;&gt;Geochecker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final cache is a 450ml clip lock box covered in black duck
tape. It contains a small log book and pencil/pen. Please, as ever,
take care to replace the cache as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you will most likely solve this at home before venturing out,
the final cache is placed where the calculated coordinates appear
to be on GoogleMaps. This may be a few feet from where your GPS
thinks it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy your studies and that you get the grades you
need.&lt;/p&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The Tyne Tunnel is a mysterious passageway connecting Tattenhoe
in Milton Keynes with Tyneside. No-one knows exactly how it works,
although it might just involve a car....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigations on this phenomenon suggest that any trackables
placed in the northbound entry to Tyne Tunnel somehow end up in
South Tyneside. Trackables
from the North-East have also been known to find their way
south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the tunnel you must ensure that you follow the correct
signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey between the first sign and the northbound entry is
quite short but will be twice as long when the river is in spate or
if you aren't very agile on your feet. The first sign is near
to the river, so as ever take care if you have kids. As this is a
tunnel, then you can assume that the end point is on the other
side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the entry to the tunnel you need to read the following
information from the sign at the coordinates above. It is
wheelchair accessible from the pathway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Which cycle trail is this sign on ? (Answer = AB)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
In miles, how far is it from here to Winslow ? (Answer =
C)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
How many letters are there in the designer's given name
? (Answer = D)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
And how many letters in his surname ? (Answer = E)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
In which year was this sign designed ? (Answer = FGHI)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
How many bolts are holding the sign into the floor ? (Answer =
J)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Calculate E-J (Answer = K)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful with &quot;D&quot; - there is an initial, and that is NOT the
answer you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final cache is located at : North AB AG.HIK West 000
ED.DJC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tunnel is a 450ml clip lock box covered in black duck tape.
It is not in plain sight and is not wheelchair accessible. It is a
low traffic area, but there are occasional dog-walking and
horse-riding muggles around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take care to re-hide the tunnel exactly as you found
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The northbound entry to the Tyne Tunnel is a small clip lock box
contained inside the larger one. To pay your toll simply leave one
or more trackables in the box and log the drop as normal on the
website. If your trackables don't fit in the box then it
won't be possible for you to use the tunnel. Please check with the
owner before placing any trackables inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Items travelling southbound through the tunnel will arrive in
the larger box and cachers are welcome to take and relocate any
items there. Please don't remove items from the smaller
box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously if you can write all your logs in Geordie that'd be
canny, like. Wye aye !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original cache description for this cache contains embedded images which cannot currently be embedded on OpenCaching.com. However, you can collect this cache without seeing the image.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This one is placed right on the 52nd degree of latitude as it

&lt;p&gt;It is overlooked by houses, so please exercise some caution.
However, it is also close to a car park, so is excellent for a

&lt;p&gt;It is a fairly quiet area, or so I thought, until I was passed
by 5 pedestrians and two cars while I was there.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the 10 kilometre race from the MK Schooldays series of
caches. The series is based very loosely around GCSE examinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The puzzle icon is shown at one of Milton Keynes' educational
establishments, in this case Shenley Brook End School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the cache is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; at this location. Please do not
attempt to park or search there. It is not there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all of this series, we are available for mentoring and
support by email on request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCSEs were introduced into secondary schools in England in 1986
to replace the previous GCE &quot;O&quot; Levels and CSEs. They are available
in a bewildering array of different subjects in a number of
distinct categories. Running sits in the Physical Education
category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing this examination will reveal Bonus Code I for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2FXN1&quot;&gt;MK Schooldays: Graduation
Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Physical Education Examination: Time Limit 2 Hours&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't much of a question really, it's more of a
practical....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have laid out a 10km course starting at the coordinates
above, which is a redway in front of Shenley Brook End School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start point, and at each subsequent kilometre, you will
need to find a piece of information which is used to take you to
the next marker. Simply follow them all in sequence from start to
end and you will reveal the location of the final cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the markers are near to estate roads and could be
reached by car if you are lazy, but be wary at all times because
the PE Teacher may be lurking just out of sight, waiting for
schoolchildren who are trying to cheat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire course consists of redways or good quality paths. All
of the route is accessible to wheelchair users, cyclists and
childrens' buggies regardless of the weather. The course will take
you through several areas but will finish quite close to the start.
You'll have to do the course to find out exactly where, but rest
assured that even we aren't cruel enough to leave you 10 kilometres
away from your car. The final cache is also quite close to the
start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extra Scooby Snax will be awarded to the most ingenious or
bizarre means of completing the course - upload photos. If you add
your time and mode of transport we might even maintain a leader
board on this page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we want everyone to follow the right course we have
included directions, but you may find a map of Milton Keynes
useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid repetition during the descriptions, please &quot;listen very
carefully, I will say this only once....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I say &quot;enumerate&quot; the text I mean A=1, B=2, C=3, etc. Digits
are used as they are seen. So if the text reads &quot;I am 45&quot; you will
end up with &quot;A BCD EF&quot; = &quot;9 113 45&quot; There is a new set of values at
each kilometre marker, so you don't need them again once you have
calculated the next location. Otherwise we would rapidly run out of
letters of the alphabet. At each marker you'll get one digit for
the final location. So I'll give you something like Q = D - B (2 in
the example here). Remember Q thru Z as you will need all 10 of
these at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you're probably very confused, but hopefully all will become
clear as you read the actual steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, I hope you are now wearing your kit, have done all
your warmup routines and have remembered to go to the toilet,
because we are about to start. Also before you start, make sure you
have a pen and some paper as there is a lot of writing to do. So
let the countdown begin........&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;On your marks, get set, GO !&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;START POINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Task - Enumerate the shortest place name as A BC DE FG HI JK
LM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final Code - No code for the final cache here. You are going to
have to do at least 1km before you get any goodies. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route - Follow the redway past the front of the school. Turn
right and right again alongside the H7 towards Westcroft Roundabout
until you get to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next Marker - N 52 I(D-C).B(E-D)F W 000
M(G+C).(K-H)(B+F)I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1km MARKER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Task - Enumerate the label to get AB C DEF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final Code - Q = C - D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route - Head uphill into Emerson Valley and straight on. At the
second hill/roundabout turn left towards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next Marker - N 52 (C-D)(F-E-D).(C+D)(C+F)(A-D) W
000 (A-C)A.F(E-D)(A+E)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2km MARKER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Task - Enumerate the label to get AB CD EFG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final Code - R = D - E&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route - Continue and turn left down the redway, into Shenley

&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a 450ml clip lock box covered in black duck
tape. It contains a small log book and pencil/pen. Please, as ever,
take care to replace the cache as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All calculated coordinates are as they appear on GoogleMaps,
which may be a few feet from where your GPS thinks it is. However,
all of the markers are obvious when you get there, so you shouldn't
have trouble picking the right items to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GCSEs were introduced into secondary schools in England in 1986
to replace the previous GCE &quot;O&quot; Levels and CSEs. They are available
in a bewildering array of different subjects in a number of
distinct categories. Leisure, Travel &amp; Tourism sits in the
People &amp; Society category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simple practical examination. All you have to do is to
visit the Bureau de Change and buy enough Euros for your upcoming
summer holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We normally use the one at North &lt;b&gt;E U.RO&lt;/b&gt; West
&lt;b&gt;C A.SH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt; = SKK + ( BEF / NLG ) + NLG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;U&lt;/b&gt; = FRF - FIM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RO&lt;/b&gt; = ( EEK * FIM ) + ( EEK / FIM ) + DEM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; = MTL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; = LUF + MCF + ( SKK / EEK )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a book cipher, or more correctly it is a poem cipher. It
will be easy to solve if you can identify the poem. You might be
able to solve it without the poem if you are good at substitution
ciphers. If you can't do either of those then your best bet is to
sweep the area within 1km of the given coordinates and guess where
I might have put it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To confirm you have the correct one, it has 288 words - count
the bits with hyphens as a single word, not as several. Each bullet
below makes one word. Each group makes one sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the final stage in the MK Schooldays series of caches, which is based very loosely around GCSE examinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this cache is the graduation ceremony, the puzzle icon is
shown at The Open University, which is a suitably prestigious
establishment for you to continue your studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the cache is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; at this location. Please do not
attempt to park or search there. It is not there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all of this series, we are available for mentoring and
support by email on request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCSEs were introduced into secondary schools in England in 1986
to replace the previous GCE &quot;O&quot; Levels and CSEs. They are available
in a bewildering array of different subjects in a number of
distinct categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MK Schooldays series requires you to pass at least one subject
from each of nine categories to graduate. Some categories have more
than one subject available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pass in each individual examination will reveal one of the
bonus codes for this graduation puzzle. Different subjects in the
same category will give you the same bonus code, so you don't have
to do every puzzle to graduate, but as most of you are total
addicts we are sure you will do them all anyway, just to prove that
you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categories and subjects currently available from the Examination
Board are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematics (Bonus Code A)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GA0P&quot;&gt;Algebra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GV4V&quot;&gt;English Language&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GYZF&quot;&gt;English Literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GV3D&quot;&gt;Electronics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GBE2&quot;&gt;Physics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classics (Bonus Code D)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GBEN&quot;&gt;Ancient Greek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern Languages (Bonus Code E)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GV6G&quot;&gt;European Languages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanities (Bonus Code F)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2G77G&quot;&gt;Geography&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2G9YQ&quot;&gt;History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People &amp; Society (Bonus Code G)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GZ00&quot;&gt;Leisure, Travel &amp;
Tourism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expressive Arts (Bonus Code H)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2GV5R&quot;&gt;Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical Education (Bonus Code I)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2G7B9&quot;&gt;10km Race&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have passed your 9 GCSEs you are eligible to apply for
the Graduation Certificate. To do this please take the following
steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substitute your 9 bonus codes into the Sudoku grid below&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solve the Sudoku&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer the questions below&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out how to use those answers to get the coordinates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, the Sudoku grid is one containing what is very
likely (but not mathematically proven) the minimum number of
starting entries whilst still having a unique solution (17). About
45,000 grids like this are known. No unique solution grid has been
discovered with 16 or fewer starting entries. Unless you know
different, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the plot, the difficulty rating of this cache is high
because you have to do 9 other puzzles to get here, not because the
Sudoku is hard. It is actually quite a simple one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Opencaching.com is currently not able to display embedded images you will need to get the Sudoku grid from our website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-gardners.co.uk/index.php/geocaching/ourcaches/schooldaysgraduationday.html&quot;&gt;MK Schooldays: Graduation Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have solved the grid, you can find the cache at :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North PQ 0R.STU West 000 VW.XYZ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P = (4/.4)+(4/4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q = Joe Montana's Team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R = 26&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S = General Agricola orders the building of Mamucium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T = Speed of old records (rpm)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;U = Dumbbell Nebula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V = Number of Human Chromosomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W = Slots on an American Roulette Wheel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X = Curium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Y = ASCII %&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Z = Dial Mexico&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can mark your own exam paper at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=7f34d95b610c4a4377615f1fd716ca93&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=47433246584e31&amp;amp;name=4d4b205363686f6f6c646179733a2047726164756174696f6e20446179&quot;&gt;Geochecker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final cache is a 450ml clip lock box covered in black duck
tape. It contains a small log book and pencil/pen and a few
graduation certificates. Help yourself to a certificate. If none
are there, drop us a note through the log and we'll get one to you
somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you will most likely solve this at home before venturing out,
the final cache is placed where the calculated coordinates appear
to be on GoogleMaps. This may be a few feet from where your GPS
thinks it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ever, please take care to replace the cache as you found
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an image of a blank Sudoku grid below so you can print
it out and fill in the Bonus Codes as you go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you have enjoyed this series of caches.&lt;/p&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Round the Bend: Geomorphology and the
River Ouzel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a simple virtual cache. The aim of it is to make you take a
closer look at the world around you, and to make you remember a
geography lesson many moons ago when your teacher was trying in
vain to get you interested in river features. You remember, the one
where you convinced yourself that it would never, ever be of any
use in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well here is the teacher's revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To log this cache you will have to learn about the
processes that shape the earth and in particular the features
created by moving water. You will learn to identify some of these
features and, using this recently re-acquired knowledge, you will
be able to answer the questions posed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy this little journey back to your
childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Geography Lesson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rivers play a key role in shaping the land. Through erosion and
deposition they move rocks and soils around the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the classic features of lowland rivers is the meander. A
meander is a loop-like bend in a river. It seems strange that the
water doesn't just run in a straight course downhill, but you can
demonstrate meandering quite easily by tipping a jug of water
slowly down a sheet of wood, glass or metal. You will only see a
straight course of water if the sheet is at a steep angle. At a
shallow angle the water will wander from side to side. You can
demonstrate this even better with a layer of sand over a slightly
sloping surface, and a hose-pipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a real meander the outer bank is eroded away because here the
water is deeper and flows more quickly. It undercuts the bank and
makes it steeper through incremental collapses. The net effect is
that meanders get more pronounced as time passes, and the outer
bank will be at the steepest angle that the soil material can
support. It may well be vertical at times, and is referred to as a
river cliff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the inner bank we see a much slower flow and hence we get
deposition. A gentle slip-off slope will develop where faster
flowing water slows down and can no longer carry the material
eroded from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more erosion takes place there comes a point where the river
breaks through the narrowing loop and resumes a straighter course.
This quite often happens at times when the river is in spate and
its erosive force is much greater. A little looped or semi-circular
lake is left behind, commonly known as an ox-bow lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the flood plains of rivers like this you can often also find
abandoned channels from previous stages of erosion and deposition.
The river is constantly changing its channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Classic Undercutting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opencaching.com is not currently able to display the images required for this cache. Please view the full cachepage on our website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-gardners.co.uk/index.php/geocaching/ourcaches/roundthebend.html&quot;&gt;Round the Bend: Ouzel Valley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The River Ouzel - Top to
Bottom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The River Ouzel (also known locally as the Lovatt) rises as a
chalk stream from a spring near the Dunstable Downs. It flows
northwards and near Leighton Buzzard it cuts through the Greensand
Ridge. From there it meanders its way northwards into Milton
Keynes, where it has largely been tamed by the balancing lakes at
Caldecotte and Willen. Around Willen Lake its course has also been
altered and straightened. From Willen it meanders a little more
until it joins the Great Ouse at Newport Pagnell. The section of
river we are studying is between Caldecotte and Willen balancing
lakes and upstream of the straightened section. The balancing lakes
act mainly to capture the fast surface run-off from the new city,
and therefore act to reduce the number of very serious floods. The
river therefore behaves more like it would if the city was not
present at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reedbeds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opencaching.com is not currently able to display the images required for this cache. Please view the full cachepage on our website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-gardners.co.uk/index.php/geocaching/ourcaches/roundthebend.html&quot;&gt;Round the Bend: Ouzel Valley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The River Ouzel – A
History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todays river is too small and too passive to cut such a large
valley. In fact, if you stand at the current river you can't
really tell you are in a valley. The closest river terraces are
maybe 150m away towards Woughton on the Green. This is an indicator
that the river once carried a lot more water than it does
today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half a million years ago at the end of the Anglian glaciation
vast amounts of water were released from the melting ice masses.
This water gushed along the valley here, carrying large amounts of
silt, sand and gravels. These sediments were deposited as the water
slowed and became unable to support its weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The River Ouzel - A
Morphology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The River Ouzel is an alluvial river. Alluvial rivers deposit
sediments along their length. The Ouzel has cut through layers of
boulder clay deposited during the retreat of the Anglian ice
sheets. This boulder clay overlies the older Oxford Clay deposits
beneath. The beds and bank are made up of river sediment which is
of a fairly even, and small, grain size. The few pebbles that do
exist are quite rounded. This is an indicator of constant rework by
the river. In a &quot;new&quot; more recent boulder clay deposit
we would see an uneven mixture of grain sizes and much more jagged
rocks. From this we can infer that the Ouzel has been in this
valley for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Floodplain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opencaching.com is not currently able to display the images required for this cache. Please view the full cachepage on our website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-gardners.co.uk/index.php/geocaching/ourcaches/roundthebend.html&quot;&gt;Round the Bend: Ouzel Valley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The River Ouzel – Round The
Bend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To log this cache there is some field observation to be
done, so you will need to make a visit to the site and have a look
around. Access should be easy at all times unless the river is in
flood. There are several gravel paths running through the park
here, and one of these runs past all of the listed waypoint
positions. You can reach the start point on paved routes from
either Monkston Park, or from the car park in Woughton on the Green
(the &quot;Parking&quot; waypoint).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the river features described in the Geography Lesson are
visible within a few hundred yards just here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To claim this cache as a find simply answer the questions below to make up the Code Phrase. Use the following codes for your answers (Abandoned Channel=AC, Oxbow Lake=OL, River Cliff=RC, Slip-Off Slope=SO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start at the information board at the given coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1. Move to waypoint Position 1, a few yards in front of you.
What feature are you standing on ? (Answer aa)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2. What feature is on the other side ? (Answer bb)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3. Now move to waypoint Position 2, about 100m to the North.
Which feature is this ? (Answer cc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4. Now move to waypoint Position 3, about 400m South. What feature
do you think this is ? (Answer dd)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make up your Code Phrase as follows (all capitals,no spaces) - 1aa2bb3cc4dd - Where aa, bb, cc &amp; dd are one of &quot;AC&quot;, &quot;OL&quot;, &quot;RC&quot; or &quot;SO&quot; as above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final cache is a black plastic &quot;turtle tub&quot; around 10cm
diameter and 7cm deep, with a screw top lid. It contains a small
log book and pencil/pen. There's room for small trackables (coins,
etc.), but nothing large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, as ever, take care to replace the cache as you found
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you will most likely solve this at home before venturing
out,the final cache is placed where the calculated coordinates
appear to be on GoogleMaps. This may be a few feet from where your

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Music Examination: Time Limit 50 minutes 33 seconds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At school I was never much of a student of music. Sure, I
listened to plenty, but somehow I could never get the hang of
playing or singing. Maybe they were trying to teach me the wrong
way, maybe I was just tone deaf. I was on the fast track to failure
with my music GCSE. Heaven alone knows why I chose to study music
in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one day our regular teacher was taken ill and I was taught
for a couple of months by a relief teacher, who changed me
completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked a most unlikely source of inspiration. He was a tall,
thin, gaunt and rather introverted American with long black hair.
He wore a crows foot around his neck for good luck. He said he was
from the North, but his accent was definitely Southern. He gave us
something our previous teacher never could. He taught me to learn
about myself, to feel the music, and to use music to express my
emotion. He taught me how to bring harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes salvation comes from the most unlikely of sources, and
now to lessen my troubles I've stopped hanging out with
vultures and empty saviours. I have found my remedy. Would you let
me show you what I mean ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before he came I had thorn in my pride. I was a failure. I
thought of giving up. It's hard to make up your mind
sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes salvation sneaks up and I am a changed woman. No
time for accusations or conversations on all the bad, bad things.
Yes, now I have my remedy. Will you let it slide ? My remedy,
enough to please me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months passed too quickly and the awful day came when my
musical inspiration was to return to the west. He would no longer
be my companion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He left me a note which read simply &quot;Bad luck, Blue Eyes,
goodbye !&quot; He was gone, and with him went my only chance of
success, or so I thought. Sometimes a memory only sees what it
wants to believe. I suffered a hotel illness, but this week's
fashion is last year's flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My past came back to sting me briefly and I was filled with
rage. But if you feel like a riot then don't you deny it, put
your good foot forward. And this proved to be my remedy. Did I see
you laugh about that ? Well I will tell you one more thing. No more
black moon creeping. My three wishes were granter to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will always remember that relief teacher. You may have met him
yourself, but if not then please seek him out and discover his
work. If you do then you will pass the test and you will find the
secret.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the Geography examination from the &quot;MK Schooldays&quot;
series of caches. The series is based very loosely around GCSE examinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The puzzle icon is shown at one of Milton Keynes' educational
establishments, in this case Ousedale School in Newport
Pagnell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the cache is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; at this location. Please do not
attempt to park or search there. It isn't there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all of this series, we are available for mentoring and
support by email on request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCSEs were introduced into secondary schools in England in 1986
to replace the previous GCE &quot;O&quot; Levels and CSEs. They are available
in a bewildering array of different subjects in a number of
distinct categories. Geography sits in the Humanities category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing this examination will reveal Bonus Code F for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX2FXN1&quot;&gt;MK Schooldays: Graduation
Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examination Question - Time Limit 1 Week&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh ! Who's kidding ? Geography was always one of my favorite
subjects at school, and I just haven't got the heart to set you an
examination for this one, so instead I will just tell you a little
story and hope that the headmaster doesn't notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My story begins many years ago when I was 18. I had just passed
my driving test and the world was my oyster. Actually I passed it
when I was 17 years and 9 months, but who's counting ? And yes,
before you ask, I passed it in a car, with a petrol engine, not a
steam one. I'm not that old, thanks very much. The cheek of it
!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, got distracted there, back to the plot....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was saying, I decided to spend a week experiencing driving
in a way I previously could only dream about. The wide open spaces,
the high speeds, no one for company but myself. OK, nowadays you
can't drive anywhere in Britain with being in a jam, but back in
the day...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was still young, I stayed in Britain. At the tender age of
17 years and 9 months there were still plenty of places I had never
been to, and more still that I had not been to on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What better way to celebrate this new found freedom than a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;......ROAD TRIP......ROAD TRIP......ROAD TRIP......&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a shame I didn't have a best friend, girlfriend, or
orang-utan to come with me, but I was young and shy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &quot;where did you go to ?&quot; I hear you asking, &quot;where, where,
where ?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold your horses will you ! Can't you see I'm trying to drag it
out a bit here ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, OK then ! I'll tell you. After all, you've stayed with me
this long, so I feel like I owe you something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being from the North, I decided to start with a trip down south.
I liked it there. I didn't know which side to go so I tried both -
first I went to Exeter and then to Folkstone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a good start I thought, but how could I better it ? I
know, how about a trip to The Principality ? Sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So off I went again, and this time I got as far as Swansea,
having passed through Taunton on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad, but how about Scotland ? It was a long way, but I
eventually made it to Stirling before heading south again and going
tro Canterbury. Wow, that was a long way, more than enough to
warrant a long snooze. Zzzzzzzzzzzzz....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I set off again with renewed vigour. The sun was up, the sky
was blue, and as it was the 80's so Steve Wright was playing Go
West! on the radio. Where to go, though ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swindon was a reasonable start, closely followed by Tamworth.
Finally I made one little trip 'Oop 't North to Huddersfield, and
then that was my lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, lots of roads, lots of miles, and lots of dodgy toilets on
the way. But can you figure out where I finished ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can mark your own exam paper at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=ff049b0c2ba42eb837a1b072f9a3a725&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=47433247373747&amp;amp;name=4d4b205363686f6f6c646179733a2047656f677261706879&quot;&gt;Geochecker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can, you will find a 450ml clip lock box covered in black
duck tape. It contains a small log book and pencil/pen. Please, as
ever, take care to replace the cache as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you will most likely solve this at home before venturing out,
the final cache is placed where the calculated coordinates appear
to be on GoogleMaps. This may be a few feet from where your GPS
thinks it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy your studies and that you get the grades you
need.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; ===========================================================&lt;br/&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cache revolving around an ancient historical market town set in rural north east Buckinghamshire that is known for its pancake race run here every Shrove Tuesday, which is; interestingly always forty seven days before Easter Sunday.&lt;br/&gt;Extra information is available (visit link).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A little known Gallic verse :-&lt;br/&gt;Eating crepes on Candlemas day will bring a year of happiness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eat now eat now eat now eat now eat now eat now eat now eat eat eat eat.&lt;br/&gt;Until Lent anyway heeeheee...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;===========================================================&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is ample free parking along the wide, tree lined High Street, but be aware that some of it is limited to 60 minutes waiting time, which may well be insufficient to complete this cache.To find the cache, you will need to visit the listed locations and obtain various letters, words or phrases. A walk of around two miles will be involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Location 1 – all along the High Street&lt;br/&gt;Your easy starter for 5 - the High Street is lined with old cast iron lamp posts, on each of which is a small cast plaque depicting a chained creature. Simply, what is the creature? (4 letters)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Location 2 – near N 52°09.401 W 0°42.097&lt;br/&gt;An item made of cast iron and more often seen in former times carries three sets of figures, a total of five digits. Add each individual digit together to give a two digit figure, and spell out the answer. (9 letters)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Location 3 – near N 52°09.342 W 0°42.077&lt;br/&gt;A stone carving depicts an old woman engaged in an ancient Buckinghamshire industry. What is the industry? (4 letters)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Location 4 – near N 52°09.175 W 0°42.113&lt;br/&gt;Look for a seated figure, three hares and a quill pen. What do they come together to form? (7+4 letters – tip, the second word contains 2 vowels, not 2 similar consonants)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Location 5 – near N 52°09.160 W 0°42.054&lt;br/&gt;The William Cowper museum is housed in his former home. According to the plaque on the wall, who or what did he translate? (5 letters)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Location 6 – near N 52°09.108 W 0°42.116&lt;br/&gt;The use of this building carved into the stone window lintel contradicts the sign hanging from the wrought iron bracket. What is carved in stone? (9 letters)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Location 7 - near N 52°08.979 W 0°42.052&lt;br/&gt;John Newton’s remains were re-interred here in 1893. He was “Clerk, once an ? and ?, a servant of slaves in Africa”. (7+9 letters)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Location 8 – near N 52°09.015 W 0°42.033&lt;br/&gt;A cast iron plaque hidden in the ivy on the wall and a very worn, narrow yellow line painted across the road mark what? (7+4+6 letters)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using the first letter of each word in the paragraphs highlighted above cross off one corresponding letter in your answers.&lt;br/&gt;i.e. A Cache Revolving Around gives A,C,R &amp; A. Get it ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You should now be left with six letters. Each of these needs to be converted to a number in the time honoured way, a=1, b=2, c=3 etc. In the case of double digit numbers, ignore the leading digit. You should now have six numbers. Are you still with me?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These can now be converted to the co-ords for the location of the cache. Call the lowest number u and then sequentially up to the highest which will be z (zero counts low).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So your final location is N 52° 08.zu(x-v-v) W 0° 41.w(y-x-v)(t/t)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now in it's THIRD location, feel free to log this one again.&lt;br/&gt;This time you're looking for a medium sized jar.  </groundspeak:long_description>

Caxton is a small village located a mile or so south-west of the
modern development of Cambourne. The village is mostly comprised of
the main road, Ermine Street, which used to carry the A1198. In
recent times, a bypass moving the A-road to the east has been
built, returning a sense of peace to the village. A few smaller
roads lead off the main street but the village remains small.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Like every village, town and city in the UK, Caxton has sent its
sons (and now, of course, daughters) to serve at sea, on land and
in the air. Not all of them came back. Like almost every settlement
in the UK they have a nicely maintained war memorial at which the
fallen are remembered every year.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is located near the memorial, but not on it. Please do
not search the memorial itself. You are looking for a pet barrel
nano with only a paper log inside - please bring a pen/pencil and
just add a date and initials.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please spare a thought for those whose names are inscribed here.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.roll-of-honour.com/Cambridgeshire/Caxton.html&quot;&gt;We will
remember them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Walked down through the sleeping village of Caxton to the war memorial at it's southern extremity. Having done a few of these POP's now, I knew pretty much what to look for and this one was no different. Logged the find and rehid, before heading back up hill through Caxton to the waiting cachemobiles and a quiet drive home after a very pleasant evenings caching.

Thanks for the cache,

Jon.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A spooky cache'n'dash just off the A428 in Cambridgeshire. Originally listed on geocaching.com as GC2ZK1J &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Caxton Gibbet is the site of a former gallows that stood just SE of
the crossroads of Ermine Street (now the A1198) and the Cambridge
to Oxford Road (the A428). The gallows now situated there is a
replica believed to have been constructed in about 1900; the
original gallows had disappeared by the early 1800s.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A &lt;i&gt;gibbet&lt;/i&gt; is an iron cage used to display the remains of an
executed criminal. This may have been body parts of treasoners who
had been hanged, drawn and quartered, or the whole cadaver of a
villain slain for some less grievous crime. While it is reputed
that some condemned felons may have been imprisoned in the gibbet
alive, to die slowly of dehydration or exposure, there is scant
evidence that this practice was ever carried out in England.
Gibbeting was outlawed in 1834.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A number of legends exist regarding unfortunate souls reputed to
have been gibbeted at this site, but definitive references are few
and far between. Perhaps if you know of some firm evidence you
could let me know! The most credible report is found at the
Cambridgeshire County Record Office, where a William Cole
(1714-1782) writes that &lt;i&gt;&quot;About 1753 or 1754 the son of Mrs.
Gatward being convicted of robbing the Mail was hanged in chains on
the Great Road.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; There is no explicit reference to Caxton
Gibbet but it is thought by many to be the location Cole describes.
Other sources state that a highwayman called Christopher Ewings was
hanged here in 1676 and that in 1745 the felons Footmass and
Jerroms were hanged for robbery.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
More lurid tales exist in local folklore. In one tale, the landlord
of the nearby inn attempted to rob three wealthy travellers. He
killed all three, having disturbed them and been caught in the act,
and so he disposed of the bodies down the inn's well. Ghostly
footsteps are reputed to lead to the site of the well as if the
ghoulish scene is being replayed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Another story, which appears to have become confused in the
telling, is of the murder of a member or members of the Partridge
family. In one version of the tale, the murderer was hung alive
from the gallows in an iron gibbet; a compassionate baker who
handed him a piece of bread was also hanged.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The cache itself is a camouflaged lock'n'lock box containing the
usual goodies, including an unactivated &lt;a href=&quot;http://EACachers.org.uk&quot;&gt;East Anglia Cachers&lt;/a&gt; geocoin as a FTF
prize. The hide is nothing special, but I hope the location is of
interest. It is by a busy road, so please take care with kids and
dogs. After the cache, to turn northwards you may be better advised
to drive south for a half-mile or so and go right around the next
roundabout.&lt;br/&gt;

Last cache of the night... erm... Morning [:o}

Parked up in a convenient spot and headed over to examine ground zero. Spotted the cache and retrieved the special extraction tool from the caching bag! After fishing around for a bit soon had the cache in hand - great hiding place and well implemented hide.

Thanks for the cache,

Jon.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A short walk from the Cambridgeshire village of Great Paxton. The
route is a mix of concrete road and footpath across a field. It
could get muddy in wet weather and is hard work with a stroller. Originally listed on geocaching.com as GC18Y5Q.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The plateau to the NE of College Farm is earmarked for a wind farm
development subject to much local opposition. More information can
be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stopthewindfarm.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Cotton Farm Action
Group&lt;/a&gt; (Cotton Farm is roughly 2 miles NE of College Farm). I
make no comment about the pros and cons of this scheme, but it is
clear that if it goes ahead it will have a dramatic impact on this
locality.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please do not drive to the farm to park: ample street parking is
available just under a mile away. You are looking for a cylindrical
screw-top container of approximately 1 litre capacity. It contains
log book, pencil and the usual goodies, with ample room for
geocoins and smaller TBs and swaps. Very close to water, so take
care with children. Wellies advised if not essential. &lt;br/&gt;

As we were already in Great Paxton, this cache looked an easy one to get too as well. Techincally it was - however by the time we reached ground zero our boots were at least twice the size and weight they were when we started! The Mud was some of the stickiest I've seen in a very long time. Cache was found in the classic hiding place, although needed double jointed wrists to actually retrieve it! 

Took: Nothing
Left: Nothing

Grabbed: 'Great Outdoors' geocoin.

Thanks for the cache,

Jon.</groundspeak:text>

Everything you need is above. The cache, a camouflaged 2l
lock'n'lock box, is not at the published co-ordinates but is within
1 mile. Originally published as GC1KVMM on geocaching.com, you can check your answers for this puzzle on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=563f125a9db9be0b25ad222249eae4b9&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=4743314b564d4d&amp;amp;name=52656ee920446573636172746573202020&amp;amp;f=3c397a09b076248b5f24d07e0adc6af8&quot;&gt;

Planned an evening of caching in St.Neots and spotted this puzzle needed solving. A quick, but educational read up of René Descartes on Wikipedia and my 'QUEST' to make sense of the numbers was soon complete. Co-ords validated straight away via the handy checker and downloaded to my GPSr. Really enjoyed the walk to this cache and once at ground zero the cache was in the obvious but well disguised hiding place.

Thanks muchly for the puzzle &amp; the cache,

Jon.</groundspeak:text>

Parked at the North Eastern end of the footpath and took a wander down &quot;Doo poo alley&quot; behind the houses and across the field to ground zero. Found the cache without any problems and had just returned it to it's hiding place when a doggle came bounding by, closely followed by it's muggle owner.

Grabbed: Caching on the Moon Geocoin.

Thanks for the cache,

Parked up nearby and found my way through to this area of land behind the houses. Followed the footpath to ground zero and after no success at the first hiding place I checked, I moved on and soon had it found. Not sure I'd want to hang around here much longer as it's obviously someone's air-rifle shooting range based on the number of 22 sized holes in just about everything. Quickly signed log and made my escape!

Found it, although couldn't see the reason for there being a cache here, unless you happened to own a dog that needed desperately to drop it's load?

Parking is on road immediately adjacent to the cache although this
is next to the entrance to a business park so please be
considerate. Stealth may be required at lunch times as
there's loads of office workers out for some fresh air.
Or why not park in Ferry Meadows (watersports centre end) and do a
little round trip of Squirrel Nutfest, Cedars of Lebanon and this
one. It's a pleasant 2.5ish mile walk.

Had to nip into Peterboring today, so decided to have a look for this cache whilst it was quiet in the neighbourhood! Parked up by Minerva house and wandered over to ground zero. Sensei Harry spotted the cache very quickly, and as muggles were approaching, we retired to the cachemobile to sign the logs.

Thanks for the cache,

Jon.

PS - Sorry brother Reef, spotted the squared paper in the cache but as it was blank cito'd it. So I can confirm you were there, but any cache-police that follow - the evidence has gone!</groundspeak:text>

This is a new tricky cache (I hope it's tricky anyway) to compliment some of the other local ones that have cropped up recently. It is not located in a cemetery as such so don't worry about ghouls and ghosts, but it is a lovely location to sit for 5 minutes, and whilst you do so have a look at the lovely cottage on the corner.

Please use discretion whilst searching and logging as you are overlooked by a few houses.

Recommended parking would be on Mill Road after the double yellow lines, or at the local supermarket just off Grosvenor Road. 

Take care as you will be on a main road corner, and sometimes boy racers try and take the corner on two wheels.

Please bring a writer for this one and replace as found please.

Congratulations to Andytuk for the FTF!  </groundspeak:long_description>

TTT stands for Team Twitter Trail. The trail came
into being after a discussion between local geocachers over
Twitter. The Team Twitter Trail is a trail of caches around the
Peterborough Green Wheel cycle network. Caches are placed at
regular intervals along 50 miles of cycleways, footpaths and
bridleways that circle the city of Peterborough and surrounding
villages. Each section of the trail has been placed by a different
member of the team and reflects their own hiding
styles.
&lt;br/&gt;

Keep a sharp lookout for muggles! Please restore leafouflage when

The first in this section of the trail is an easy one, Just a
couple of steps off the path. Plenty of nearby parking but this
trail is best done by bike.

Recently I've been experimenting with a new (for me) cache design and though I would place one of the early attempts out in the wild and see how it goes. As much as I enjoy micro and nano caches, I still prefer 'proper' cache and even more so if they're well disguised rather than just well hidden. Feedback on the container most welcome.
There is room inside for the logbook and small swaps/coins/bugs. 

Parking at Orton Mere or on one of the residential streets accessed from Sugar Way. There are several other good caches in this area including a good one 'in disguise' so why not take the time to tick them off your list.

Visited cache this morning and am sorry to report that somepoint pretty soon after my visit last night the cache has been the victim of vandalism. The screw cap of the cache has clearly been bashed hard several times, apparently in an attempt to open it, and when that didn't work, someone has cut it open.
I don't think its going to be kids or anything like that since they would probably just have stolen the entire cache and not replaced it in the way it has been. So it must have been someone who knew what they were looking for.
The contents appear in tact and I will leave the cache active while I replace the lid. I don't think its going to get damp as the weather has been good recently. Obviously it is very disappointing that someone would do this. Please, if you can't work out how to open a cache, don't destroy it to get in to it.</groundspeak:text>

TTT stands for Team Twitter Trail. The trail came
into being after a discussion between local geocachers over
Twitter. The Team Twitter Trail is a trail of caches around the
Peterborough Green Wheel cycle network. Caches are placed at
regular intervals along 50 miles of cycleways, footpaths and
bridleways that circle the city of Peterborough and surrounding
villages. Each section of the trail has been placed by a different
member of the team and reflects their own hiding
styles.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of people fishing when you find/replace this
cache. Initials only on log please and replace carefully&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is placed by a bridge over the Nene and one sort-of
bridge over a small stream. When I returned to check this one a
snail had taken up residence next to the cache. Please don't try to
unscrew him or extract a log from him! He's innocent!

Oxford won the boat race this year so they get the cache nearest to
the finish line! Watch out for those low branches.

TTT stands for Team Twitter Trail. The trail came
into being after a discussion between local geocachers over
Twitter. The Team Twitter Trail is a trail of caches around the
Peterborough Green Wheel cycle network. Caches are placed at
regular intervals along 50 miles of cycleways, footpaths and
bridleways that circle the city of Peterborough and surrounding
villages. Each section of the trail has been placed by a different
member of the team and reflects their own hiding

This used to be a footpath up to the bridge over the river but it
has since been fenced off. Please be careful not to drop the cache
when you retrieve it.

&lt;br/&gt;

A slightly more tricky one to finish off my section of the trail.
No need to cross the bridge or get too close. Please be aware of
children near the water. Initials only and no stamps please, they
take up too much space in the log.
&lt;p&gt;I hope you have enjoyed my section of the Team Twitter Trail.
From here you can go over the bridge and start at section 01 or
carry on and cross the Nene to the end of section 09.&lt;/p&gt;

Does anyone else remember the song Eye Level, by the Simon Parks
Orchestra, it went to number 1 for 4 weeks in 1973 - I remember my
Dad having it on a compilation tape and loved the track, even
though I wasn't born when it came out. Anyone back to the cache:
This cache is a small camo tube hidden in the trees. The ground
close to GZ is bumpy, hence the terrain rating on this one. Good
Luck.</groundspeak:long_description>

So here we have a cache that is a 35mm pot, the clue is in the
title. If on a mountain bike you may not even need to dismount. As
ever please practise good caching and replace exactly as found if
you would please! Good Luck.</groundspeak:long_description>

TTT stands for Team Twitter Trail. The trail came
into being after a discussion between local geocachers over
Twitter. The Team Twitter Trail is a trail of caches around the
Peterborough Green Wheel cycle network. Caches are placed at
regular intervals along 50 miles of cycleways, footpaths and
bridleways that circle the city of Peterborough and surrounding
villages. Each section of the trail has been placed by a different
member of the team and reflects their own hiding
styles.
&lt;br/&gt;

Gates rock, especially this one, what do you think? For this series
of caches on the Team Twitter Trail, you are best parking in
Marholm and walking the route, it's a couple of miles I think. Or
at the Castor end of Ham Lane there is space for a car or too off
the road, but please don't block any gates of course.</groundspeak:long_description>

A simple cache on the Team Twitter Trail, this is a small camo'd

Cache is, I suppose, somewhere between a micro and a small, well
it's not micro, but only holds the log book. So please bring a
writer! The clue is there somewhere, and please replace as you
found it. Parking for this part of the team twitter trail is best
found in Marholm Village.</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is a small round lock n lock, so a swap or two is
welcome, cache at time of placing contains just a log sheet and an
pencil from Sweden.... If I can find a note book small enough I'll
pop one in for better logging ability! Parking for this part of the

TTT stands for Team Twitter Trail. The trail came
into being after a discussion between local geocachers over
Twitter. The Team Twitter Trail is a trail of caches around the
Peterborough Green Wheel cycle network. Caches are placed at
regular intervals along 50 miles of cycleways, footpaths and
bridleways that circle the city of Peterborough and surrounding
villages. Each section of the trail has been placed by a different
member of the team and reflects their own hiding
styles.
&lt;br/&gt;

Like trees, this cache is tubular. But smaller than a tree, much
smaller! Please bring a pen(cil) for this cache too! Parking is
best found in Marholm.</groundspeak:long_description>

This take you back into Marholm Village, the cache is a 35 mm pot
at eye level, it's quite a sign of the times. Pen(cil) essential! I
can confirm it meets the GAGB guidelines for urban caches.</groundspeak:long_description>

Quite close to Marholm, just over the bridge, watch out for cars,
muggles, horses, everything! Take care near the bridge if you have
children with you, water is nearby. A pen is required for the
cache. Please replace as found and ensure cache is well hidden
before you move on - thanks!</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache here is a disguised tub, OK for swaps, at ground level.
Please treat co-ords as accurate to within 20ft, at time of taking
my readings I had GPS issues! If people struggle to find I will
visit site to gain a more accurate reading but I am sure
Peterborough cachers will find it! Please bring a writer, and
parking is available near cache on verge, or in Marholm.</groundspeak:long_description>

Named after a very fine song by Suede, nineties rock/indie
pioneers! And a cache that also happens to be attracted to metal.
Say no more. Pakring is OK at this one, but don't block the gates
please, and if you doing more of the trail, it's maybe best to park
up in Marholm village. A writer's required, no room for swaps, just
a logbook here. Enjoy the cache!</groundspeak:long_description>

Small camo tube, in the trees, about 2 foot up, so most of you
should be OK with this one. A writer's required. You can still hear

TTT stands for Team Twitter Trail. The trail came
into being after a discussion between local geocachers over
Twitter. The Team Twitter Trail is a trail of caches around the
Peterborough Green Wheel cycle network. Caches are placed at
regular intervals along 50 miles of cycleways, footpaths and
bridleways that circle the city of Peterborough and surrounding
villages. Each section of the trail has been placed by a different
member of the team and reflects their own hiding
styles.
&lt;br/&gt;

This cache takes you to a bridge which crosses the east cost main
line - the trains fly through this bit! Often at the weekend you'll
see trainspotters at this location. Cache is a magnetic nano, as
you'd perhaps expect I guess. Take care for muggles, and please
bring a writer. Congrats to Handymoo for FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

So from the co-ords you will see a really odd sign, well all about
odds and evens, this way , that away.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caching is more important than who lives where, so go ahead and
find this one! a micro nano, hanging tough. This cache meets the

This small enclave of  farm buildings and houses is known as Odder, but its name has undergone a surprising number of changes over the past 200 years.  The cache is located on the Bridleway between Odder and South Carlton.

Having played here for a few years we thought it appropriate to locate a cache nearby. The container is a disguised micro container.

Lincoln Golf Club was founded in Lincoln City in 1891 and moved to its present site at Torksey in 1903, where the course was designed by Open Championship winner J H Taylor. The first season's play included a professional match between J H Taylor and another Open Championship winner James Braid, which was won by J H Taylor with a score of 75 + 74 beating James Braid's 75 + 78. 

The club's championship standard course has been the venue for The English Seniors County Championship, Lincolnshire Open Championship, the Lincolnshire Amateur Championship, and the Lincolnshire Junior Championship, as well as many other County and Regional matches. 


Please return it as found please.  Please bring pen/cil.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Situated between Coates and Thorpe le Fallows, on a bridleway, we have placed 7 individual caches for the discerning seeker.

This is a small camouflaged container with only a log.  Pencil needed.

A visit to the church at Coates is recommended.


St Edith's church, Coates, stands is a lonely reminder of the past. There is no village; the church stands beside farm buildings in a small copse of trees. The building is very simple, with a small chancel, nave, and bellcote. The origins of the building are 12th century, with some later additions.

Why, then, given this unassuming exterior, should you be interested in a visit to Coates church? The answer lies in the interior, where you will find the only 15th century rood screen in Lincolnshire. The screen, in simple Early English style, has been sensitively restored. Opposite the entrance is a lovely royal coat of arms dating to 1635.

In the gallery above the rood screen is a painted figure of the Virgin Mary, just visible against the wood panelling.</groundspeak:long_description>

A magnetic nano container. Pencil needed.

A visit to the church at Coates is recommended.

St Edith's church, Coates, stands is a lonely reminder of the past. There is no village; the church stands beside farm buildings in a small copse of trees. The building is very simple, with a small chancel, nave, and bellcote. The origins of the building are 12th century, with some later additions.

Why, then, given this unassuming exterior, should you be interested in a visit to Coates church? The answer lies in the interior, where you will find the only 15th century rood screen in Lincolnshire. The screen, in simple Early English style, has been sensitively restored. Opposite the entrance is a lovely royal coat of arms dating to 1635.

In the gallery above the rood screen is a painted figure of the Virgin Mary, just visible against the wood panelling.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Situated between Coates and Thorpe le Fallows, on a bridleway, we have placed 7 individual caches for the discerning seeker.

Stealth required - close to buildings.

This is a small camouflaged container with only a log. Pencil needed.

A visit to the church at Coates is recommended.


St Edith's church, Coates, stands is a lonely reminder of the past. There is no village; the church stands beside farm buildings in a small copse of trees. The building is very simple, with a small chancel, nave, and bellcote. The origins of the building are 12th century, with some later additions.

Why, then, given this unassuming exterior, should you be interested in a visit to Coates church? The answer lies in the interior, where you will find the only 15th century rood screen in Lincolnshire. The screen, in simple Early English style, has been sensitively restored. Opposite the entrance is a lovely royal coat of arms dating to 1635.

In the gallery above the rood screen is a painted figure of the Virgin Mary, just visible against the wood panelling.</groundspeak:long_description>

Opening in 1984 on the site of the old Humber Dock and Railway Dock, the Marina is home to many private craft as well as a Royal Navy training ship and the Spurn Lightship, which served as a floating lighthouse on the Humber Estuary from 1927 until 1975.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The lightship now serves as a museum, but is currently closed for refurbishment.

The area is named for Holy Trinity Church, the largest parish church in the country when floor size is measured. Parts of the building date back to the 13th Century and it is still in use as a church as well as being open to the public for tours. William Wilberforce was baptised here.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Also in and around the square are; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A statue of Andrew Marvell, a 17th century poet, politician, and lecturer at the church.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Old Grammar School, built in the 16th century and one of the oldest grammar school buildings in the country. The above mentioned Wilberforce and Marvell both attended here, along with several other historical figures. It is rumoured to be haunted.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Nearby is the Princes Quay Shopping Centre and the Marina.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This area can get busy, hence the difficulty level.

A journey around Hull City Centre seeing some of the sights, with a small container and some trades waiting at the finish point.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Much of the area is pedestrianised so the simplest way to get around is to walk. If necessary it is possible to get at least close to all stages in car, but it's a more indirect route. Not all stages are wheelchair accessible, including the final one.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One stage closes at 4:30, so if you want to go inside and have a look  around (not required, it's just interesting) you'll need to come before that. The information needed to answer the question at this location, as well as all other stages, is accessible at all times.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Stages:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located just outside the Prospect Shopping Centre near a statue of pioneering aviator Amy Johnson, who was born in the city.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Johnson is famous for such feats as being the first woman to fly solo from Britain to Australia and the first, along with a co-pilot, to fly from London to Moscow in one day. She also broke several existing records such as Britain to South Africa (twice, after her first record was itself broken), Japan, and India.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She died in 1941 while transporting planes for the RAF. Conflicting reports state that she was either forced to bail out over the Thames Estuary during bad weather or that she was shot down by British anti-aircraft guns for failing to give the correct identification signal. Her body was never found.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Aside from the statue, a school in Hull (now closed) was named after her. There are also tributes to her in several other cities around the world.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This can be a very busy area hence the difficulty level.

By this time we were starting to out-stay our welcome as time was ticking on and the boys were getting a little fractious - but could we stretch to just one more cache.....?

(Of course we could!)

Opened in 2007 the St Stephen's shopping centre stands on the site of the old bus station and long closed ABC Cinema, and is adjacent to the refurbished Paragon Interchange containing both the bus and train station. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The site is also home to the Albemarle Music Centre and the new Hull Truck Theatre, which moved from the building on nearby Spring Street. The old theatre building can be seen behind the cache site.

Regular container on a field between Spring Bank West and Anlaby road, accessible via a bike path running between the two.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is not a playing field so I don't imagine it'll ever get really busy, though it does seem somewhat popular with dog walkers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There are lots of bramble bushes around but the cache is not in one of these.

A nice quiet park that's quite a bit bigger than it first appears.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I discovered this park while scouting for new cache locations, which just goes to show it's not only finding caches that can take you to new places.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The cache site is pretty much surrounded by brambles, bushes and nettles etc. but there is at least one path through them to the cache. This is reflected in the terrain rating.

One of only twenty World War II bomb sites remaining in the UK, the National Picture Theatre was bombed during an air raid in March 1941. There were no casualties.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The site has been largely untouched since then, and a campaign is under way to turn the site into a memorial to those who were killed during the blitz. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Most of the interior was destroyed but the façade is largely intact, and while it's not possible to enter the building it is still worth seeing just for the history it represents.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Next to the cinema is the Swan Inn which closed in 2003. There are plans to reopen this pub as part of the campaign.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;
This cache is near the playing field formally belonging to Newland Avenue Primary School, which is now closed. The area doesn't seem to be officially named so I'm calling it Reynoldson Field after the nearest street, though I'm sure other people use other names. The area actually consists of two fields, the front one is somewhat overgrown while the playing field is at the back.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
At some point in the early to mid 90's the area was renovated to pretty much what is there now and not long after the field was acquired by the school, though it was only used a few times a year. I guess having a school field 10 minutes away from the school put them off using it more frequently.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Despite the fact that it was rarely used by the school the playing field was not open for public use until 2008 (2 years after the school itself closed), when the Council finally seemed to accept that people were using the field whether they were allowed to or not and installed new gates giving access during the day.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The cache is on the path running alongside both fields (accessible at all times from Jack Kaye Walk). This path used to connect to the end of the adjacent Ella Street and could be used as a shortcut as well as a place to take a nice, scenic, stroll.



At some point in the last few years the access to Ella Street was blocked for some reason, some of the trees were cut down, and a 10 foot steel fence was installed a few feet to the side of the path. Unfortunately this has detracted somewhat from the aesthetics of the area.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The path is not paved and a slight slope needs to be climbed to get onto it so it's not really accessible for wheelchairs or buggies. Please note that Google Maps will map a route via the bottom of Ella Street, but it is not actually possible to get to the cache this way.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It probably goes without saying but if you decide to come at night bring a torch as there are no street lights nearby and it gets very dark.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I hope you enjoy my first cache. Please feel free to email me if you need any further assistance.

million acres of cache desert in the East Riding of Yorkshire. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The cache one of me pots with a log book and usual bits and bobs
in. It is hidden just short of half a mile from the Sir Tatton
Sykes Monument @ 54°02.616'N, 0°32.365'W. This is one impresive
sight.. not yer normal run of the mill monument, check out the
piccy. You can park here and walk to the cache site or drive,
whatever the mood takes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 This was going to be an offset cache but found you could get info
affa the net to solve it.. Oh! Joy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Sir Tatton Sykes, had a bit of a reputation as a bare knuckle
fighter, but also as a good kinda guy, Well his friends built this
thing for him.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 May I suggest a look around Sledmere, not a lot there but the
archetecture is something else. The Hall has gardens and also had
quite a reputation as a stud.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 Just can't understand why some Yorkshireman aint got in first
!!!!!!!&lt;br/&gt;

 Enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This National Trust cache will take you to our land at Port Mulgrave - a brilliant place for enjoying wildlife, hunting for fossils, learning about our industrial past or just enjoying breath-taking scenery.


The National Trust is a charity that protects special places in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for ever, for everyone.

The settlement at Port Mulgrave owes its existence to the ironstone mining industry of the mid 19th century. The old mine entrance can still be seen 50 feet above the high water mark. After the mine ceased to be productive the tunnel was extended to join with the Grinkle Park mine and used to transport stone to the harbour by narrow gauge railway.

Little remains of the harbour these days. It was destroyed by the Royal Engineers during the Second World War to prevent it being used as a landing area by invading Nazi's. What remains is a popular spot for local sea fishermen.

Today Port Mulgrave is probably best known for its geology. The shales that make up the coastal slopes are rich in fossils and draw geologists and palaeontologists from far and wide. Ammonites can often be found in recent rock falls and you may be lucky enough to find reptile remains. If you do look for fossils at the base of the cliffs, please take the necessary safety precautions and listen out for falling rocks.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This National Trust multicache will take you on a tour of the
picturesque fishing village of Staithes before revealing the final
cache location atop Cowbar Nab - the headland that shelters the
bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parking is at N 54° 33.340' W 000° 47.605'. There is nowhere to
park in the village itself, so please don't attempt to take cars
any further than the car park. The streets of Saithes can be very
steep, so although this is only a short walk, be prepared to do a
bit of exercise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cowbar Nab is cared for by the National Trust. In spring the
cliff face is home to a raucous seabird colony where kittiwakes,
fulmars and the occasional razorbill jostle for position on the
narrow ledges. In summer it is covered by wild flowers, notably the
rare wild cabbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Trust is a charity that protects special places in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for ever, for everyone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the cache you will need to find the answers to the
following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question One: N 54° 33.358' W 000° 47.660'&lt;br/&gt;
James Cook is the most famous former resident of Staithes. He
worked for William Sanderson, a local merchant for 18 months before
leaving to join the merchant navy. In what year was Captain Cook
born?&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = 17&lt;b&gt;AB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Two: N 54° 33.434' W 000° 47.648'&lt;br/&gt;
Staithes used to be the most important fishing station in the North
of England. How many cobbles were there here in 1816?&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = &lt;b&gt;CD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Three: N 54° 33.519' W 000° 47.415'&lt;br/&gt;
In what year did Captain Cook move to Staithes?&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = 17&lt;b&gt;EF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Four: N 54° 33.643' W 000° 47.308'&lt;br/&gt;
In what year was the recontruction of the breakwater
completed?&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = 19&lt;b&gt;GH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goal: N 54° 33.(&lt;b&gt;B-A&lt;/b&gt;)(&lt;b&gt;H&lt;/b&gt;)(&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;)' W 000°

The National Trust is a charity that protects special places in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for ever, for everyone.

Today the Loftus Alum Quarry is a peaceful place to get away from it all and enjoy the cliff top views of the coast, but between 1656 and 1863 it was a centre of industrial activity.


At its height this was the most prolific quarry complex on the Yorkshire Coast, producing around 900 tonnes of alum per year. Alum was a valuable product at this time as it was a vital ingredient for the textile and tanning industries. Remains of the industry still survive.

The second cache is in an area known as the Warren adjacent to the quarry. Creating alum was a slow an laborious process. It took up to 100 tons of shale to create 1 ton of alum. First pickmen quarried the shale from the rock face. Barrowmen then took the shale to clamps where it was burned for up to a year. Liquormen washed the burnt shale in seeping pits on the edge of the quarry to produce alum liquor, which was then taken to the Alum works for further processing. The remains of the wet shale were then dumped over the edge of the cliff by pitmen.</groundspeak:long_description>

The National Trust is a charity that protects special places in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for ever, for everyone.

Today the Loftus Alum Quarry is a peaceful place to get away from it all and enjoy the cliff top views of the coast, but between 1656 and 1863 it was a centre of industrial activity.


At its height this was the most prolific quarry complex on the Yorkshire Coast, producing around 900 tonnes of alum per year. Alum was a valuable product at this time as it was a vital ingredient for the textile and tanning industries. Remains of the industry still survive.

The location of this cache should give you a good view across the field to the hamlet of Street Houses. The cottages here were originally built to house the alum workers that worked the quarry. There is also a farm and a chapel, although the later was not built until around the time the quarry closed.</groundspeak:long_description>

The final cache of the series is hidden within the quarry where the huge quantity of removed shale has created a double cliff. The quarry floor has developed some interesting vegetation as it has returned to nature. A 'dry heath community' now exists with species such as ling, bell heather, sheep sorrel and wood sage.</groundspeak:long_description>

of Warsett Hill and the surrounding area where you will discover
fabulous views, amazing sculptures and fascinating industrial
history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This multicache is best enjoyed as a circular walk of around 4.5
miles starting at the public car park in Saltburn (N 54°35.080' W
000°58.030') and then following the Cleveland Way along the coast
to the location for the first question. Obvious inland paths then
lead back to Saltburn from the final cache location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those wanting a shorter walk can access Warsett Hill via the
public footpath through Hunley Hall golf course from Brotton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completing this cache requires crossing the railway line. Please
do this only at the proper crossing points at N 54°34.890' W
000°55.290' and N 54°35.050' W 000°56.235'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the winter cattle graze Warsett Hill and can be quite
inquisitive, which some people find quite intimidating. If you
aren't comfortable around livestock, this cache would be more
enjoyable in the summer months. It can also be quite muddy, so
walking boots are recommended&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Trust is a charity that protects special places in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for ever, for everyone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the cache you will need to find the answers to the
following questions. The final location is close to question 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question One: N 54°35.169' W 000°55.848'&lt;br/&gt;
The sculptures alongside the Cleveland Way were created by the
artist Richard Farrington as part of a 'New Milestones' project and
were inspired by ideas about locally distinctive features in the
landscape. This shape of sculpture is based on a trawl door. The
items on the shelves are based on plankton. How many of these
'plankton' are there?&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Two: N 54°35.106' W 000°55.458'&lt;br/&gt;
This sculpture – the Circle is the most famous of the series.
What year was it created.&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = 19&lt;b&gt;BC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Three: N 54°35.013' W 000°55.235'&lt;br/&gt;
Take time to read about the Guibal fan house. It may not be the
most attractive of buildings, but it was an incredible feat of
engineering. Between 1872 and 1906 it contained a gigantic 9 metre
wide fan that drew fresh air through the mines below. At what speed
did the fan rotate?&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = &lt;b&gt;DE&lt;/b&gt; r.p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question Four: N 54°35.001' W 000°55.838'&lt;br/&gt;
Enjoy the spectacular views along the coast from the top of Warsett
Hill where you will also find a triangulation pillar. These pillars
were erected by the Ordnance Survey from 1935 on prominent hills
across Great Britain. On a clear day it was possible to see at
least two other triangulation pillars at every point. By carefully
measuring the angles between each pillar the Ordnance Survey were
able to accurately map the whole of the country. Every
triangulation pillar has a unique reference number. What is the
number of this pillar?&lt;br/&gt;
Answer = S&lt;b&gt;FGHI&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goal: N 54° 35.(&lt;b&gt;B-E&lt;/b&gt;)(&lt;b&gt;D+G&lt;/b&gt;)(&lt;b&gt;F+I&lt;/b&gt;)' W 000°
56.(&lt;b&gt;A-C&lt;/b&gt;)(&lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;)(&lt;b&gt;H-D&lt;/b&gt;)'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The remains of the Guibal Fanhouse at Warsett Hill provide a reminder of the ironstone mining that was once a major industry in the area. Today both the fanhouse and the surrounding area are cared for by the National Trust. 
The National Trust is a charity that protects special places in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for ever, for everyone

The fanhouse was part of the Huntcliff ironstone mine that operated between 1872 and 1906. A complex maze of horizontal tunnels (or bords) were mined out of the ironstone seam beneath the ground and the stone hauled up in tubs using a steam driven rope system. Eventually the pillars between the bords were removed too as the miners worked back through the mine.

The gas and dust that could build up in the mines made it dangerous and unpleasant work. The Guibal fanhouse improved conditions by drawing stale air out of the mine by the means of a huge rotating fan. Named after its Belgian inventor, these fanhouses sprung up all over the area. Today the remains at Warsett are the best preserved.
