            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Head on up to Arcata Community Forest. Take 14th Street and then park at the trailhead. To locate this cache you want to stay on the trail marked #1. Don't worry, it's an easy stroll through the forest and shouldn't take but 5 minutes. Follow trail and after about 5 minutes you should arrive at some wooden steps descending to a little clearing. The cache is just before the bridge erected above the little stream. When you think you've found the Chair of Wisdom, feel free to take a seat! </groundspeak:long_description>

Thoroughly searched formation with four baby trees. Did find several beer cans within the formations leading us to believe non-cachers must have discovered and tampered with the cache. Beautiful location for a hunt and will recommend the area to others.</groundspeak:text>

My first OC find and a FTF to boot. I have been to this area a bunch of times but never down this trail, we will have to come back when it isn't foggy so we can check out the view. The other times I was here was to hide a cache which I had to remove and the last time to find the Earth cache here. The coordinates were off 40' or so, I forgot to look after I found it to see exactly how far but the hint zeroed us right in after searching the wrong pile of rocks. After I found it I realized I wasn't sure what my OC username was so I put down what I thought it was, Breezly, which was wrong, and my second choice which was closer, Bruhn which is my geocaching.com username. That was wrong too but close enough, if I get back I will add the &quot;S&quot; to the front of it.
Took: tick nippers which us coastal cachers can always use, it's getting to be tick season.

As a way to say thank you, please respect the area and CITO if you see it. Oh... and this cache location is accessible 24hrs a day, so respect the gate sign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the gates are open, check out the view of the harbor.  There is a great photo op as well -- Please upload yours to the listing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats twopeasinapod FTF!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***Noticed what looks like damage to Ground Zero.

One can drive to this location depending on what one drives (for me it is a 4x4 toyota). The road conditions in some places are a little less than friendly. We never did get to the cache we wanted. It should be obvious why once you get here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The terrain rating is based on either the road conditions or the length of the hike.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A sign of the times, this cache directs your attention to the past, or. At least a place where you can park to view the past. No stopping on the road, but a nearby side street may suffice. Byp(pen) to log this relic. If vertically challenged, teamwork may be required.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The area immediately outside the gates of Canada's Air Force Base, CFB Comox, is vibrant with greenery year round I am told.  Even more so in the Spring and Summer months.  This cache is one of several that I have added to the area,, in the hopes that residents and visiting Cachers alike will take the opportunity to not only grab a few &quot;Finds&quot;, but also to lead your through some of the postcard worthery scenery that I enjoyed while placing these caches.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
please bring something to sign the Log with, and be sure to hide the cashe well enough in so that the next scherzo may enjoy the hunt. Happy Caching!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Reach up, then in and down.  You may need a boost or something to stand on if vertically challenged.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache is
not at the above coordinates !
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This is the story of a geocacher named
Victor.&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;After noticing a new cache, Victor decided to
try and be the first to find it. He drove to the trail head
coordinated and proceeded to walk into the cache. After walking
three hundred and thirty three meters at two hundred and fifty two
degres true, victor stopped on a wooden bridge to admire the nice
creek. Carrying on for another three hundred and seventy nine
meters at one hundred and eighty eight degrees, Victor arrived at a
nice spot to sit and enjoy the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About to continue, Victor noticed a girl coming
down the trail towards him. Seeing the GPS receiver in her hand,
Victor realized he had most likely been beaten to the cache. This
girl's name happened to be Vicky, and the two found themselves
engaged in a nice chat about geocaching. One thing they both
noticed quickly was a mutual interest in physics and their
conversation soon sounded like a lecture on vectors. After a short
while, Victor learned that Vicky had indeed found the cache behind
a spot where she had stopped to sit and reread the cache page and
was now on her way out to her car. She told Victor that she had
left the cache site and walked two hundred and seventy four meters
at one hundred and sixty two degrees where she came to a trail
junction. Vicky had then taken the trail that led her four hundred
and eighty one meters at two hundred and sixty six degrees. Here
Vicky had stopped at another trail junction and followed the trail
that led her four hundred and twenty five meters at three hundred
and sixty degrees. This is where she met Victor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After their discussion Victor realized there was
probably an easier way to find the cache. He decided to walk out
with his new found friend and come back the next day. At home
Victor thought about his conversation with Vicky and with the
information he knew about his walk combined with what Vicky had
told him about her walk, he soon realized he could walk a much
shorter distance to the cache than he had originally planned. With
a little bit of vector math, Victor had come up with a straight
forward path to where he thought the cache should be. He went out
the next day, followed his new vector and found the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can you
find Victor's vector?
&lt;br /&gt;
There are two ways to approach this cache.&lt;br /&gt;
1. One that is harder on the legs and easier on the math&lt;br /&gt;
2. One that is harder on the math and easier on the legs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is also one fundamental rule for adding vectors you will need
to apply in either scenario if you want to find this cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need to leave the trail system. All
waypoints were taken while standing on the trail. Due to reception
in the area, you may find a waypoint slightly off the trail. The
only time you will need to step off the trail is to grab the cache
container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: V124V0M - Victor 1&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Victor's first vector.
