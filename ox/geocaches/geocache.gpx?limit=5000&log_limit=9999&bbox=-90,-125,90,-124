this is a beautiful outlook of the ocean right outside of klamath california and is only a 15-20 minute drive to the redwoods (Highly recommended). this is a 2 quart cache with a blue screw on lid... i threw in lots of swag to get this started so enjoy!
 P.S. don't forget to sign my guest book!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">* this cache was placed by another geo and was suddenly achieved so what is there is the original container and contents. at some time soon we will go maintenance it with a new container. * used to be called Arago Peak and its to beautiful a view to let this one go, so we adopted it. (there is a bench mark by Ents 10 fyi)

definitely take the time to go to this cache! on a clear day the views are spectacular! you will be 602' above sea level at this point. the cache site is a perfect place to sit and have lunch or a snack and enjoy the view.

there are many other caches along the way to this so please visit them too. this trail can be started at Cape Arago State Park or further down the road at a trail head for March of the Ents series.

once you reach the area there is no real path to this cache but you will eventually find an animal type trail/geo path (albeit a bit of bushwhacking) you will go down the hill and through the salal (we didnt find any stickeries) just follow the GPS and your compass and you will find this hidden treasure.

great place to lunch or snack at!

well this is a nice quiet neighborhood. and thought the micro forest could use some visits. there are some very old ivy vines growing here, bigger than i've ever seen. one tree in particular stands out from the rest and is missing something the others have. if you've ever seen &quot;it's a mad, mad, World&quot; you will understand what i'm talking about! enjoy!

container is bigger than a nano, but smaller than a film canister.
please park on 12th side and not ingersol as there's no parking signs.
DO NOT go down the hill to the property owners yard area, there is no need. * GPS can be a bit jumpy

there is an active neighborhood watch program here, but have met with one of their watchers and he knows what we're up to! so have fun

drive back to the day use parking lot. stay on the outer trails and don't cut through the park, easy short walk.

* FYI...day use fee area, one pass can get you into many other locations on the caching route and many other parks for the day!</groundspeak:long_description>

First florence hide. 
Slow down after mile marker 1, pull over on the right side at V243 (there is room for your vehicle there). AGAIN WATCH YOUR STEP REACHING FOR THIS SMALL CACHE.

Standing 107 feet tall this was dedicated in 1898. It is the tallest in WA. and the 3rd tallest on the West coast. The base sits on 12ft of sandstone. Walls at the base are 4 feet thick and are made of brick with a coating of cement on the outside. It takes 135 steps to bring you to the lantern room.
In 1898 this sat 400 feet from the high tide line. Now it is 3,000 feet. Just a little more local history. </groundspeak:long_description>

Looking for a nice view but when I got here all socked in, Was told it is a great view on a clear day. Someone please let me know. With the wet haze and fog maybe ny numbers are a little off but got the same readings twice so think I am real close. IT is a ammo can. Not a small film can. As I have been know to place.

If you only visit to the beach on a weekend, find this cache, and take a picture home. This would be a great screen saver to remind you what you miss during the week, And for those of us who live here, what we have in our back yard. A GREAT view.
Also for the older bunch, this is one for us as it was placed by one of the very older bunch. You are looking for key holder. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">My favourite caches are in the woods on trails that I would not normally drive. This trail I did drive, and it reminded me of Samuel Butler's book, hence I called it &quot;The Road to Erewhon&quot;.

The cache is a container, that can hold small trade items. I started it out with some tokens and coins which you can use &quot;nowhere&quot; around here. There are also a couple of pins in the container.

Cheers.
