            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;&quot;Lost&quot;&lt;/b&gt;, was a serial drama television
series that followed the lives of a group of plane crash survivors
on a mysterious tropical island, somewhere in the South Pacific.
The show was filmed primarily on location in Oahu, Hawaii. The
pilot episode was first broadcast on September 22, 2004. Since
then, six seasons have aired with the last episode airing on May
23, 2010. The show was produced by ABC Television Studio (formerly
Touchstone Television), Bad Robot Productions and Grass Skirt
Productions and aired on the ABC Network in the U.S. Because of its
large ensemble cast and the cost of filming in Hawaii, the series
was one of the most expensive on television. Because of its large

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cache info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This 5-bedroom, 6-bath mansion was featured in Season 3 of &quot;LOST&quot;
as Hugo &quot;Hurley&quot; Reyes' nouveau riche digs in the episode &quot;Tricia
Tanaka is Dead.&quot; Although it was set in Los Angeles, the actual
location of the home is in the Kahala neighborhood of Honolulu,
Hawai'i. So what's this place like? Dude. Hurley's new home was a
long way from Mr. Cluck's Chicken Shack, at almost 7500 square feet
with a gourmet kitchen, numerous balconies, a sound system, a pool,
a whirlpool, and a dolphin fountain. It sold in August for nearly
$400,000 less than the former asking price of 3.9 million. The
selling price worked out to about 3% of Hurley's $114 million
lottery winnings.&lt;br /&gt;
Due to the muggle &quot;rich&quot; area, I'm making it really easy  ---- &lt;u&gt;nano on the base of something

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;The Honolulu
Zoo&lt;/b&gt; is located between the slopes of Diamond Head
and Waikiki at the corner of Kapahulu Ave. and Kalakaua Blvd. The
Zoo is administered by the Honolulu Zoo Society, a non-profit
organization, and is maintained by a corps of volunteers. It is
owned by the City &amp; County of Honolulu through the Auditoriums
Department. The hours of operation are 9:00 am to 4:30 pm daily
(closed on Christmas Day). Admission is as follows (Local I.D.
required for kama'aina price):
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Admission (13 years and older) $12.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kama'aina (13 years and older with local I.D.) $6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children (4-12 years with adult 18 years and older) $3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children (3 years and under with adult) free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Family Pass starting at $45.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Zoo's history is a regal one. It is the only zoo in the United
States to be established by grants made by a sovereign monarch. In
1876, King Kalakaua made the lands near the slopes of Diamond Head
available for the establishment of a grand public park for the
people of his kingdom. The 300 acres (42 of which is the zoo) came
to be known as Queen Kapio'lani Park, named after his wife. Today
the zoo houses over 1,230 animals in specially designed habitats
and averages 750,000 visitors a year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parking is Metered
&amp; Stealth is Required&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Was with Homebru for a few caches today while the girls were off shopping. My GPS on this one had me going in all different direction.  Jumping around and was not much help at all.  So I sure was glad that Homebru was doing better and found it.  Not to bad on muggles as the zoo was closed and guess it was not late enough that the homeless had showed up yet.

As we approached GZ we saw a familiar face walking away.  It was marcos.bs [:D].  Together we waited out a muggle using the _____.  After he was done we used the &quot;come let's take a picture&quot; technique to retrieve and replace the cache.  With the little germs this never fails to fool the muggles [;)].  TNLN, TFTC!

Mo'o. Did some online research and found this -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Geckos in
Paradise is a volunteer based effort intended to increase the
awareness of women's health issues, with a special focus on breast
cancer. The goal of this exciting event is to raise $250,000, of
which all the proceeds will benefit the Breast Center at the
Kapi`olani Women's Center.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are apparently 50 Mo'o placed throughout Waikiki and
Honolulu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular Gecko was made by the Veteran Improvement
Program and looked a little different when first placed back in
2004.&lt;/p&gt;

Find this cache and see if it helps… at least for a little while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High up in the Ko'olau along the Kalawahine Trail (Na Ala Hele Trail &amp; Access System)…&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://hawaiitrails.ehawaii.gov/trail.php?TrailID=OA+19+003&amp;island=Oahu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;… lies a cache of extraordinary beauty filled with treasure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the Kalawahine trail head on Tantalus Drive, there are a few parking spaces across the road, makai side. N 21° 19.834, W 157° 49.281 Please be careful crossing the road; it's a blind curve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's a bench along the way for you to rest a spell and contemplate the view at N 21° 20.001, W 157° 49.172&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It can be wet and the trail muddy with the frequent mauka showers that sweep through at this altitude. Bring a way to protect your electronics: GPSr, cell phones, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you head mauka on the Kalawahine Trail, once you get to the way-point, there's a small path on the left. Follow it left and down into the trees. About 20 paces off the main trail, start looking for the cache. It's very near this secondary trail. No bushwhacking required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are numerous trinkets &amp; treasures in the geocache. Take one, leave one. There are some $100 bills drawn on the Bank of Hell in there. I got them in Hong Kong. Take a C-Note home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy! It's a beautiful walk along the ridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When replacing the cache, please put it back with the lid on top. It's awfully wet up there. </groundspeak:long_description>

Later, at the Petri Dish...
Was surprised to find an empty log on this one.  Got the brrrring for this one while on the way to pick up 808ladybug from the airport.  Went home so she could freshen up after her 12+ hours of travel and then headed out.  Made our way over to GZ and after a false start down the wrong side trail (there are 3 here now, only remember one before LOL) we had the cache in hand [:)].  Coords were spot on, for us anyway [^].  Swapped out TBs, TFTC! [:D]

over 3100 feet they are the highest peaks of the Ko'olaus. OK here
it is, which peak is K1 and K2 LOL. I get different answers from
different sources. So in your log write which one you think it is
and eventually I’ll change the name to the right peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the cache. It is a camo'd taped 500ml bottle tied to a
lapalapa tree on the left side of the &quot;lookout&quot;. Take a look at the
pictures before heading out, don't want any DNFs. Hike safe and
enjoy!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/u&gt; You are under no
obligation to hunt my cache. You do so at your own risk. Like any
outdoor sport, it carries the risk of unforeseen hazards. Use your
best judgment with the environment and conditions. As conditions
and cache locations may vary, it is the responsibility of the
searcher to be familiar with the conditions in the area to be
searched, to adequately prepare for those conditions, and to
conduct oneself safely and responsibly and remain within his or her
personal abilities and limitations. Children should be well
supervised. When and if you find a cache, you are under no
obligation to touch it, reach it, climb to it, dig for it, pick it
up, or even open it. Open it at your own risk. If food or drink is
present, do not consume it, throw it out. Individual Geostash and
GPS cache sponsors assume no liability for events, which may occur,
related directly or indirectly to your searching for a
stash.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Ala Hele website:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maunawili Falls Trail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Trail Length:&lt;/b&gt; 1.25 mi.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Terrain:&lt;/b&gt; Varied. Wet gulches to open forest canopy&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Activity:&lt;/b&gt; Pedestrian&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Elevation:&lt;/b&gt; 300 ft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Maunawili Falls Trail begins in mostly coffee and mountain
apple trees. It crosses the stream in several places, winding
through ginger, climbing gently. It begins to descend down a long
flight of steps to the final stream crossing and the waterfall and
pool. The trail offers views of the Ko`olaupoko watershed and views
down into some lush gulches. Please kokua and do not climb above
the waterfall - it is restricted watershed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Directions: Drive along the Pali Highway towards Kailua,
through the tunnels and past Kamehameha Highway. Pass Auloa Road
(on the right) for the first time, then take the second turn onto
Auloa Road (it is a horseshoe shaped road). The road splits very
soon after the turn off the Pali - take the left fork which is
Maunawili Road. Follow Maunawili Road until it ends in a
residential neighborhood. Notice the trail access road to your left
(look for trail signs). DO NOT DRIVE OR PARK ON THIS PRIVATE ROAD!
Instead, legally park on the right in the neighborhood. Please
respect the residents by not loitering or making a lot of noise and
obeying parking laws. Walk along the access road until you reach
the trailhead on your right..&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even though the cache is close to the beginning of the trail, the
trail has hours. The trail is open from &lt;b&gt;6 AM - 6 PM&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;The 2.5 difficulty is largely due to the stealth required since
this is a very popular trail. Please rehide it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You &lt;b&gt;DO NOT&lt;/b&gt; need to hike the Maunawili Falls Trail to find
this cache, but if you choose to you will find a quaint waterfall
and a refreshing pool to swim in at the end (not to mention a
couple caches along the way )&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here's the caches going in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC12RH9 - Josefa Moe &quot;What a life&quot; cache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC1ZQWG - The Gallows Tree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here's a couple you might wanna check out before going in:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCT0V0 - Look at me, I'm in a tree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GC1FRYW - A Nano in the Woods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;FTF Prize&lt;/u&gt;: FTF Craze Comic #1 Geocoin ----&amp;gt;

High stealth required, muggles everywhere! There is no need to search through any &quot;trash&quot; areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 30 Nov 2010...a Christmas Tree lot has appeared around this cache, so extra stealth will be required if they are up and running selling Christmas Cheer.</groundspeak:long_description>

Arrived at GZ and had an embarrassing DOH moment LOL.  After a short search I was like, there's no shave ice place here.  Reread the cache page and DOH, found the cache LOL.  Thanx for the late night cache run! [:D]

&lt;u&gt;Some facts about Aloha Stadium:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Officially opened on September 12, 1975&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First football game played between University of Hawaii and
Texas A &amp; I on September 13, 1975. Attendance: 32,247&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ownership: State of Hawaii&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management: Stadium Authority, State of Hawaii&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capacity: 50,000 (424-wheelchair seats on the lower concourse
level)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size: 104 acres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location: 12 miles (20 minutes) from Waikiki, 2 miles from the
Honolulu International Airport&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parking: 8,000 cars, 150 buses, 109 disabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main playing surface: FieldTurf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stands are movable, first of its kind in the USA. The
stands are moved by air cushions into different configurations
(football, baseball and concert configurations). However, at the
beginning of 2007 the stadium will be locked in the football
configuration permanently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Events at Aloha Stadium include football, baseball, soccer,
boxing, religious and music festivals; swap meets; auto shows;
motorcrossess; mud races; tractor pulls; concerts; carnivals,
etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The scoreboard is 154 feet long. The JumboTron is 19' x
26'.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sitting in the highest seat in the stadium is as high as a
ten-story building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swap meet open wednesday, saturday, and sunday 6am - 3pm
(admission: $1, 12 years and under free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Past and Present Tenants:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hawaii Warriors (NCAA) - 1975 to Present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hawaii Islanders (PCL) - 1975 to 1987&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team Hawaii (NASL) - 1977&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro Bowl (NFL) - 1980 to 2009&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hula Bowl (NCAA) - 1975 to 1997, 2006&lt;/li&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow, what an adventure.

When I started looking at caches in Hawaii, this one jumped out at me.  We decided we would rent a car to get around to various places, and this cache was definitely on my must do list.

We drove up and ended up on the wrong road.  After consulting a map and putting the top down on our car because it looked like rain, we went back and started to climb to the cache.  Then the fun began - it downpoured.  It was raining harder than I have ever seen, and the water was flowing down the road in torrents.  Very slowly I approached the parking lot, and waited.  Once it started to let up, I found some of the easier to grab caches near parking.

Finally it stopped raining.  We went off to find the cache from the lower trailhead.  I looked at where we were going and read some logs, and mistakingly decided we were on the wrong part of the trail, so we turned back and went to the upper trailhead.

We hiked a mile and a half into the upper trail before I realized there was no way that we could be on the right trail - we were still on the wrong side of the ravine and we were walking on mud and a slippery mess on the side of some very shear cliffs.  Additionally the GPS was dying, so I decided we should turn back.  We managed to get the Cache Across America cache before returning.

Once we got back to the car, I was defeated.  I didn't originally think I would be able to get it.  I drove back to the other lot, and we decided to go for it.  This side of the trail is a MUCH easier walk, and we got down pretty easy.  The creek crossing was almost bad, and I managed to get my foot pretty wet - it was flowing pretty good after the rain.  Walked up the other side and followed the advice.  I had turned the GPS back on right when we were near it (300 foot away but still needed to round the bend).  I figured I could always use the geocaching app on my phone to find it if I needed to.

Once getting around the bend, I booked it to the cache so I could use the GPS.  It died 40 feet from the cache, but I quickly found it anyways.  I signed the log and we took some pictures and we headed back out.  The trip back was good as the sun finally came out.

I took quite a few pictures, and I will upload some of them to the log when I get home.

Thanks for maintaining this cache for so long - it was a pleasure to find, and something I won't soon forget.

You are wrong about the cache not being uphill, the trail is uphill all the way there. I found the cache after a short search, but even though I kept an eye out for it I never did see the loopy tree. Had a great walk. Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

Well the trail was pretty muddy, so that was part of it. Plus we weren't expecting any hills. For future cachers... just because it says NOT UPHILL many times in the description, that only applies to when you're within about 50 ft of the cache :D Ah well, I wasn't about the leave the island without finding the oldest one in the state.

He had a great time running back and forth on a deserted trail that we had to ourselves during our 3 hours back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We noticed that the caches on a different caching website along this route haven't been visited since March 2010, so what better way to encourage some traffic than by throwing in a new cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be reached on the trail past the Punanani &quot;Good News&quot; cache and Halapepe Ammo Box. If you continue down the trail to the next summit you will find &quot;Porter.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an additional challenge, you can back track a bit and take a separate trail down to Halapepenui Geocache. The trail head for that cache is: N21 25.279 W157 54.427.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parking recommend at the end of Kaahumanu Street at N21 25.845 W157 56.056, trail head is the service road. There is a guard shack that may or may not be occupied when you head up the street. It may be necessary to park before the guard shack and walk up to the trail head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GZ is at the summit, no need to go over the edge.

Been on the trail before so we knew what to expect, Wet &amp; Slippery.  We were lucky that it only rained on us once, just long enough to unpack the ponchos.  At the fork we found that it doesn't really matter if you take the low or high road.  I preferred the low road in and the high road out [:)].  Found the coords a bit off for us, about 90ft, undoubtedly due to the tree cover.  Here's the reading I took at GZ:

&lt;p&gt;I'm close to one of the sets of three tiki a hop, skip and a
jump from the nearest Mickey D. Hey, you can actually park within
mere feet of me. There is no need to hurt anything that grows in
dirt. I'm out in the open under something that was once molten.
Please don't attract the muggles behind your back. Cause I want to
stay and put smiles on all the faces that come my way. Thanx and
have a nice day! &lt;/p&gt;
