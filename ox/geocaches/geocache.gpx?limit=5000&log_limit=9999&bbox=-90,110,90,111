It is very popular with joggers and strollers in the evenings - there are usually quite a number of people there when the weather is good. It used to be the fresh water reservoir for Kuching town and the park was developed around it. The Japanese Bridge crossing the main lake is one of the truly iconic structures in Kuching. This park definitely holds a sentimental value for many people as it used to be the main dating ground in Kuching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being right in the city centre, it is quite surprising to find a place with so many tall and mature trees. The trees here could be some of the oldest in Kuching, as they seem to have been there forever. The are some 2nd World War Bomb Shelter at a corner of the park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a great place for exercise as the trees provide plenty of shade and the tracks give you a choice of either an easy run around the lakes, or a more strenously trek on the hilly slopes . There is also a nice playground for the kids.</groundspeak:long_description>
