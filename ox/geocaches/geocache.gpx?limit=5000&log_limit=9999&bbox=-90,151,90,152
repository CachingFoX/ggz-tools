            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Tenterfield is 715 km north-east of Sydney and 275 km south of Brisbane. It is situated in a shallow valley 882 metres above sea-level at the northern end of the New England Tablelands in an area of rugged mountains and rural vistas. It proclaims itself 'The Birthplace of the Nation' as Henry Parkes chose this spot to deliver his crucial Federation speech of 1889, which led to the establishment of Australia as a unified nation in 1901.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mount Mackenzie provides magnificent views over the township from an altitude of 1298m. The reserve is approximately 5km south-west of Tenterfield, on the Mount Mackenzie Road. Once at the top, there are picnic tables, toilets and a gas barbeque.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a camo eclipse container and shouldn't be very difficult to find. There is no need to leave the viewing platform.&lt;br/&gt;Be aware that snow does fall at this location, and while the road to the top is in good condition, care and warm clothing would be advisable in the winter months. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

for the Quorrobolong area or the Great North Walk map set.&lt;/p&gt;

the Great North Walk track starting at Congewai Ave, Congewai. The
Barraba Trig Rest Area, where you can camp at, is on the top of
Barraba which is 520m above mean sea level (amsl).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trig location is actually approximately 600m north of the
the Barraba Trig Rest Area. There is a gravel road that runs close
to the trig but you will need to do a small bit of bush bashing
along the ridge to Barraba Spur (450m amsl).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The views at the trig are obscured by trees but this is a nice
little detour for anyone staying at Barraba Trig Rest Area over
night.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Toronto...
&lt;p&gt;Toronto is a town within the city of Lake Macquarie in New South
Wales, Australia, approximately 28 kilometres (17 mi) from
Newcastle's central business district and is a commercial hub for
the sprawling suburbs on the western shore of the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History:&lt;br /&gt;
Toronto was named after Toronto, Ontario, Canada in honour of
Edward Hanlan, a world-champion sculler who visited Australia in
1884. The area's subdividers, the Excelsior Company, named the land
in honour of Hanlan's visit, which coincided with the opening of
the subdivision. The name was not publicly used until 1887. The
Canadian city's name comes from the Mohawk language tkaronto,
meaning where there are trees standing in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toronto was originally the site of an Aboriginal mission called
Ebenezer, established in 1829 by Reverend Threlkeld. Threlkeld is
reported to have begun construction of his chimney with a local
black stone which he later realised was coal. Coal Point is named
after this discovery. The development of several coal mines in the
region, proximity to the nearby city of Newcastle, and its position
by the lake led to gradual development and population
increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the closure of the Ebenezer Aboriginal Mission in
1890, the population of the Toronto area remained mostly
Aboriginal. As the coal companies moved into the area, the
aboriginal population were helped financially and the community was
sustained mainly by the coal industry. However, it was not long
before a mixture of land disputes and poor treatment of the local
Aboriginals led to a major rally by the locals. This rally, which
began as vandalism of mining company property, soon escalated into
heavy violence and led to the Toronto massacre of 1896. Five
Aboriginals were killed and many people on both sides were brutally
beaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population:&lt;br /&gt;
Toronto and its surrounding suburbs had a total population of just
over 5,000 people at the turn of the century. Toronto's population
was 5161 in the 2006 census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transport:&lt;br /&gt;
Toronto is considered to be the hub for public transport on the
western side of Lake Macquarie. The area is served by a privately
operated bus service; 'Toronto Bus Service', which services the
areas to the west, south and north of the town.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Toronto was served by train services until March 1990, when the NSW
Government closed the line because of low passenger levels. The
train service was replaced by a bus service which connects Toronto
with Fassifern railway station.Train services operating from
Fassifern include services to Sydney and Newcastle as well as the
XPT service to Brisbane. Toronto is well served by road links to
Newcastle and Sydney and is approximately 8 minutes from the
Sydney-Newcastle Freeway (F3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toronto centre serves the local communities of Kilaben Bay,
Coal Point, Carey Bay, Rathmines and Wangi Wangi to the south and
Teralba, Booragul, Woodrising, Fennell Bay, Bolton Point, Fassifern
and Blackalls Park to the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sports:&lt;br /&gt;
Toronto is represented by three sports teams in Newcastle
competitions. The Toronto Awaba Stags FC in the Northern NSW
Football competition; the Macquarie Scorpions in the Newcastle
Rugby League and also the Toronto Workers Kookaburras in the
Newcastle cricket competition. Nathan Green, winner of the 2009 RBC
Canadian Open, was born in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;

Starting life as the Berowra-Calga Tollway, the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway has been gradually extended and improved until the Palmdale / Ourimbah gap and Lengahans Drive bypass were completed in the late 90's. The route replaced several sections of very windy road between Berowra and the southern reaches of Newcastle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The freeway starts with the junction of the Pacific Highway and Pennant Hills Road at Pearce's Corner, Wahroonga in Sydney's north. From here it goes north, skirting the western edge of the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park before meeting the Hawkesbury River at Brooklyn. After crossing the Hawkesbury the motorway passes through the Brisbane Water National Park, crossing Mooney Mooney Creek with an impressive 480m long and 75m high bridge before reaching the first main interchange on the Central Coast at Kariong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After reaching Kariong, the motorway continues through rural and semi-rural areas of the Central Coast with interchanges provided at Ourimbah, Tuggerah, Warnervale and also Kiar, near Doyalson. From the Doyalson interchange the freeway continues to the west of Lake Macquarie with interchanges near Morisset, Cessnock, Toronto and Cardiff. The Doyalson interchange is with what is known as &quot;Motorway Link&quot; a connection feeder to the Pacific Highway (now SR111), when the freeway ended at this interchange in the mid 1980s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the Cardiff interchange a link road takes  traffic into Newcastle via Wallsend while the motorway continues north to reach its finish with a roundabout at the junction of Weakleys Drive (Weakley's Drive photos can be seen here) and John Renshaw Drive, Beresfield. From here the National Highway route continues to Brisbane via the New England Highway (accessed via Weakleys Drive), with traffic on NH1/NH15 taking John Renshaw Drive and the New England Highway eastbound to meet the Pacific Highway at Hexham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sydney-Newcastle Freeway, is part of the Auslink National Network, and is the major road linking Sydney, the Central Coast and Newcastle. It also links with the New England and Pacific Highways, for travel to northern New South Wales and Queensland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sydney-Newcastle Freeway is a vital link for around 75 000 motorists that use the freeway daily, the majority of whom travel between the Central Coast and Hunter regions and Sydney. During weekends and school holidays, the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway is heavily used by motorists travelling to and returning from northern New South Wales and Queensland holiday destinations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This section of the F3 was opened to traffic:&lt;br/&gt;Morisset to Freemans Drive - March 1988&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History:&lt;br/&gt;The Sydney-Newcastle Freeway replaced the old Pacific Highway which was built in the 1920s along a route that had existed since 1840s, when settler George Peat cut a track to his property on the banks of the Hawkesbury River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planning began for the freeway in the 1950s, with the aim of providing a high-speed replacement to a section of the Pacific Highway which was built in the 1920s and was struggling to cope with the increased traffic volume. Furthermore it was planned that the freeway would connect to freeway systems being proposed for both Sydney and Newcastle, providing a city-to-city freeway link.&lt;br/&gt;However, due to several reasons the goal and route of the freeway changed significantly so that today it serves to bypass Newcastle rather than go into it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freemans Drive:&lt;br/&gt;General information:&lt;br/&gt;Freemans Drive runs from the Morisset round-a-bout to the Freemans Waterhole round-a-bout. It is 19.1km's in length and takes approximately 17 minutes to drive it full length.&lt;br/&gt;Freemans Drive cross the path of the F3 Freeway three times - one under and twice over.&lt;br/&gt;Freemans Drive passes through the town of Cooranbong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freemans Drive is a sealed road in New South Wales. It goes from Morisset to near Ryhope.&lt;br/&gt;Freemans Drive's highest elevation along its length is 61.3m and the lowest point is at 4.85m.&lt;br/&gt;For cyclists and those towing caravans, boats or heavy loads Freemans Drive is undulating along its 15.6 km length, with about 510 m that is steeper in incline/grade than 5%. The total ascent / descent along the length of Freemans Drive is 117 m / 154 m. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was previously published on www.geocaching.com on 27 Jun 2011, so has been found before under that listing.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located near the Martinsville Cricket Oval, tennis courts and the Martinsville Rural/Bush Fire Brigade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Martinsville, NSW&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Name Origin:&lt;br/&gt;William and Sarah Martin were the earliest known settlers in the area and in the early 1890's a meeting of local citizens adopted the name in their honour. By the I January 1894 the local post office had also adopted the name. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early Land Grants:&lt;br/&gt;Portion 37, Parish of Coorumbung, Thomas Moore, granted 60 acres, on 8/4/1834. Moore's grant was near the junction of Dora and Deep Creeks. Portion 10, Owen Beardmore, granted 100 acres in May 1854. This portion adjoined that of Thomas Moore. The Martin family purchased a large tract of timbered country from the Crown between 1865 and 1875. In 1877 Sydney Dodds purchased the 60 acres that had originally been a grant to Thomas Moore. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early Settlers:&lt;br/&gt;William Martin a timber getter and his wife Sarah with their children were the first settlers. They originally came from Ireland, and settled in the area sometime between 1861 and 1866. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other settlers followed the Martins but no real community emerged until after 1875. About then Sydney Dodds settled and took up farming. Others to settle at the same time were George Hadlow, James Maher and John Edgtton, the latter two being sawyers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early Industries:&lt;br/&gt;Martinsville was founded on the timber industry. During the 1880's many men were employed in the industry with bullock teams carrying logs to the large saw mills at Cooranbong. Only small saw mills existed at Martinsville. Bamiers' Mill was at the top of Mount Falk, Mullards' at the foot of the Wattagan Road and Espleys' near the crossing of Blarney Grove Creek. Later fanning became predominant including dairying and citrus growing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First Post Office:&lt;br/&gt;Opened I November 1889, with the name of 'Dora Creek'. This office was renamed 'Brush' on 15 December 1892 and 'Martinsville' on I January 1894. It closed on 30 January 1965. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First School:&lt;br/&gt;Opened in December 1878 as Deep Creek Provisional School by Sydney Dodds on part of his land. His position as a teacher was confirmed in December 1878 by the Department of Public Instruction. In May 1881 Dodds transferred to a school in Newcastle and Miss Gleeson replaced him, remaining in the position for 8 years. It became a public school in October 1879. The school closed about 1974 due to insufficient numbers of pupils. The school was called 'Deep Creek' until 1883, and 'Dora Creek' until February 1894. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Town:&lt;br/&gt;First Church: The original &quot;Union Church&quot; was erected about the same time as the post office was established. It was a meeting place for many denominations until it was pulled down in 1924. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was previously published on www.geocaching.com on 22 Nov 2010, so has been found before under that listing.

Early spellings include 'Kuringbong'(1834),'Coorumbung'(1841), 'Corumbong' (1879). The name was officially adopted with the opening of' Cooranbong' post office in 1866. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Police Station and lock up was built by Henry Worley in 1835. Moses Carroll was the Superintendant. The township came into existence around the time of the 1861 land sales. It was announced in 1866 that a bridge was to be erected over Dora Creek. The first Catholic church was erected by November 1861. Thomas Russell opened the first hotel. By 1875 a racecourse was operating. The Seventh-day Adventists established a college at Cooranbong in 1896. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1865 it was estimated that the town had 150 residents, who were chiefly timber workers. In 1884 the population was about 700 but the census of 1891 showed only 206 people, possibly due to the depression of the 1890's affecting the timber trade. The population has grown to around 4500. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was previously published on www.geocaching.com on 2 Jul 2011, so has been found before under that listing.

The aim of the cache is to lead you to one of the best spots for

700 m North West of the cache, the Pines is one of the best places
in the Watagans for a family picnic or BBQ. There are however many
more great picnic areas and lookouts around so it is well worth a
look around. Below is a description from one of the official
websites. &quot;The Pines Forest Park - The most popular site in
the Watagans and is located in a remnant slash pine plantation
planted in the 1920s and 1930s. There are picnic tables and
barbecues scattered throughout this area, while a covered shelter
is also available and can be hired for exclusive use by family or
school groups. The picnic area is also the start of three walking
trails, The Wildflower Trail, The Pines Trail and Abbotts Falls
Trail. The Pines Trail leads to a small swimming hole, which is a
popular venue in the summer.&quot; You can easily spend the day in
this area so give it a go.</groundspeak:long_description>

BYO writing device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‘Cooranbong’ is from an Aboriginal word meaning rocky bottom creek or water over rocks. The name was officially adopted with the opening of the Cooranbong Post&lt;br/&gt;office in 1866.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cooranbong was an important river port with up to ten ships trading here regularly for timber and agricultural produce. The town had a courthouse, shops, hotels and a ship yard. When the northern railway was coming, it was expected to pass through Cooranbong with a branch line to Newcastle and the main line to pass under the Gap as it went further north. The town’s people saw the town as the administration centre of the south. But the line was eventually built through Morisset and over Dora Creek. This prevented the sailing ships from coming up the river and Cooranbong rapidly went into decline dropping the population from 700 to less than 200 in five years. About that time the Adventists arrived and moved the town a mile to the east where the town center is today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Demolition was due to commence within days to make room for a new concrete structure. Guessing that these particular bats were large-footed bats (Myotis adversus), a threatened species, I quickly alerted environmental staff at the local city council in Lake Macquarie. &lt;br/&gt;Sure enough, an initial inspection revealed that this represented the first known roost of large-footed bats in the Lake Macquarie area. From my point of view, the discovery was very exciting, but for the city council and their bridge construction company, it presented unforeseen obstacles. I developed a plan allowing the bridge to be replaced with minimal disturbance to the bat colony, and it was approved by both the city council and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. My subsequent role was to ensure the bats were safely excluded from the bridge and to attempt to re-establish their roosts within the new structure. &lt;br/&gt;As demolition began, we progressively excluded the entire colony of bats from the cracks in the timbers where they roosted. Plastic flaps were placed over roost entrances so that the bats exiting at dusk were unable to re-enter after feeding. Using scaffolding beneath the bridge, I crawled around on the narrow timber planks, precariously suspended over a murky creek, placing traps at the roost entrances. The bats I caught were banded, and some individuals were fitted with radio transmitters. By tracking the transmitter signals, we discovered an alternative roosting site among the concrete beams of a canal supplying water to a power station about 2 1/2 miles (4 km) away. &lt;br/&gt;When the new bridge was partially completed, the construction crew moved roost timbers from the old wooden bridge into equivalent positions in the new concrete one. This method of incorporating pieces of the original roost into a new structure may actually be the first of its kind attempted. &lt;br/&gt;We had determined that, prior to the bridge replacement, a population of at least 170 large-footed bats had roosted there. Also, the presence of many juveniles and the discovery that females outnumbered males approximately four to one suggested the bridge had been a maternity roost. Following completion of the new bridge, the Lake Macquarie City Council funded a monitoring program, and we have verified that large-footed bats have re-established roosts within the old timbers and are breeding successfully. Apparently the bats recognized their home! &lt;br/&gt;Glenn and Margaret Hoye have researched bats throughout Australia for the past 20 years. They survey, research, and advise on bat-related issues through their company, Fly By Night Bat Surveys. &lt;br/&gt;The success of this project suggests that the strategy of fitting old roost elements into new structures could be applied in many similar situations. Anyone attempting this, however, should be aware of climatic differences and other changes that could make the habitat unacceptable to the bats. Prior to removal, one should note the position, aspect, height, temperature, and sun exposure of roost elements then take care to re-install them into equivalent positions and conditions in the replacement structure. &lt;br/&gt;________________________________________&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to bridges, the large-footed bat’s most common roosts include caves, mines, tunnels, tree hollows, buildings, and dense foliage in rain forest areas. This species is seldom found far from bodies of water, over which it hunts for insects and small fish. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Piers for the new bridge were installed while the original timber bridge was systematically removed. Scaffolding used to reach the bat roosts is visible under the bridge. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Timbers from the old bridge were carefully placed in equivalent positions in the new structure, and the city council marked the significance of the roost with a plaque. (“Fishing bat” is a common local name for the species.) </groundspeak:long_description>

Please be carefull finding this cache! HIGH MUGGLE ACTIVITY! Suggest not to find during business hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opened on 16th June 1888 as a receiving post office only, in charge of Henry Eckford, who was also the station master. He was followed in 1889 by G.H. Manson. On 16 November 1898 its status was raised to that of an official Post office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Lieut-colonel James Thomas Morisset who was Commandant of Newcastle from 1818-1823. In April 1823 he made the first overland journey from Newcastle to Sydney and camped overnight under a tree on the western side of Lake Macquarie; the tree was situated just east of the present Morisset railway station, and is marked as a historic tree. However, there is also a possibility that it was named after his son E.N.V. Morisset who was superintendent of police at Bathurst, Maitland and Goulburn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first two industries established were sawmilling, and the building and functioning of the railway. The sawmills were situated near the railway to make transport easier. Logs were brought by bullock dray from a wide area, many from the Wattagan mountains. In 1909 the weekly output of one mill included:2000 tool handles, 8000 spokes, 100 pairs of rims, 200 pairs of shafts and 200 pairs of naves for wheels. Many of these were exported to New Zealand</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;The posted co-ordinates are fake. There is absolutely no need to
go there; also it would be extremely dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache has a small pencil in it, with the log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead the cache can be found at the following
co-ordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First to Find (FTF) honour go to Marcus Vitruvius!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E 227º 035.&quot;0&quot;362/026+064&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NB. You need to do the decoding before you do the math. The &quot;0&quot;
means you need a leading zero in this position of the decoded
numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to determine the code to convert the above to the
actual, real, co-ordinates of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real co-ordinates are with 250 meters of the posted
coordinates.Thanks to Dazndky for checking the calculations

The site is &quot;NOT KID&quot; friendly, Please exercise caution when crossing any road.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just something different to break up the trip, shouldn't take long and you&lt;br /&gt;
can exit and enter the freeway in any direction.&lt;br /&gt;
Log only, BYO pen.&lt;br /&gt;

As you can see from the picture we have installed a beacon at the F3 Morisset Interchange.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Through our advanced technology we have managed to cloak it so it wont be&lt;br /&gt;
visible to the naked eye, it was only visible for a brief moment during construction&lt;br /&gt;
when we managed to snap the picture. You can however still pick up the signal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache will take you from the &quot;Stone Age&quot; to the &quot;Space Age&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
At the start coords you will find something from the stone age to lead you to WP2.&lt;br /&gt;
At WP2 you will need to intercept the signal from the space age for the next clue to be chirped to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

the physical cache container is, but may be of interest, based on
the clues below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache container looks somewhat like a VERY LARGE battery and
is large enough to hold quite a few Travel Bugs, Geocoins and
swaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First to Find honours go to Mr&amp;MrsFish. Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;What cereal can give you ample energy to get up and go, so that
you can vault through your day? A liquid breakfast? If breakfast
and cereals is not your thing, maybe you need a different
energizer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now for the puzzle...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final coordinates are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S SV° SA.(SW)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E EV° EA.(EW-1)&lt;/p&gt;
Where:
&lt;p&gt;SV=?, A=3, W=99&lt;br /&gt;
SA=?, V=9, W=171&lt;br /&gt;
SW=?, V=40, A=19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EV=?, A=5, W=755&lt;br /&gt;
EA=?, V=13, W=325&lt;br /&gt;
EW=?, V=16, A=14,&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Bar Island is where History meets Nature and Adventure. This cache is by boat only and the ultimate approach is by the southern-most tip. Just a few meters up the shore line in magnificent rock. South shore is bare rock and free of environmentally fragile mangroves or salt marsh – no needs to enter those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be careful:&lt;/b&gt; Needs hands on the rocks to get up there.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After having found the cache, it's worth to drive to the jetty and visit Bar Island on a self-guided tour. There is a modern jetty superimposed to the historic one at the northern end, allowing landing even to one larger boat. The track leads up the hill, though the ruins of the church with a remaining chimney, the cemetery to the memorial at the summit.&lt;p&gt;Bar Island reveals both Aboriginal and modern history. The traditional lands of the Guringai and Darug groups meet at Bar Island. At its northern end, the island's foreshore has a midden which contains debris such as shells deposited by Aboriginals who ate shellfish and other foods on the site over many years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The island was occupied in the beginning of the 1870s by the new Australians. St. John's Anglican Church was built on Bar Island in 1876 to serve the spiritual needs of the local community on the Lower Hawkesbury River. A part time school was transferred to the premises in 1877, became full time in 1884, but closed in April 1892, reopening for a short period in January 1901 to July 1903. The first burial in the Cemetery took place on 23 August 1879, with the majority of burials taking place before 1906, by which time the church was a ruin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We made our way in a duck, such as the surf rescue inflatable boats and watered in Apple Tree Bay of the Kuringai National Park. That was a 72 km round trip with Bar Island being the furthest point. A gorgeous day out! Of course, there are closer boat ramps and access points all over the river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Wanting to increase my averages I decided to get a couple of Arkaroos other caches while I had chance to borrow a boat. Today was a trial run, making sure I knew where the shallows and channels are.
Not too difficult to land the dinghy on the southern end of Bar Island. And just a short climb up to the cache.
Found the GC/OC cache fairly easily. Wrote in the logbook that I was also logging this for Opencaching.
Left: Mini Karabiner, Mini Pencil, and a Correct Site Marker - surgical skin pen, that we get from work.
Thanks again for the cache Arkaroo.
PS A one litre sistema as a small, sweet! A bit more room for swaps.</groundspeak:text>

Good for kids.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;1L Sistema box- yeah they should sponsor geocaching.com! 2
Trackables, a logbook and a magnetic shark. Please put cache back
and do CITO. Read hint below for hints :). Hassell Park is the HQ
of St Ives Cricket Club so watch out for muggles. This is my first
cache so I will be willing to help out. FTF prize is a new
akkatracker certificate (Extremely rare) and a chance at $20,000 :)
Eagleye8 and I will maintain it regularly as I live in the area.
Although I had strong signal coverage at the time feel free to
update coordinates as I used a geomate jr. (all you garmin
users)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*EDIT*&lt;br /&gt;
This cache was muggled in August 2011. The container is now a
&quot;small&quot; type container which is related to sport. Please Replace
Cache as it was found as this was how it got muggled.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Lake Parramatta was formed after the daming of Hunt's Creek in 1856. The surface area of the lake is 10km2 with a current storage of 450ML.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lake has been a relaxation area for many decades - being a popular swimming spot in the 1920s and 30s. Pollution from urban runoff meant the lake was no longer safe to swim in. However, recent tests have now cleared it for public use again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This geocache is located close to the shore of the lake, opposite another one of my geocaches - Lilypad lookout (GC2K2RM). You'll also be rewarded with a Munzee that is hidden in the container.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: The park is only open from 6:30 am until 5:30 pm (7:30 pm during Daylight Saving). Please don't attempt the cache outside of these hours.</groundspeak:long_description>

In 1791, Schaeffer was granted 140 acres of land in this area. Along with four convicts, he cleared the land of trees and rocks and planted grape vines, producing 'ninety gallons of wine in about two years'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today the creek is filled with weeds such as lantana and nasturtiums, but local groups and Parramatta council are slowly winning the war, replacing the area with native plants. You can see some of the rehabilitated sections further up (east) the creek, which include  Sydney Blue gums.</groundspeak:long_description>

I attempted to approach from the closest road access once before to be stopped by the creek, so this time I approached from the western end. A short walk and the cache was quickly in hand. Lots more rubbish down this section of the creek than in the bit behind my place, perhaps due to some of the recent rain. Thanks spindoctors.</groundspeak:text>

I then found park and a path that looked like it would take me in from Crowgey St. This path was full of lizards and windy all the way in with a creek crossing as well. GZ came up at a brief 7 min. run /walk in. Found the likely spot and found that I was FTF. SL and took coins. Left TB. however my Munzee app was not working and would not let me sign in so I took a pic of it and will try later.Thanks for a great cache hide and walk. Never been here so I enjoyed the history.Rntd safe.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is an excuse by La Perouse (who was once a pilot) to write
about his favourite aviation era. You don’t have to read the
essay below on “Chilla”, although there are clues to
the cache in the images attached. The container is a 250ml systema
with room only for small TBs - not swaps. BYO pen. The place is
easy to access by 263 bus, or the ferry to Neutral Bay wharf. Sats
were not brilliant - only 4. It is not necessary to trespass on the
Sydney Water Board property.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The late 1920s and early 1930s was an era when aviation suddenly
shrunk the World. It could be compared to the way computers changed
our lives from the 1960s onwards, or to the spin offs from the NASA
space, shuttle, and satellite programs - from which we geocachers
benefit so much to-day. Aircraft technology moved very rapidly from
high drag canvas &amp; wood biplanes to streamlined monoplanes,
designed by clever young men who strove to make each creation go
ever faster and farther. It was all very experimental, the era of
the air race, the long distance flight, and intrepid pilots risking
their lives to be first for fame and fortune. By 1934, honorary
RAAF Air Commodore Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, Kt, M.C., A.F.C.
(known to the public as “Smithy” but always to his
close friends and family as “Chilla”) was a national
hero – an aerial Don Bradman. A small pugnacious 37 year old
with ever ready repartee, a beer &amp; a cigarette in his hand, a
prankster always with a pretty woman at his side, Smithy was said
to offer his female groupies “a ride for a ride”. A
proper larrikin, he lived life hard, fast and dangerously. In WW1
he survived Gallipoli as a signals dispatch rider, and then became
an Royal Flying Corps fighter pilot and was wounded and shot down
by Von Richthofen. After the War he was a Hollywood stunt pilot, a
bush pilot, a performer in an aerial circus and founder of Western
Australian Airways. Smithy was the first to cross the Pacific from
America to Australia, the first around the world, the first across
the Tasman, the fastest solo flight from England to Australia etc.
Smithy held more long distance flying and speed records than anyone
else on earth. Nancy Bird Walton, that national treasure of
Australian aviation and founder of the Australian Women Pilots'
Association, still lives in a house that overlooks the site of this
cache. In 1933, at the age of 17, she was the youngest Australian
woman to gain a pilot's licence, and one of the first pupils of the
Kingsford Smith Flying School at Mascot. She has described
Smithy’s flying technique as &quot;one of beauty and precision,
exactly timed, judged and balanced.&quot; In fact his exceptional flying
abilities made him a less than perfect instructor and one often
intolerant of a pupil’s lack of natural skill. He was also a
mediocre businessman, and in spite of all his success, was always
short of funds and getting entangled in dubious deals. But Smithy
was unstintingly generous with his own money and with his most
treasured possessions – his aircraft. The City of Melbourne
wanted to put itself on the world map for its centenary in 1934 and
devised a promotion: an Air Race from London to Melbourne, the
route stretching over 18,250 Km, through 19 countries and over
seven seas. They persuaded Sir Macpherson Robertson, a
multi-millionaire confectionary manufacturer, to sponsor the race.
Robertson wrote a cheque for A$1,500,000 (2006 values) and 63 of
the world’s top aviators entered the
“MacRobertson”, including Smithy, who accepted a
A$200,000 loan from Robertson to enable him to acquire a suitable
aircraft. Melbourne businessman Sidney Myer also underwrote
A$20,000 of Smithy’s costs if six others gave Smithy the same
amount. Take-off date was set at dawn (6:30 AM) on October 20,
1934, from RAF Mildenhall in England. Smithy chose the Lockheed
“Altair” - the creation of those cutting edge designers
from Burbank, California, John K. Northrop and Gerard Vultee. New,
the aircraft would have cost him A$800,000. This one was
“preowned” (actually “precrashed” and then
factory rebuilt) and was described by another famous aviator of the
period, P.G.Taylor, Smithy’s co-pilot for the Race and the
West–East Pacific crossing, as “A real thoroughbred.
Her tapered wings glistening below her blue streamlined fuselage:
no complex contraption of wires and struts and gadgets hanging
everywhere; just a wing, a body, and a tail of perfect form, like a
beautiful blue bird poised ready for flight” This state of
the art monocoque low wing monoplane had a tandem enclosed cockpit,
retractable undercarriage, flaps, variable pitch propeller, and a
performance far superior to any military aircraft of the time. The
14:1 supercharged engine was the 550 HP Pratt &amp; Whitney 9
cylinder radial which evolved into the famous Wasp R-1340, in
production until 1960, an engine that has powered a host of famous
aircraft, including the North American AT-6/SNJ/ Harvard advanced
trainer in which most Allied pilots in WW2 and afterwards learnt
their trade. You can find some newly discovered photos (2008) of
this beautiful 1930's aircraft at
http://www.adastron.com/lockheed/updates.htm and of the previous
owner, Captain George Hutchinson - who bought the Altair to emulate
Lindbergh's crossing of the Atlantic, but crashed on take-off
shortly after taking delivery! Note the shot showing the engine
without its cowling - then you understand how huge the fuel tanks
were, and why the pilot and navigator are located so far back. As
the actress said to the bishop - it's all to do with the C of G, my
dear :) Lockheed accepted Smithy’s order to modify the
“Altair” for long distance flying on the basis of his
fame (and their hope that a little would rub off on Lockheed if he
won the Race!) The mods resulted in an aircraft with a maximum take
off weight 34% higher than the design was certificated by the US
airworthiness authorities, so it could not obtain a US C of A. And
the rules of the MacRobertson Race said that all aircraft must
possess an airworthiness certificate from a country which was a
signatory to the International Air Convention. The USA was not a
signatory but Australia was. To add to Smithy’s woes, the
Australian government forbade the importation of aircraft from any
country that had not signed the ICAN. So Smithy did not have
– nor could he obtain – overt permission to import the
“Altair” or to fly it in the Race without first getting
an Australian airworthiness certificate. He had known this all
along, but gambled that if he could just get his
“Altair” onto Australia soil, he could use the press
and public opinion to bend the rules for him and have
“ANZAC” (as he now named the plane) certified here.
From Los Angeles, he shipped “ANZAC” to Sydney on the
sports deck of the SS ”Mariposa”, and directly she
docked at Woolloomooloo, Smithy paid the floating crane
“Titan” A$3,000 to swing her onto a barge. On 17 July,
1934, in Neutral Bay, “ANZAC” was manhandled off the
barge and pushed some 250 metres up to the northwest end of
Anderson Park. Fuelled with only 10 gallons (about 17 minutes
endurance), she was run up, turned into the wind and Smithy took
her off in 155 metres for the 12 Km flight to Mascot. When he
arrived there, Customs immediately impounded “ANZAC”,
disabled her engine by confiscating the plug leads and locked her
up in a sealed hangar! [To see good quality newsreel of the above

Postscript: The “ANZAC” was renamed “Lady
Southern Cross” following a campaign by the Returned
Soldiers’ League to stop Smithy’s commercial use of the
name ANZAC. She eventually got her Australian airworthiness
certificate as VH-USB - Smithy was right about public opinion! But
she was scratched from the Race due to mechanical problems; time
ran out and she would have had to break the Australia to England
record just to reach the starting line. Subsequently, Smithy took
her to USA to sell so he could pay Robertson’s loan back.
Fitted with extra fuel tanks by the Australian designer Lawrence
Wackett, she now had a still air range of 4,090 miles (6,600 Km) at
a maximum take off weight nearly 40% above her certificated MTOW
and this provided Smithy some interesting challenges as it doubled
the take-off distance required. The flight was another record,
another triumph, the first trans Pacific flight from Australia to
USA. In Burbank, whilst Lockheed refurbished “Lady Southern
Cross”, Smithy made plans to take her to England. He became
embroiled in another bureaucratic nightmare: no US airworthiness
certificate meant no export permit from USA, which meant no import
licence into UK! In the end, common sense prevailed and she was
admitted to UK on a limited “racing only” C of A
registered as G-ADUS. However Smithy was running out of funds, and
was soon left with no options but to fly “Lady Southern
Cross” home to Australia. He and his copilot/mechanic Tommy
Pethybridge left on 6 November 1935 via Athens, Baghdad, Allahabad
(NW India), Singapore and Darwin in an attempt to break the England
to Australia speed record. Smithy was in poor health, burnt out
after living on adrenaline for 20 years, and deeply worried about
his financial situation. What should have been another glorious
adventure was now just a business enterprise to raise enough money
to survive. “Lady Southern Cross” was last seen at
around 2.16 AM on 8 November, 1935, south of Rangoon, Burma, when
the glow from her exhausts was visible as she overtook the only
other aircraft in the area, Jimmy Melrose in his Percival Gull,
also bound for Singapore. The weather was typhoonal and the
visibility bad. On 1 May, 1937, a section of her undercarriage
including a wheel and tyre (still inflated) washed ashore on Aye
Island in the Gulf of Martarban. Modern forensics have since shown
that it had been immersed for about 17 months in less than 15
fathoms (27 metres) of salt water. This relic is now in the
Powerhouse Museum, Sydney. The expedition that investigated this
find in 1937 also noted that the tallest tree on the very top of
jungle covered Aye Island (about 150 metres above sea level) had
had its top sliced off, and a dozen trees leading from there down
towards the sea were similarly damaged. They found some small
pieces of metal from the “Altair” on the beach, and
concluded that Smithy had crashed into the sea just off the Island.
It was a tragic ending to an amazing career, but not unexpected.
Amy Johnson, CBE, the great British long distance solo pilot and
contemporary of Smithy, always said “I know I shall end up in
the drink one day” and she did, and was never found. And
Amelia Earhart, DFC, another contemporary, an American and the
first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, said &quot;Flying may not
be all plain sailing, but the fun of it is worth the price.&quot; She
left Lae, New Guinea, for Howland Island 4,000 km away, on 2 July,
1937, on the penultimate leg of her attempt to be the first woman
to fly around the world – and was never seen again. Pioneer
fliers used up their luck pretty quickly. As the saying goes
“There are old pilots and bold pilots – but there are
no old, bold pilots…” In 1936, in Smithy’s
honour, Mascot Airport was renamed “Kingsford Smith
Airport” – international abbreviation KSA.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I (Akkatracker) Have now adopted this cache from Geomatica.&lt;/p&gt;
The sat coords were very consistent over 15 minutes although only 4 sats were acquired. Please report DNFs. The grounds were empty on a week day at lunchtime, although it is only 400 metres (as the crow flies) from North Sydney station. Starbrand muggle rating 2/5. I’ve lived around this area for over 30 years – and I never knew it existed. Safe place for geokiddies, but no swings. Sorry.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In 1872, the previous owner being in dire financial straits, a three story stone house known as “Euroka” on the heights of North Sydney, about two blocks from the Post Office, was sold to George Dibbs. He subsequently became State Treasurer and in this role he stopped the then practice of selling off Crown land to balance the State's books. He won public esteem when jailed for a year 1880 - 1881 for refusing on principle to pay £2000 damages for slander. Dibbs went on to serve several terms as Premier of New South Wales. George Dibbs set about turning the 7.5 acres (3 hectares) grounds near the house into a spacious parkland. Substantial plantings of figs, pines and other trees were undertaken. In 1882 he renamed the property “Graythwaite” after the ancestral home of his wife. Graythwaite's gardens have had 130 years to mature and it shows. In particular the estate features over forty mature Morton Bay, Port Jackson and Small Fruited Figs under whose canopy a rainforest has been gradually evolving from seed brought in by birds and bats. A significant number of young native rainforest trees are now on the rise. In 1915, Sir Thomas Dibbs (George Dibbs' brother) lost his only two grandsons at Gallipoli. In their ANZAC memory, he offered the property to the State of New South Wales as &quot;a Convalescent Home for our Sick and Wounded Soldiers and Sailors and when not required for that purpose as a Convalescent Home in perpetuity for distressed subjects of the British Empire regardless of Sect or Creed&quot;. The NSW Premier accepted the property as ”A gift for all time…” and in 1916, after significant building work, the convalescent home was opened under the control of the Red Cross. In 1978 “Graythwaite” was placed on the Register of the National Estate, the only comparable site in Sydney being Government House, with its setting on Sydney Harbour more or less opposite (from the South) and a garden area of comparable size - 5 hectares. However, in 1980 management responsibility for the property passed from the Red Cross to the NSW Department of Health. The property has steadily deteriorated since, and after two decades of almost total neglect by NSW Health, the State of NSW has twice tried to gain Supreme Court approval to &quot;separate the property from the trust&quot; and to sell it. No one would think of building medium density housing and allowing commercial development in the grounds of Government House, but that is precisely what the Health Department envisages for Graythwaite. North Sydney Council has made an offer to the NSW Government to buy “Graythwaite” to retain the land in public ownership, create a CBD park and ensure the restoration of the historic mansion to its former splendour. Currently the grounds are maintained by volunteers, and essential works are financed ex gratia by North Sydney Council, awaiting the State Government’s decision. A great garden does not happen overnight. It takes time, lots of it and one of the major features of Graythwaite is its gardens. You’ll find some postcards in the cache. If you think “Graythwaite” should not be sacrificed and turned into million dollar luxury apartments, please take one and post it to the current Premier. UPDATE May, 2008: The good news is that the 2008 Federal Budget allocates $20 million to “securing the future” of Graythwaite over the next 3 years. This is $5 million less than Kevin Rudd's election promise, but $20 million more than suggested after his Labor government’s review of the John Howard's Government's election spending promises. The less good news is that the Commonwealth has now effectively distanced itself from the issue, leaving it up to the RSL to battle the New South Wales State Government. (The Returned Services League is the Australian veterans' organization established in Australia in 1916 to provide help for former members of the armed forces and their families) The previous proposal had been for the Commonwealth to become the Trustee of the Graythwaite Trust, which would have given the Supreme Court confidence in the future of the Trust should it decide to remove the State Government as Trustee. The current proposal is for the RSL to become the Trustee, supported by the $20 million provided by the Commonwealth. This money both has to provide for the restoration of the property and provide an income for a range of RSL welfare services provided to veterans. This leaves the RSL with the obligation to finding a self funding use for the Graythwaite house itself. The gardens would be maintained by North Sydney Council. The RSL is actively looking for partners to assist it in finding a viable use for the house, most preferably a use related to health care. There is at least one good possibility and hopefully this can be developed prior to the next round of Supreme Court hearings in June, 2008. Update 10-07-08: The Mater Hospital has been actively looking at locating a convalescent facility at Graythwaite, and will join with the RSL in putting a proposal to the Supreme Court on July 14th. This will very substantially strengthen the RSL's case and make it much more difficult for the State to argue that their proposal is the best use of the Trust. Update 23-10-08: All the evidence has been heard. NSW Health proposed the sale of Graythwaite, the proceeds to be used for a rehabilitation facility at Ryde Hospital to replace an existing facility at Greenwich. This proposal would create not a single additional rehabilitation bed. It is simply a grab for cash. The other proposal, by the Australian Government and the RSL, proposed that the full purpose and spirit of the Graythwaite Trust be fulfilled by the grant by the Commonwealth of $15 million to the RSL for use for the provision of care services to veterans, that the grounds of Graythwaite be leased for a peppercorn rental to North Sydney Council for use as a regional park for the North Sydney CBD, that the Commonwealth provide $5 million for the restoration of the Graythwaite mansion and that St Vincents and the Mater Hospitals construct a new rehabilitation facility adjacent to the Graythwaite mansion and the adaptive reuse of the mansion as part of this facility. This proposal was supported by the RSL, the Commonwealth, North Sydney Council, St Vincents and the Mater Hospitals and the Friends of Graythwaite. All that has to happen now is for the Judge to choose the best case. However, the State Government/ NSW Health is going to court this Friday 24th October to try to defer the Graythwaite hearings set down for October 30 and 31. They suggest that the matter be stood over for a further directions hearing (not hearing of the evidence ) on December 5. Given that all of the evidence is now in and that the current Judge is retiring at the end of November, this suggests either that NSW Health realise that they have no chance of winning or that they want a new judge to hear the case some time in 2009. So, if you think the referee might rule against you - try and change the referee! Update 20 November 2008: The Court found in favour of the scheme proposed by NSW Health solely on the basis that it would help more 'distressed' citizens than the proposed Mater facility. This was despite the fact that the Mater's beds would be in addition to all existing beds, whereas the NSW Health scheme would merely replace existing beds without a single new bed being created to treat 'distressed' citizens! The Court's decision ignored the spirit and intent of Sir Thomas Dibbs's gift of Graythwaite and his obvious concern for the welfare of veterans, and focused solely on a narrow interpretation of just one sentence in his Deed of Gift. I understand the Court's decsion will be appealed. The cache is a 1 litre “sistema” box, with geokiddie goodies, the log and a 27 litre rubbish bag. Feel free to use the bag and take out any garbage you see around. If you do, record it when you log your find, and the next cacher will know to bring in a replacement. It is a pretty clean site - but we’d like to keep it that way! First To Find may get $50,000 - we’ve left a “scratchie” for you. Please replace the cache precisely as you found it - otherwise it will get muggled. Because of the water, ensure the log bag is put inside the zip slide bag. Oh and BTW If you spot a Garmin Oregon 300 laying around, its mine- I lost it here :(</groundspeak:long_description>

Seriously, amazingly big bamboo specimens in this garden. The cache isn't in an easy to find location, but a bit of confirmation from a previous finders kept us searching and after more searching we found it. TNLN</groundspeak:text>

This epic, one of the oldest written stories, is the basis of many myths, legends and tales, including modern ones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gilgamesh, Assyrian King of Uruk during the third millennium BC, is apart god and part man. He sets out on a quest to seek immortality. In the course of his quest, he finds compassion, friendship, courage, love and peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The statue was unveiled by the Chancellor of the University emeritus professor Dame Leonie Kramer, AC DBE on the 15 October 2000.</groundspeak:long_description>

While you can't really tell from the outside a huge portion of it is actually underground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache itself is a nano and is hidden in the forecourt of the Sydney Law School.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My GPS had a bit of difficulty with finding GZ because of the buildings surrounding the area. Please post the coords you get in the log if you think it’s wrong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sydney Law School building and associated components of the project occupy a significant site within the Camperdown Campus bounded by Fisher Library, Eastern Avenue, the Carslaw Building, and, Victoria Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four major components of the project are the Sydney Law School Building, including a Moot Court facility, Faculty of Law Library, Teaching Spaces, and Forecourt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Faculty of Law Building is the visually dominant element of the project occupying an elevated position on a linear north south orientation defining the campus perimeter with Victoria Park. Rather than forming a barrier the building is lifted above the groundplane with its northern section splayed providing an “open door” orientation towards the city, reinforcing the connection of law with the CBD’s legal precinct and wider society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This building, over four levels, accommodates the faculty academic and administrative staff, together with a range of research centres and institutes, and incorporates collaborative spaces, meeting and conference rooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A total of 23 teaching spaces are provided within the facility, ranging from 300 and 100 seat lecture theatres, through to 60, 56, and 24 seat seminar facilities to suit a wide range of teaching requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Law Library occupies approximately 3,650 sq mts on Level 1 including the associated mezzanine level to the western edge of the new facility and features views to Victoria Park from a range of contemporary resource and research spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone attempting this cache needs to be mindful that the forecourt is a very hight muggle activity area during the day. Evening/night time should be quieter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BYO pen. Also the log can be difficult to remove so bring a paper clip (or cache extraction tool).</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located at the Old Darlington School, a beautiful little building, which is surrounded by a moat on one side that separates it from from Cadigal Green park (also beautiful).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is is a log only cache so bring a pen. High muggle activity during the day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old Darlington School was designed c1877, and was one of a number of single storey suburban schools designed by the architect to the Council of Education, George Allen Mansfield. At the end of 1975, the school, which was in a very poor state of repair was transferred to the University. Several buildings were demolished and the site cleared in 1976. It was originally intended that the area be used for construction of a new building for the School of Biological Sciences, to be relocated to Darlington from Science Road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This plan was cancelled with the ending of the Australian University’s Commission triennial funding in 1975, and in 1978 the building was renovated for the Department of Music to be used as a theatre workshop and performance space. The building is heritage listed under the City of Sydney Local Environment Plan and the University’s Section 170 Register.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old Darlington school is a single storey Gothic Revival style building constructed of polychromatic brickwork with sandstone sills, kneelers, broaches and string courses. The picturesque composition includes a spire at the south corner, a chimney almost in the centre of the verandah (to the west elevation) and gables to the south and west.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In September 2007, the University of Sydney began conservation work on the façade and roof of the old Darlington School in accordance with the 1999 Heritage Fabric Survey recommendations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work was completed in February 2008, allowing the Old Darlington School to continue as a venue for events, concerts and exhibitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Old Darlington School is now conserved for future generations. The life expectancy of the features, such as the roofs is over 100 years. The savings to can be measured by the original investment in the embodied energy for the building has been saved for the 21st century. The project achieved its goal and was completed within the project budget of $1.4m, compared with the cost of an equivalent new building which would be in excess of $2m.</groundspeak:long_description>

area. The cache may hold small swaps such as geocoins and travel
bugs.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Towra Point, the northern tip of the of the land area stretching
into Botany Bay bears clear waters and a white beach. Beyond starts
the Towra Point Nature Reserve, which is often stated as the most
important wetland in the Sydney area. There are public moorings on
a day use basis, and on a hot summer day, this beach is one of the
regional secrets. You may also see marine wildlife, plenty of fish,
including stingrays.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Access:&lt;/b&gt; You must come by boat as land access through Towra
Point Nature Reserve is first by permit only, and secondly
impenetrable through the swamps. Landing of a larger vessel is at
the day use area, then walk the short distance along the beach
until you are closest to GZ. If you feel, please take some rubbish
off your way &lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">By boat only. Best is high tide, but probably you have to wade the
last meters.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Carters Island consists of two small areas of terrestrial
vegetation surrounded by mangroves which are the most highly
developed mangrove stands at Towra. The water is very shallow and
you may need to wade some hundreds meters if you are at low tide.
At high waters, you can come close with a small boat, but take care
if you have a motor, because there are plenty of submarine hazards
for your propeller.
&lt;p&gt;The shoreline at this part of Botany Bay is fractal exposing a
multitude of bays, sand bars, mangroves. In the water you may see
big fish as stingrays, at land and in the air birds. The adjacent
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkHome.aspx?id=N0551&quot;&gt;
Towra Point&lt;/a&gt; and Carters Island nature reserves are home to many
endangered, vulnerable, protected and exotic species of birds,
amphibians, mammals reptiles and plants. Land access into these
reserves is restricted and needs a permit, however, there are a few
beaches and landing stripes for boats which are open or closed, as
signposted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may need to work out your best boat access by yourself. It
depends on the size of the vessel, its propulsion method and where
you are coming from. Satellite maps may help to determine a deeper
water channel for approach. One way is to enter the bay close to
the Elephants Trunk. As you cross the bay towards GZ, steer
straight towards the mangroves and then follow them westwards, as
there the water is deeper than further out.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

a key, a coin, a screwdriver or a nail.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Assuming that you have done the Quibray Bay Mangroves (&lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC2VPZ6&quot;&gt;GC2VPZ6&lt;/a&gt;) already, so you know all
about the area. Weeney Bay lies further down the channel between
oyster the farms. Have you seen the birds sitting on the poles and
fishing. Or just drying their feathers in the sunshine. The
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkHome.aspx?id=N0551&quot;&gt;
Towra Point Nature Reserve&lt;/a&gt; starts behind this sign, a few
meters further south of here, where even boats are prohibited. And
look to that idyllic hut just east of the sign with its little
jetty! It must be a nice place to relax.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Access:&lt;/b&gt; Here, larger vessels can come at high tide,
however, stay well in the channel, otherwise you may find yourself
in trouble. There is no need to enter the oyster fields at all. I
saw a jetski racing by with 20 or 30 knots, but many people
exercise here by paddling from the Kurnell area. A careful study of
a map or satellite image may be helpful for planning to come out
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rating is that high only because of the need of a boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember: Don't drop it, please!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
