It is situated in a shallow valley 882 metres above sea-level at the northern end of the New England Tablelands in an area of rugged mountains and rural vistas. It proclaims itself 'The Birthplace of the Nation' as Henry Parkes chose this spot to deliver his crucial Federation speech of 1889, which led to the establishment of Australia as a unified nation in 1901.

Mount Mackenzie provides magnificent views over the township from an altitude of 1298m. The reserve is approximately 5km south-west of Tenterfield, on the Mount Mackenzie Road. Once at the top, there are picnic tables, toilets and a gas barbeque.

The cache is a camo eclipse container and shouldn't be very difficult to find. There is no need to leave the viewing platform.
Be aware that snow does fall at this location, and while the road to the top is in good condition, care and warm clothing would be advisable in the winter months.

The Historic Train Station and Old Photographs is open: 1pm - 4pm, Sunday, Wednesday &amp; Public Holidays.

2011 is the centenary for Toronto Train Station also the 120th anniversary of the opening of the private tramway from Fassifern Station. There were no roads to the area, only by water or long uncomfortable ride on horseback through the bush from Newcastle. The Excelsior Land Investment &amp; Building Company &amp; Bank Ltd purchased the former aboriginal mission land grant in 1885, with the goal of developing an attractive lake-side resort town.

The Company sub-divided part of the property and gave it the name &quot;Toronto Estate&quot;.

This is also the current site for the Lake Macquarie Historical Society.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Toronto...
&lt;p&gt;Toronto is a town within the city of Lake Macquarie in New South
Wales, Australia, approximately 28 kilometres (17 mi) from
Newcastle's central business district and is a commercial hub for
the sprawling suburbs on the western shore of the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History:&lt;br/&gt;
Toronto was named after Toronto, Ontario, Canada in honour of
Edward Hanlan, a world-champion sculler who visited Australia in
1884. The area's subdividers, the Excelsior Company, named the land
in honour of Hanlan's visit, which coincided with the opening of
the subdivision. The name was not publicly used until 1887. The
Canadian city's name comes from the Mohawk language tkaronto,
meaning where there are trees standing in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toronto was originally the site of an Aboriginal mission called
Ebenezer, established in 1829 by Reverend Threlkeld. Threlkeld is
reported to have begun construction of his chimney with a local
black stone which he later realised was coal. Coal Point is named
after this discovery. The development of several coal mines in the
region, proximity to the nearby city of Newcastle, and its position
by the lake led to gradual development and population
increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the closure of the Ebenezer Aboriginal Mission in
1890, the population of the Toronto area remained mostly
Aboriginal. As the coal companies moved into the area, the
aboriginal population were helped financially and the community was
sustained mainly by the coal industry. However, it was not long
before a mixture of land disputes and poor treatment of the local
Aboriginals led to a major rally by the locals. This rally, which
began as vandalism of mining company property, soon escalated into
heavy violence and led to the Toronto massacre of 1896. Five
Aboriginals were killed and many people on both sides were brutally
beaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population:&lt;br/&gt;
Toronto and its surrounding suburbs had a total population of just
over 5,000 people at the turn of the century. Toronto's population
was 5161 in the 2006 census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transport:&lt;br/&gt;
Toronto is considered to be the hub for public transport on the
western side of Lake Macquarie. The area is served by a privately
operated bus service; 'Toronto Bus Service', which services the
areas to the west, south and north of the town.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Toronto was served by train services until March 1990, when the NSW
Government closed the line because of low passenger levels. The
train service was replaced by a bus service which connects Toronto
with Fassifern railway station.Train services operating from
Fassifern include services to Sydney and Newcastle as well as the
XPT service to Brisbane. Toronto is well served by road links to
Newcastle and Sydney and is approximately 8 minutes from the
Sydney-Newcastle Freeway (F3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toronto centre serves the local communities of Kilaben Bay,
Coal Point, Carey Bay, Rathmines and Wangi Wangi to the south and
Teralba, Booragul, Woodrising, Fennell Bay, Bolton Point, Fassifern
and Blackalls Park to the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sports:&lt;br/&gt;
Toronto is represented by three sports teams in Newcastle
competitions. The Toronto Awaba Stags FC in the Northern NSW
Football competition; the Macquarie Scorpions in the Newcastle
Rugby League and also the Toronto Workers Kookaburras in the
Newcastle cricket competition. Nathan Green, winner of the 2009 RBC
Canadian Open, was born in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;

SYDNEY - NEWCASTLE (F3) FREEWAY
National Highway 1
General Information:
The Sydney-Newcastle Freeway is a 127 km (79 mi) stretch of motorway linking Sydney to the Central Coast, Newcastle and Hunter regions of New South Wales.
The Sydney-Newcastle Freeway is the major arterial highway between Sydney and Newcastle. Starting life as the Berowra-Calga Tollway, the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway has been gradually extended and improved until the Palmdale / Ourimbah gap and Lengahans Drive bypass were completed in the late 90's. The route replaced several sections of very windy road between Berowra and the southern reaches of Newcastle.

The freeway starts with the junction of the Pacific Highway and Pennant Hills Road at Pearce's Corner, Wahroonga in Sydney's north. From here it goes north, skirting the western edge of the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park before meeting the Hawkesbury River at Brooklyn. After crossing the Hawkesbury the motorway passes through the Brisbane Water National Park, crossing Mooney Mooney Creek with an impressive 480m long and 75m high bridge before reaching the first main interchange on the Central Coast at Kariong.

After reaching Kariong, the motorway continues through rural and semi-rural areas of the Central Coast with interchanges provided at Ourimbah, Tuggerah, Warnervale and also Kiar, near Doyalson. From the Doyalson interchange the freeway continues to the west of Lake Macquarie with interchanges near Morisset, Cessnock, Toronto and Cardiff. The Doyalson interchange is with what is known as &quot;Motorway Link&quot; a connection feeder to the Pacific Highway (now SR111), when the freeway ended at this interchange in the mid 1980s.

After the Cardiff interchange a link road takes  traffic into Newcastle via Wallsend while the motorway continues north to reach its finish with a roundabout at the junction of Weakleys Drive (Weakley's Drive photos can be seen here) and John Renshaw Drive, Beresfield. From here the National Highway route continues to Brisbane via the New England Highway (accessed via Weakleys Drive), with traffic on NH1/NH15 taking John Renshaw Drive and the New England Highway eastbound to meet the Pacific Highway at Hexham.

The Sydney-Newcastle Freeway, is part of the Auslink National Network, and is the major road linking Sydney, the Central Coast and Newcastle. It also links with the New England and Pacific Highways, for travel to northern New South Wales and Queensland.

The Sydney-Newcastle Freeway is a vital link for around 75 000 motorists that use the freeway daily, the majority of whom travel between the Central Coast and Hunter regions and Sydney. During weekends and school holidays, the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway is heavily used by motorists travelling to and returning from northern New South Wales and Queensland holiday destinations.

This section of the F3 was opened to traffic:
Morisset to Freemans Drive - March 1988

History:
The Sydney-Newcastle Freeway replaced the old Pacific Highway which was built in the 1920s along a route that had existed since 1840s, when settler George Peat cut a track to his property on the banks of the Hawkesbury River.

Planning began for the freeway in the 1950s, with the aim of providing a high-speed replacement to a section of the Pacific Highway which was built in the 1920s and was struggling to cope with the increased traffic volume. Furthermore it was planned that the freeway would connect to freeway systems being proposed for both Sydney and Newcastle, providing a city-to-city freeway link.
However, due to several reasons the goal and route of the freeway changed significantly so that today it serves to bypass Newcastle rather than go into it.

Freemans Drive:
General information:
Freemans Drive runs from the Morisset round-a-bout to the Freemans Waterhole round-a-bout. It is 19.1km's in length and takes approximately 17 minutes to drive it full length.
Freemans Drive cross the path of the F3 Freeway three times - one under and twice over.
Freemans Drive passes through the town of Cooranbong.

Freemans Drive is a sealed road in New South Wales. It goes from Morisset to near Ryhope.
Freemans Drive's highest elevation along its length is 61.3m and the lowest point is at 4.85m.
For cyclists and those towing caravans, boats or heavy loads Freemans Drive is undulating along its 15.6 km length, with about 510 m that is steeper in incline/grade than 5%. The total ascent / descent along the length of Freemans Drive is 117 m / 154 m.

Martinsville, NSW

Name Origin:
William and Sarah Martin were the earliest known settlers in the area and in the early 1890's a meeting of local citizens adopted the name in their honour. By the I January 1894 the local post office had also adopted the name. 

Early Land Grants:
Portion 37, Parish of Coorumbung, Thomas Moore, granted 60 acres, on 8/4/1834. Moore's grant was near the junction of Dora and Deep Creeks. Portion 10, Owen Beardmore, granted 100 acres in May 1854. This portion adjoined that of Thomas Moore. The Martin family purchased a large tract of timbered country from the Crown between 1865 and 1875. In 1877 Sydney Dodds purchased the 60 acres that had originally been a grant to Thomas Moore. 

Early Settlers:
William Martin a timber getter and his wife Sarah with their children were the first settlers. They originally came from Ireland, and settled in the area sometime between 1861 and 1866. 

Other settlers followed the Martins but no real community emerged until after 1875. About then Sydney Dodds settled and took up farming. Others to settle at the same time were George Hadlow, James Maher and John Edgtton, the latter two being sawyers. 

Early Industries:
Martinsville was founded on the timber industry. During the 1880's many men were employed in the industry with bullock teams carrying logs to the large saw mills at Cooranbong. Only small saw mills existed at Martinsville. Bamiers' Mill was at the top of Mount Falk, Mullards' at the foot of the Wattagan Road and Espleys' near the crossing of Blarney Grove Creek. Later fanning became predominant including dairying and citrus growing. 

First Post Office:
Opened I November 1889, with the name of 'Dora Creek'. This office was renamed 'Brush' on 15 December 1892 and 'Martinsville' on I January 1894. It closed on 30 January 1965. 

First School:
Opened in December 1878 as Deep Creek Provisional School by Sydney Dodds on part of his land. His position as a teacher was confirmed in December 1878 by the Department of Public Instruction. In May 1881 Dodds transferred to a school in Newcastle and Miss Gleeson replaced him, remaining in the position for 8 years. It became a public school in October 1879. The school closed about 1974 due to insufficient numbers of pupils. The school was called 'Deep Creek' until 1883, and 'Dora Creek' until February 1894. 

Town:
First Church: The original &quot;Union Church&quot; was erected about the same time as the post office was established. It was a meeting place for many denominations until it was pulled down in 1924.

The Adventist Aviation Association, established 1973, and their aircraft assisted
volunteer country outreach and missionary programs. There are secondary
levels of significance, such as the formation of the main strip by early
Adventist community members in the late 1940s, and the development of a
flying school in the late 1970s. The size and scale of the airstrips form
distinctive landmarks when viewed from the air.

Cooranbong:

From Aboriginal word &quot;Kour-an-bong&quot; meaning rocky bottom creek or water over rocks. Early spellings include 'Kuringbong'(1834),'Coorumbung'(1841), 'Corumbong' (1879). The name was officially adopted with the opening of' Cooranbong' post office in 1866. 

The Police Station and lock up was built by Henry Worley in 1835. Moses Carroll was the Superintendant. The township came into existence around the time of the 1861 land sales. It was announced in 1866 that a bridge was to be erected over Dora Creek. The first Catholic church was erected by November 1861. Thomas Russell opened the first hotel. By 1875 a racecourse was operating. The Seventh-day Adventists established a college at Cooranbong in 1896. 

In 1865 it was estimated that the town had 150 residents, who were chiefly timber workers. In 1884 the population was about 700 but the census of 1891 showed only 206 people, possibly due to the depression of the 1890's affecting the timber trade. The population has grown to around 4500.

‘Cooranbong’ is from an Aboriginal word meaning rocky bottom creek or water over rocks. The name was officially adopted with the opening of the Cooranbong Post
office in 1866.

Cooranbong was an important river port with up to ten ships trading here regularly for timber and agricultural produce. The town had a courthouse, shops, hotels and a ship yard. When the northern railway was coming, it was expected to pass through Cooranbong with a branch line to Newcastle and the main line to pass under the Gap as it went further north. The town’s people saw the town as the administration centre of the south. But the line was eventually built through Morisset and over Dora Creek. This prevented the sailing ships from coming up the river and Cooranbong rapidly went into decline dropping the population from 700 to less than 200 in five years. About that time the Adventists arrived and moved the town a mile to the east where the town center is today.

If you believe this cache is on private property, you are correct. But don't worry I have permission.

This cache is placed about half way on the track that I used to ride on my bike to and from school every day.The path is now closed off on the Avondale Rd side.

This is a “historic Walk” which has been restored and maintained by Avondale College (land owner.) “This is a 2.2 km track that takes in key heritage and ecological features of the Avondale Estate. The traditional Girls Walk – So named because female and male students were directed to use separate walking tracks in earlier chapters of Avondale College’s history – formed the original entrance to Avondale from Avondale Rd.”

This is a very easy going walking track 2.2 km long. The cache is about at the half way mark near where Avondale Rd used to connect to the track and also near what used to be a BMX dirt track. (It has been dismantled with fallen trees covering parts of the track to it can no longer be used. Probably for OHS issues.)</groundspeak:long_description>

This bridge was constructed in 1996 by Lake Macquarie City Council.
It replaces the earlier timber bridge built in 1938.

The overall difficulty has been set at 2.5 due to the amount of muggle activity at this location.

The cache is an Eclipse tin, so there isn't much room inside for much more than the log and the pencil.

The initial coordinates take you to information that will help you work out the coordinates to the actual cache.

To work out the coordinates to the actual cache please follow these instructions:

X = Calculate the number of letters on the 5th line (do not count spaces or numbers) and add the answer to your original S coordinate - ie S 33 6.014+X

Y = Subtract the older date from the newer date, then subtract the number of letters on the 7th line, then subract the number of letters on the 3rd line and finally add the number of letters on the 6th line (do not count spaces or numbers). Add the answer to your E coordinate - ie E 151 28.471+Y

Have fun, enjoy the beautiful creek, be careful of traffic and muggles, and please replace the cache carefully.

Following is an interesting article regarding this bridge and the bats that live there...

VOLUME 17, NO. 2 Summer 1999

Home Sweet Bridge
Incorporating timbers from an old bridge into a new one brings Australian large-footed bats back home to roost . . .
Hoye, Glen Alexander and Margaret

Incorporating timbers from an old bridge into a new one brings Australian large-footed bats back home to roost . . .
By Glenn Alexander Hoye with Margaret Hoye 
Early in May 1996, I was informed that a colony of bats roosting within an old wooden bridge in eastern New South Wales was about to lose its home. Demolition was due to commence within days to make room for a new concrete structure. Guessing that these particular bats were large-footed bats (Myotis adversus), a threatened species, I quickly alerted environmental staff at the local city council in Lake Macquarie. 
Sure enough, an initial inspection revealed that this represented the first known roost of large-footed bats in the Lake Macquarie area. From my point of view, the discovery was very exciting, but for the city council and their bridge construction company, it presented unforeseen obstacles. I developed a plan allowing the bridge to be replaced with minimal disturbance to the bat colony, and it was approved by both the city council and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. My subsequent role was to ensure the bats were safely excluded from the bridge and to attempt to re-establish their roosts within the new structure. 
As demolition began, we progressively excluded the entire colony of bats from the cracks in the timbers where they roosted. Plastic flaps were placed over roost entrances so that the bats exiting at dusk were unable to re-enter after feeding. Using scaffolding beneath the bridge, I crawled around on the narrow timber planks, precariously suspended over a murky creek, placing traps at the roost entrances. The bats I caught were banded, and some individuals were fitted with radio transmitters. By tracking the transmitter signals, we discovered an alternative roosting site among the concrete beams of a canal supplying water to a power station about 2 1/2 miles (4 km) away. 
When the new bridge was partially completed, the construction crew moved roost timbers from the old wooden bridge into equivalent positions in the new concrete one. This method of incorporating pieces of the original roost into a new structure may actually be the first of its kind attempted. 
We had determined that, prior to the bridge replacement, a population of at least 170 large-footed bats had roosted there. Also, the presence of many juveniles and the discovery that females outnumbered males approximately four to one suggested the bridge had been a maternity roost. Following completion of the new bridge, the Lake Macquarie City Council funded a monitoring program, and we have verified that large-footed bats have re-established roosts within the old timbers and are breeding successfully. Apparently the bats recognized their home! 
Glenn and Margaret Hoye have researched bats throughout Australia for the past 20 years. They survey, research, and advise on bat-related issues through their company, Fly By Night Bat Surveys. 
The success of this project suggests that the strategy of fitting old roost elements into new structures could be applied in many similar situations. Anyone attempting this, however, should be aware of climatic differences and other changes that could make the habitat unacceptable to the bats. Prior to removal, one should note the position, aspect, height, temperature, and sun exposure of roost elements then take care to re-install them into equivalent positions and conditions in the replacement structure. 
________________________________________
 

In addition to bridges, the large-footed bat’s most common roosts include caves, mines, tunnels, tree hollows, buildings, and dense foliage in rain forest areas. This species is seldom found far from bodies of water, over which it hunts for insects and small fish. 
 

Piers for the new bridge were installed while the original timber bridge was systematically removed. Scaffolding used to reach the bat roosts is visible under the bridge. 
  

Timbers from the old bridge were carefully placed in equivalent positions in the new structure, and the city council marked the significance of the roost with a plaque. (“Fishing bat” is a common local name for the species.) </groundspeak:long_description>

Opened on 16th June 1888 as a receiving post office only, in charge of Henry Eckford, who was also the station master. He was followed in 1889 by G.H. Manson. On 16 November 1898 its status was raised to that of an official Post office.

After Lieut-colonel James Thomas Morisset who was Commandant of Newcastle from 1818-1823. In April 1823 he made the first overland journey from Newcastle to Sydney and camped overnight under a tree on the western side of Lake Macquarie; the tree was situated just east of the present Morisset railway station, and is marked as a historic tree. However, there is also a possibility that it was named after his son E.N.V. Morisset who was superintendent of police at Bathurst, Maitland and Goulburn.

The first two industries established were sawmilling, and the building and functioning of the railway. The sawmills were situated near the railway to make transport easier. Logs were brought by bullock dray from a wide area, many from the Wattagan mountains. In 1909 the weekly output of one mill included:2000 tool handles, 8000 spokes, 100 pairs of rims, 200 pairs of shafts and 200 pairs of naves for wheels. Many of these were exported to New Zealand</groundspeak:long_description>

It is near the Yates fertiliser plant.

As this cache is hidden near a major road the overall difficulty rating has been set at 3 because of the amount of traffic which uses this road.

Be careful of the traffic and muggles.

Wyee, which means &quot;Place of Bushfires&quot; was officially pronounced a town on 22 August 1891.
The Wyee Train Station was opened in 1887.
The Wyee School, which was first opened in 1878, has been closed and reopened a number of times and is still operating today.
Wyee was first settled in 1835.

the physical cache container is, but may be of interest, based on
the clues below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache container looks somewhat like a VERY LARGE battery and
is large enough to hold quite a few Travel Bugs, Geocoins and
swaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First to Find honours go to Mr&amp;MrsFish. Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;What cereal can give you ample energy to get up and go, so that
you can vault through your day? A liquid breakfast? If breakfast
and cereals is not your thing, maybe you need a different
energizer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now for the puzzle...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final coordinates are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S SV° SA.(SW)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E EV° EA.(EW-1)&lt;/p&gt;
Where:
&lt;p&gt;SV=?, A=3, W=99&lt;br/&gt;
SA=?, V=9, W=171&lt;br/&gt;
SW=?, V=40, A=19&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Lake Parramatta was formed after the daming of Hunt's Creek in 1856. The surface area of the lake is 10km2 with a current storage of 450ML.

The lake has been a relaxation area for many decades - being a popular swimming spot in the 1920s and 30s. Pollution from urban runoff meant the lake was no longer safe to swim in. However, recent tests have now cleared it for public use again.

This geocache is located close to the shore of the lake, opposite another one of my geocaches - Lilypad lookout (GC2K2RM). You'll also be rewarded with a Munzee that is hidden in the container.

Note: The park is only open from 6:30 am until 5:30 pm (7:30 pm during Daylight Saving). Please don't attempt the cache outside of these hours.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is hidden along part of The Ponds walk - a small strip of bushland tucked behind houses in the suburb of Rydalmere.

The area was once part of the first vineyard planted by Philip Schaeffer, a settler from the First Fleet. In 1791, Schaeffer was granted 140 acres of land in this area. Along with four convicts, he cleared the land of trees and rocks and planted grape vines, producing 'ninety gallons of wine in about two years'.

Today the creek is filled with weeds such as lantana and nasturtiums, but local groups and Parramatta council are slowly winning the war, replacing the area with native plants. You can see some of the rehabilitated sections further up (east) the creek, which include  Sydney Blue gums.</groundspeak:long_description>

I then found park and a path that looked like it would take me in from Crowgey St. This path was full of lizards and windy all the way in with a creek crossing as well. GZ came up at a brief 7 min. run /walk in. Found the likely spot and found that I was FTF. SL and took coins. Left TB. however my Munzee app was not working and would not let me sign in so I took a pic of it and will try later.Thanks for a great cache hide and walk. Never been here so I enjoyed the history.Rntd safe.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Headed to this cache as I noticed it was also published on OC. Arrived at the area and spent a minute looking in the likely spots. No cache. Then suddenly, I saw it sitting in the open. It must have become dislodged. It was then I noticed that it wasn't an OC cache, but a GC one. Dual listing! Cool, two for the price of one. I returned the cache to where I think it should be, although the owner may wish to confirm. Nice little location, but what are the pipes for? Water?</groundspeak:text>
