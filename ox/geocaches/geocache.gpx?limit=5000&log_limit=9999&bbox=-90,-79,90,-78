Are they linked or not?  Should I log at both places?  My thought was to see if there were any caches unique to opencaching near me, but I think everything I see are duplicates.

There are numerous items in the GOS 3.0 as of 15 May 2005. good luck I'm sure they will go fast: Swiss Army Watch, Boonie Cap, ESS Tactical Goggles, compass, Pedometer, chem light, mini maglight, ranger beeds, signal mirror. 


All right there true believers, today we are on a search for the strongest symbol of our past and future the &quot;Stone.&quot; The nickname &quot;Gardens of Stone&quot; is a movie set in the vietnam era. and it relates to the numerous tombstones in Arlington National Cemetary. We are going on a search for other stones around town. Once you arrive at the first coordinates look for the following clues: 
Clue #1: Find the stones that lay in a half circle with the great military units of today and yesterday. Number of stones -18 = 3X (thirty something)

Clue #2 pillars of stone with jumpers falling between. Number of pillars – 15 = Y

35 03.XY6N
078 53.2X0W

All right, you are doing great so far now you are among more stones use the following clues to get the next coordinates:

The chapter # of Rolling Thunder who helped make this park possible: The Chapter # =X

The number of KIA + WIA + POW + 3,359,344= your north coordinate

Final coordinates
**.**.***N
078.52.05XW

Congrats to Wolfwalker for being the FTF Garden of Stone (original).

I have the back-up car with none of my geo-equipment in it, so I race home and get kitted up.  I am loaded for bear!  I’m ready for anything that comes my way.  Boots, knee and elbow pads, five flashlights, waterproof GPSr/Camera cases…last will and testament!  I totally deciphered the hint and looking at the map, I knew what was in store for me.  

Got to GZ and tried to be as quick and none conspicuous as possible in getting down to business.  Almost took the wrong fork, but a clue kept me on the right course…thanks Scott.  I couldn’t get over the graffiti down here, there are other people out there who are crazy, and not just geocachers.  Man the hike was brutal and a bit disconcerting when looking forward and back your flashlight beam just disappears into the abyss!  I had to take a couple of breathers along the way.  While you’re trudging to this cache, you have LOTS of time to ponder and doubt what and why exactly what you’re doing and second-guessing yourself every step of the way.  (By the way, you’re crushing many scrambling spiders on the way there).  I started to feel claustrophobic a little too.  I also started to think about striza’s tube ghost sighting and was starting to get a little paranoid.  I’m noticing no water splash marks or footprints on the way there, so I feeling hopeful about the FTF possibilities, although it wouldn’t be the first time at a cache that decemberinside was in and out and eating cornflakes when I thought I was FTF at a cache.

Finally made it to the cache site before I knew it.  I almost kept walking past it, I was so focused.  Fresh log…how nice!  Great hide.  Signed the log and steeled myself for the ordeal back.  I looked for a shortcut to escape my entombment, but the thought of be decapitated by some semi-truck quashed that idea.  Made my way back, half-expecting to meet someone coming the other way, but didn’t meet anyone.  I’m a bit surprised no one else is descending on this one.  I was never so happy to see daylight in my life as when I returned to the surface.  Great, great hide and experience.  I’ll never return here again.  Thanks for all of your imaginative work.

Still, it wasn't too far from my home, so off I go.  Got the entrance, met Echo Six Charlie, and out pops...like two dozen cachers!  At least I was equiped for this one this time.  I just keep equipement in the car now.  This one was a work out.  Very creative, as are all of e6c's hides.  When I got back out, everyone was still there, waiting for some more cachers to show up.  We had a grand time talking caching!  What a great group of guys.  Nice to finally meet some of the more active cachers in Fay-town finally.  I'll be ready for the next one.  Congrats Stiza on the FTF.   Didn't bring my camera, based on the appearance of some of the guys exiting.  TNLNSL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Got the alert and watched the video and thought twice about this one.  Scared the begezzers out of me.  But I headed for it anyway, because it intrigued me.  No too surprised on how to access the cache entrance.  Thought about heading home to get somemore appropiate footwear for this one, but figured I didn't have enough time get back and snag it before being upstaged by decemberinside.  Doffed the shoes and headed in...yes it is dark and cold.  Got to GZ quicker than I thought I would.  Saw the cache and made a grab for it.  Now this is one of the more uncomfortable retrievals of all time for me.  My choices are stand low and freeze my feet or stand high and have my arches loose circulation.  Not easy.  Started trying to locate the cryptext clue but no matter how much I tried with my flashlight, I could find nothing.  Yes night may be easier to see the stars afterall.  Kept trying to enter an incorrect word from a I clue I gathered from the cache page.  I kept entering it backwards, staggard, and upside down.  I thought the capitalized word &quot;MANE&quot; ment something then, but now I know it means something else.  I'll give you a big hint, the word is not &quot;HORSE.&quot;  LOL!  

I was making a pretty comical picture I'm sure.  One flashlight on my hip, one In my mouth, balancing.  Couldn't reach my glasses, and worried about the rats running around.  Finally, after about 20 minutes, I just happened to move the letters and formed the beginning of a word and the light went on and I went with it.  The cache container was very tight and bound trying to get it apart.  I wasn't giving up and succeeded in opening it.  Logged and reasymbled it and as I was turning the tumblers I hear wet footsteps.  It's decemberinside of course.  I lucked out again.  He opened the cryptext much faster than I.  Looking at everything, I think the clue was right in front of my face the whole time.  Haste makes waste.  

Great, great cache.  Maybe one of the best in Fayetteville.  This one is going on my list.  E6c you can retire now.  It doesn't get any better than this.  Thanks for all of your work.  I totally enjoyed this one...kinda like a haunted house tour.  TNLNSL TFTC

But, I did get a funny look from everybody when my ringtone alert went off.  By the time I finished and got to the web page g5ps had already made the find.  Also looks like stinza and gang had made a lunch time assualt on this one.  Great hide w/ a great container, as always with e6c hides.  Not too hard to grab, but when big trucks pass they kick a lot of debris on top of you.  This one will last centuries!  TNLNSL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Rats, I got the alert for this one while finishing up watching the Christmas parade downtown today.  Then I had to go to lunch with the family.  When I got home my car in the driveway had a flat!  Changed the tire and dropped it off at the tire place...then I headed for the cache.  Of course, I was too late.  I get quite irked when the caches post less than a mile from my house and I either can't get them, or else I'm out of town.

I had some idea of what this cache required.  I've never done one before, but I've heard about them at geo-events.  So, I came prepared.  Easy find and retrieval.  E6c...you starting to make me angry, bogarting all of the cool containers!  Very nice hide.  One of the most unique in F'ville.  You might want to consider securing the cache with oversized, heavy duty cable times from some place like Northern Tools.  Also, you may consider painting the container to match the host, so as to give it a more finished less foreign industrial look. (I hope I'm not critiqueing to much, 'cuz the cache IS awesome.) Great job.  Very clever and I really enjoyed it.  I hope it lasts.  TNLNSL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

I pull up and see CV and Striza are in the back of their pickup trucks sunbathing, 'cuz the weather is so nice, and they want to laugh at anyone who shows up to hunt the cache.  As much as I like those guys, I hate seeing them already parked at a new cache when I arrive.  I just knew this one was too far to get to in a timely fashion on a Friday afternoon.  Even they were not the first.  DI made the grab and was already gone...he's not one to sit around and chit chat when there are caches being published.  They gave me an option for a quick dirty or a long clean route.  Being not to motivated I grabbed the clean one.  Another great hide.  This area could serve as a fall-out shelter for a year.  When I extract myself out of the cave, the CO, e6c, is also pointing and laughing at me too.  Always fun to have a pleasant conversation with those guys.  They are always so enthusiastic.  Decided to head out to some other caches just as some local residents were deciding to go to work panhandling the tourists.  Another great hide.  Someday you're going to run out of containers or colverts...I don't know which will come first.  TNLNSL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Mr. Breyer hikes&lt;br/&gt;a lot, and he loves geocaching.   Mr.Breyer is&lt;br/&gt;so funny, because he is always making jokes.  He likes his new&lt;br/&gt;year in 3rdgrade!  He always wears ties and long&lt;br/&gt;shirts.  He is the nicest teacher in the&lt;br/&gt;world!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Our&lt;br/&gt;Mascot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lynx is a solitary cat that haunts the remote&lt;br/&gt;northern forest of North America, Europe, and&lt;br/&gt;Asia.  Lynx are covered&lt;br/&gt;with beautiful thick fur that keeps them warm during the frigid&lt;br/&gt;winters.  Their large paws are also furry and hit the ground&lt;br/&gt;with a spreading toe motion that makes them function as natural&lt;br/&gt;snowshoes.  Few still survive in Europe but those that do,&lt;br/&gt;like their Asian relatives, are typically larger than their North&lt;br/&gt;American counter part, the Canadian lynx.</groundspeak:long_description>

would least expect it. I found this one nearby my work. While very
close to urban areas, this location makes you feel as if you're in
a good sized forest. So, since there was plenty of room for it, I
placed an ammo box for you to find.
 Nothing tricky here. There is plenty
of parking nearby. I suggest parking at N35 43.921 W078 47.522
where you will find a trailhead. &lt;b&gt;PLEASE PARK
AT THE GIVEN PARKING COORDINATES and STAY ON THE PATH until it
ends! (Bushwhacking to the cache may cause the cache to need to be
archived. Please don't contribute towards losing this
cache.)&lt;/b&gt; It will take you to within 75 feet of the cache
and you will have an easy path to the cache from there. Please
rehide the cache as well as or better than you found it and enjoy
this area of calm amidst the busy city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKRECF - Parking coordinates&lt;br/&gt;N 35° 43.921 W 078° 47.522&lt;br/&gt;Parking coordinates</groundspeak:long_description>

Stumbled across this one while walking looking for it.  Cool little area - was hot enough I'm sure we could have cooked on the pavement.

One of the many we hit today from GW5.  I'm not sure I can say much in these logs a million others hitting the cache won't.

To commemorate the anniversary and to thank the valued geocachers that support OpenCaching.com, this cache was created and filled with various OpenCaching.com swag.  As swag material is depleted, it will be replenished. The cache is located in the natural area surrounding the Garmin office. Please use the nearby parking lot and do not park alongside the road when attempting this geocache.

This cache also highlights the use of Garmin chirp™ for those interested. While not required to find the cache, an extra hint is broadcast from this geocaching beacon to chirp-compatible devices. </groundspeak:long_description>

We started looking for the other cache that was nearby and after reading the other log comments decided that the Garmin sponsored one had to be easier. It was our first time out geocaching and not finding the &quot;easy&quot; one was a bit disheartening. Maybe this has been removed or stolen from the original hiding spot? I will post that the cache needs to attention from the owner...maybe they can provide some feedback.  If anyone else finds this cache please post a clue or email me: Danceswithpizzas@yahoo.com
Thanks and happy hunting!

If you find yourself a little tired about a quarter mile in from the slight uphill climb, you will be able to rest here and you are very close to your treasure.  Don’t get dizzy at the roundabout, and if you go through it, you’ve gone too far.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncgeocachers.org&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Cache:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multi-cache is located on NC State University's campus. It
is designed to take explicit advantage of the free &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/trans/transportation/wolfline/&quot;&gt;Wolfline
Bus System&lt;/a&gt;. The four star difficulty rating is based solely on
the time it takes to complete the cache, which should be
approximately 1.5-2.0 hours (hence Diddle-Daddle) and one or two
tricks which could lengthen the time. Everything is wheel-chair
accessible except for the final cache location. These Wolfline
buses run on schedules, so make sure to check the link above to see
that they are running on the day you wish to attempt the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to enjoy the scenery and views of campus as you ride
along on the buses!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need to Know:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to bring something to take notes and/or pictures.
&lt;b&gt;You will need to take sign information down from each stage (see
example below) to use in solving for the final stage
coordinates.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each stage you will need to pay attention to your
surroundings, in order to figure out the coordinates to the next
stage as well as the number of the bus to get you there. At some of
the stages there are signs in which you need to write down the
numeric information (include any letters as well). An example sign
can be seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--0svmphY26I/Td3T6_mlseI/AAAAAAAAAVc/wArU4iLTV3I/s640/photo.JPG&quot;&gt;
here&lt;/a&gt;. Note that there are no letters in this one, but the ones
you will encounter will (i.e. 2761 223K).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not end up at or very close to a bus stop for each
stage (excluding the final stage) then something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
N 35° 46.917'
W 78° 40.076'
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the location for the start of the multi-cache. This is
the Coliseum parking deck where you can park for a
&lt;strong&gt;fee&lt;/strong&gt; if you cannot find free parking anywhere
close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: (How many columns on the deck have red squares) x (3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B: How many of the columns appear to be made out of brick when
looking at the exit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: You should be looking at the deck from the posted
coordinates or on the side of the deck that aligns with cates road.
For B, you need to be at the exit of the deck (same side just
opposite entrance).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
N 35° 46.A42'
W 78° 40.2B9'
Walk  
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record the numeric information of the nearest sign, based on the
example given earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C: Add all of the individual digits of the sign together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D: How many flags are on the stadium entrance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E: Add the first two individual digits of the sign together.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
N 35° 47.D05'
W 78° 41.01E'
Bus #: C  
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two signs here. You need to record the numeric
information for the one across from the bus stop station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F: (How many dots per window pane at the bus station are there?)
divided by (How many benches are there in one bus station?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G: How many panes of glass are there per bus station?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 4:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
N 35° 46.F58'
W 78° 40.4G3'
Bus #: What does one and one make?  
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need to record any sign information at this
location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H: (Looking between the two buildings. How many windows are on
the wall, closest to the path, on the left building) divided by
(2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I: What's the answer to life the universe and everything. If you
don't know google it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The information for H may seem confusing when you get
there. Just remember it's the wall closest to the path between the
buildings.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 5:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
N 35° 46.3H1'
W 78° 40.I3'  
Walk
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record the numeric information of the nearest sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J: (The last digit of the dedication year of the closest
buidling) divided by (2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K: (The first digit of the number on the sign that does not
contain a letter) divided by (2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L: The digit closest to the letter on the sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: For these signs we basically have two pairs of numbers.
One that is with a letter and one that is not. The dedication year
of the building should be easily visible and noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 6:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
N 35° 46.9K2'
W 78° 40.L79'
Bus #: J  
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look familiar? Your journey is coming to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now Using The Three Collected Signs from previous stages,
Solve For The Final Stage Coordinates.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: From the sign that would come last alphabetically, add the
individual digits together (of both numbers) and repeat until you
have a single digit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N: From the sign that would come first alphabetically, subtract
the smaller # from the larger #. Now rearrange the digits in
ascending order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: For each sign, take the individual digits for each pair of
#'s and add them together. Then subtract the results from each
other for each sign. Of these, choose the smallest number. (i.e.
2761 223 =&amp;gt; 16 7 =&amp;gt; 16-7=9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Looking at all the numbers from all the signs. Multiply the
only two unique digits together and subtract 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: For sanity sake there is no Letter 'O&quot; to solve for. That
is a zero below!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Stage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
N 35° 4M.N'
W 78° 4P.0Q' 
Walk 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little luck you will find the ammo can that initially
contains the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log Book with NCSU Sustainability Pen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FTF GeoCoin (Prize, do not need to trade anything)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique NCSU Coins (Make sure to trade something in return).
Limit one per person please.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trackable Mr. Wolf whose mission is to visit as many college
campuses as possible!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misc. Pencils&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: You can check your &lt;b&gt;Final Stage&lt;/b&gt; solution with
GeoCheck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://geocheck.org/geo_inputchkcoord.php?gid=597034dc6f9730-3c9c-4578-ab82-d4483c89af99&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;









&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PK2WZ8V - GC2WZ8V Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 35° 46.917 W 078° 40.076&lt;br/&gt;These coordinates are for the start of the multi-cache.  It is also conveniently located at a parking deck for those who cannot find free parking near the coordinates.  Please note for the first stage this you will need to look at the exit on this side of the parking deck, just opposite of the entrance (which is where these coordinates are located).</groundspeak:long_description>

Don’t let the short distance fool you because it is all uphill.  You can still hear the faint sound of the waterfall, but this cache is nestled just out of sight of most park goers on a not so crowded day.  Although there is no dog, there is plenty of “bark” and “shedding”.  Watch out for spectators as this is a somewhat small park.  No need to try too late in the day because this park closes at sunset.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Since my wife and I started geocaching a couple of months ago
we've had quite a lot of fun. So, when her birthday came around, I
decided to hide her birthday presents (well, all of them except the
new GPSr) in a geocache. This cache is off some of the mountain
bike trails in Lake Crabtree County Park. You used to have to walk
about 400 feet off the trail to find it but with the new loop #6
it's now much closer to the trails (in fact, it was about 10 feet
or less from the new trail before I moved it!). It's a standard
rubbermaid container. Initially, I've seeded it with all kinds of
party favors, some GPSr candy (i.e. batteries) and a toy car (in
honor of our son). It's very well hidden and may take some
searching to find. In two times visiting the cache place, I got
very different GPSr readings, so some of the difficulty level is in
getting a good satellite lock. Please have fun seeking this
birthday cache, especially if it's your birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: When you re-hide this cache, please make sure to hide it
thoroughly with no portion of it showing. 
&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;No joke! There i was. Holding one of the althiometrist's
challege caches. Really didn't seem like much, but hey, they've
earned it. Earned it, i say! Each item i placed in it, i thought
about how long it had taken them to reach this milestone. Few
people had actually thought it would eventually happen. I wasn't
one of them, though. Very soon, i had thought. Each cache they did,
brought them closer and closer to the goal. Five star terrain and
five star difficulty, even. I should know, i was there. Vexing
puzzles? Easily handled. To get to this point, they had done their
share. We knew it. Once they got close, we started planning. This
was going to be a great challenge cache. We even made it into six
distinct caches. Only for the alethiometrists. For who else could
tackle such a challenge? I certainly wouldn't want to. Victims
though they would be, i wished them the best. Each cache that had
to do to reach the goal would present them with a challenge. Time
would tell if they were up to it or not. We wished them well.
Onward and upward!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, what else can i say about this cache. Seek it to find the
clue that will lead to the final cache. Each one of five caches
will provide a piece of the puzzle. Venture forth to find them all,
but beware! Evil-minded geocachers have planned this out. No
quarter will be given. Even easy puzzles may not be what they seem.
I certainly wouldn't want to solve them. Give me an easy ammo box
in the woods. Hide it under a tree. Take me there with easy clues.
Fix things so they're simple to find. Instead, what do they get?
Very hard puzzles. Each one different from the previous. Six in
total. I know what they'll need. X-ray vision. Once they can see
through walls, they'll be unstoppable. No, you don't think so? Even
i wouldn't hide a cache like that? Five star difficulty with
special equipment needed? Oh well, it's a nice thought. Until we
get real x-ray glasses, i guess that will have to wait. Rather an
interesting idea. Only a few more caches to go, now, though. Next
up, the big 1k! Excellent work to get this far,

Her sister had a birthday party this afternoon, so we went for a bike ride (with a few small hiking excursions).  She thought it was pretty cool when i pulled the cache out from under the leaves and opened it.  After looking at everything inside it, she noticed me signing the logbook with the pencil and forgot about everything else.  I let her write a little note in the book too and then managed to distract her with some food while i put it all back in the can.  As far as trades go, we dropped two TBs and a smashed penny and took one TB and an Alethiometrists signature magnet.  Great day to be out and about on the ATT (or anywhere, for that matter).

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The best selling book of all time is by far the Bible. With over
6 billion copies sold, it far outdwarfs anything else. What you may
not know, however, is that the Bible has something to say to
geocachers. Below, you will be given several verses or parts of
verses from the Bible that relate to geocaching (or at least I like
to think so!). You will need to figure out where in the Bible they
come from, specifically from what &lt;b&gt;chapter&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;verse&lt;/b&gt;.
You can then use those numbers to figure out the correct
coordinates to this cache. Good luck and happy searching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_____ A:B - Can anyone hide in secret places so that I cannot
see him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_____ C:D - It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing,
concealed even from the birds of the air.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_____ E:F - Are you wiser than Daniel? Is no secret hidden from
you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_____ G:H - He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what
lies in darkness,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_____ I:J - For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed,
and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the
open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_____ K:L - So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you;
seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to
you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the numbers from above and plug them into these
coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N 35 (F+G)(K-L).(I)(B-A)(C-J)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W 078 ((D-K)/2)(E-H).(H-J)(F)(B-D)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

multi-cache dedicated to baseball and all other sporting pastimes.
On this geocache, you will have the opportunity to hit for the
cycle as you go for a single, a double, a triple and a home run. I
hope you’ll have a lot of fun, but make sure you don’t end up with
a double and an error. Bring your good walking shoes as your entire
trek will take over more than a mile of terrain on the southern
Durham part of the American Tobacco Trail. The coordinates above
will help you hit a single. Each successive micro cache will help
you hit a double, triple, and finally lead you to a home run, an
ammo box full of sports related items. None of the sections require
much bushwacking so stay on the trial as much as possible.

First i told her the ducky (Daffy Duck) was going to give her something.  Then all along the way it was &quot;the ducky wants to give me something else&quot;.  Clever clever on the &quot;error&quot;.  Took a while to find the real triple, too.  The home run was no problem after we got the rest of them.  Took a bouncy green ball and left a Hello Kitty sticker book.  Also grabbed the oddly-named (given the attached tractor) &quot;Dan&quot; the travel bug.</groundspeak:text>

--Luther Hodges, Governor, NC 1956-1960&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
RTP was developed more than forty years ago by the Research
Triangle Foundation using no state or federal money. In the 1950s
many graduates of the three major nearby universities had to leave
the state to find good paying jobs. By creating a research park
located between the universities, it was hoped that this trend
could be reversed.&lt;br/&gt;

This log-only micro is hidden near a small plaza commemorating the
history of RTP. Parking is available nearby. Please take care to be

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The city of Durham has had a baseball team since 1902 and has
used the name Bulls since 1913. The story goes that the reason the
place baseball pitchers warm up is called a &quot;bullpen&quot; is because of
the many advertisements for Bull Durham Tobacco placed behind them.
It wasn't until 1988, though, with the movie Bull Durham, that the
local team gained worldwide attention. As part of the movie, which
was shot in Durham, the producers set up a large snorting bull.
Smoke came from his nostrils whenever a player hit a home run. On
the bull was written the words, &quot;Hit Bull, Win Steak.&quot; On the
grassy field beneath it was written, &quot;Hit Grass, Win Salad.&quot; When
the movie was finished, the sign was left behind at the Durham
Athletic Park. Several years later, when the Bulls moved into a new
stadium (the Durham Bulls Athletic Park), they brought the bull
with them and then replaced it with a bigger one when they achieved
Triple-A status. Today, the bull still snorts smoke when a player
hits a home run and any player hitting the bull is treated to a
free steak at the nearby Marriot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're looking for a 35mm film cannister placed nearby (although
possibly out of sight from) this bull. Feel free to walk over and
see the stadium after finding it. If a game is in progress you
should be able to see part of it through the bars. Also go walk
through the nearby American Tobacco Campus. At one time Durham was
the tobacco capital of the world and these renovated tobacco
warehouses are well worth the visit.&lt;/p&gt;

I have been in this area MANY times but haven't had this waypoint in my GPS (except for the one time when people were digging up the road RIGHT THERE).  Today my 3.5 y.o. daughter came with me to find the cache while her sister and mother relaxed in the AT campus.  She came even knowing it was just going to be a &quot;sign your name&quot; one, but what do you know there was a bouncy ball in it.  The log was wet, so in trade for the bouncy ball we left a new log in a tiny ziploc (the original log is there too...it's actually just damp and i was &quot;sort of&quot; able to sign it before i thought of leaving a new one).</groundspeak:text>

houses fine shopping and dining. My wife and I like it so much we
tend to come here once or twice a week. After the recent
renovation, I couldn't resist placing a micro here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for an extremely small micro cache. Please be
EXTREMELY discreet while searching. You
may need a toothpick or something similar to retrieve the log after
you find the cache. Also, make sure to bring your own fine point
pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please enjoy the cache and take some time to sample a local
restuarant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; My wife pointed out to me the other day that this
cache has just over a 50% find rate, so based on that, I'm bumping
up the difficulty to a 3. If you have trouble finding this cache,
don't despair. I will give hints &lt;b&gt;IF&lt;/b&gt; you have already tried
to find it on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2nd Update:&lt;/b&gt;This cache does NOT require you to disturb
anything. It can be found without digging, pulling anything out, or
removing anything. Disturbing the area excessively fosters a poor
image of geocaching. Please cache responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Marshall, Will and Holly
On a routine expedition 
Met the greatest earthquake ever known 
High on the rapids It struck their tiny raft (insert screams here)
And plunged them down a thousand feet below 
To the Land of the Lost
To the Land of the Lost
To the Land of the Lost  ….

Remember the little raft superimposed over the trickling rivulet of tap water? How about the spongy dinosaurs with big pink tongues? The Sleestaks hissing with their big boggly eyes and stubby tails? The little Sasquatch-lookin’ people that stole the four foot long carrots off the cart pulled by the baby brontosaurus? No? Where were you in the 70’s? Under a rock … on the moon … with your fingers in your ears? C’mon! It’s Land of the Lost, man. It was HAP’n’in’ on Saturday mornings. Right before Superfriends and Scooby-Doo, man.  Every little boy wanted to take on Grumpy and Alice with a big sharp stick and every little girl wanted to grow up and marry Will.  I spent many a thirty minutes curled up on the couch, hiding under a blanket, terrified of the Sleestaks but unable to tear my eyes from the drama unfolding on the screen.  My husband reminisced about it, saying “I used to get up at six am every Saturday. It was my best show.”

Hopefully enough of you remember it to make this a fond little stop in a day’s caching. If you are unfamiliar with the show there are some photos in the cache as well as plenty of information online at LandoftheLost.com. And for all, the location of the cache should give a BIG indication about the show’s content!

This cache has been placed because I love my husband, Rampantbear, and one of the things I love the most about him is his ability to still tap into his childhood, to get excited about the little things, to remember with fondness and sentimentality the joys of youth and snatch those feelings up into the present. (When we subscribed to Netflix the full run of Land of the Lost was the first thing he ordered and he watched each episode in rapt attention. –While I, at 38, hid under the covers, STILL afraid of Sleestaks!)

We are stocking the cache with Dino-goodies but as you discover it please feel free to trade whatever you have with you – when you are in the Land of the Lost you never know what will come in handy!

After winter strips the trees of there leafs, leaving everything dreary, mother nature can grace us with a fresh blanket of snow to paint a landscape no master can duplicate with a paintbrush. There's nothing like a crisp walk in the fresh fallen snow, followed by a cup of hot cocoa by a blazing fire. Or the snowmen, each one different from the other. Finish the day with a moonlight walk, all sound dampened by the snow. There's something about a clear sky at night with a fresh blanket of snow on the ground that makes the stars shine brighter.
What does this have to do with a cache you might ask? Why, it's snowing!</groundspeak:long_description>

This Cache is in honor of Bugger Cat, who was lost in the fire, I
never saw a cat that acted like a lap dog before, but He loved to
share my recliner with me, just like a dog. Bugger Cat also loved
to lay in the window and watch outside, so if he was still around,
he'd be watching you. One thing we like is to have company, so if
we see you we will say &quot;Hi&quot; This cache is located at the end of our
driveway, so please, NO NIGHT CATCHING. This Cache was placed with
the help of my Church Youth Group.

To acknowledge the creator of such fine caches as the JLESF series (including the horribly difficult JLESF #8 Depressed), the Coin Cache Series, the Geocacher's Dream series, and many eclectic micros like The Eclectic Micro, this absolutely had to be a multistage cache.  Some containers will be familiar and others won't.  It will take all of your geocaching skills to not get bucked off this cache.  In addition, since these cachers are known for their first to finds (over 100 already!), and this one is being given to them first, it's appropriate that no one even has a chance to find it before they do.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So, get your riding boots on, saddle up, and let's go.  Here's what you'll need.  A full tank of gas, a full feed bag of oats, sunglasses, blinders, riding crops, three saddles, a shetland pony, current road and riding trail maps of North Carolina and the entire southeast, flashlights, a heavy duty portable generator with 400 feet of extension cord, 50 feet of climbing rope, a lasso, six juggling clubs (or jugglings torches if you prefer), bridle, halter, duct tape, two GPS receivers, a snorkel, crutches, a ladder, a telescope, a high powered lantern, four FRS radios, walking sticks, a saddle blanket, a satellite phone with camera capability, a mirror, two different kinds of compasses (magnetic and geometric), one medium rubber band, 10 q-tips, a box of kleenex, painkillers, a dozen straws, two dowels (at least 3 feet long), a roomba, a Leatherman multi-tool, a roll of paper towels, a sling shot, a first aid kit, an atomic clock, a chariot (on fire if you wish), a hard hat, safety glasse, a lariat, a bullwhip, a cowboy hat, a sulky, and a pogo stick.  All you need is your GPSrs, and the ability to think outside the box.  Be sure your health insurance is up to date.  Bring extra casts, plenty of water, your best hiking boots, bug spray, tecnu, a canoe, and hip waders.  This cache will take time and you may have to make several attempts.  Each hide is progressively harder than the one before it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
All stages are micros except the last one.  Keep at it and you'll be able to ride into the sunset to the final ammo box.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Break a leg!
&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Stage 1: Micros in the woods are a hole lot of fun.
Stage 2: The low-down on the parking situation
Stage 3: Peek-a-boo
Stage 4: The BARK is worse than the bite, as long as you don't stray too far from the path.
Stage 5: Go North!
Stage 6: What, you can't find an ammo box in the woods?</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Recommend looking for this cache in the early morning during a week-end. During the day, it's a high traffic area and people everywhere. If you need to take a break, there is a picnic table across from the site where you can read and scope out the area. Congratulations!!! To Team.Hepler for FTF!!

A view of the tails is something to see. At the site, you will find yourself near a center of academic administration. The tails are part of the larger Charlottesville Art in Place (visit link) This cache is designed to bring attention to the effort of community culture in C'Ville. The three whale tails are the replacement to the single whale tail broken by a micro burst in Summer of 2010.

Once you find the cache, take time to check out the Art in Place. Take caution in crossing roads and bridges. The cache location is designed to provide a safe park and then walk location.</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache is in small lock-n-lock...Please hide the container exactly as found so others may join in on the fun! ...BRING PEN.. 

 Initial contents contain log, a usb thumb drive for FTF and travel bug . There is room for small TB and/or geocoins. I did not have a short pen/pencil with me so make sure to bring something to sign log with and enjoy the trek!!!!!!

Congrats to Arctic fox75 and Buck1975 on FTF!!!!!!!!

The Story of Berkeley Springs;
Berkeley Springs, a fountainhead of warm mineral waters frequented by Native Americans long before Europeans arrived in the New World, are at the heart of a mountain spa community in West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle. 

First noted as Medicine Springs in 1747 on a map drawn by Thomas Jefferson's father, the waters for many centuries have drawn visitors seeking health and relief from the stress of everyday life.
 
In 1776, George Washington's family and friends drew up a plat of 134 lots, named the streets, and incorporated The Town of Bath, invoking the muses of the renowned English spa. See : (GC1JXRW -- Four Corners of History) 

Yet the magic of the springs prevailed, and the town and surrounding area are known by their name -- Berkeley Springs. 

The waters flow at a constant 74°F from the base of Warm Springs Ridge. You may still drink freely and fill your jugs at Lord Fairfax's public tap, and wade in the ancient stone pools in the nation's smallest state park. See: (GCP2GB -Berkeley's Soothing Springs) 

The town has endured cycles of notoriety, fashion, war and modern progress, but remains the Country's First Spa, a quiet, friendly haven surrounded by West Virginia's splendid outdoors.


You will find this cache as you enter or leave Berkeley Springs from the North. This unique cache is not at the Welcome Sign but close by with plenty of parking and away from busy Route 522. As always when near traffic areas, Please keep an eye on your children. 

In this small cache you will find a log, stash note, writing utensil and some swag. It has room for small geo coins and TB’s with smaller Hitchhikers.

** Congratulations to GR8caches and TwoLovies for the FTF **

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Staplebend Tunnel was constructed in 1834 for the Allegheny
Portage Railroad as the first railroad tunnel in the United States.

It has been restored by the National Park Service and was opened
for public use in 2001. More information is available at
http://www.nps.gov/alpo/sbt.htm.

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site, and
the 2.5 mile mostly rail-trail access from the community of Mineral
Point, are maintained by the National Park Service as a National
Historic Site. The initial point of this multi-cache is a virtual
and consists of two display plaques at the southern end of the
tunnel. These final plaques, along with others that you will pass
along the way between the parking area and the tunnel, provide the
keys to the coordinates of the second and final cache. That site is
a physical cache located outside of the Park boundaries. Parking
and restrooms are available at &lt;b&gt;N40-22.583, W78-50.175&lt;/b&gt;. Dogs
and bikes are permitted on the trail but dogs must be on a 6 foot
max leash, and bikes must be walked through the tunnel. Bring a
flashlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the
final two, &lt;b&gt;the clues are NOT necessarily in an order&lt;/b&gt; that
coincides with the plaques that you come across along the way, so
read them all thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache
coordinates are  &lt;b&gt;N40-21.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;jft&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,
W78-51.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;nrd&lt;/b&gt;
,
where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___________
(i&lt;b&gt;j&lt;/b&gt;
)
maximum speed of the passenger trains,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___________
(klm&lt;b&gt;n&lt;/b&gt;
)
is the year the Pennsylvania Railroad crossed the
mountains,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___________
(q&lt;b&gt;r&lt;/b&gt;
) #
of years the Allegheny Portage Railroad was in
operation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___________
( s
&lt;b&gt;t&lt;/b&gt; ) length of Allegheny Portage Railroad in miles.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___________
(e&lt;b&gt;f&lt;/b&gt;
g)
is the length of the tunnel,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
final clue is on the plaques at the posted
coordinates&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___________
(abc&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;
)
is the year that the facility shown in the photo at the bottom
center of the right plaque (at the listed virtual location) was
built,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
As with any caches, the &lt;b&gt;clues should not direct you to final
coordinates that are on NPS property or active railroads&lt;/b&gt;. 
Your final coordinates for this cache should be within 0.1 mile of
the virtual site and should not take you back through the tunnel or
over any rivers. 
Please completely conceal the cache when finished, it has been
muggled previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site of
posted coordinates is ADA accessible. The final site is not ADA
accessible. Therefore, we will make the posted coordinates a
virtual find provided you email (do NOT post) the clue answers
along with your interpretation of the purpose of the large concrete
structure located at the posted coordinates (its not on the
plaques).&lt;/p&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

You really need some stealth for this one. But it should not be too hard to get to. The container is a key holder so there is not much room. Bring something to write with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck and enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to BMXPOP and BMXKID on the FTF!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I placed this cache in a down pour. If you find it, could you please double check the cords and let me know. Thanks

&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Our caching friends kimchee&amp;smartykatt have found
their 1000th find and to celebrate, I decided to put out a multi
just to have some fun and take you back to some familiar places.We
have been on some wild adventures together and they have sent us
out on some wild ones too.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Yes you will have to bushwack. Safety glasses maybe
required&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Yes you may get wet. Waterproof boots maybe
needed&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Yes you may get muggled.Stealth is a must&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Yes you will curse me out for it.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;But in the end it is worth it.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The first 2 stages you will be looking for matchstick containers
with cords inside to the next stage. Don't worry, they will not be
hard to spot, just a pain to get to. The final is a gold ammo
can.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please use stealth,
it is a must, especially at the
final&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please allow time for kimchee&amp;smartykatt to get the

On warm Summer Saturday nights this place is buzzing. You will know why once you come to find it. But Saturday nights would not be a good time to come a looking as you will get muggled severely. I have been given permission from the owner to place this cache. And some given Saturday nights you just might find me here helping out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can park along the road or in the dirt area and climb the bank. Do not go in the gate, even if it is open unless you are here for what goes on here, but like I said, when the event is going on, it would not be a good time to get the cache. And Friday nights is when the crew is getting the area ready, so be cautious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the checkered FTF flag goes to jodi_goob! Way to go!

But decided it needed a much bigger&lt;br/&gt;container. My brain started to think. I came up with it...A puzzle&lt;br/&gt;cache. Now this is one of the easiest puzzles that I have seen. It&lt;br/&gt;is so easy, it shouldn't be a puzzle. But evil side of me said &quot;Go&lt;br/&gt;for it!&quot;. So here it is. My puzzle cache. For those who have been&lt;br/&gt;here before, you will know where to look for your clue. Everyone&lt;br/&gt;else...(see hint)(seriously...check out the hint) Basically I&lt;br/&gt;wanted you the finder to feel a little more comfortable about&lt;br/&gt;looking for a cache in a yard. So I made it very easy. Also, the&lt;br/&gt;container is big enough to hold most TB's and coins. There is a&lt;br/&gt;seperate container inside for TB's and coins. If the TB's you are&lt;br/&gt;dropping off are too big, just place it somewhere in the container.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ATTENTION: PLEASE DO NOT PARK ON THE ROAD NEXT TO THE CACHE. I live on a blind turn. Use the parking cords that I have provided so as not to park in my neighbors drive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF - Congrats to the CARELS! Way to go! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't mind the dogs if they are out.

honor Mailbrat for finding his 1000th
find..&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Our caching friend Mailbrat has found his 1000th cache.
To celebrate, this gold ammo can has been placed for all to
find.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This cache should not be too hard. It is located on
state game lands, so be sure to wear your orange.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;As with most 1K caches, please allow time for Mailbrat
to get FTF.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There is a FTF prize for the first person after Mailbrat.</groundspeak:long_description>

With me helping I think we came&lt;br/&gt;up with a pretty good spot. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please come visit Chris and his new home. It has a lovely view,&lt;br/&gt;especially in the fall. Might want to bring some binoculars. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need to bring your own writing utensil, as Chris does not&lt;br/&gt;have any. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch for muggles driving by. There is a small pull off big&lt;br/&gt;enough for one car. This cache maybe very hard to get in the&lt;br/&gt;winter. Do NOT mess around the building near.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Fatwalker on the FTF!&lt;/p&gt;

For awhile I have been tryin to come up with a pretty good hide. Then an idea finally came to mind. But instead of just a find, this was going to be a multi. While scouting it all out, I found a Benchmark. The odd part about this one BM is, I can not find it in the BM database. The cords for the BM are in the final stage log book, right at the front of the book. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 2 stage multi with the 2nd stage being the final. You can drive to each stage or walk to them, they are not that far apart. The first stage is a small micro tube with the cords inside. The road that the first stage of the cache is on, is not bad, but taking a car down it may be doing so at your own risk. Winter maintenance is minimal or not at all, not sure. You may see another car once in a while but then again you may not. Also this is a hunted area, so please wear orange during hunting seasons. There is also a couple of paths up the dirt roads that you could go for a walk on. The dirt road will lead you out to Mountain Run Road near Camp Mountain Run.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun!

My father showed me this place when I was very young and was always amazed by it everytime I came here. There is lots of wildlife around, you never know what you may see. As the roads leading in are very rough and muddy, you may need 4wd or an ATV. I would not suggest taking a car with little clearance on these roads. Jeeperseekers were with me when I placed this, as they are new and wanted to see how it was done.&lt;br/&gt; This particular area is the Whetstone Reservoir #2. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be sure to wear orange during hunting seasons as this area is highly hunted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to PureEvil110 on the FTF!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a nice little area to fish or swim. The cache is hidden near North Fork. From what I am told, my wife's uncles and cousins used to jump off the bridge into the water. Can't really do that anymore as the water is not deep anymore under the bridge. They have also gone tubing too, just gotta pick a day that has a little more water. I have gone fishing down here and caught a couple nice sized ones. They all hunt down here during hunting season, so be careful and wear your orange. It does flood down here once in awhile, so be cautious. I did make the container so it would not float away, so it should be there no matter what (but you never know). My wife's family's camp is near, so you may be muggled (but it is ok). The hunting camp actually used to be where the old chimney stands, but it got washed away. Please be respectful of the property. If anything happens that should not, I will be forced to delete this cache. The road can be very rough on the way down. If you take a car, drive slow. Also, there is no cell phone signal down here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring something to write with. Container is about the size of a handheld GPS, so small trades items are good. Be sure the lid is closed tightly to help keep most of the water out. Be cautious of rattlesnakes (they are down here). The difficulty of 3 is for the drive down in as the road is not maintained very well (no winter maint). The actual area is about a 1.5 - 2. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please replace the cache just as you found it so it does not get muggled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Smoky Bear 1 on the FTF!

Thought it was pretty cool that there was once a cache here and figured it would be good to keep it going. From the info I got from the Street, this rock carving was done by a local guy. It sure is really cool looking.&lt;br/&gt;The cache is hidden near by. It is a thin ammo can. Good place for a CITO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the summer, be very careful of snakes! Also, it may be hard to get some exact cords at times, especially when there are leaves on the trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to happydancer123 for the FTF, and welcome back!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck!!!

You could find this cache while getting the caches on the way to and at Devil's Den.  A trail to the cache is located just across the stream from N 41 23.813 W 078 44.733 behind the Elk's Camp.  You could also bushwhack very easily from this cache to the trail that leads to Devil's Den from the Elk's Camp or vice verse.  This is the most used route to Devil's Den.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a clear 35mm film canister and contains a log. Please hide this as you found it because this spot sees a lot of traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope that you enjoy this beautiful location&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to Guitardudev for the FTF.

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

This cache is about 3 miles south of Gibbs Hill Road on the NCT.   </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When built in 1882, the Kinzua Viaduct was the highest railroad bridge in the world. It was constructed as an alternative to laying an additional eight miles of track over rough terrain along the line leading to McKean County’s coal, timber and oil lands. Built of iron, the original viaduct was 301 feet high, 2,053 feet long, and weighed 3,105,000 pounds. By 1900, it became necessary to rebuild the entire structure with steel to accommodate heavier trains. That May, about 100 to 150 men working ten-hour days completed the job in 105 days. The new steel viaduct had the same measurements, but now weighed 6,715,000 pounds. Freight traffic discontinued in June of 1959. In 1963, Governor William Scranton signed a law that created Kinzua Bridge State Park. The park officially opened in 1970. In 1977, Kinzua Viaduct received national recognition when it was placed on the National Register of Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks.
On Monday, July 21, 2003, at approximately 3:15 p.m., an F1 tornado (wind speed 73 – 112 mph) struck the side of Kinzua Viaduct. Eleven towers from the center of the bridge were torn from their concrete bases and thrown to the valley floor. Fortunately no one was seriously injured.
Don't miss the bridge overlook, it gives great views of the viaduct and the Kinzua Creek Valley. The picnic area has shaded picnic tables, water and a modern restroom. Easy access to cache, please use stealth during park activities.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another find on day number two of our three day caching adventure in McKean, Potter, Cameron and Elk Counties.  We ran into the fence problem and were really dissapointed because this was going to be one of the highlights of our trip.  We went and tried the earthcache.  Hopefully I can find the answers for that online since I was able to get a picture from one of the viewing platforms.  When we returned to the parking lot, there was a DCNR maintenance worker there.  I told him of our predicament and he told us he knew where the cache was located and how we could access it.  I guess cache grabbers did it the right way because that's exactly what he told us.

He also told us that the fence went up about three weeks ago so I'm surprised no other cachers mentioned it in their logs.  The project is supposed to take a year or more and it sounds like it's going to be a big improvement for the park.  I think you're correct in disabling it since that's not an ideal way to approach it and you miss out on the bridge experience.  Thanks for McKean County stamp number twelve and AGT- number 103.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My dog &quot;Bear&quot; and I were caching through north central PA this weekend working on the AGT, and this was one of the caches on the list.  This was a popular spot!  A group of bikers from down in my area was at the overlook taking pictures.  Found out they were from Perry County, and one of them works in my home town of Mechanicsburg.  After a little chat and some picture taking of my own I headed off to find the cache.  Two other cachers were just returning from signing the log when I started into the woods.  Found quickly and signed and stamped my passport.   I'd always wanted to see the bridge, but never took the time to do it.  Thanks for putting a cache here!  </groundspeak:text>

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The North Country National Scenic Trail Geotrail (NCTGT) is a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association (NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A slimy salamander and a redback salamander were both watching over this spot!&lt;/p&gt;

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Tidewater Pipe Co. was formed in 1878 to attempt to transport crude in the first oil pipeline 109 miles across the mountainous terrain to Williamsport, Pa. The construction of the pipeline ranks as one of the all-time great achievements in the annals of oil exploration. 
This is the approximate site of Pump Station #1 on the Tidewater pipeline. On May 28 1879, the 80-horsepower pumps located in Coryville sent an oil flow of 250 barrels an hour through a 6 inch pipeline across the mountains and ultimately into Williamsport on June 4th. The Tidewater Pipe Company sucessfully destroyed the Standard Oil Company's (John D. Rockefeller) monopoly on oil transportation by rail.

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The North Country National Scenic Trail Geotrail (NCTGT) is a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association (NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Cobb's Blue Loop Trail and a campsite on the top of the hill were built in 1999 by members of the Foothills Trail Club of Buffalo and the Finger Lakes Trail Conference.  Bog bridging along this trail was constructed by the Boy Scouts troop from Lancaster and the Girl Scouts troop from Franklinville.  In 2002, a bridge was constructed, through funding from the National Park Service, over Devereaux Creek.  Very descriptive wooden signs have also been placed along the trail at both intersections with the Finger Lakes/North Country Trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is not located at the listed coordinates.  To obtain the coordinates for the geocache, you must first find the &quot;Cobb's 45 - Latitude&quot; and &quot;Cobb's 45 - Longitude&quot; geocaches.  In &quot;Cobb's 45 - Latitude&quot; geocache you will find the latitude for this cache written on the log book and the cover of the geocache container.  In &quot;Cobb's 45 - Longitude&quot; geocache, you will find the longitude for this cache also written on the log book and the cover of the geocache container.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After finding &quot;Cobb's 45 - Longitude&quot; you will have the final coordinates and need to continue following the blue blazes which will eventually lead you to the bottom of the hill.  This series of caches is set up to take you on a hike of the entire loop trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the hunt.  The Finger Lakes Trail Conference has granted permission to have this cache placed here and has selected the location for the cache and the &quot;Latitude&quot; and &quot;Longitude&quot; geocaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have a nice hike.  This is a great section of trail in a very beautiful piece of woods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Finger Lakes Trail Conference has requested that no one attempt to find this geocache from November 15th - December 15th.  They allow this area to be hunted and shut it down to all other activities during this time.

Park Approval #LSP-17

Park Hrs. are 6am to 11pm daily Park entrance fee may apply

This is my first attempt at hiding a cache so let me know what you think. The cache is located in scenic Letchworth State Park. At the location of the cache there is a beautiful view of the iron railroad bridge that crosses the Genesee valley above the upper falls. Depending on what time of year you visit this area, the bridge can usually be seen through the trees. I chose this spot to place the cache because it is a mysterious area. The forest is quite open and very old. Not too far from the cache spot is a tree called the “Jungie” tree. Iroquois legend tells us that the “Jungies are an ancient race of little people who inhabit the land and are rarely seen by humans. Their handy work though proves their existence, for you see, their job is to be the caretakers of the streams and rivers, the forests, and the stones. Close by the cache location you may notice a tree that appears to have a moat around it. It is believed that this ring around the tree was formed by the “Jungies” dancing around the tree when there is no one there to observe them. I can offer no better explanation. When you get close to the area of the cache you may want to try to find an opening in the trees to get your best GPS signal and let it settle in before attempting to make the find. There is a spot not too far away from the cache where you can get a good signal and the arrow should point right to the spot.

Good Luck!

Park at the Council Grounds N42 35.183 W078 02.625 to start your journey.

The cache is a standard 30 cal ammo can that is painted dark green with black highlights. The clue I am giving should prove to be quite helpful.

Please try to conceal this as neatly as possible after you have found it so as not to give away its location too easily to the next cacher.

Once you return back to the parking lot take time to explore the newly renovated Council Grounds before you leave the area. In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the gift of Letchworth State Park to the State of New York by W.P. Letchworth, the council grounds have been restored to the appearance they had in the time when Mr. Letchworth lived there.

This cache will take you on a pleasant nature walk on the old Rochester and Southern railway track bed. This rail bed divides a large marsh literally in two and provide the hiker with a beautiful view of the plants and animals that inhabit this area.

Tracks were first laid here in 1878 by the newly chartered Rochester and State Line Railroad. After 3 short years the line becomes the Rochester and Pittsburg Railroad. 10 years later the Genesee &amp; Wyoming Valley Railway is incorporated. In 1899 the name is changed into the Genesee &amp; Wyoming Railway. Eventually the rail line is consumed by the Baltimore and Ohio (B&amp;O) which eventually becomes part of the Chessie System. Many other changes occur in the next few years as Railroads go through some hard times. Finally in 1991 the route from Silver Springs south to Salamanca is abandoned and the tracks are torn up. Today these abandoned rail beds offer a nice path through some very remote country sides and they are enjoyed by 4 wheelers and snowmobilers as well as hikers.

There is nothing all that special about the cache hide, it is placed there to get you to see this beautiful and scenic area. I would highly recommend bringing along your camera because I can guarantee you will see a lot of wildlife and beautiful plants that grow in the marsh. When I was placing this cache a Doe and her twin fawns stood a short distance away observing me. The sounds of the marsh are intoxicating and the birdlife is abundant. The journey from the parking area to the cache is about .35 miles and is flat and straight. While visiting this area you might want to give &quot;Bridges in the Boondocks&quot; (Dedicated to CBG) (GC2C0R5) a try to see the large marshy area that that cache will take you through. I do not recommend doing this cache at night because you will miss the scenic views this cache has to offer. I hope you enjoy your visit to this special place!</groundspeak:long_description>

i moved the difficulty over 3 because two people attempted this and could not find it.  the title of the cache is a good hint. might want to wikipedia the word and think about how it might relate to hiding a cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

Lake Scugog is a lake in Scugog Township near the town of Port
Perry, Ontario. The lake has an area of 514 km² with an average
depth of 1.3 m. The lake is fed by the Nonquon and Layton Rivers
and drained by the Scugog River. The depth of the lake has become
more shallow over the past century as development around the lake
has removed most of its forest cover, allowing it to fill with
silt. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The lake was formed when William Purdy dammed the Scugog River at
Lindsay, Ontario in 1834 to power his grist mill. The new lake was
originally very unpopular with the local residents; its formation
also destroyed the wild rice stands and cranberries harvested by
the native Mississaugas. Today, the lake is used for fishing and
recreational boating. The lake is surrounded by swamps and marshes
which provide habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The name &quot;Scugog&quot; is an Ojibwe word meaning &quot;marshy waters&quot;.</groundspeak:long_description>

brother's dog (a.k.a The Mutt)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; While visiting the Hooligan family for
Easter, my brother (the Head Hooligan) and I were discussing the
lack of caches in the area that he has not found or placed himself.
I decided that I would put out a cache for him before we headed
home.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The next day, our two families went out for a hike minus him, as he
had to work. The littlest Hooligans had run out of steam by the
time we finished the Googly series, so they headed back, and the
mutt and I headed further down the trail, and found this rather
good hiding spot.&lt;br/&gt;

 I decided to put thsi on out while in the area on a little weekend family vacation. It is in a great area to watch nature. When I was placing this cache I was visited by a group of about 10-12 deer. What a pleasing sight! I nice quick cache to do while visiting the area. Hope you enjoy the walk in nature as much as I did..... maybe you can the two others nearby that I have placed while in the area. 
Happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache is a camo'ed water bottle located halfway along the portage between Ernest Lake and Brandy Falls on Gun Lake. 

You'll need a canoe to get to this one hence the 5 terrain, the portage itself is a 2 terrain at most.

I decided to paddle out on one of my favourite lakes and just go with the flow and see where it takes me. After 2 two portages and a wonderful encounter with a moose and her 2 calves I wound up on Knife Lake where a freak thunderstorm drove me to shore and set up a shelter with my canoe. 
So here I was, just me and about two million mosquitoes and deer flies sitting under an upside down canoe waiting out the rain for 2hrs. I had planned to make Jean Lake before days end it but it wasn't meant to be. 
Despite the rain and insects it was a good day on the water. So to mark the end of the day I left a cache at the head of the Jean Lake portage near the site of my temporary rain shelter.


Maybe next time I'll make Jean Lake or maybe just see where fate takes me.


May your paddles bring you just as many pleasures.

I forgot to leave a pencil in the cache so BYOP

You can drive your boat down to waters edge at this access point
and it also has &quot;facilities&quot;. You can find the access point at N45
14.753 W078 47.690 The driveway can be reached from Kawagama Lake

and canoeing and the fishing shows some potential as well. The
cache is on the Haliburton Highlands Water Trail and near one of
the on shore campsites. You can also access Rocky Wilderness GC1613
by just paddling a little further into Ernest Lake (no portage
required) A two for one special! If you decide to go on there is a

there just aren't enough of them. Terrain on this one is steep, but
the view is worth it. Be careful as there are some steep drops in
the area.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 
Flowing out of Kawagama Lake is the Hollow river, tucked away from
Haliburton Road #8 is a small set of falls. The cache is located
near those falls. There is limited parking at the staging area
located at N45° 15.396 W078° 51.503. Please be careful as the slope
can be slippery at times and its a long quick ride to the bottom.
Best route is to go up the rockface to the trail on top and then
back down to the cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 The Cache is in a standard Rubbermaid container and contains the
following:&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located in Algonquin Provincial Park, on Tea Lake. It can be
accessed from either the Tea Lake dam picnic area, or the Tea Lake
campground depending on how much paddling you want to do... if you
feel really adventerous you could even rent your canoe from the
portage store on canoe lake and paddle all the way to the cache
=)

&lt;b&gt;Originally owned by:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=07ef8b4a-8043-4953-b9d6-7cba130e3085&quot;&gt;
Dave (Think), and Glenn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in Algonquin Provincial Park, in Ontario
Canada. A permit is required to use the park, and therefore one is
needed to access this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located on Tea Lake off highway sixty in the park.
For the short route you can start from the Tea Lake dam picnic
area, or for a longer route you can start from the beach at the Tea
Lake campground (or even longer route is from the portage store on
canoe lake, where you can rent canoes!). Either will work. It would
be a big mistake to try and walk to this cache, it must be accessed
by canoe, however since the lake is relativly small, it is an easy
paddle, and wind is rarely a problem here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &quot;Canoe routes of Algonquin park&quot; map would definately be a
good idea especially if you decide to approach this from one of the
two distant access points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original contents include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 AA batteries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Algonquin Park Post card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energizer Pocket Flashlight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire Starter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plastic water-tight match container&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waterproof Matches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toilet Paper =)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log and pens&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This is the first northern interior Algonquin Park cache originally
placed by Alex and Mike. It is an enjoyable half day canoe trip
including at least 1 portage. If you are lucky you might run into a
moose grazing on lilly pads on your trip. You must have a permit to
make this trip. If you are not staying on one of the car camping
sites or planning to find the cache on an overnight canoe trip you
need to have a day permit. You can get a permit from the Parks
office. It is in an A-frame building at the southern end of Canoe
Lake along Highway 60. If you don't own one, you can rent a canoe
from the Portage Store. It is under the restaurant and giftshop
near the docks. An Algonquin Canoe Routes map would also be
helpful, otherwise it is easy to get lost! Bring lots of water,
snacks and lunch. 
&lt;p&gt;The cache is in a clear plastic tupperware container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a good trip and Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Remember what the cache is called!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
