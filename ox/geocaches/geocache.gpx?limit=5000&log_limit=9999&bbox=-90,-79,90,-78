Access this cache from the street side only.&lt;br/&gt; If approaching from the beach side cross to street side using the access platforms.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A quick and easy cache to find, but a bit harder to actually get. Moderate to heavy muggle traffic here, be aware of muggles sitting on nearby balconies before attempting to retrieve.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Feel free to take a pink ribbon/pin (1 per person - no trade needed.)

Couldn't leave right away for this hide, as work and co-workers were shaming me.  Finally got on the road and was not too surprised that the area had been dug up.  Made the grab and saw the improvised log.  Replaced it with one I had as a spare.  All good to go.  Glad I didn't have to search too long to find this one as traffic was steady here at this time.

I have the back-up car with none of my geo-equipment in it, so I race home and get kitted up.  I am loaded for bear!  I’m ready for anything that comes my way.  Boots, knee and elbow pads, five flashlights, waterproof GPSr/Camera cases…last will and testament!  I totally deciphered the hint and looking at the map, I knew what was in store for me.  

Got to GZ and tried to be as quick and none conspicuous as possible in getting down to business.  Almost took the wrong fork, but a clue kept me on the right course…thanks Scott.  I couldn’t get over the graffiti down here, there are other people out there who are crazy, and not just geocachers.  Man the hike was brutal and a bit disconcerting when looking forward and back your flashlight beam just disappears into the abyss!  I had to take a couple of breathers along the way.  While you’re trudging to this cache, you have LOTS of time to ponder and doubt what and why exactly what you’re doing and second-guessing yourself every step of the way.  (By the way, you’re crushing many scrambling spiders on the way there).  I started to feel claustrophobic a little too.  I also started to think about striza’s tube ghost sighting and was starting to get a little paranoid.  I’m noticing no water splash marks or footprints on the way there, so I feeling hopeful about the FTF possibilities, although it wouldn’t be the first time at a cache that decemberinside was in and out and eating cornflakes when I thought I was FTF at a cache.

Finally made it to the cache site before I knew it.  I almost kept walking past it, I was so focused.  Fresh log…how nice!  Great hide.  Signed the log and steeled myself for the ordeal back.  I looked for a shortcut to escape my entombment, but the thought of be decapitated by some semi-truck quashed that idea.  Made my way back, half-expecting to meet someone coming the other way, but didn’t meet anyone.  I’m a bit surprised no one else is descending on this one.  I was never so happy to see daylight in my life as when I returned to the surface.  Great, great hide and experience.  I’ll never return here again.  Thanks for all of your imaginative work.

My legs were already sore from workouts, so this one put a bit of a hurt on me.  I did bring my camera but I am not sure how or where I would post my work.  Took pics, left a goofy-looking pic.  Thanks for the experience!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Yep, it was a mini-event.  Had three computers crash at my home so I got the notification late.  Saw Stiza's note so I knew the game was a foot.  Still, it wasn't too far from my home, so off I go.  Got the entrance, met Echo Six Charlie, and out pops...like two dozen cachers!  At least I was equiped for this one this time.  I just keep equipement in the car now.  This one was a work out.  Very creative, as are all of e6c's hides.  When I got back out, everyone was still there, waiting for some more cachers to show up.  We had a grand time talking caching!  What a great group of guys.  Nice to finally meet some of the more active cachers in Fay-town finally.  I'll be ready for the next one.  Congrats Stiza on the FTF.   Didn't bring my camera, based on the appearance of some of the guys exiting.  TNLNSL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Got the alert and watched the video and thought twice about this one.  Scared the begezzers out of me.  But I headed for it anyway, because it intrigued me.  No too surprised on how to access the cache entrance.  Thought about heading home to get somemore appropiate footwear for this one, but figured I didn't have enough time get back and snag it before being upstaged by decemberinside.  Doffed the shoes and headed in...yes it is dark and cold.  Got to GZ quicker than I thought I would.  Saw the cache and made a grab for it.  Now this is one of the more uncomfortable retrievals of all time for me.  My choices are stand low and freeze my feet or stand high and have my arches loose circulation.  Not easy.  Started trying to locate the cryptext clue but no matter how much I tried with my flashlight, I could find nothing.  Yes night may be easier to see the stars afterall.  Kept trying to enter an incorrect word from a I clue I gathered from the cache page.  I kept entering it backwards, staggard, and upside down.  I thought the capitalized word &quot;MANE&quot; ment something then, but now I know it means something else.  I'll give you a big hint, the word is not &quot;HORSE.&quot;  LOL!  

I was making a pretty comical picture I'm sure.  One flashlight on my hip, one In my mouth, balancing.  Couldn't reach my glasses, and worried about the rats running around.  Finally, after about 20 minutes, I just happened to move the letters and formed the beginning of a word and the light went on and I went with it.  The cache container was very tight and bound trying to get it apart.  I wasn't giving up and succeeded in opening it.  Logged and reasymbled it and as I was turning the tumblers I hear wet footsteps.  It's decemberinside of course.  I lucked out again.  He opened the cryptext much faster than I.  Looking at everything, I think the clue was right in front of my face the whole time.  Haste makes waste.  

Great, great cache.  Maybe one of the best in Fayetteville.  This one is going on my list.  E6c you can retire now.  It doesn't get any better than this.  Thanks for all of your work.  I totally enjoyed this one...kinda like a haunted house tour.  TNLNSL TFTC

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Rats, I got the alert for this one while finishing up watching the Christmas parade downtown today.  Then I had to go to lunch with the family.  When I got home my car in the driveway had a flat!  Changed the tire and dropped it off at the tire place...then I headed for the cache.  Of course, I was too late.  I get quite irked when the caches post less than a mile from my house and I either can't get them, or else I'm out of town.

I had some idea of what this cache required.  I've never done one before, but I've heard about them at geo-events.  So, I came prepared.  Easy find and retrieval.  E6c...you starting to make me angry, bogarting all of the cool containers!  Very nice hide.  One of the most unique in F'ville.  You might want to consider securing the cache with oversized, heavy duty cable times from some place like Northern Tools.  Also, you may consider painting the container to match the host, so as to give it a more finished less foreign industrial look. (I hope I'm not critiqueing to much, 'cuz the cache IS awesome.) Great job.  Very clever and I really enjoyed it.  I hope it lasts.  TNLNSL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

I pull up and see CV and Striza are in the back of their pickup trucks sunbathing, 'cuz the weather is so nice, and they want to laugh at anyone who shows up to hunt the cache.  As much as I like those guys, I hate seeing them already parked at a new cache when I arrive.  I just knew this one was too far to get to in a timely fashion on a Friday afternoon.  Even they were not the first.  DI made the grab and was already gone...he's not one to sit around and chit chat when there are caches being published.  They gave me an option for a quick dirty or a long clean route.  Being not to motivated I grabbed the clean one.  Another great hide.  This area could serve as a fall-out shelter for a year.  When I extract myself out of the cave, the CO, e6c, is also pointing and laughing at me too.  Always fun to have a pleasant conversation with those guys.  They are always so enthusiastic.  Decided to head out to some other caches just as some local residents were deciding to go to work panhandling the tourists.  Another great hide.  Someday you're going to run out of containers or colverts...I don't know which will come first.  TNLNSL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Dr. Willams&lt;br /&gt;is our principal, and Mrs. Wheeler is&lt;br /&gt;our vice principal.  There is almost 1,000 kids in our&lt;br /&gt;school!  Our school mascot is the lynx. Our teacher is&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Breyer, and this is his sixth year in Harnett county,&lt;br /&gt;and his second year at Overhills Elementary School.  Last year he taught&lt;br /&gt;5th grade. Mr. Breyer hikes&lt;br /&gt;a lot, and he loves geocaching.   Mr.Breyer is&lt;br /&gt;so funny, because he is always making jokes.  He likes his new&lt;br /&gt;year in 3rdgrade!  He always wears ties and long&lt;br /&gt;shirts.  He is the nicest teacher in the&lt;br /&gt;world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Our&lt;br /&gt;Mascot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lynx is a solitary cat that haunts the remote&lt;br /&gt;northern forest of North America, Europe, and&lt;br /&gt;Asia.  Lynx are covered&lt;br /&gt;with beautiful thick fur that keeps them warm during the frigid&lt;br /&gt;winters.  Their large paws are also furry and hit the ground&lt;br /&gt;with a spreading toe motion that makes them function as natural&lt;br /&gt;snowshoes.  Few still survive in Europe but those that do,&lt;br /&gt;like their Asian relatives, are typically larger than their North&lt;br /&gt;American counter part, the Canadian lynx.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Every now and then, you come across an area of calm where you
would least expect it. I found this one nearby my work. While very
close to urban areas, this location makes you feel as if you're in
a good sized forest. So, since there was plenty of room for it, I
placed an ammo box for you to find.
 Nothing tricky here. There is plenty
of parking nearby. I suggest parking at N35 43.921 W078 47.522
where you will find a trailhead. &lt;b&gt;PLEASE PARK
AT THE GIVEN PARKING COORDINATES and STAY ON THE PATH until it
ends! (Bushwhacking to the cache may cause the cache to need to be
archived. Please don't contribute towards losing this
cache.)&lt;/b&gt; It will take you to within 75 feet of the cache
and you will have an easy path to the cache from there. Please
rehide the cache as well as or better than you found it and enjoy
this area of calm amidst the busy city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKRECF - Parking coordinates&lt;br /&gt;N 35° 43.921 W 078° 47.522&lt;br /&gt;Parking coordinates</groundspeak:long_description>

Stumbled across this one while walking looking for it.  Cool little area - was hot enough I'm sure we could have cooked on the pavement.

One of the many we hit today from GW5.  I'm not sure I can say much in these logs a million others hitting the cache won't.

What to do...... decided to spend a few hours searching some nearby caches.  This was the closest one, and our 1st in Raleigh.  We got a kick out of the name on this, only because we own a cache with the exact same name and concept.http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=df326a30-7911-4da6-9454-9fc5a295c1bf

After a brief search of the area stumbled across the cache.  Ammo cans are always nice.  Dropped &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; TB.

Thanks

[teal][font=comic sans MS][size=2] [p]Thanks for the hunt and as always thanks to all the geocachers who have hidden all these great caches.

This cache was placed near the Regency Park office to commemorate the one year anniversary of Garmin opening an R&amp;D center in North Carolina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To commemorate the anniversary and to thank the valued geocachers that support OpenCaching.com, this cache was created and filled with various OpenCaching.com swag.

We started looking for the other cache that was nearby and after reading the other log comments decided that the Garmin sponsored one had to be easier. It was our first time out geocaching and not finding the &quot;easy&quot; one was a bit disheartening. Maybe this has been removed or stolen from the original hiding spot? I will post that the cache needs to attention from the owner...maybe they can provide some feedback.  If anyone else finds this cache please post a clue or email me: Danceswithpizzas@yahoo.com
Thanks and happy hunting!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncgeocachers.org&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Cache:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multi-cache is located on NC State University's campus. It
is designed to take explicit advantage of the free &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/trans/transportation/wolfline/&quot;&gt;Wolfline
Bus System&lt;/a&gt;. The four star difficulty rating is based solely on
the time it takes to complete the cache, which should be
approximately 1.5-2.0 hours (hence Diddle-Daddle) and one or two
tricks which could lengthen the time. Everything is wheel-chair
accessible except for the final cache location. These Wolfline
buses run on schedules, so make sure to check the link above to see
that they are running on the day you wish to attempt the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to enjoy the scenery and views of campus as you ride
along on the buses!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need to Know:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to bring something to take notes and/or pictures.
&lt;b&gt;You will need to take sign information down from each stage (see
example below) to use in solving for the final stage
coordinates.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At each stage you will need to pay attention to your
surroundings, in order to figure out the coordinates to the next
stage as well as the number of the bus to get you there. At some of
the stages there are signs in which you need to write down the
numeric information (include any letters as well). An example sign
can be seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--0svmphY26I/Td3T6_mlseI/AAAAAAAAAVc/wArU4iLTV3I/s640/photo.JPG&quot;&gt;
here&lt;/a&gt;. Note that there are no letters in this one, but the ones
you will encounter will (i.e. 2761 223K).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not end up at or very close to a bus stop for each
stage (excluding the final stage) then something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
N 35° 46.917'
W 78° 40.076'
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the location for the start of the multi-cache. This is
the Coliseum parking deck where you can park for a
&lt;strong&gt;fee&lt;/strong&gt; if you cannot find free parking anywhere
close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: (How many columns on the deck have red squares) x (3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B: How many of the columns appear to be made out of brick when
looking at the exit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: You should be looking at the deck from the posted
coordinates or on the side of the deck that aligns with cates road.
For B, you need to be at the exit of the deck (same side just
opposite entrance).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
N 35° 46.A42'
W 78° 40.2B9'
Walk  
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record the numeric information of the nearest sign, based on the
example given earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C: Add all of the individual digits of the sign together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D: How many flags are on the stadium entrance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E: Add the first two individual digits of the sign together.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
N 35° 47.D05'
W 78° 41.01E'
Bus #: C  
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two signs here. You need to record the numeric
information for the one across from the bus stop station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F: (How many dots per window pane at the bus station are there?)
divided by (How many benches are there in one bus station?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G: How many panes of glass are there per bus station?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 4:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
N 35° 46.F58'
W 78° 40.4G3'
Bus #: What does one and one make?  
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need to record any sign information at this
location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H: (Looking between the two buildings. How many windows are on
the wall, closest to the path, on the left building) divided by
(2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I: What's the answer to life the universe and everything. If you
don't know google it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The information for H may seem confusing when you get
there. Just remember it's the wall closest to the path between the
buildings.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 5:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
N 35° 46.3H1'
W 78° 40.I3'  
Walk
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record the numeric information of the nearest sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J: (The last digit of the dedication year of the closest
buidling) divided by (2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K: (The first digit of the number on the sign that does not
contain a letter) divided by (2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L: The digit closest to the letter on the sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: For these signs we basically have two pairs of numbers.
One that is with a letter and one that is not. The dedication year
of the building should be easily visible and noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 6:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
N 35° 46.9K2'
W 78° 40.L79'
Bus #: J  
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look familiar? Your journey is coming to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now Using The Three Collected Signs from previous stages,
Solve For The Final Stage Coordinates.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M: From the sign that would come last alphabetically, add the
individual digits together (of both numbers) and repeat until you
have a single digit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N: From the sign that would come first alphabetically, subtract
the smaller # from the larger #. Now rearrange the digits in
ascending order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P: For each sign, take the individual digits for each pair of
#'s and add them together. Then subtract the results from each
other for each sign. Of these, choose the smallest number. (i.e.
2761 223 =&amp;gt; 16 7 =&amp;gt; 16-7=9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Looking at all the numbers from all the signs. Multiply the
only two unique digits together and subtract 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: For sanity sake there is no Letter 'O&quot; to solve for. That
is a zero below!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Stage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
N 35° 4M.N'
W 78° 4P.0Q' 
Walk 
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little luck you will find the ammo can that initially
contains the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log Book with NCSU Sustainability Pen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FTF GeoCoin (Prize, do not need to trade anything)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique NCSU Coins (Make sure to trade something in return).
Limit one per person please.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trackable Mr. Wolf whose mission is to visit as many college
campuses as possible!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misc. Pencils&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: You can check your &lt;b&gt;Final Stage&lt;/b&gt; solution with
GeoCheck.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Since my wife and I started geocaching a couple of months ago
we've had quite a lot of fun. So, when her birthday came around, I
decided to hide her birthday presents (well, all of them except the
new GPSr) in a geocache. This cache is off some of the mountain
bike trails in Lake Crabtree County Park. You used to have to walk
about 400 feet off the trail to find it but with the new loop #6
it's now much closer to the trails (in fact, it was about 10 feet
or less from the new trail before I moved it!). It's a standard
rubbermaid container. Initially, I've seeded it with all kinds of
party favors, some GPSr candy (i.e. batteries) and a toy car (in
honor of our son). It's very well hidden and may take some
searching to find. In two times visiting the cache place, I got
very different GPSr readings, so some of the difficulty level is in
getting a good satellite lock. Please have fun seeking this
birthday cache, especially if it's your birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: When you re-hide this cache, please make sure to hide it
thoroughly with no portion of it showing. 
&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;No joke! There i was. Holding one of the althiometrist's
challege caches. Really didn't seem like much, but hey, they've
earned it. Earned it, i say! Each item i placed in it, i thought
about how long it had taken them to reach this milestone. Few
people had actually thought it would eventually happen. I wasn't
one of them, though. Very soon, i had thought. Each cache they did,
brought them closer and closer to the goal. Five star terrain and
five star difficulty, even. I should know, i was there. Vexing
puzzles? Easily handled. To get to this point, they had done their
share. We knew it. Once they got close, we started planning. This
was going to be a great challenge cache. We even made it into six
distinct caches. Only for the alethiometrists. For who else could
tackle such a challenge? I certainly wouldn't want to. Victims
though they would be, i wished them the best. Each cache that had
to do to reach the goal would present them with a challenge. Time
would tell if they were up to it or not. We wished them well.
Onward and upward!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, what else can i say about this cache. Seek it to find the
clue that will lead to the final cache. Each one of five caches
will provide a piece of the puzzle. Venture forth to find them all,
but beware! Evil-minded geocachers have planned this out. No
quarter will be given. Even easy puzzles may not be what they seem.
I certainly wouldn't want to solve them. Give me an easy ammo box
in the woods. Hide it under a tree. Take me there with easy clues.
Fix things so they're simple to find. Instead, what do they get?
Very hard puzzles. Each one different from the previous. Six in
total. I know what they'll need. X-ray vision. Once they can see
through walls, they'll be unstoppable. No, you don't think so? Even
i wouldn't hide a cache like that? Five star difficulty with
special equipment needed? Oh well, it's a nice thought. Until we
get real x-ray glasses, i guess that will have to wait. Rather an
interesting idea. Only a few more caches to go, now, though. Next
up, the big 1k! Excellent work to get this far,

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">#230 for me and the first i've found with just me and my 1 yr old.  Her sister had a birthday party this afternoon, so we went for a bike ride (with a few small hiking excursions).  She thought it was pretty cool when i pulled the cache out from under the leaves and opened it.  After looking at everything inside it, she noticed me signing the logbook with the pencil and forgot about everything else.  I let her write a little note in the book too and then managed to distract her with some food while i put it all back in the can.  As far as trades go, we dropped two TBs and a smashed penny and took one TB and an Alethiometrists signature magnet.  Great day to be out and about on the ATT (or anywhere, for that matter).

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The best selling book of all time is by far the Bible. With over
6 billion copies sold, it far outdwarfs anything else. What you may
not know, however, is that the Bible has something to say to
geocachers. Below, you will be given several verses or parts of
verses from the Bible that relate to geocaching (or at least I like
to think so!). You will need to figure out where in the Bible they
come from, specifically from what &lt;b&gt;chapter&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;verse&lt;/b&gt;.
You can then use those numbers to figure out the correct
coordinates to this cache. Good luck and happy searching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_____ A:B - Can anyone hide in secret places so that I cannot
see him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_____ C:D - It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing,
concealed even from the birds of the air.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_____ E:F - Are you wiser than Daniel? Is no secret hidden from
you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_____ G:H - He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what
lies in darkness,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_____ I:J - For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed,
and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the
open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_____ K:L - So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you;
seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to
you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the numbers from above and plug them into these
coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N 35 (F+G)(K-L).(I)(B-A)(C-J)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W 078 ((D-K)/2)(E-H).(H-J)(F)(B-D)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Those days are long gone, though, so i found it the way most other people have found it... online.  Took me two tries to find the actual cache.  The first time it was too hot and i wasn't too motivated to look very hard.  Second time the weather was great and we found it.  Spawn01 took a super ball (despite my attempts to persuade her to take the cool Virginia Lotto key chain) and we left a &quot;Peace and Love&quot; temp tattoo.

RTP was developed more than forty years ago by the Research
Triangle Foundation using no state or federal money. In the 1950s
many graduates of the three major nearby universities had to leave
the state to find good paying jobs. By creating a research park
located between the universities, it was hoped that this trend
could be reversed.&lt;br /&gt;

I visited the park/plaza soon after it was constructed (having seen the construction activity, i was, of course, curious as to what was happening up there).  After having the waypoint in my GPS for a month or two, occasionally tracking it and watching the arrow point as i drove by, i finally stopped and did the search.  This was my first micro (well.. that i actually found) and i enjoyed it.  The hiding place was excellent as was the clue.  It's kind of disconcerting to be looking around with all the traffic nearby, but i guess that's part of the allure of the &quot;urban micro&quot;.  Good hide, and you beat me to it.. I had been considering this little place for my first hide.  But now i'm thinking i'll go for a traditional cache in a more secluded location.</groundspeak:text>

a lot of fun solving some of the local cipher caches, so I decided
to up the ante a bit. The coordinates to this cache are encrypted
using strong encryption. It's up to you to break the encryption and
find the cache. You may need some help with the math, but a simple
calculator should be more than enough. The cache container is very
small. You'll need to bring your own pen to sign the log. Please be
discreet when searching for it and rehide it exactly as you found
it. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache itself is located at the following coordinates. Please
note that only the portion within the square brackets is
encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;

tend to come here once or twice a week. After the recent

&lt;p&gt;You are looking for an extremely small micro cache. Please be
EXTREMELY discreet while searching. You
may need a toothpick or something similar to retrieve the log after
you find the cache. Also, make sure to bring your own fine point
pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please enjoy the cache and take some time to sample a local
restuarant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; My wife pointed out to me the other day that this
cache has just over a 50% find rate, so based on that, I'm bumping
up the difficulty to a 3. If you have trouble finding this cache,
don't despair. I will give hints &lt;b&gt;IF&lt;/b&gt; you have already tried
to find it on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2nd Update:&lt;/b&gt;This cache does NOT require you to disturb
anything. It can be found without digging, pulling anything out, or
removing anything. Disturbing the area excessively fosters a poor
image of geocaching. Please cache responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Marshall, Will and Holly&lt;br/&gt;On a routine expedition &lt;br/&gt;Met the greatest earthquake ever known &lt;br/&gt;High on the rapids It struck their tiny raft (insert screams here)&lt;br/&gt;And plunged them down a thousand feet below &lt;br/&gt;To the Land of the Lost&lt;br/&gt;To the Land of the Lost&lt;br/&gt;To the Land of the Lost  ….&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember the little raft superimposed over the trickling rivulet of tap water? How about the spongy dinosaurs with big pink tongues? The Sleestaks hissing with their big boggly eyes and stubby tails? The little Sasquatch-lookin’ people that stole the four foot long carrots off the cart pulled by the baby brontosaurus? No? Where were you in the 70’s? Under a rock … on the moon … with your fingers in your ears? C’mon! It’s Land of the Lost, man. It was HAP’n’in’ on Saturday mornings. Right before Superfriends and Scooby-Doo, man.  Every little boy wanted to take on Grumpy and Alice with a big sharp stick and every little girl wanted to grow up and marry Will.  I spent many a thirty minutes curled up on the couch, hiding under a blanket, terrified of the Sleestaks but unable to tear my eyes from the drama unfolding on the screen.  My husband reminisced about it, saying “I used to get up at six am every Saturday. It was my best show.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully enough of you remember it to make this a fond little stop in a day’s caching. If you are unfamiliar with the show there are some photos in the cache as well as plenty of information online at LandoftheLost.com. And for all, the location of the cache should give a BIG indication about the show’s content!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache has been placed because I love my husband, Rampantbear, and one of the things I love the most about him is his ability to still tap into his childhood, to get excited about the little things, to remember with fondness and sentimentality the joys of youth and snatch those feelings up into the present. (When we subscribed to Netflix the full run of Land of the Lost was the first thing he ordered and he watched each episode in rapt attention. –While I, at 38, hid under the covers, STILL afraid of Sleestaks!)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are stocking the cache with Dino-goodies but as you discover it please feel free to trade whatever you have with you – when you are in the Land of the Lost you never know what will come in handy! &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Unfortunately we stopped by on a whim, so we didn't have anything to add, but it's only a few minutes walk from our house so I'll be sure to put something in the next time we are going in that direction.  I did take out a battery that someone put in there, not as a keepsake but because I figured battery acid/corrosion wouldn't be a very pleasant find for someone later on.</groundspeak:text>

We parked at the Museum, and took a quick walk down. On the way, we noticed a poor baby dinosaur that was apparently injured and left to alone in the woods. There were a couple of people walking dogs, but they quickly passed us by, so RaptorKed made a quick find, and we hurried home for our next errand.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Week 7 of my after school geocaching class at club blvd and i took the kids caching for real.  It didn't take them too long to find this, once i convinced them that just because it's that's direction doesn't mean it's over on those &quot;tracks&quot; by the radio towers!
I left two TBs and took one.  The kids in the class made various trades, including for one lucent flashlight that i couldn't even open, but would be pretty cool if it works.  I left a pathtag.  Nice to visit this cache again.  Really a great place for a cache.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The land might have been lost, but this cache was easy to find.  It's almost in plain view once you're within 10 feet or so, but i couldn't find any way to conceal it without moving it, so i don't know if that's intentional or not.  Would have been a nice find with my daughters, but every time i'm up this way with them we're going to the NCMLS and there's no time for caching.  </groundspeak:text>

Finish the day with a moonlight walk, all sound dampened by the snow.

To acknowledge the creator of such fine caches as the JLESF series (including the horribly difficult JLESF #8 Depressed), the Coin Cache Series, the Geocacher's Dream series, and many eclectic micros like The Eclectic Micro, this absolutely had to be a multistage cache.  Some containers will be familiar and others won't.  It will take all of your geocaching skills to not get bucked off this cache.  In addition, since these cachers are known for their first to finds (over 100 already!), and this one is being given to them first, it's appropriate that no one even has a chance to find it before they do.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So, get your riding boots on, saddle up, and let's go.  Here's what you'll need.  A full tank of gas, a full feed bag of oats, sunglasses, blinders, riding crops, three saddles, a shetland pony, current road and riding trail maps of North Carolina and the entire southeast, flashlights, a heavy duty portable generator with 400 feet of extension cord, 50 feet of climbing rope, a lasso, six juggling clubs (or jugglings torches if you prefer), bridle, halter, duct tape, two GPS receivers, a snorkel, crutches, a ladder, a telescope, a high powered lantern, four FRS radios, walking sticks, a saddle blanket, a satellite phone with camera capability, a mirror, two different kinds of compasses (magnetic and geometric), one medium rubber band, 10 q-tips, a box of kleenex, painkillers, a dozen straws, two dowels (at least 3 feet long), a roomba, a Leatherman multi-tool, a roll of paper towels, a sling shot, a first aid kit, an atomic clock, a chariot (on fire if you wish), a hard hat, safety glasse, a lariat, a bullwhip, a cowboy hat, a sulky, and a pogo stick.  All you need is your GPSrs, and the ability to think outside the box.  Be sure your health insurance is up to date.  Bring extra casts, plenty of water, your best hiking boots, bug spray, tecnu, a canoe, and hip waders.  This cache will take time and you may have to make several attempts.  Each hide is progressively harder than the one before it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
All stages are micros except the last one.  Keep at it and you'll be able to ride into the sunset to the final ammo box.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Break a leg!
&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Stage 1: Micros in the woods are a hole lot of fun.
Stage 2: The low-down on the parking situation
Stage 3: Peek-a-boo
Stage 4: The BARK is worse than the bite, as long as you don't stray too far from the path.
Stage 5: Go North!
Stage 6: What, you can't find an ammo box in the woods?</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This one all started with a stroll through the park with my GPS until I realized there was a cache nearby. I had no idea this was a multi until I found the first stage.

All stages went quickly until I got to #5 at which point it was getting late. On the ride home I had a brainstorm and realized what needed to be done to conquer this toughie.

The next morning I came better prepared and it all paid off with a quick find of stage 5 and the final.

I had loads of fun hunting this and am eager to move on to my next multi (this was my first)....hope it is as fun as this one.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache was placed with the permission of the property owner. You are looking for a small plastic container. The container is big enough to hold Geocoins, PathTags, and similar items. Its original contents are an ink pen &amp; a log book.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Meet JANE, otherwise known as Just At/Near (the) Exit, a series of caches for the traveller. We are borrowing this concept from the JANE series of caches in the Richmond, Virginia area by SailorRory &amp; the Winch Wenches.  
&lt;br /&gt;
This JANE likes to eat pizza &amp; subs (especially a good turkey with pesto), is closest to the southbound ramps but easily accessable to both North &amp; Southbound travelers! Visit her with stealth please! She is hiding in a plastic container, big enough for tiny trade items.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We travel the interstates frequently, and are always looking for easy on, easy off caches, that can coincide with a gas stop, food or just a chance to get up and stretch the legs. The JANE series of caches seems to fit well with traveling.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyone is welcome to come and play with JANE, even to hide a few!  We only ask that you regard a few considerations if you choose to use the name!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The cache must be within 0.25 miles of a ramp to a limited access highway.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Must be rated a 2/2 or below.&lt;br /&gt;
3. By design, puzzles or multicaches are not acceptable for this series.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Because these are designed to be easy on/easy off, they shouldn't be on an exit with no reentry to both directions.&lt;br /&gt;
5. Please put these rules in your cache description.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Happy Traveling!</groundspeak:long_description>

I like the location, so when they archived their cache I contacted them and got the go-ahead to place one here. There's ample parking not too far from the cache site. Be careful as this is a popular place for boaters to launch their boats and fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a micro covered with camo tape.  It should be a relatively easy Park-n-Grab. Please put the cache back as you found it so that it will hopefully not be muggled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coordinates are an average of 25 waypoints so they should bring you close enough to get a smilie.</groundspeak:long_description>

You can paddle around the bend and end up in the main channel of Lake Gaston.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache contains a few tradables. Some are fishing related. I'd like to keep as close to the fishing theme as possible, but also a few things that the kids would like.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you log the find, please put the cache back like you found it.

My thanks to vttracker for letting us have the area to put our cache in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located along the Tobacco Heritage Trail, a Rails-to-Trails project crossing southside Virginia. This section was finished a few years ago and runs along an old RailRoad bed between Brodnax and LaCrosse. Another section has been completed in Lawrenceville. Hopefully the entire trail will be completed in a few years. It's great for biking, horseback riding, hiking and even geocaching! Nice parking area at the trail head on Airport Road. It's a relatively short hike to the cache but beware. The last few feet are very steep! You don't need climbing gear but almost. Be careful and have fun.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;The hide method is a bit different for around here. I found one like it in North Carolina on the way to the beach, when we stopped for a McFlurry.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I placed this on the eastbound lane of 360 near the Charlotte County line. We needed to have some hotels in Halifax County so cachers will have somewhere to drop the trackables they are moving around.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since this is on Army Corps of Engineers property (with the knowledge and permission of the Geocache manager/ranger) and hunting is allowed year round, be sure to take proper precautions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BLAZE ORANGE IS RECOMMENDED.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's just a flat metal box, painted in camouflage green &amp; brown. There were no travelers in there when placed as I didn't have any to put in it. But feel free to drop them in anytime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache contains toys for the younger cachers and I'll try to keep it filled as time goes by. It will be a combination trackable hotel and kids toy box. Since it is in the woods, I placed first aid supplies in it too. You'll need to walk a short distance up an old road bed to GZ, then climb a short bank. It's well hidden under a cedar. Please replace as found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUCKERS &amp; RV DRIVERS: THERE IS AMPLE PARKING &amp; TURNAROUND SPACE AT THE BOAT RAMP DOWN THE HILL.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the web link to read more about the history of the Staunton River.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oldhalifax.com/county/StauntonRiverTour&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stage coach road used to run by this place. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oldhalifax.com/county/GeoWashington.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; , George Washington passed this way in June of 1791 when he took a tour of the southern states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QUOTED from the web site listed above:&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;From McKendree, the President's route took him to Crystal Hill, then northeast through Lennig and Whiteville and up the Coles' Ferry road past Ellis Creek Baptist Church to the Ferry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pride's, where the President had breakfast, was, according to the late Mr. Faulkner, near Crystal Hill. It was a tavern, now destroyed, and was properly called Priddy's after the Priddy family that ran it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has, over the years, been a great deal of confusion as to where the Col. Issac Coles, with whom the President stayed, lived. Some have said it was in Pittsylvania County, others at Mildendo, in Halifax County. Actually, it was at Coles' Ferry. The confusion has arisen because there were so many Isaacs in every generation of the Coles family.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read this on the web, I mentioned to my husband what it said. He surprised me by telling me it runs right through this property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now for the cache.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container is quite a nice sized metal box, painted in faded green. It blends in nicely with the surrounding plant life. It has plenty of room for swag, trackables and toys for the kiddies. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permission has been given by the landowner to place this cache here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please do not cross the fence or go past the gate, it belongs to a different landowner and permission is not given to enter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs aren't allowed because the landowner's dogs may be out for exercise and I wouldn't want any territory issues. However, if you contact me ahead of time, arrangements can be made. Thanks for understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**The cache is stocked with items for kids along with prizes for the first &amp; second to find.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please do not hunt for this after midnight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Hunting!&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crystal Hill is so named because of the railroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local lore tells that when the railroad was being built, they discovered that the area now known as Crystal Hill was at a higher elevation than the land to the north &amp; south. It's a downhill grade to Halifax in the south &amp; Clarkton on the Staunton River to the north. When the road bed was being leveled, crystals were found here also. Thus the nickname the crystal hill was adopted by the railroad crews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In time, a community grew around the depot. A post office &amp; stores flourished. The depot served the surrounding area as a way to get passengers &amp; tobacco to Halifax or South Boston. Goods were also shipped in to the citizens of Crystal Hill. One notable shipment can still be seen at &lt;strong&gt;N36 52.352 W78 54.413&lt;/strong&gt;. In the 1920's, Sears &amp; Roebuck sold everything imaginable in the mail order catalogs. The story goes that the house at the coordinates given here was ordered &amp; shipped via railroad to Crystal Hill. It arrived in pre-built sections, hauled to the location on wagons &amp; put together on site. Isn't that a surprise in this tiny spot in the road?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Churches are always the heart of a community &amp; here is no exception. There are several well attended churches in Crystal Hill, along with their accompanying cemeteries. Some headstones in these cemeteries date back to the days of the building of the railroad, &amp; explosion of growth brought with it. Some are even older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, the stores closed with the storekeeper's retirements &amp; the community slowed it's pace. Younger people went away to find jobs, older people passed on. Now, the only businesses still open are the Post Office (yes, it's in that tiny building), a fertilizer supply company &amp; a store that is changing hands as I write this. Another thriving store, Crystal Hill Ordinary, burned to the ground a few years ago. The other two stores still stand, abandoned. Now Crystal Hill has become the sleepy little hamlet you see today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please stop by to find this cache &amp; take a look around. Watch your speed though, the 35mph limit is patrolled by a resident deputy. The big sandy colored dog aids in the enforcement as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is doing or has done an Alphanumeric Cache Challenge knows there are some letters that are really hard to find. This cache is for those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those letters that's hard to find is the &quot;Q&quot;. That's the only reason the cache has it's name, so there's no need to look for a clue there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking coords can be found in the waypoints. You can park there and walk to other caches close by. F, Q, 1 &amp; 2 can all be accessed from the waypoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permission has been given by the landowner to place this cache here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunting is not allowed on this property but proper precautions should be taken from October to January anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs aren't allowed because the landowner's dogs may be out for exercise and I wouldn't want any territory issues. However, if you contact me ahead of time, arrangements can be made. Thanks for understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the coords averaged to between 1 and 6 feet because of the trees, but that's close enough for you to find this. I won the container at a CITO event in Lynchburg, if you were there and remember what I won, you're ahead of the game.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever went to hide a cache with a specific container in mind &amp; had to change it because you couldn't find a good place to put it?&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is one of those caches. I wanted to place a small container so people could put goodies &amp; bugs or coins in it. I wandered all over this area &amp; never found a place good enough to keep flood waters from taking it water skiing on down to Buggs Island Lake. So on the ground was out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back to the truck 4 times to trade down a size, but none of the good spots would hold them. I finally found the perfect spot! A little modification with hubby's trusty knife and it will hold my pill bottle tightly. You do NOT need to remove the bottle itself, just twist the top off. You will need to bring your pen of course. (and a tall friend if you're shorter than 5'7&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the history lesson. You can read it in its entirety here. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oldhalifax.com/county/StauntonRiverTour.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote&gt;Staunton Scenic River Tour Contributed by the stewards of the Staunton River and the Roanoke River Basin.
&lt;p&gt;The Staunton Scenic River begins at Long Island, Virginia, and extends to the Kerr Reservoir.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pronounced &quot;Stanton&quot;....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name &quot;Staunton&quot; is said to originate from Captain Henry Staunton, a soldier of the Revolutionary War, who earlier was in command of a company of soldiers organized to patrol the river valley from the mountains to the mouth of the Dan to protect the early white settlers from the incursions of the Indians. This section of the river came to be known locally as &quot;Captain Staunton's River&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Capt. Staunton and his men were patrolling the river, a young girl named Mary Crawford who lived at the white settlement near Hurt in Pittsylvania County was stolen by the Indians and taken to their camp near Smith Mountain. Col. Abner Anthony, an early Campbell County citizen, relating the story, said that Capt. Staunton learned where the Indians had hidden Mary, stole into their camp at night and rescued her, wading and swimming the river with the girl to conceal his tracks from the Indians, and brought her safely home to her parents.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Taken from the Introduction of the Herman Ginther's book &quot;Captain Staunton's River&quot; - 1968 - with permission.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;THE HOMESTYLE CLAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;FOR THEIR FTF!&lt;/em&gt;



 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cache can hold small items, trackables &amp; log. BYOP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have changed containers. It's now clear with a green screw top. I put in fresh swag and a new log, all in zipper bags. (7/30/12)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, for safety issues, check out the picture in the gallery of the honey bee tree. You do not have to go near it to see the object of interest or the cache. Once you see the forked cedar tree, go in the opposite direction, back toward the road (not the parking area).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://s188.photobucket.com/albums/z233/Shay1959/?action=view&amp;amp;current=ForkedCedar.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been working in this area since 1994 &amp; never saw this until recently, even though I have been to the general location too many times to count. Head for a large patch of periwinkle near the road leading in. Find Agnes &amp; her pals, and you're nearly there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be respectful &amp; be careful not to trample the area too much, so it can be kept in the condition it's in now. This can be a very muggle rich place in warmer months. Wear blaze orange from November to mid January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please keep the cache safe from muggles, re-cover it as found or better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOR THE BOTANICALLY CHALLENGED, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinca_minor&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;'s your link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are photos here to help find the entrance to the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's another location that is the hub of a community. This time, it's the area around Nathalie. I rate the difficulty on this more because of the muggle factor rather than the hide itself. But I did have to hide it well because of the MRE (muggle rich environment). Please be very aware of the muggles all around you &amp; at the house on the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a small plastic container wrapped in black tape. It can hold small items, Travel Bugs, geocoins, along with the log sheet. BYOP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can I say about this location? Martha Stewart has been here &amp; talked about it on her show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From early morning until late afternoon, there's a plethora of work trucks, hunters, fishermen, farm workers, rail road workers, loggers...just about everyone in the area stops by at some point of the day. So, I believe you could guess the reason why this area is so muggley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truckers &amp; RV Drivers: parking is available in one of three graveled lots on the side of the road.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Camo pill bottle with a log only. BYOP Please replace it as you found it or better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safe parking &amp; retrieval is available.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This location is across the road from where the water from an old mill used to flow. There are reports of some serious bounce in the area, you may have to expand your search area to find this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look across the creek toward the cutover, you may be able to spot the old iron mill wheel. It's the only part of the mill still there. You can park on the wide shoulder near the &quot;No Dumping&quot; signs. It is there that the wheel may be visible. It's hard to see, but if you notice an odd circular shape in the vines &amp; trees, that is it. From there, you will be seeing the 'bucket side' of it, rather than the entire wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GZ is a short walk back toward the intersection, it will be on your right. Muggley, but if you pretend to be taking a picture or CITOing, they'll probably ignore you. CITO could be a part of the camouflage for your visit here.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back in 1994, when I started working in this area, I ran across this location. There's a huge oak tree that had a brass plate fastened to it. The plate said something like &quot;Seat Cover's Last Stand...Ride on Forever&quot; and it had a date on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to stand at this tree, wondering about Seat Cover. Who was he? What happened to him? Was he a biker that crashed here? I was fascinated with this myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, as I checked the tree like I always did when I was in the area, the brass plate was gone. I felt a sense of loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only recently, I found out the real story behind the brass plate. Seat Cover is the CB handle of an older fellow in the neighborhood. Near this oak tree was where he always parked for his deer stand. Even after he stopped hunting as much, he still would go to &quot;his&quot; deer stand to hang out with the other hunters. He's gone now, I'm using this cache to honor him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm adding some attributes such as poison plants &amp; thorns as they may be there in season. Of course, it goes without saying that you may need to take proper precautions during hunting season.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I was a youngster, my parents used to bring my 3 siblings &amp; me here to play the hot summer afternoons away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those were the good ol' days when viennas &amp; nabs, a potted meat, 'baloney' or peanut butter &amp; jelly sandwich were some fine dining! 'Co-cola' was about the only drink to be had, especially with peanuts poured in the bottle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before &amp; after that great meal, we kids would be found in the creek. Wading, running, splashing &amp; pretending it was deep enough to swim in. But of course, you know those hands were on the sandy bottom, walking along as we kicked our feet like crazy. Crawdads, minnows &amp; knotty heads were in abundance &amp; fun to feed bread crumbs to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who remembers those days? If you do, then please stop by here to relive your childhood for at least a lil' while. Go ahead, stick your toes in the water, feel it running over your toes, let the sand swirl around your feet. It'll sure make you feel young again!&lt;/p&gt;

Recommend looking for this cache in the early morning during a week-end. During the day, it's a high traffic area and people everywhere. If you need to take a break, there is a picnic table across from the site where you can read and scope out the area. Congratulations!!! To Team.Hepler for FTF!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A view of the tails is something to see. At the site, you will find yourself near a center of academic administration. The tails are part of the larger Charlottesville Art in Place (visit link) This cache is designed to bring attention to the effort of community culture in C'Ville. The three whale tails are the replacement to the single whale tail broken by a micro burst in Summer of 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you find the cache, take time to check out the Art in Place. Take caution in crossing roads and bridges. The cache location is designed to provide a safe park and then walk location.</groundspeak:long_description>

May be a cache-n-dash if you have a cacher and a driver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Housing five state-of-the-art performance venues, the Forbes Center for the Performing Arts at James Madison University opened in 2010 and is the destination for world-class theater, dance and music entertainment. Take in a show ranging from talented JMU students and faculty to internationally recognized professional artists. Don’t expect easy parking. There is plenty of parking nearby, but in university lots you must have a permit to avoid getting a ticket. And they WILL ticket. If you are coming from the east side of Rt. 11, be sure to experience the tunnel that runs from the Quad under Rt. 11 directly to the cache site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to milleren for the FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Rapidan Camp (also known at times as Camp Hoover) in Shenandoah National Park in Madison County, Virginia, was built by U.S. President Herbert Hoover and his wife Lou Henry Hoover, and served as their rustic retreat throughout Hoover's administration from 1929 to 1933. The first family's residential cabin was known as the &quot;Brown House&quot; in contrast to their more famous residence, the White House.&lt;br/&gt;Rapidan Camp was precursor of the current presidential retreat, Camp David.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapidan Camp is accessible by a 4.1 mile (6 km) round-trip hike on Mill Prong Trail, which begins on Skyline Drive at Milam Gap (Mile 52.8). During much of the spring, summer, and fall, an interpretive guide stays at camp and provides tours. The Brown House is decorated as it was in Hoover's day; the Prime Minister's Cabin contains interpretive exhibits. The camp is also accessible from the extremely rough, unpaved Quaker Run Road accessible near Criglersville. However, vehicles are prohibited beyond a fire gate at the park boundary one mile from camp, with very limited parking.Visitors must reach the camp on foot, as bicycles are prohibited on unpaved roads within the park.  Backcountry camping is prohibited within 1⁄2-mile (0.8 km) of Rapidan Camp.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We started in Criglersvile and took a left on Quaker Run Road State Route 649.  This road starts out &quot;OK&quot; and gets worse.  I would not suggest going on this road if the weather is poor.  The road goes in and out of the Rapidan Wildlife Management Area and Shenendoah National Park.  Eventually you'll run into a yellow metal gate.  Park here and walk up this road about 1 mile.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the posted coordinates you'll find an interpretive sign.  Prove you were there, the work you are looking for is an &quot;odd&quot; word for a President's Residence.  That is your code phrase.  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Washington's Washington

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Washington is a town in Rappahannock County, Virginia. It is noted for being the oldest of the 28 towns and villages by the name of Washington in the United States of America. The site of this town was surveyed by George Washington himself in July of 1749. Its population was just 183 people at the 2000 census. It is also the county seat of Rappahannock County. It is nicknamed Little Washington to avoid confusion because of its proximity to Washington, D.C., which lies only 70 miles east.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the Civil War, a home on the town's Main Street served as a Confederate Hospital. In the late 19th century when rail became the main method of trade, the main east-west railway route of the time was constructed north of town through the accessible Thoroughfare Gap. Washington was relatively unaffected by the Industrial Age and thus the current town is quite similar to the one of 150 years ago. By the start of the 20th century the population had reached nearly 500, supporting businesses such as three garages and a barber shop.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Currently, the town is probably most known for The Inn at Little Washington, a five-star restaurant, inn, and member of the Relais &amp; Chateaux group. As such it attracts a high-paying clientele from Washington, D.C. and its suburbs. Largely due to its influence, the town is home to several rather expensive shops, bed and breakfasts and restaurants. Dining aside, the town also attracts many hikers that come into the county from the east en route for day hikes or weekend camping trips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Washington's Town Hall is a historic structure and worth exploring. While there, check out the time capsule and miniature replica of the town hall bird house. There's also a lovely flower garden nearby to stroll through.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Beware of the occasional muggler when searching.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Super awesome! I upset so many spiders on the way up though, it seemed every ten feet one had built a web across the trail. I was a bit wary at first because the trail went in the opposite direction my compass indicated, but it eventually zigs after a long zag! I also highly recommend climbing the rock the cache is in for a fantastic view.
keep on caching everyone!</groundspeak:text>

and it's a beautiful natural setting. Several caches have been
placed along this trail in the Berkeley and Morgan County area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache was inspired by the random musings about camp during
a hike on the Tuscarora from Sleepy Creek Lake to Shockey's Knob
Shelter with CLueseeker and BJ&amp;Snurt101. If you're so inclined, guess which of the three of us was thinking about which of the three items in the
poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiking on the Tuscarora with glee.&lt;br /&gt;
Light hearts and heavy feet go thee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The miles pass, the pack like weights.&lt;br /&gt;
You ponder the campsite's welcoming traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might think of warm smokey fires, or of stout in a
mug,&lt;br /&gt;
but some will think of wood nymphs nestled sweetly&lt;br /&gt;
on a deep-pile bear skin rug.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

See : (GC1JXRW -- Four Corners of History) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yet the magic of the springs prevailed, and the town and surrounding area are known by their name -- Berkeley Springs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The waters flow at a constant 74°F from the base of Warm Springs Ridge. You may still drink freely and fill your jugs at Lord Fairfax's public tap, and wade in the ancient stone pools in the nation's smallest state park. See: (GCP2GB -Berkeley's Soothing Springs) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The town has endured cycles of notoriety, fashion, war and modern progress, but remains the Country's First Spa, a quiet, friendly haven surrounded by West Virginia's splendid outdoors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will find this cache as you enter or leave Berkeley Springs from the North. This unique cache is not at the Welcome Sign but close by with plenty of parking and away from busy Route 522. As always when near traffic areas, Please keep an eye on your children. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this small cache you will find a log, stash note, writing utensil and some swag. It has room for small geo coins and TB’s with smaller Hitchhikers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;** Congratulations to GR8caches and TwoLovies for the FTF ** &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache is not near the house!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I just had to place this type of cache container after finding a similar one up north.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  You may be a little hesitant at first but after you realize the title of the cache, you should figure it out pretty quickly.  Please visit only when the parking area is open (not roped off by the yellow chain).   While you are searching you may enjoy a nice treat and if you happen to talk to the owner, “George.” Please thank him for allowing the geocache to be placed here.  If you happen to be caught by a muggle, please introduce them to Opencaching and take a moment to explain what you are doing.  &lt;br/&gt;	Please be sure to secure the container exactly the way you found it.  If you need any further hints, please e-mail me and I’ll give one more hint to help you out.&lt;br/&gt;               Parking lot is only accessible from &quot;Ragers Hill Road.&quot; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Staplebend Tunnel was constructed in 1834 for the Allegheny
Portage Railroad as the first railroad tunnel in the United States.

It has been restored by the National Park Service and was opened
for public use in 2001. More information is available at
http://www.nps.gov/alpo/sbt.htm.

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site, and
the 2.5 mile mostly rail-trail access from the community of Mineral
Point, are maintained by the National Park Service as a National
Historic Site. The initial point of this multi-cache is a virtual
and consists of two display plaques at the southern end of the
tunnel. These final plaques, along with others that you will pass
along the way between the parking area and the tunnel, provide the
keys to the coordinates of the second and final cache. That site is
a physical cache located outside of the Park boundaries. Parking
and restrooms are available at &lt;b&gt;N40-22.583, W78-50.175&lt;/b&gt;. Dogs
and bikes are permitted on the trail but dogs must be on a 6 foot
max leash, and bikes must be walked through the tunnel. Bring a
flashlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the
final two, &lt;b&gt;the clues are NOT necessarily in an order&lt;/b&gt; that
coincides with the plaques that you come across along the way, so
read them all thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache
coordinates are  &lt;b&gt;N40-21.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;jft&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,
W78-51.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;nrd&lt;/b&gt;
,
where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___________
(i&lt;b&gt;j&lt;/b&gt;
)
maximum speed of the passenger trains,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___________
(klm&lt;b&gt;n&lt;/b&gt;
)
is the year the Pennsylvania Railroad crossed the
mountains,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___________
(q&lt;b&gt;r&lt;/b&gt;
) #
of years the Allegheny Portage Railroad was in
operation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___________
( s
&lt;b&gt;t&lt;/b&gt; ) length of Allegheny Portage Railroad in miles.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___________
(e&lt;b&gt;f&lt;/b&gt;
g)
is the length of the tunnel,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
final clue is on the plaques at the posted
coordinates&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;___________
(abc&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;
)
is the year that the facility shown in the photo at the bottom
center of the right plaque (at the listed virtual location) was
built,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
As with any caches, the &lt;b&gt;clues should not direct you to final
coordinates that are on NPS property or active railroads&lt;/b&gt;. 
Your final coordinates for this cache should be within 0.1 mile of
the virtual site and should not take you back through the tunnel or
over any rivers. 
Please completely conceal the cache when finished, it has been
muggled previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site of
posted coordinates is ADA accessible. The final site is not ADA
accessible. Therefore, we will make the posted coordinates a
virtual find provided you email (do NOT post) the clue answers
along with your interpretation of the purpose of the large concrete
structure located at the posted coordinates (its not on the
plaques).&lt;/p&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This park is dedicated to the WWII veterans. Originally this town fired up in the early rather roaring 1920's. It was built because of the coal mining industry - due to the Buffalo Pittsburgh railroad steaming through the area. Seems like everyone in this area has either worked in a coal mine, or has had a relative that has. Its a quiet town, with a nice small park just south of Main Street. When you leave and if you head back to US RT 119 on Main Street, be sure to look to your left. There is a beagle that hangs in his home... he's a real cutie.&lt;br/&gt;I did the coordinates in Google maps its a dead ringer. - If you have a GC . com account, there's another cache in this park. Heck, If I would have had cell service, I would have hunted. Well? Happy Hunting.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please, use caution - If you search in the wintery icy conditions - I'd rather you wait for the snow and ice to melt. I checked for ticks after I was done, and didn't find any on me, but, that doesn't mean its tick free. This may not be a good caching area for children.

honor kimchee&amp;smartykatt for finding their 1000th
find.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Our caching friends kimchee&amp;smartykatt have found
their 1000th find and to celebrate, I decided to put out a multi
just to have some fun and take you back to some familiar places.We
have been on some wild adventures together and they have sent us
out on some wild ones too.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Yes you will have to bushwack. Safety glasses maybe
required&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Yes you may get wet. Waterproof boots maybe
needed&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Yes you may get muggled.Stealth is a must&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Yes you will curse me out for it.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;But in the end it is worth it.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first 2 stages you will be looking for matchstick containers
with cords inside to the next stage. Don't worry, they will not be
hard to spot, just a pain to get to. The final is a gold ammo
can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please use stealth,
it is a must, especially at the
final&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please allow time for kimchee&amp;smartykatt to get the
FTF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN2M0K9 - GC2M0K9 Final&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Final&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: S22M0K9 - GC2M0K9 Stage 2&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Stage 2</groundspeak:long_description>

I have been given permission from the owner to place this cache. And some given Saturday nights you just might find me here helping out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can park along the road or in the dirt area and climb the bank. Do not go in the gate, even if it is open unless you are here for what goes on here, but like I said, when the event is going on, it would not be a good time to get the cache. And Friday nights is when the crew is getting the area ready, so be cautious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the checkered FTF flag goes to jodi_goob! Way to go!

This is... however a P&amp;G. You'll need a crayon or some type of writing instrument, and a pair of tweezers, or some other handy dandy tool to remove the log. Take a break from I-80 at Exit 97 and find your way to a few other OX caches in the area. Happy Hunting. This little town has lots of caches in the area.</groundspeak:long_description>

But decided it needed a much bigger&lt;br /&gt;container. My brain started to think. I came up with it...A puzzle&lt;br /&gt;cache. Now this is one of the easiest puzzles that I have seen. It&lt;br /&gt;is so easy, it shouldn't be a puzzle. But evil side of me said &quot;Go&lt;br /&gt;for it!&quot;. So here it is. My puzzle cache. For those who have been&lt;br /&gt;here before, you will know where to look for your clue. Everyone&lt;br /&gt;else...(see hint)(seriously...check out the hint) Basically I&lt;br /&gt;wanted you the finder to feel a little more comfortable about&lt;br /&gt;looking for a cache in a yard. So I made it very easy. Also, the&lt;br /&gt;container is big enough to hold most TB's and coins. There is a&lt;br /&gt;seperate container inside for TB's and coins. If the TB's you are&lt;br /&gt;dropping off are too big, just place it somewhere in the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ATTENTION: PLEASE DO NOT PARK ON THE ROAD NEXT TO THE CACHE. I live on a blind turn. Use the parking cords that I have provided so as not to park in my neighbors drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTF - Congrats to the CARELS! Way to go! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't mind the dogs if they are out. They are both tied.&lt;br /&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: FP1D4YP - 969 Puzzler Final&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Final Location.&lt;br /&gt;PK1D4YP - My Driveway&lt;br /&gt;N 41° 09.440 W 078° 40.759&lt;br /&gt;Please park here.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Our caching friend Mailbrat has found his 1000th cache.
To celebrate, this gold ammo can has been placed for all to
find.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This cache should not be too hard. It is located on
state game lands, so be sure to wear your orange.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;As with most 1K caches, please allow time for Mailbrat
to get FTF.&lt;/b&gt;

There is a FTF prize for the first person after Mailbrat.</groundspeak:long_description>

With me helping I think we came&lt;br /&gt;up with a pretty good spot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please come visit Chris and his new home. It has a lovely view,&lt;br /&gt;especially in the fall. Might want to bring some binoculars. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to bring your own writing utensil, as Chris does not&lt;br /&gt;have any. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch for muggles driving by. There is a small pull off big&lt;br /&gt;enough for one car. This cache maybe very hard to get in the&lt;br /&gt;winter. Do NOT mess around the building near.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrats to Fatwalker on the FTF!&lt;/p&gt;

For awhile I have been tryin to come up with a pretty good hide. Then an idea finally came to mind. But instead of just a find, this was going to be a multi. While scouting it all out, I found a Benchmark. The odd part about this one BM is, I can not find it in the BM database. The cords for the BM are in the final stage log book, right at the front of the book. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 2 stage multi with the 2nd stage being the final. You can drive to each stage or walk to them, they are not that far apart. The first stage is a small micro tube with the cords inside. The road that the first stage of the cache is on, is not bad, but taking a car down it may be doing so at your own risk. Winter maintenance is minimal or not at all, not sure. You may see another car once in a while but then again you may not. Also this is a hunted area, so please wear orange during hunting seasons. There is also a couple of paths up the dirt roads that you could go for a walk on. The dirt road will lead you out to Mountain Run Road near Camp Mountain Run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun! Bring something to write with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrats goes to carels for the FTF!&lt;br /&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: BM1E98H - No. 10 with a BM - Benchmark&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Benchmark&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: FS1E98H - No. 10 with a BM Final&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Final Stage</groundspeak:long_description>

My father showed me this place when I was very young and was always amazed by it everytime I came here. There is lots of wildlife around, you never know what you may see. As the roads leading in are very rough and muddy, you may need 4wd or an ATV. I would not suggest taking a car with little clearance on these roads. Jeeperseekers were with me when I placed this, as they are new and wanted to see how it was done.&lt;br /&gt; This particular area is the Whetstone Reservoir #2. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to wear orange during hunting seasons as this area is highly hunted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrats to PureEvil110 on the FTF!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a nice little area to fish or swim. The cache is hidden near North Fork. From what I am told, my wife's uncles and cousins used to jump off the bridge into the water. Can't really do that anymore as the water is not deep anymore under the bridge. They have also gone tubing too, just gotta pick a day that has a little more water. I have gone fishing down here and caught a couple nice sized ones. They all hunt down here during hunting season, so be careful and wear your orange. It does flood down here once in awhile, so be cautious. I did make the container so it would not float away, so it should be there no matter what (but you never know). My wife's family's camp is near, so you may be muggled (but it is ok). The hunting camp actually used to be where the old chimney stands, but it got washed away. Please be respectful of the property. If anything happens that should not, I will be forced to delete this cache. The road can be very rough on the way down. If you take a car, drive slow. Also, there is no cell phone signal down here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bring something to write with. Container is about the size of a handheld GPS, so small trades items are good. Be sure the lid is closed tightly to help keep most of the water out. Be cautious of rattlesnakes (they are down here). The difficulty of 3 is for the drive down in as the road is not maintained very well (no winter maint). The actual area is about a 1.5 - 2. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please replace the cache just as you found it so it does not get muggled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrats to Smoky Bear 1 on the FTF!

Thought it was pretty cool that there was once a cache here and figured it would be good to keep it going. From the info I got from the Street, this rock carving was done by a local guy. It sure is really cool looking.&lt;br /&gt;The cache is hidden near by. It is a thin ammo can. Good place for a CITO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the summer, be very careful of snakes! Also, it may be hard to get some exact cords at times, especially when there are leaves on the trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrats to happydancer123 for the FTF, and welcome back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!!!

You could find this cache while getting the caches on the way to and at Devil's Den.  A trail to the cache is located just across the stream from N 41 23.813 W 078 44.733 behind the Elk's Camp.  You could also bushwhack very easily from this cache to the trail that leads to Devil's Den from the Elk's Camp or vice verse.  This is the most used route to Devil's Den.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cache is a clear 35mm film canister and contains a log. Please hide this as you found it because this spot sees a lot of traffic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that you enjoy this beautiful location&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations to Guitardudev for the FTF.

This cache is in memory of their son who was recently killed in a motor cycle accident. They ask that if you knew Philip you write something in the log book.  Phillip supplied free over 300 large cache containers to local geocachers over the last 4 years.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The football on top should make it easier to find. Sam And Lois live here and also host Buster's Place at their camp. Stop &amp; say hello, introduce yourself, and tell them you found it. This cache has a special meaning for them. It should be easy to find even without the hint. For the coin collectors there are some special wooden nickels to trade. You may also trade some of your favorite teams paraphernalia.&lt;br/&gt;Parking is available along the street with the sidewalk and the cache is handicap accessible.&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations j&amp;bs way to go FTF. Thanks for giving his containers a good home.</groundspeak:long_description>

You may also encounter a bad guy along the way that will try and stop you from getting to the princess.  This is an up hill trail (but not bad) on the roadway but think of the positive, it all down hill when your done!   First to find certificate in each cache, and first to find prizes in the princess cache for both adults and kids.

Due to his bobbing and weaving style, he was nicknamed Bendy Abednego, which eventually evolved into Bendigo. If you're in the area, there is a nice state park, state gamelands, and the little town of Glen Hazel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kayaking, boating, fishing, swimming, picnics - Just about anything outdoorsey that you'd like to do, this neck of the woods has it... I thougth the road was &quot;Bendigo&quot; because you Bend - I - go this way, and that way. A nice slow twisty road.&lt;br/&gt;   Its a nice drive, if you're not ventured this way. This is a quick P&amp;G, non magnetic cache. Enjoy the area, and wear an orange hat for this dash. BYOP and maybe tweezers?&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The North Country National Scenic Trail Geotrail (NCTGT) is a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association (NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

This cache is about 1.5 miles north of PA 948 on the NCT.    </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

This cache is about 1 mile north of US 6 on the NCT.   </groundspeak:long_description>

However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

This cache is about 2 miles south of Gibbs Hill Road on the NCT.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When built in 1882, the Kinzua Viaduct was the highest railroad bridge in the world. It was constructed as an alternative to laying an additional eight miles of track over rough terrain along the line leading to McKean County’s coal, timber and oil lands. Built of iron, the original viaduct was 301 feet high, 2,053 feet long, and weighed 3,105,000 pounds. By 1900, it became necessary to rebuild the entire structure with steel to accommodate heavier trains. That May, about 100 to 150 men working ten-hour days completed the job in 105 days. The new steel viaduct had the same measurements, but now weighed 6,715,000 pounds. Freight traffic discontinued in June of 1959. In 1963, Governor William Scranton signed a law that created Kinzua Bridge State Park. The park officially opened in 1970. In 1977, Kinzua Viaduct received national recognition when it was placed on the National Register of Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks.&lt;br/&gt;On Monday, July 21, 2003, at approximately 3:15 p.m., an F1 tornado (wind speed 73 – 112 mph) struck the side of Kinzua Viaduct. Eleven towers from the center of the bridge were torn from their concrete bases and thrown to the valley floor. Fortunately no one was seriously injured.&lt;br/&gt;Don't miss the bridge overlook, it gives great views of the viaduct and the Kinzua Creek Valley. The picnic area has shaded picnic tables, water and a modern restroom. Easy access to cache, please use stealth during park activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another find on day number two of our three day caching adventure in McKean, Potter, Cameron and Elk Counties.  We ran into the fence problem and were really dissapointed because this was going to be one of the highlights of our trip.  We went and tried the earthcache.  Hopefully I can find the answers for that online since I was able to get a picture from one of the viewing platforms.  When we returned to the parking lot, there was a DCNR maintenance worker there.  I told him of our predicament and he told us he knew where the cache was located and how we could access it.  I guess cache grabbers did it the right way because that's exactly what he told us.

He also told us that the fence went up about three weeks ago so I'm surprised no other cachers mentioned it in their logs.  The project is supposed to take a year or more and it sounds like it's going to be a big improvement for the park.  I think you're correct in disabling it since that's not an ideal way to approach it and you miss out on the bridge experience.  Thanks for McKean County stamp number twelve and AGT- number 103.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My dog &quot;Bear&quot; and I were caching through north central PA this weekend working on the AGT, and this was one of the caches on the list.  This was a popular spot!  A group of bikers from down in my area was at the overlook taking pictures.  Found out they were from Perry County, and one of them works in my home town of Mechanicsburg.  After a little chat and some picture taking of my own I headed off to find the cache.  Two other cachers were just returning from signing the log when I started into the woods.  Found quickly and signed and stamped my passport.   I'd always wanted to see the bridge, but never took the time to do it.  Thanks for putting a cache here!  </groundspeak:text>

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The North Country National Scenic Trail Geotrail (NCTGT) is a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association (NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A slimy salamander and a redback salamander were both watching over this spot!&lt;/p&gt;

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

The construction of the pipeline ranks as one of the all-time great achievements in the annals of oil exploration. &lt;br/&gt;This is the approximate site of Pump Station #1 on the Tidewater pipeline. On May 28 1879, the 80-horsepower pumps located in Coryville sent an oil flow of 250 barrels an hour through a 6 inch pipeline across the mountains and ultimately into Williamsport on June 4th. The Tidewater Pipe Company sucessfully destroyed the Standard Oil Company's (John D. Rockefeller) monopoly on oil transportation by rail.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Please follow all the rules of Pennsylvania State Game Land #301&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The North Country National Scenic Trail Geotrail (NCTGT) is a collaborative effort among the North Country Trail Association (NCTA) and the Allegheny National Forest Chapter (ANF chapter) of the NCTA. 100 individual caches are hidden approximately a mile apart on the ANF chapter’s 100 mile section of the North Country Trail. This section runs from the New York border to the PA 66 trailhead South of Marienville, Pennsylvania.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cache in this geotrail is unique and can be logged individually. However, for a real challenge, and to earn a commemorative North Country Trail medallion, you could find 50 of the NCTGT caches and retrieve the hidden code words written on the inside of the lids of each of the 50 caches that you find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pamphlet with spaces to write the code words for each of the 100 caches is found &lt;a href=&quot;http://northcountrytrail.org/cla/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/NCTGT-Codewords-Sheet.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find a cache, write its code word or letter on the corresponding spot on your pamphlet. When you have found any 50 NCTGT geocaches and have the corresponding code words written on the pamphlet, send it with your name, geocaching name and address to the address on the pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after sending in your pamphlet, you will receive your North Country Trail medallion that will forever remind you of the real treasure that you gained by completing the NCTGT. That treasure is experiencing a large portion of a national treasure that we are very lucky to have pass through our part of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&quot;&gt;www.northcountrytrail.org/anf&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the trail and access points in the Allegheny National Forest&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Cobb's Blue Loop Trail and a campsite on the top of the hill were built in 1999 by members of the Foothills Trail Club of Buffalo and the Finger Lakes Trail Conference.  Bog bridging along this trail was constructed by the Boy Scouts troop from Lancaster and the Girl Scouts troop from Franklinville.  In 2002, a bridge was constructed, through funding from the National Park Service, over Devereaux Creek.  Very descriptive wooden signs have also been placed along the trail at both intersections with the Finger Lakes/North Country Trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is not located at the listed coordinates.  To obtain the coordinates for the geocache, you must first find the &quot;Cobb's 45 - Latitude&quot; and &quot;Cobb's 45 - Longitude&quot; geocaches.  In &quot;Cobb's 45 - Latitude&quot; geocache you will find the latitude for this cache written on the log book and the cover of the geocache container.  In &quot;Cobb's 45 - Longitude&quot; geocache, you will find the longitude for this cache also written on the log book and the cover of the geocache container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finding &quot;Cobb's 45 - Longitude&quot; you will have the final coordinates and need to continue following the blue blazes which will eventually lead you to the bottom of the hill.  This series of caches is set up to take you on a hike of the entire loop trail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the hunt.  The Finger Lakes Trail Conference has granted permission to have this cache placed here and has selected the location for the cache and the &quot;Latitude&quot; and &quot;Longitude&quot; geocaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice hike.  This is a great section of trail in a very beautiful piece of woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Finger Lakes Trail Conference has requested that no one attempt to find this geocache from November 15th - December 15th.  They allow this area to be hunted and shut it down to all other activities during this time.  As such this geocache will be temporarily deactivated during that time period every year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: FN2H1XG - Final&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;Final coordinates for cache&lt;br /&gt;PK2H1XG - GC2H1XG Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 42° 19.903 W 078° 34.566&lt;br /&gt;Parking for Cobb's 45 - Final</groundspeak:long_description>

It is an uphill walk on a maintenance road for the first half and then a woods walk to the cache site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park Approval #LSP-17&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park Hrs. are 6am to 11pm daily Park entrance fee may apply&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is my first attempt at hiding a cache so let me know what you think. The cache is located in scenic Letchworth State Park. At the location of the cache there is a beautiful view of the iron railroad bridge that crosses the Genesee valley above the upper falls. Depending on what time of year you visit this area, the bridge can usually be seen through the trees. I chose this spot to place the cache because it is a mysterious area. The forest is quite open and very old. Not too far from the cache spot is a tree called the “Jungie” tree. Iroquois legend tells us that the “Jungies are an ancient race of little people who inhabit the land and are rarely seen by humans. Their handy work though proves their existence, for you see, their job is to be the caretakers of the streams and rivers, the forests, and the stones. Close by the cache location you may notice a tree that appears to have a moat around it. It is believed that this ring around the tree was formed by the “Jungies” dancing around the tree when there is no one there to observe them. I can offer no better explanation. When you get close to the area of the cache you may want to try to find an opening in the trees to get your best GPS signal and let it settle in before attempting to make the find. There is a spot not too far away from the cache where you can get a good signal and the arrow should point right to the spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park at the Council Grounds N42 35.183 W078 02.625 to start your journey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a standard 30 cal ammo can that is painted dark green with black highlights. The clue I am giving should prove to be quite helpful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please try to conceal this as neatly as possible after you have found it so as not to give away its location too easily to the next cacher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you return back to the parking lot take time to explore the newly renovated Council Grounds before you leave the area. In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the gift of Letchworth State Park to the State of New York by W.P. Letchworth, the council grounds have been restored to the appearance they had in the time when Mr. Letchworth lived there. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

the final in the series. It is called Maximus because it will take
a maximum effort to get to this cache. This is a two stage
multicache - stage one is a small Lock -N Lock and the final is a
.30 cal Ammo box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Franklin Gulf is a undeveloped Erie County Park. It is nestled
between North Collins and Eden NY. It has numerous types of terrain
and many scenic areas. This series will take you to all parts of
the Park via the creek bed. This final is located at the top of the
gorge and can be reached via numerous ways.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You are searching for a camouflaged matchstick container.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can park at N42.38.249 W078.10.210&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache will take you on a pleasant nature walk on the old Rochester and Southern railway track bed. This rail bed divides a large marsh literally in two and provide the hiker with a beautiful view of the plants and animals that inhabit this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tracks were first laid here in 1878 by the newly chartered Rochester and State Line Railroad. After 3 short years the line becomes the Rochester and Pittsburg Railroad. 10 years later the Genesee &amp; Wyoming Valley Railway is incorporated. In 1899 the name is changed into the Genesee &amp; Wyoming Railway. Eventually the rail line is consumed by the Baltimore and Ohio (B&amp;O) which eventually becomes part of the Chessie System. Many other changes occur in the next few years as Railroads go through some hard times. Finally in 1991 the route from Silver Springs south to Salamanca is abandoned and the tracks are torn up. Today these abandoned rail beds offer a nice path through some very remote country sides and they are enjoyed by 4 wheelers and snowmobilers as well as hikers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is nothing all that special about the cache hide, it is placed there to get you to see this beautiful and scenic area. I would highly recommend bringing along your camera because I can guarantee you will see a lot of wildlife and beautiful plants that grow in the marsh. When I was placing this cache a Doe and her twin fawns stood a short distance away observing me. The sounds of the marsh are intoxicating and the birdlife is abundant. The journey from the parking area to the cache is about .35 miles and is flat and straight. While visiting this area you might want to give &quot;Bridges in the Boondocks&quot; (Dedicated to CBG) (GC2C0R5) a try to see the large marshy area that that cache will take you through. I do not recommend doing this cache at night because you will miss the scenic views this cache has to offer. I hope you enjoy your visit to this special place!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On the property of Orchard Park Wesleyan Church, this cache should be fairly easy for any geocachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is our first cache we hid as a family. It is located on the property of the church that we attend and dad serves as the youth pastor. You'll want to park in the back corner behind the gymnasium building. The hillside behind the church is very inviting for hikes as well as many creatures. I've seen deer while walking through the woods here many times -- often you can get within 20 feet or so before you realize that they're there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the name implies, you can see the pond from the location of the cache. Well ... we call it a pond, it's more of a glorified puddle, but you get the idea. The cache itself is a 2.7 quart plastic container covered in camo duct tape.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VERY IMPORTANT ... do not seek this cache during the fall, big game hunting seasons (October through December).  It would be a shame to spoil your geocaching by running into an angry hunter ... not that we get angry when it happens.</groundspeak:long_description>

Joe's as I was in the military, take if you want but please leave something and sign the log book. Please re-hide the cache. You will need bug spray in the warm months as the midges are very numerous in the area. If you don't know what midges are, they are mosguitoes here in the USA.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There are many theories as to the exact mode of origin and plenty of controversy among geologists interested in geomorphology on how drumlins are formed. Some consider them a direct formation of the ice, while a theory proposed in the 1980s by John Shaw and others, postulates creation by a catastrophic flooding release of highly pressurized water flowing underneath the glacial ice. Either way, they are thought to be a waveform (similar to ripples of sand at the bottom of a stream). It is not clearly understood whether drumlins are erosional or depositional features. It is also poorly understood why drumlins form in some glaciated areas and not in others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A drumlin’s long axis is parallel with the movement of the ice. The Stoss End (blunt end) faced into the ice flow and the Lee Slope is the gentle slope on the back side. Drumlins are typically 0.6 to 1.2 mi. long, less than 165 ft. high and approxamently 0.25 mi. wide. Drumlins generally have a consistent ratio of 2:3.5 width to length dimensions. Drumlins are often in drumlin fields of similarly shaped, sized and oriented hills. Drumlins usually have layers indicating that the material was repeatedly added to a core, which may be of rock or glacial till. The composition of drumlins varies depending on the area in which they are found, and can consist of similar material to the till of the surrounding moraine or be composed almost entirely of bedrock, sand and gravel or various mixtures thereof.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drumlin soil classification is variable but often consists of a thin A soil horizon and a thin Bw horizon. The C horizon is close to the surface, and may be at the surface on an eroded drumlin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The drumlin field in New York State is the largest in North America. It covers and area roughly bounded in the east by Interstate 81, south by the Finger Lakes and Interstate 90, west by the Niagara River and north by Lake Ontario (over 4,000sq. mi.). In the vicinity of this cache there are a hand full of drumlins. Rt. 98 near Lockport Rd. cuts through a drumlin. Although the majority of drumlins are located east of the Genesee River, there are still a good number scattered west of the Genesee River into Niagara County.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this cache you will be tasked with calculating the slope of the Stross End and the Lee Slope of Bulgary Ridge. By either driving or walking you will need to gather:&lt;br/&gt;1.	The elevation difference between points A and B and the ground distance between points A and B, converted from miles to feet. &lt;br/&gt;2.	The elevation difference between points A and C and the ground distance between points A and C, converted from miles to feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slope or gradient (grade) is the steepness or incline of a hill, road or trail. A higher slope value indicates a steeper incline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this Earthcache enter the two word code phrase from the sign at GZ (not the bus sign).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How To Figure Slope:&lt;br/&gt;To convert miles to feet, multiply miles by 5,280&lt;br/&gt;To calculate slope, divide the rise (elevation difference) by the run (ground distance) and multiply by 100. (rise/run x 100=grade%)&lt;br/&gt;Example:&lt;br/&gt;Rise: 3,000’– 2,000’= 1,000 feet elevation difference&lt;br/&gt;Run: 2 miles x 5,280= 10,560 feet &lt;br/&gt;       1,000’ (rise) / 10,560’ (run)= 0.094x100= 9.4% grade&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A.	43 06.892 –78 12.145 (Cache Coor.)&lt;br/&gt;B.	43 06.781 –78 12.778 (RP B)&lt;br/&gt;C.	43 06.941 –78 11.769 (RP C)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the above info., can you figure the following (include in post if you wish, not required)?&lt;br/&gt;1.   What is the grade of the Stoss End?&lt;br/&gt;2.   What is the grade of the Lee Slope?&lt;br/&gt;3.   What is the general alignment of the long axis?&lt;br/&gt;4.   What was the general direction of the advancing ice sheet?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;RB2K5X2 - GC2K5X2 RP B&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 06.781 W 078° 12.778&lt;br/&gt;Jct. of Ridge and Graham Rd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RC2K5X2 - GC2K5X2 RP C&lt;br/&gt;N 43° 06.941 W 078° 11.769&lt;br/&gt;Road/Stream crossing   </groundspeak:long_description>

Occasionally, unusual birds such as the cinnamon teal, ruddy duck, European widgeon, cackling goose, white-fronted goose, blue goose and snow goose are identified by the more serious observers. Interesting shore birds, marsh waders, warblers and other songbirds also use this excellent wildlife habitat and are a constant challenge in identification to the amateur and professional ornithologist, alike. the best time to view the outstanding waterfowl concentrations occurs from early March through the middle of May.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you have the time, I highly recommend climbing the tower.  The 360 degree view is outstanding.  I spotted things that I never knew were there and I literally lived just 5 minutes away for over 30 years.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This part of Western New York is rich in glacial history. If you look around you will see a landscape of glacial engineering. For example, at posted coordinates you are on top of one of many moraines in the area. This moraine is called the Barre Moraine. It roughly runs from Lockport to West Berre. To the north are the Albion Moraine and the Carlton Moraine. To the south are the Batavia Moraine, Niagara Falls Moraine and the Buffalo Moraine, to name a few. Other features visible from this location are a Kame Deposit, immediately to your northeast and a ridge of Glacial Till (Oak Orchard Ridge) to the south. Between the Barre Moraine and the Glacial Till is lowlands that is made up of Lacustrine Silt/Clay that was laid down by a post-glacial lake, Lake Tonawanda. Also near by are Eskers and the remains of and ancient beach. If you drive west, crossing over S. Gravel Rd. and drive down Dunlop Rd. you will come to where the Oak Orchard Creek breached this moraine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is a Moraine?&lt;br/&gt;A moraine is material transported by a glacier and then deposited. There are eight types of moraine, six of which form recognizable landforms, and two of which exist only whilst the glacier exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The types of moraine that form landforms are Ground,  Lateral,  Medial,  Push, Recessional and Terminal. The two types only associated with glacial ice are Supraglacial and Englacial moraine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ground Moraine &lt;br/&gt;A Ground Moraine is till deposited over the valley floor. It has no obvious features and is to be found where the glacier ice meets the rock underneath the glacier. It may be washed out from under the glacier by meltwater streams, or left in situ when the glacier melts and retreats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lateral Moraine&lt;br/&gt;A Lateral Moraine forms along the edges of the glacier. Material from the valley walls is broken up by frost shattering and falls onto the ice surface. It is then carried along the sides of the glacier. When the ice melts it forms a ridge of material along the valley side.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Medial Moraine &lt;br/&gt;A Medial Moraine is formed from two lateral moraines. When two glaciers merge, the two edges that meet form the center line of the new glacier. In consequence two lateral moraines find themselves in the middle of the glacier forming a line of material on the glacier surface. The existence of a medial moraine is evidence that the glacier has more than one source. When the ice melts it forms a ridge of material along the valley center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Push Moraine &lt;br/&gt;Push Moraines are only formed by glaciers that have retreated and then advance again. The existence of a push moraine is usually evidence of the climate becoming poorer after a relatively warm period. Material that had already been deposited is shoved up into a pile as the ice advances, and because most moraine material was deposited by falling down not pushing up, there are characteristic differences in the orientation of rocks within a push moraine. A key feature enabling a push moraine to be identified is individual rocks that have been pushed upwards from their original horizontal positions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recessional Moraine &lt;br/&gt;Recessional Moraines form at the end of the glacier so they are found across the valley, not along it. They form where a retreating glacier remained stationary for sufficient time to produce a mound of material. The process of formation is the same as for a terminal moraine, but they occur where the retreating ice paused rather than at the furthest extent of the ice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terminal Moraine &lt;br/&gt;The Terminal Moraine forms at the snout of the glacier. It marks the furthest extent of the ice, and forms across the valley floor. It resembles a large mound of debris, and is usually the feature that marks the end of unsorted deposits and the start of fluvially sorted material. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supraglacial Moraine &lt;br/&gt;Supraglacial Moraine is material on the surface of the glacier, including lateral and medial moraine, loose rock debris and dust settling out from the atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Englacial Moraine &lt;br/&gt;Englacial Moraine is any material trapped within the ice. It includes material that has fallen down crevasses and the rocks being scraped along the valley floor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you guess what type of Moraine this is? &lt;br/&gt;Enter this type of Moraine as the code phrase.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is further proof of that.  There are 3 trees here that have attempted to swallow something in their way.  Each one is different.  See if you can locate them all.&lt;br/&gt;I was totally unaware of this surprise when I came here at first.

The entrance is on County House Road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Residents at the Orleans County Alms House were a forgotten class of people, but thanks to an Albion service learning class’ hard work and the help of local officials and historians, the area where some of the Alms House residents were buried will be remembered.&lt;br/&gt;The graveyard had become lost in a patch of overgrowth surrounded by farm fields, but on Monday a large crowd was able to gather on the plot cleared and cleaned by the Orleans County Highway Department to dedicate a monument commemorating those who lived at the Alms House.&lt;br/&gt;The ceremony occurred one year to the day after Albion service learning teacher Tim Archer and a group of brave students discovered the first of 66 gravestones in the heavily wooded area. &lt;br/&gt;Archer’s seventh-grade class spent this school year poring through century-old documents in their search for information about those buried underneath numbered gravestones. The class determined the names of more than 160 of the residents buried at the Alms House using Board of Supervisors’ minutes, death ledgers and medical records.&lt;br/&gt;“These people were forgotten,” Archer said. “This project brings them back to life.”&lt;br/&gt;Orleans County Historian C.W. Lattin, who unveiled the monument with Albion student Dylan Bader, said the students’ effort ensures that the memory of the men and women buried in the graveyard will live on.&lt;br/&gt;“So long as we live, they, too, shall live,” said Lattin, quoting from a poem by Rabbi Roland Gittelsohn. “For they are now part of us, we remember them.”&lt;br/&gt;Speakers also celebrated the students for their effort.&lt;br/&gt;“Orleans County is proud of you,” Legislature Chairman David Callard told the assemblage of seventh-graders. “You took an idea, developed it and transferred it into something practical.”&lt;br/&gt;Archer said the class is finishing a book about the Alms House that will be available for purchase this summer. He said the class has made several touches to the site to ensure that future generations will remember their work.&lt;br/&gt;“The students planted three ceremonial trees that will be grown by the time they’re bringing their children here,” Archer said. &lt;br/&gt;The class will also bury a time capsule this fall.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The fifth in a series of caches hidden near historical locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A charming lakeside Regency cottage built c. 1850. It retains its original wrap-around verandah and spacious lawns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two interesting stories surrounding this building located on what used to be called Seminary Street.  The second one is more believable.  The first story says that the site of what is now known as the Breakers Motel is the same site that Calcutt called home when he first came to Cobourg. Calcutt built the main house on the property and called it &quot;Cold Blow&quot; which he used as a hideaway.  The house was to have also had secret tunnels that were installed to ensure safety.  The body of an old enemy of Calcutt washed up on shore after his death half a mile from the wharf, or so the story goes.  The story ends by saying that Mrs. Calcutt had been so terrified after finding the body that she refused to live in &quot;Cold Blow&quot; anymore.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second story follows history a bit better and is more logical.  The Breakers Motel was never built by the Calcutt family according to historian Rob Mikel.  Supporting proof for this also comes from the 1840's census role.  The house was not built by James Calcutt Jr., Calcutt's son, but rather by a Judge George Boswell in 1840.  The property did indeed find itself in the hands of the Calcutt's some ten years later when Calcutt Jr. purchased it from Boswell.  It is believed that James Jr., and his brother Kingsley ran a small branch brewery during the time when his father was selling Lakehurst.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no parking near the cache location. Please park on Bay street and walk down to the cache.  The cache is NOT located on private property so no need to trespass to find it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a 35mm film canister FIRMLY attached to its hiding spot. Do not remove the cache from it's hiding spot - just remove the lid and sign the log book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container SHOULD be water proof but if not I'll put a bag on the log book. Probably no room for trades (except possibly very small ones).</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The first in a series of caches hidden near historical locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ontario Woollen Mills was the largest industry in Cobourg for most of the 19th century. It was begun about 1845 by Stuart McKechnie and this two brothers. It was later carried on by Alexander Fraser and William Rosamond. At the turn of the century the factory was bought by the Dick Family from Montreal.  At its peak it manufactured over 400,000 yards of cloth a year and was one of the largest industries of its kind in Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mill was built on Factory Creek (also called Jones' creek, Cobourg Brook and currently Cobourg Creek) on the south side of King Street West. It used water from the dam which had been built much earlier (~1804) 200 feet north of King street - probably by John Nugen. The water was carried in a five foot wooden enclosed flume that went under King street to the basement of the Mill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mill building was mainly brick, 4 and half stories high, 100 feet long and 40 wide. The basement housed the water wheel, the fulling machinery (Fulling is the process of fluffing up an already woven or knitted piece of woolen cloth) , finishing room and dye house. On the second floor was the weaving department with its Power Loom. The third floor housed the Carding room where wool was processed from its raw state so that it was ready for spinning into yarn on the fourth floor. The fifth floor was really an attic and was used for drying the wool after it was washed and dyed.  A feature of the Mill was that it was steam heated so that there was less of a fire hazard - always a problem in those days. Employment at the Mill was reported to be 170 people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mill location is currently occupied by a building that used to be The Cobourg Daily Star newspaper offices and is now up for sale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a lock-and-lock and has lots of nice swag for trade.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The fourth in a series of caches hidden near historical locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The consensus amongst historians seems to be that the first settler in Cobourg was Eliud Nickerson who built a cabin near King and Division Streets in 1798. The settlement he founded was first called Buckville, after Elijah Buck, who settled there in 1808 and opened a tavern. Later, the settlement was named Amherst, after Baron Amherst (and the same name as another local village with its centre at Elgin and Burnham Streets). Even later, the settlement was called Hamilton, after the township. It was also nicknamed Hardscrabble (because the settlers had a hard time scratching out a living). Finally, in 1891 it was officially named Cobourg in honour of the marriage of princess Charlotte Augusta, Princess of Wales, daughter of George IV&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is believed that he built his house near where this cache is located.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the area is literally saturated with muggles during the day thus extreme stealth will be required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a black bison tube (knock-off that I got at a Dollar Store) FIRMLY attached to its hiding spot. Do not remove the cache from it's hiding spot - just unscrew it from the lid and sign the log book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container SHOULD be water proof but if not I'll put a bag on the log book.  If it does hold up well to weather I'll buy some more and stop using 35mm film cans.  No room for trades in this one.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The third in a series of caches hidden near historical locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Albion Cottage was built in the 1820s by John Vance Boswell, brother of Judge George Boswell. In 1867, Boswell sold the house to Colonel Chambliss, an American who had moved to Cobourg that year to become Manager of the Cobourg-Marmora Railway and Mining Company. The house was destroyed by a fire in 1879. Following the fire, Chambliss built a much larger house, which the Cornells purchased in 1890 and renamed &quot;Hadfield Hurst&quot;. In 1929, the property was purchased for use as a private girls school and once again renamed to Hatfield Hall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hatfield Hall, private Residential School for Girls, opened its doors to receive the first boarders on September 17th, 1929. Miss W.M. Wilson, B.A., Honours, London, England and Miss W.M. Ellis, B.Sc., London, England were the co-principals and Rev. T. Stannage Boyle, D.D., D.C.L. was President of the Board of Trustees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Board of Trustees decided that &quot;Hatfield Hall&quot;, the name of the residence of Queen Elizabeth I, was a more suitable name for a girl's school. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stable of the Main House, known as the Lodge, was converted into a gymnasium with a dormitory and All Saints Chapel on the second floor. The Chapel was dedicated on November 1st, 1929 by the Lord Bishop of Toronto. It operated until 1951.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The building currently is a set of apartments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a 35mm film canister FIRMLY attached to its hiding spot. Do not remove the cache from it's hiding spot - just remove the lid and sign the log book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container SHOULD be water proof but if not I'll put a bag on the log book. Probably no room for trades (except possibly very small ones).</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The second in a series of caches hidden near historical locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sidbrook is a rare surviving example of an early Victorian villa in Cobourg and also an example of the grand summer houses that once line Cobourg streets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Called Sidbrook because of its most recent use as a Private Hospital, this is one of Cobourg's best known Heritage buildings.  The &quot;villa&quot; was originally two storeys and had a flat roof, built for Cobourg Railway director Henry Mason.  In 1868, the structure was altered to add the &quot;High Italianate design&quot; and the large west wing and hipped roof. Toronto architect Kivas Tully, who designed Victoria Hall, was involved in this work.  The third floor of the building was added in 1900 by William Abbott of Pittsburgh, an associate of industrialist Andrew Carnegie. Also added at that time was the &quot;Beau-arts Corinthian portico with balcony and its one-storey Corinthian porch&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note : The nearby buildings are private property and they are posted &quot;No Trespassing&quot;. They should be considered off-limits - they do not need to be approached in order to find this geocache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a 35mm film canister FIRMLY attached to its hiding spot. Do not remove the cache from it's hiding spot - just remove the lid and sign the log book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The container SHOULD be water proof but if not I'll put a bag on the log book. Probably no room for trades (except possibly very small ones).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area is surrounded on all sides by private houses so poking around at night with a flash-light is not recommended as it might freak out the neighbours.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; While visiting the Hooligan family for
Easter, my brother (the Head Hooligan) and I were discussing the
lack of caches in the area that he has not found or placed himself.
I decided that I would put out a cache for him before we headed
home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The next day, our two families went out for a hike minus him, as he
had to work. The littlest Hooligans had run out of steam by the
time we finished the Googly series, so they headed back, and the
mutt and I headed further down the trail, and found this rather
good hiding spot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Good luck and have fun! (P.S. Put out some
more caches...)&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It's small, so don't bring anything too big to swap with. I placed the cache near the edge of the marsh, off the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's about an hour hike with no extended breaks, on a well beaten trail/fire route. This route is popular with ATVers and snowmobilers, so lookout for motorized vehicles. The actual hike and the cache location are easy to get to, but due to the extended drive to get to pencil lake and being in the middle of no-where, I recommend spending the night. Also be warned of excessive flies and mosquitoes mid-summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also very limited parking available near Pencil Lake. Don't come during long weekends, impossible to park anywhere.</groundspeak:long_description>

Terrain is a little tough but still walkable with ease if you take your time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I decided to put thsi on out while in the area on a little weekend family vacation. It is in a great area to watch nature. When I was placing this cache I was visited by a group of about 10-12 deer. What a pleasing sight! I nice quick cache to do while visiting the area. Hope you enjoy the walk in nature as much as I did..... maybe you can the two others nearby that I have placed while in the area. &lt;br/&gt;Happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

After 2 two portages and a wonderful encounter with a moose and her 2 calves I wound up on Knife Lake where a freak thunderstorm drove me to shore and set up a shelter with my canoe. &lt;br/&gt;So here I was, just me and about two million mosquitoes and deer flies sitting under an upside down canoe waiting out the rain for 2hrs. I had planned to make Jean Lake before days end it but it wasn't meant to be. &lt;br/&gt;Despite the rain and insects it was a good day on the water. So to mark the end of the day I left a cache at the head of the Jean Lake portage near the site of my temporary rain shelter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe next time I'll make Jean Lake or maybe just see where fate takes me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;May your paddles bring you just as many pleasures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I forgot to leave a pencil in the cache so BYOP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK317AJ - Herb Lake Access Point&lt;br/&gt;N 45° 14.753 W 078° 47.690&lt;br/&gt;Parking and access point, washroom also available</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a water only access cache, so you will require a canoe to
get to it. The best starting point is the Herb Lake portage access.
You can drive your boat down to waters edge at this access point
and it also has &quot;facilities&quot;. You can find the access point at N45
14.753 W078 47.690 The driveway can be reached from Kawagama Lake
Rd. This beautiful shallow lake will provide some great swimming
and canoeing and the fishing shows some potential as well. The
cache is on the Haliburton Highlands Water Trail and near one of
the on shore campsites. You can also access Rocky Wilderness GC1613
by just paddling a little further into Ernest Lake (no portage
required) A two for one special! If you decide to go on there is a
great little rock island where you can stop and swim. Cache is a
white round rubbermaid type container.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKPP2E - Parking and Boat Launch&lt;br /&gt;N 45° 14.753 W 078° 47.690&lt;br /&gt;Herb Lake Access Point. Parking, Boat Launch and washroom facilities available.</groundspeak:long_description>

there just aren't enough of them. Terrain on this one is steep, but
the view is worth it. Be careful as there are some steep drops in
the area.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
Flowing out of Kawagama Lake is the Hollow river, tucked away from
Haliburton Road #8 is a small set of falls. The cache is located
near those falls. There is limited parking at the staging area
located at N45° 15.396 W078° 51.503. Please be careful as the slope
can be slippery at times and its a long quick ride to the bottom.
Best route is to go up the rockface to the trail on top and then
back down to the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The Cache is in a standard Rubbermaid container and contains the
following:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Compass/Whistle&lt;br /&gt;
Canadian blow up beach ball&lt;br /&gt;
Wooden model&lt;br /&gt;
Flashing superball&lt;br /&gt;
Allen key set&lt;br /&gt;
Canada keychain&lt;br /&gt;
Keychain from my hometown&lt;br /&gt;
compass/thermometer biner keychain &lt;br /&gt;
 The cache is located about 130m from the staging area.&lt;br /&gt;
Look for the cache where something has fallen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PKGQME - Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 45° 15.396 W 078° 51.503</groundspeak:long_description>

Heading back home and just had to go for this cache.  Talked my friend &quot;Goldy&quot; into searching for this cache with me - thus this will be his first.  

Took TB left &quot;RFD&quot; key chain.

accessed from either the Tea Lake dam picnic area, or the Tea Lake
campground depending on how much paddling you want to do... if you
feel really adventerous you could even rent your canoe from the
portage store on canoe lake and paddle all the way to the cache
=)
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;Originally owned by:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=07ef8b4a-8043-4953-b9d6-7cba130e3085&quot;&gt;
Dave (Think), and Glenn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in Algonquin Provincial Park, in Ontario
Canada. A permit is required to use the park, and therefore one is
needed to access this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located on Tea Lake off highway sixty in the park.
For the short route you can start from the Tea Lake dam picnic
area, or for a longer route you can start from the beach at the Tea
Lake campground (or even longer route is from the portage store on
canoe lake, where you can rent canoes!). Either will work. It would
be a big mistake to try and walk to this cache, it must be accessed
by canoe, however since the lake is relativly small, it is an easy
paddle, and wind is rarely a problem here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &quot;Canoe routes of Algonquin park&quot; map would definately be a
good idea especially if you decide to approach this from one of the
two distant access points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original contents include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 AA batteries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Algonquin Park Post card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energizer Pocket Flashlight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire Starter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plastic water-tight match container&lt;/li&gt;

It only took us 15 minutes to get there and we were surprised to find another familiar signature (chris-mouse) from the same day already in the log book before us. Our arms were still sore from the previous day's paddle, but we managed [:D]

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is the first northern interior Algonquin Park cache originally
placed by Alex and Mike. It is an enjoyable half day canoe trip
including at least 1 portage. If you are lucky you might run into a
moose grazing on lilly pads on your trip. You must have a permit to
make this trip. If you are not staying on one of the car camping
sites or planning to find the cache on an overnight canoe trip you
need to have a day permit. You can get a permit from the Parks
office. It is in an A-frame building at the southern end of Canoe
Lake along Highway 60. If you don't own one, you can rent a canoe
from the Portage Store. It is under the restaurant and giftshop
near the docks. An Algonquin Canoe Routes map would also be
helpful, otherwise it is easy to get lost! Bring lots of water,
snacks and lunch. 
&lt;p&gt;The cache is in a clear plastic tupperware container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a good trip and Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Remember what the cache is called!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
