your part to practice CITO whenever you're out caching. If you're
good at it just bring the bags here! A pretty standard hide near a
facility that had me laughing at the name &amp; acronym. As with
all Kenai Peninsula caches, Please DO NOT add trackables to this
cache, they don't stand a chance in this area
&lt;p&gt;I averaged 500+ times but never got better than +/- 17'. If any
cachers get better numbers please mention them in you logs&lt;/p&gt;

Located at the beginning (or end?) of the Mize's Folly trail in Kincaid Park.  This cache may be winter accessible, but only if you are on cross country skis. Once they groom the trails any other mode of transportation is heavily frowned upon.  Up until they are groomed though, you can access the cache on foot or by bike and with the dogs.  No bushwacking required for this one.

Enjoy the hunt and please replace any covering cammo you may find surrounding the cache.

This is not your usual cache placement, so get seriously creative in your thinking.  I tried to pick an area that was sans caches though it turned out to be chock full O' moose, so be careful.  As always, you should probably take along your favorite mosquito, moose, and bear spray.  You can gain access from a few directions.  One offers minimal bushwacking, the others, a bit more and it is only going to get worse as the summer moves on.  I could easily have called this &quot;Devils Club Haven&quot;, but &quot;Anti-Gravity&quot; is so much better and it also provides a hint.  Enjoy the hunt and please replace the cache just like you found it.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">CONGRATULATIONS TO MALCORE FOR FTF!!! Even after reading the initial logs, Malcore was not deterred and went after, found, and had a swing!  Way to Go!!!!

Given the initial feedback by some worthy cachers, I'll add this for others who may wish to have a swing and give the cache a try:  1.  The coords are good-I've been back to make sure and I can tell by the signs left by those who have tried to find it that their GPS's took them to the correct spot as well  2.  I'm not sure of the condition of the tree, it looks fine to me and I've enjoyed many swings, but please use your own judgement when deciding to swing or not to swing as I can not vouche for it's safety   3.  Bushwacking is not required as there is a dirt road which leads to a trail (albiet somewhat overgrown at this time of year), which leads directly to the cache site.  Retrieving the cache does not require going into any of the surrounding Devils Club nor does it require any special effort.  4.  Sometimes it is the obvious that is the most difficult.

I found this spot while on the way to another cache.  I won't say which one because it is embarassing how far off course I was.  [:)]
One of the great things about caching is it gets you to areas you might otherwise miss, like this one.

There is no room in this cache for pencil, pen, or trade items.

Enjoy a swing on me!

Wouldn't you welcome the skill to decypher the most devious of hints and find the most cleverly hidden micros and nanos?  Do you not want the Glory and Fame that would be yours as Anchorage's Premier Geocacher? Even better than Scobey?  Even better than Oleruns?  Even better than AKwhodini, Tundra Tim, LBK and NorthWes?  To obtain your every geocaching desire, all you must do is take a bite.&quot;
 
&quot;Go ahead...it's just a bite, what are you waiting for?&quot; 

Forbidden Fruit is another of my southern end (Kincaid to Pt. Woronzof) Coastal Trail caches.  I have Horsegeeks of North Carolina to thank for this idea.

This cache is not far off the trail which is paved in the summer and groomed for skiiers in the winter.  The only reason the terrain rating is a 3 is because of its distance to parking and because of the hill going to and from the Kincaid Chalet; otherwise, the trail is just about level.

Please do not try to remove the small container from the larger container.  It is not necessary in order to retrieve the log.  You'll see what I mean when you get there.  TAKE YOUR OWN PENCIL!

CONGRATS TO MALCORE FOR YET ANOTHER FTF!  Glad you decided not to take a bite!

There are some short but steep ups and downs to get to this one, but once you are near, it's not far off the trail.  Please observe the archery range caution signs.  This cache is NOT on the range.  I made an effort to hide this for year 'round discovery (we'll see how those efforts pay off come December).  Please use care when extracting and replacing the cache as we don't want those archer muggles finding it on their way to their next station.  Please replace the natural camo as best you can.  Happy Hunting!

It wasn't until a lovely Lady Moose decided to move that I noticed her.  She had been quietly watching from a distance of about 30 feet.  I spoke, she nodded and went on with her munching, doing a very close circumnavigation of the cache site.

This cache should be available during the winter with up to 1-2ft. of snow. I hope....we'll see.

Happy Hunting and keep an eye out for the lovely Lady Moose.

Most were civilian aircraft headed for friendly places.  One aircraft, though, looked like a Herc, maybe from Kulis and I wondered if it was flying a sortie or carrying troops to Afghanistan.  Here's wishing for safety and a speedy return!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Mia is my &quot;princess&quot; niece.  She is very girly, loved dolls and all things girly.  One of my best memories of her is when she dressed her dog up in doll clothes and pushed the dog around the house in a stroller.  Her dog was so cooperative that she even held a pacifier in her mouth while being pushed around.  It was so cute!  Mia plays some sports and she has a black belt in Tae Kwon Do. I don't get to see my niece nearly enough so I have created this cache in her honor.  Both of my nieces now have their &quot;own&quot; cache and I can't wait to take them to the caches when they come up to visit!  Mia sent me some of her favorite things to share with other young girls.

She enjoys sports and is very competitive.  The last time I saw her I spent a great deal of time pitching for her.  With a great eye for tracking the ball she was hitting them almost every time!  Ariel has a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and I can't wait to be able to see her compete!  I have to settle for photos right now.  This cache include some small items that she enjoyed  and wanted me to share.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The high terrain rating is due to the long haul needed to get to this area. It is not a day hike by any means unless you are already staying at one of the numerous lodges in the area.

Summertime access will require a lengthy ride in a jet boat. Wintertime access is just a snowmobile ride away and will truely make this one a drive-up.

The fishing in the fish creek area is great, I particularly like the ice fishing here.
