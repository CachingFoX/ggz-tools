the past but I'm sure we'd all notice if it were gone! Please do
your part to practice CITO whenever you're out caching. If you're
good at it just bring the bags here! A pretty standard hide near a
facility that had me laughing at the name &amp; acronym. As with
all Kenai Peninsula caches, Please DO NOT add trackables to this
cache, they don't stand a chance in this area
&lt;p&gt;I averaged 500+ times but never got better than +/- 17'. If any
cachers get better numbers please mention them in you logs&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Caution: Stolen goods here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hmmm....  There was this Geofest 2010 and there was a chinese auction.  Great fun to be had!  Bara took possession of this can from another player and his &quot;production&quot; of taking possession was top notch!  Very entertaining stuff there.  Somehow, during the auction, I stole (in not as dramatic a fashion) this ammo can from Baradora.  OK, maybe &quot;stole&quot; is a bit harsh. Perhaps I reassigned ownership without the consent of the current owner and moved it from their table to mine.  Anyway, this can ended up in my possession and now I am hiding it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache could almost be a park and grab.  You won't have to walk far if you park in the right place.  Be watchful of muggles.  Lots of people like to sit and watch or photograph aircraft in this area. This is prime viewing area, which also means it could be noisy but I love airplane noise. The day I placed the cache I was dodging photographers, moose and joggers with dogs.  If you have access to an aviation radio or scanner that gets aviation frequencies you might enjoy listening in as you watch the planes, that is, after you find the cache!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Mia is my &quot;princess&quot; niece.  She is very girly, loved dolls and all things girly.  One of my best memories of her is when she dressed her dog up in doll clothes and pushed the dog around the house in a stroller.  Her dog was so cooperative that she even held a pacifier in her mouth while being pushed around.  It was so cute!  Mia plays some sports and she has a black belt in Tae Kwon Do. I don't get to see my niece nearly enough so I have created this cache in her honor.  Both of my nieces now have their &quot;own&quot; cache and I can't wait to take them to the caches when they come up to visit!  Mia sent me some of her favorite things to share with other young girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coords averaged 350 times at 9ft accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Way to go Quadventure on the FTF! &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
