&lt;p&gt;The cache is an easy park and grab. Located on the corner of a
great neighborhood park (Waikele Community Park) with a view of the
palm-tenna. Besides being the site of the little germs annual
school Olympics. The park is home to a playground, a pool, and
loads of room to run around. It's a great place to spend some time
with the kids, if they don't wanna go shopping in the nearby
mall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park is closed from 10pm to 5am, but the cache is still
accessible. There is not much room for trades and you need to bring
your own pen. The 2 star difficulty rating is due to the possible
high muggle factor during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supa Dupa Stealth may be required on Sundays during the People's
Open Market (11:30am to 12:30pm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don't mess with the &lt;b&gt;BLACK&lt;/b&gt; cover thingy.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Spawn from the ashes of the former plantation fields owned by
Castle &amp; Cooke, Mililani Town was the first master planned
community on the island of O'ahu. Located near the center of the
island, Mililani has a population of 28,608 (2000 census). In 1986,
Mililani was awarded the title of All-America City by the
National Civic League. It is the
only community in Hawaii ever to receive that distinction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Some other interesting facts about Mililani: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On June 3, 1968, 112 houses were originally offered for
purchase at $25,000 to $35,000 each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Original plan called for seven trees per home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On April 6, 1990, ground was broken for Mililani Mauka with the
first homeowners moving in, in 1992&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2003, Mililani was designated as the pilot site for the City
and County of Honolulu's curbside recycling program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2004, Mililani resident Jasmine Trias was a contestant on
American Idol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2005, Money magazine named Mililani as one of the best
places to live in the U.S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2006, Mililani Ike Elementary School first grade teacher
Phyllis Nakama-Kawamoto was named Hawaii's American Star of
Teaching by the U.S. Department of Education.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the cache, there is &lt;b&gt;No Parking&lt;/b&gt; near GZ. Safe
parking can be found in the neighborhood at these coords N21 27.691
W158 00.591. There are areas that are closer, but you have to cross
streets and the terrain isn't really 1. Lastly, don't forget to

&lt;p&gt;My groomsmen asked me what I wanted to do for my Bachelor party
and I replied, &quot;Let's climb the highest peak on O'ahu!&quot; After some
moaning and groaning they agreed . Being a noob back in 2006 I called the Masta -
Crider and asked if he wanted to come along and keep us on the
right trail. Since he was doing some trail clearing in his valley
that day, he kindly agreed to take us half way. After pointing us
in the right direction, we were off. We made it up to 3 poles in no
time at all and found the cache there. But, here's where the mutiny
occurred! After resting a bit, my groomsmen decided that they had
had enough. They used the impending rain clouds and the slight
drizzle as an excuse to head back down. Being out numbered 3 to 1,
I reluctantly agreed vowing to one day return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flash forward 2 years, 8 months, and 10 days to today. My wife
(the reason for the original hike ), asked me what I wanted to do for my
birthday and I replied, &quot;Let's climb the highest peak on O'ahu!&quot;
She said, &quot;OK!&quot; Several hours later we were on the summit and I was
placing this cache .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a water bottle that came with a fanny pack I used
to buy. The pack was terrible lasting only a few months, but the
bottles seem to be pretty sturdy. It is tied to the base of a small
tree. Watch out for thorns!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/u&gt; You are under no
obligation to hunt my cache. You do so at your own risk. Like any
outdoor sport, it carries the risk of unforeseen hazards. Use your
best judgment with the environment and conditions. As conditions
and cache locations may vary, it is the responsibility of the
searcher to be familiar with the conditions in the area to be
searched, to adequately prepare for those conditions, and to
conduct oneself safely and responsibly and remain within his or her
personal abilities and limitations. Children should be well
supervised. When and if you find a cache, you are under no
obligation to touch it, reach it, climb to it, dig for it, pick it
up, or even open it. Open it at your own risk. If food or drink is
present, do not consume it, throw it out. Individual Geostash and
GPS cache sponsors assume no liability for events, which may occur,
related directly or indirectly to your searching for a
stash.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;&quot;Lost&quot;&lt;/b&gt;, is a serial drama television
series that follows the lives of a group of plane crash survivors
on a mysterious tropical island, somewhere in the South Pacific.
The show is filmed primarily on location in Oahu, Hawaii. The pilot
episode was first broadcast on September 22, 2004. Since then, six
seasons have aired and the last episode will air on May 23, 2010.
The show is produced by ABC Television Studio (formerly Touchstone
Television), Bad Robot Productions and Grass Skirt Productions and
airs on the ABC Network in the U.S. Because of its large ensemble
cast and the cost of filming in Hawaii, the series is one of the
most expensive on television.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cache info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located along Farrington Hwy right before YMCA's Camp
Erdman where they have filmed parts of &quot;Lost&quot;. A little further
past the cache site you will see the mustard color cabins on the
left that was &quot;Othersville&quot;. Please do not enter the cabin area as
it is private property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cache info:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located on Mokule'ia Beach where they have filmed and
still film parts of &quot;Lost&quot;. This is the spot, in Season 1, where
the center portion of Oceanic Flight 815 came to rest after
separating from the plane in flight. The body of the plane prop can
still be seen across the street, on the mauka (mountain) side of
the Dillingham runway. If you arrive at the coordinates to find a
slew of trailers and muggles, it might not be a good time to hunt
for it. You will undoubtedly get shooed away by security and the
HPD (Honolulu Police Department).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5/16/2010 Update - the Plane crash parts on the other side of
Dilingham airfield have been removed .&lt;br /&gt;

I had decided to go on a little driving tour to a part of the island I had not been to before and this cache was along the way. I wasn't sure if I'd have time for caching on Friday and/or Saturday and I knew I wanted to find this one!  I pulled up on the beach right at sunset, there were a few men here fishing, but I didn't seem to bother them as I headed off in the other direction.  Soon, I was at the beach!  Very cool!  Found the cache in short order after snapping a few pics!

Disappointed as several TB's seem to be missing (Border Patrol, Katabria, and &quot;Hugo&quot;).  Maybe they've been grabbed but not yet logged.  I took the remaining TB and dropped off two new ones that I had held on to for quite a while.  Time for them to move along!  Mahalo!

It says we were in the right place and we searched and searched but nothing seems ti be here but a beautiful view. maybe it got picked up in all t he garbage or by someone at the surfing competition. also, the compass would just spin  whenever we got around 2 feet and 0 kept moving. We'd love to try again after you check on it! Thank you!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;b&gt;Laniakea Beach&lt;/b&gt; a.k.a. Lani's Beach or
“Turtle Beach” is not hard to find. From the historic
town of Haleiwa travel about 1.5 miles up Kamehameha Highway to
just before Pohaku Loa Way. When you see alot of cars parked in the
dirt on the right-hand side 'pull in !!!'. Across the street is
Laniakea Beach. The traffic is very heavy in this area, so please
take care when crossing the 2-lane highway. As always, don't leave
anything of value in the car.
&lt;p&gt;Lani's is a well known surfing spot on Oahu's North Shore. The
beach offers great sand and an opportunity to relax. So, bring your
swim wear and snorkel gear to enjoy a day at the beach. ***Swim At
Your Own Risk! There is no lifeguard on duty and there are signs
warning of strong rip tides. Please be careful!***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing about Laniakea Beach is the green sea turtles.
These green sea turtles (called honu in Hawaiian) can be seen close
to shore feeding on the seaweed growing on the rocks. The green sea
turtle is a reptile that can live up to 80 years of age. Like other
reptiles, the green sea turtle is cold-blooded. So they will
sometimes haul themselves up on the beach to bask in the warm
Hawaiian sun.&lt;/p&gt;
Mostly a friendly lot, they have been known to snap or nip at
people who have gotten to close. So keep these four simple rules in
mind when interacting with the sea turtles.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;While snorkeling or swimming, try to give
the green sea turtles 10 feet of space, and do not block the path
of a surfacing sea turtle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please do not block their way as they make
their way up the beach.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do not handle, touch, or feed the sea
turtles.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Never ever ride on or sit on a green sea
turtle!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The green sea turtle was listed as endangered/threatened species
on July 28, 1978 under the federal Endangered Species Act. It is
also protected under Hawaii state law. The green sea turtle is a
wild animal. Extra care should be taken when interacting with any
wild animal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more info on Green Sea Turtles visit Green Sea
Turtles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now for the cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The listed coords should take you to the road just outside of the
little pine tree grove (behind signs in picture). The cache is
about 5 feet makai of spot. It's not on the beach, but you can be
seen from there. So be stealthy. Cache is a cammo taped
Lock-n-Lock, amongst the pine needles. Please rehide it well.
Turtle swag would be cool!&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After landing at the airport I headed up here so that I could take some pictures of the Honu. When I got to the beach the turtles were eating seaweed off of the rocks and many people were standing on the rocks watching them so I headed across the rocks to watch. My foot slipped on the last rock and I, my Garmin and my camera went swimming with the turtles. Other than my pride being hurt I was OK and the trusty Garmin was still dutifully pointing towards the cache. My camera on the other hand appears to be a victim of death by seawater. After a few minutes two of the turtles headed up the beach to warm up. The picture I took is the best I could do with my cell phone. I found the cache without being observed while everyone was watching the turtles and headed back down to my hotel. Thanks for another great cache.</groundspeak:text>

Was on a little sight seeing loop with Homebru and getting a few caches also.  I sure am happy to have had this cache here, if it was not we might have drove right on by and missed the turtles.  We saw 3 on the beach and a few more in the water.  Sudsy made the find for us on this one.  TNLN.

Thanks for an excellent adventure! We were told by littletreasurehunters not to miss you and we're glad we didn't! We got to see two turtles, one south of the cache and one north of the cache. One was swimming underwater and the other one was up on the shore. Very gentle good natured fellows! Thanks again for the fun!</groundspeak:text>
