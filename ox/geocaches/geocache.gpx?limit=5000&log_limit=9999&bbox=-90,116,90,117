            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Prince Philip Park is located next to the First Beach in Tanjung Aru, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. It is the first public park in Kota Kinabalu and was built to commemorate the Royal Visit to Sabah by the British Royal Family. The park was named after Prince Philip, the consort of Queen Elizabeth II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This park offer a spectacular tropical sea view with a dazzling romantic sunset ambience along superb beach. There are numerous mature casurina trees. Unfortunately, the park facilities are a bit run down as the City Hall hasnt been active in repairing the old corroded facilities. But, there are 2 first class public toilets located in the Park, one built by the Kota Kinabalu City Hall while the other is built by the Malaysia Ministry of Tourism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located about 80m from a house of the city hall worker. You will be searching for a 1 litre icecream container with a logbook inside a a few FTF goodies for you to keep. When you are at the GZ, take a seat.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Double Six Monument is located in Sembulan, marking a significant tragedy in the history of Sabah. On June 6th, 1976, an airplane carrying Sabah’s fifth Chief Minister, Tun Mohd. Fuad Stephens and six other State ministers crashed, killing all on board. The Double Six monument was erected on the exact spot of the fatal crash.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a magnetic nano that can take some small coins. It is located in the so called Grace Point : Secret Garden of Kota Kinabalu. Its best not to go there in the evening to avoid lots of little muggle. Once you are at GZ, take a seat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Getting There&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monument is a 10-minute drive from Kota Kinabalu city. A taxi ride from the city centre will cost approximately RM15.00 (one way). Take Bus no. 17B (marked ‘Putatan’) from the bus station in front of Wawasan Plaza for RM1.50 per person (one way). Buses run from 6:30am to 8:00pm. You probably need to get off at the Sutera harbour traffic lights. Not sure if the Bus goes to the Grace Point Food Court.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Admission is free</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Atkinson Clock Tower is one of the oldest building in Kota Kinabalu, previously known as Jesselton. The building of the Clock Tower was initiated in 1902 through public donation and was completed in 1905. It was originally built as a memorial to the first District Officer. Mr Francis George Atkinson who had died in 1902 of “Borneo fever” (malaria) at the age of 28. The clock was started on April 19, 1905 while still under construction. Originally built of Merbau wood, the Clock Tower stands at 157 metres (48 feet) high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the years, through repairs and extensive renovations, the original façade has altered significantly. It was refurbished in 1959 to celebrate the city’s diamond jubilee. It is said that the original clock, a double faced clock that was a gift from Atkinson’s mother to him, was replaced in 1964. The tower once served as a lighthouse to guide sailors, when it wa nearer to the shore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sabah Museum took over the care and maintenance of the Clock Tower in 1979 and the site was gazetted as a Government Reserve in August 1983. It was designated a heritage site in 1998.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located in a clump of Oil Palm trees about 70 metres to the south of Atkinson Clock Tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After you are done with this cache, dont forget to go to [url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=6519a6a2-747a-442c-a733-fb6d62946399]Signal Hill[/url] located about 600m away.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The 0 Km milestone of Sabah was launched on March 16 2011. It is located in front of the old Post Office from where distances were measured as postmen walked or cycled to deliver mail. Now all roads will lead to this point on the floor adjacent to the entrance of the Sabah Tourism Board which is housed in the old Post Office since 1987. Their distances will be measured from the compass points of the 0 Km marker embedded on the outer floor of the building. This is one of three remaining colonial ones that survived the second world war from 1939 to 1945. The others are the Atkinson clock tower, and a building built of wood and concrete next to the Standard Chartered Bank that once housed the Sabah welfare department. Only pillars of it remain after a mysterious fire razed it on December 31 in 1992.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first official use of the old post office as a road distance marker in post colonial Sabah was announced in the government gazette of 1996.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Royal Institution of Surveyors Malaysia (Sabah Branch) decided to re-establish the 0 Km marker to mark its 50th anniversary. The project is carried out together with the Kota Kinabalu City Hall and the Sabah Tourism Board. The board will maintain the monument as it expects it to draw tourists to visit the spot. </groundspeak:long_description>

easily accessable in one or 1,5 hours by public bus or train.
&lt;p&gt;If you want to find the cache (size is between small and regular
and has enough space for Travel Bugs) please use the waypoints. You
need at least 30 minutes from W1 to the cache. The part on the
Great Wall is quite steep. The following trail, starting at W2 is
fairly small and slippery in wet conditions and gets thorny on the
last 10m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not try to find this cache in the snow because your
footprints will lead the local muggles to the hiding place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun and don't forget the spoiler pictures!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small note on cache maintenance: &quot;bj-b&quot; will
assist.
