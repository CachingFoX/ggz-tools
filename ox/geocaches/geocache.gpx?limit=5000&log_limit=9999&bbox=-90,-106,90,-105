The cache is a small to medium sized container that contains a log book, a pen, and the usual trading items.

Note: There could be an occasional snake in the area, so watch your step.

NOTE: This was the first geocache hidden in Colorado, and is only a couple of miles from where the Hayman fire started a number of years ago.

5 gal orange bucket located in a good spot with a nice view of the area. Very easy to get to this one. Bring a book, take a seat, and enjoy listening to the wind in the trees. 

NOTE For &quot;Flatlanders&quot; (people not from Colorado). Some flatlanders say the Terrain should be marked as a 2. Its not difficult, but you do have to go up a small hill which at 8,000+ feet elevation can cause you to breathe hard due to the thin air here. :) I'll compromise and call it a 1.6 now.</groundspeak:long_description>

I am quite touched to find a cache that has been hidden since eleven years ago and that is still in such a good condition.
Glad that the road was usable to bring me here.
There was some snow falling when I arrived but not that much was left on the ground. It eventually stopped as I hiked up to this awesome cache.
What a great day for me :cute:!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Part of the Argentine Railroad Grade series. A small cache at Pavilion Point. This cache has room for small trade items and travel bugs.

There are two ways to get to the cache location. From Silver Plume, the Argentine Pass railroad grade is a good hiking or biking trail, but does not allow motorized vehicles. This route is about a 3 mile hike that passes several old mines along the way. There are many side trails that lead to even more abandoned mines to explore. Bring plenty of water, as there is little along the way.

The alternative route leaves from Guanella Pass Rd., south of Georgetown. This road allows motorized vehicles. I recommend a high clearance vehicle, with 4 wheel drive vehicle (or ATV/dirt bike), depending on the time of year. Start up the mostly paved Guanella Pass Rd, then take the dirt road to the right at N 39° 40.990 W 105° 42.175. Follow the arrow 'til you get to the cache. 

At the cache location is an old chimney and a scenic view of Silver Plume, Clear Creek, and the Georgetown Loop Railroad. The large chimney is all that remains of a historic pavilion overlooking Georgetown and the surrounding valleys. The pavilion was a favorite destination for day trips during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The location of the hiding spot is fairly obvious, but please don't move any rocks until you know it's the right one. The cache will be visible, though not easy to spot.

I have replaced the cache with a temporary container and a temporary log until I can find a container that fits better.  Go ahead and sign the temporary log if you find it.</groundspeak:text>

This cache is placed in an area I used to come to when I was in high-school and college to just relax and view the city or do homework. I decided for this cache I would go to the store and buy a variety of geocaching items for the cache contents. Please trade like items to help keep this cache nice. I hope you enjoy this cache. There are cactus, yuca plant, and shrub oak on this cache. I recommend you wear pants and a good pair of shoes. The trail to follow looks like it's from animals. Also the above parking coordinates is the only place you can park for this cache. Anywhere else is considered private land. Pay attention to the signs and fence lines as well, as will all open space areas, not all is public and it's clearly marked and easy to see where you can go and not go. There is a 425 foot Altitude change from parking to cache location. As the crow flies the round trip is 1.5 miles. If you are lucky you might get to watch a train.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This location is an overlook of the old Christman Field Airport;
in the distance to the West. It was put into use in the 1940s and
later used for National Guard training. Now the main airstrip is
covered by 8,000 solar panels making 2 megawatts of power for
CSU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is not a web cam cache, another view of the solar
array can be seen online from the CSU Department of Atmospheric
Science buildings located south of the array.&lt;/p&gt;

be a good idea to have your geo-tweezers handy.


&lt;p&gt;Leafy Spurge is a perennial, not native to the USA. It has been
in this area since the 1960s and is toxic to most livestock. It is
rapidly taking over in many of our pasture lands and is an irritant
to humans, so don't get the milky sap on you. It is possibly the
most difficult weed to control in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you're here, stop a moment and look to the East. It's
plain to see why this area was so attractive to the early
settlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log only. Please replace the cache exactly as you found it and
happy caching!&lt;/p&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>
