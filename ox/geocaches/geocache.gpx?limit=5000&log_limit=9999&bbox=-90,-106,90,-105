            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a hiker's cache. You will be bushwhacking through the burned area of the Sand Gulch Fire, April 2011. Expect to get soot on your clothes. Park at the Lewis Creek Trail parking area off Colorado 96. Parking lot coordinates N 38° 11.759; W. 105° 06.599. Entrance road is rough dirt — high-clearance vehicle recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: After a dry spring, a squall with lightning and sleet moved through this area on Tuesday, April 26, 2011. A lightning strike started a small fire on a ridge southwest of the cache that afternoon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When the fire was spotted, the Wetmore Volunteer Fire Dept. responded. Firefighters judged that because the fire was small, high up on national forest, and not threatening structures, it did not require immediate response. In addition, the weather was foggy and drizzling — the fire was unlikely to spread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S. Forest Service firefighters arrived on Wed., April 27. They built a hand line on the northeast side of the fire and “burned out” (set backfires) to reinforce this containment line. Following its policy, the Forest Service decided to let the fire continue to burn to the west to reduce fuels and to provide open grazing areas for bighorn sheep that live in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At a meeting Thursday night at the Wetmore VFD fire house, Forest Service representatives assured residents that the fire would remain contained—even though high winds were forecast for Friday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Strong wind, gusting up to 50 mph, did arrive on Friday. Early Friday afternoon the fire “blew up,” jumping in size from 20 acres to more than 500 acres. Residents in the Greenwood area across Colorado 96 were advised to evacuate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fire departments from Wetmore, Florence, Rye, Westcliffe, and other towns fought the fire. Federal resources included three Hot Shot crews, a number of Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management engines, two heli-tankers, and one single-engine air tanker. </groundspeak:long_description>

Note that the creek is on private property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Container is an olive-drab box similar to an ammo can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original contents: miscellaneous small foreign coins, toy soldiers, key ring, plastic animals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four-wheel-drive is not needed except in extremely snowy weather, which would make finding the cache more challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF mr volkswagen, April 9, 2010</groundspeak:long_description>

Arrived at 0945 hours on a beautiful morning. Hardscabble creek was flowing pretty good with the snow melt. Never knew this piece of history existed here. Thanks for bringing me here. The rock is a bit odd and does seem out of place from the others. 
Thanks for the cache and the history.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The container is a Tupperware box. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ROAD CONDITIONS: Inside the national forest, road 388 is one-lane, two-way dirt road. Low-clearance vehicles and two-wheel-drive vehicles should not use it in muddy or snowy conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may park at the bottom of the hill at N 38° 11.923;, W 105° 05.668; and walk to the cache site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the road is clear, you can park at N 38° 11.788’, W 105° 05.400. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hike is steep and brushy but short.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located just outside the perimeter of the Mason Gulch Fire, which burned this area in July 2005. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shortly after the fire, the Forest Service erected the framework for some interpretive signs on an overlook—and then never completed the job! The nearby cache, therefore, contains a map and brief account of the fire. placed to mark the five-year anniversary. Some animal-theme trade items are included for the kids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coming or going from the cache, you may have followed a faint “trail.” It is actually a fire line that was dug a couple of years before the Mason Gulch Fire, when the Forest Service planned a prescribed burn on the south-facing slopes to the east of the cache site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the big fire, plans for the prescribed burn were shelved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF: mtnbirders, May 21, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE: It is probably just coincidental, but about a month after the cache was placed, the Forest Service took down the blank interpretive sign board that prompted the cache in the first place!</groundspeak:long_description>

About the most you'll ever stray away from the creek would be about 50 feet. A gradual climb over the hike, you'll start at about 7300 and venture up to about 8450. The trail continues on beyond the cache site. Up to the cache, you really won't encounter any major landmarks to speak of but the mostly shady, casual climb is reward enough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This was a hastily put together cache since I only had about 20 minutes notice to get ready for a hike but inside this shoebox sized clear plastic container with the blue lid you'll find a few McDonald's collectibles (Animal Alley's &quot;Riggley&quot; and Ty Beenie &quot;Flitter the Butterfly&quot;) a small Match Box &quot;type&quot; race car, an enameled Colorado lapel pin, a couple of 50 cent pieces and a few other small goodies. I was in such a hurry to get dressed, get my pack together, get the cache together and grab the camera that I neglected to print out the Geocaching &quot;notice&quot; that I usually place in my caches so if anyone feels obliged to bring out a copy for inclusion I would be very grateful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As far as terrain goes this would be a pretty nice hike to take the kids out on, keeping in mind the length of the jaunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy yourself, always be safe and remember - cache in - trash out. Have Fun</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Be careful of your climb as some rocks can be less than stable. About 50 yards should do it.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

While I'm sure there are some die-hards that will look at this as a half-day jaunt, we left at about 8 in the morning and didn't return until well over 4 in the afternoon with only about a 30 minute stay while at the upper lake.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While not quite as hard as getting to the Stout Creeks which are on the other side of the mountain, this was still a good workout&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like most mountain lakes, the upper lake is pretty baren but the two lower lakes were really gorgeous and made for plenty of great pics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On your way up, you're likely to pass by a few blow-down areas where recent gusts have leveled quite a few trees so be carefull to stay on the trail.  We actually ended up loosing the trail and had to make our own which I'm sure cost us an extra 30 minutes if not more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun, be safe and please don't leave any trash behind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache was placed on 7/15/2012  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache original contents:&lt;br/&gt;$2 bill&lt;br/&gt;50 cent piece from 1974&lt;br/&gt;Colorado lapel pin&lt;br/&gt;Old McDonald collector toy (2003 Brother Bear - Rutt)&lt;br/&gt;Compass, thermometor, safety whistle&lt;br/&gt;Old McDonalds collector toy (2000 Hello Kitty Apple Combo Lock)&lt;br/&gt;and a few other goodies</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Moderately comfortable hike up this small dry creek bed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A relatively easy creek-bed hike you'll find the trek fairly easy going - unless you take the wrong fork. I won't say more because that would spoil the fun!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a smaller-sized cache (Tupperware sandwich container) which, due primarily to limited GPS coverage, may be a bit challenging to find. At the time that the cache was placed my Magellan Explorist noted that accuracy was at 30 feet. Additionally, on the trek back I took another reading which was, as I expected, slightly differently than the first ( 38°27'23.10&quot;N - 105°52'35.94&quot;W ) so feel free to use either.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The path will vary from sand to rock to grass. You'll pass through some narrow areas with high walls and some open areas so you should find the cache trek quite enjoyable. While I noted that this cache may not be appropriate for younger children this is mostly because of the potentiality of encountering rattle snakes; this is not an overly difficult trek in and of itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the cache, you'll find some goodies such as:&lt;br/&gt;* Colorado Lapel Pin&lt;br/&gt;* Wood Belt Buckle&lt;br/&gt;* McDonald collectable toys&lt;br/&gt;* $1.00&lt;br/&gt;* 50 cent piece&lt;br/&gt;* Tube of instant glue&lt;br/&gt;* Belt clip for a cell phone (or ?)&lt;br/&gt;And a few other small goodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When placing the cache, a two foot rattler was encountered mid trail. You won't have to worry about &quot;this&quot; rattler - but there may be others so be aware and be cautious.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please leave the cache sealed and well hidden as it is now and please leave the &quot;marker&quot; in place to help those who follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a couple of different ways to approach this cache so do your homework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be safe and have fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note...  This cache was originally listed on another site and as of this date has been found by 5 others so be prepared for some unknown finds to be hidden in this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>IF &quot;STUMPED&quot;, make sure your &quot;TRIANGLE&quot;ation is &quot;ROCK&quot; solid. Consider starting where the creek meets Hwy fifty at the Arkansas.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A Wellsville starting point, this hike can be reletively challenging or moderately easy, depending upon your approach. Your trek involves about a 300 foot climb in altitude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a multitude of ways to get to this cache, depending on what type of challenge you like:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since half the fun is in researching your cache and mapping out a plan, I won't give away too much - sorry :-)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Challenging - We took this route to hide the cache and needed about 3 hours round trip. Suggested parking would be at the turnout on Hwy 50 at: 38°29'36.06&quot;N, 105°55'4.80&quot;W. With some moderately steep climbs up loose shale I would strongly suggest a pair of light gloves and a hiking pole: This route involves a nice 1 ½-ish) mile 'railroad hike' along the Arkansas River and some challenging climbing up the washes to the old mining road which leads to the cache. You could go a bit further down the tracks and avoid some of the washes but where's the fun in that? :-). This route will take you past an old miners furnace to investigate (about 100 yards off the East side of the tracks - opposite the river)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Less Challenging - Explore the local county roads (hint-drive across the bridge and find your way to 38 30.146N by 105 54.821W. Park near here and start up the old mine road to the WNW) Your trek will then be along an old snaking mining road with downhill grade approaching the cache, but an uphill one leaving. If you enjoy a good pace in your hikes, this route should take you about an hour and a half round trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each route holds some spectacular views and the cave at the end is really a find in and of itself. Local legend has it that this is where a fugitive held out for quite awhile while evading the local authorities and the evidence in the caves seems to back that up quite well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAUTIONS:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. When exploring the caves - if you dare, note that there have been large sections of rock which have fallen from the ceiling of the cave; mostly where the 'bandit' was burning his fire so enter at your own risk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. When hiking to the cache a second time to remove an &quot;unallowable&quot; item I inadvertently placed in the cache, we encountered a rattle snake on the railroad tracks. I STRONGLY suggest the use of a walking stick to make sure your path is clear as there undoubtedly be more off trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PLEASE - leave the caves unspoiled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the find: off to the right of the cache, the trial narrows and continues around the mountains offering additional views and unknown finds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original cache contents (Something for everyone):&lt;br/&gt;Aluminum pack clip, Colorado eagle key fob, ceramic slippers, mini bud vase, bell bottle, hand warmer pack, guitar pick and a nice1947 fifty-cent piece for the FTF.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;P.S. Please rehide the cache well!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy caching!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note that this cache was originally listed elsewhere and as of this listing has had 10 finds so there should be some &quot;interesting&quot; goodies to share!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Facing out from the West cave, right edge of the patio area, along rock 'railing' find a two inch hole drilled into large rock. cache is hidden under rocks below and left of hole.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache is in an old ammo can. Near a good turnout for parking and an easy walk.  This is pretty easy, I reckon, but hopefully you'll have fun when you find it.  Please take one of the foreign coins or the book and leave something interesting behind.  I look forward to seeing what things we can inadvertently trade. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area is famous for dinosaur fossils, so you could find more than just a geocache if you spend some time and enjoy the beautiful area.  There is a beaver dam not far off and miles of good hiking and small game hunting.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just a note to my fellow geos around Canon City:  There is almost nothing here!  People come from miles to look for fossils, let's make this a fun geocache area too!  Help me out, eh!</groundspeak:long_description>

Some flatlanders say the Terrain should be marked as a 2. Its not difficult, but you do have to go up a small hill which at 8,000+ feet elevation can cause you to breathe hard due to the thin air here. :) I'll compromise and call it a 1.6 now.</groundspeak:long_description>

I am quite touched to find a cache that has been hidden since eleven years ago and that is still in such a good condition.
Glad that the road was usable to bring me here.
There was some snow falling when I arrived but not that much was left on the ground. It eventually stopped as I hiked up to this awesome cache.
What a great day for me :cute:!

5th find of 15 during my trip to Denver for a conference
When I found out I was coming to Colorado for a conference, I set my sights on Tarryall.
Landed in Denver at about 9am. Got my rental car &amp; immediately started driving south.
Made a few stops for lunch &amp; 4 caches so that this could be my find # 500.
Turned off the main road to the cache &amp; decided to park there. Walked down the dirt road &amp; up the hill.
Dropped off a TB as noted in an earlier log &amp; then realized I forgot my camera in the car. Didn't feel like hiking down &amp; back up. I have my memories.
TFTC!
P.S. Being a flatlander who just got off the plane, I think the terrain was appropriate at 1.5.  </groundspeak:text>

This was one of three 'cornerstone' caches I had picked out for our trip to Colorado Springs.  Since it looked like an easy walk we decided to drive up on our first day as we were still acclimating a bit to the change in elevation.   After stopping by Eleven Mile State Park for a FTF we drove north and parked along side the ATV'ers and dirt bikers to make the quick dash to the cache.  Cashlet 'A' had no problems finding this one, its nice to see the big ones preserved like this.  This is now the oldest cache we've found to date.

Thanks for keeping this one alive, we maintain New England's oldest cache 'First Mass' and always appreciate the work that has gone into keeping these running for _almost_ 10 years!

I left a TB here hoping that it will make it to Summit County.

I tried to yell that I was alright but he didn't hear me. I signed the log and hurried down the hill. He asked me what I was up to and I told him about geocaching and that the first cache in Colorado is &quot;just right up there&quot;. I told him that if he sees someone up there that is probably what they are doing. Now he knows... 

Thanks for placing this one!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I am working at a pharmacy in Denver that closes at 6:00pm this week. It's only 54 miles from the job site to the cache site. So I headed down to find this cache. When I lived in Denver I always enjoyed the drive down to Colorado Springs so I took that route into the mountains. One the way in I saw a herd of elk and was really excited, then I realized they were on an animal park and wasn't as excited. Then I thought about it and realized I saw a herd of elk! So I was excited again. The drive took longer than I anticipated and my gps wanted to take me up through the four wheeler park from the south. I have a Hummer from National so I started to drive up through the trails. I had a great time but after a mile I turned back and headed up the main road to the north of the cache site. I can't figure out why my gps wanted me to take the dirt roads but it did so on the way back too. I found the cache as the last light of day left the sky. Dropped a couple of travel bugs, both were ducks and they enjoyed the Platte river nearby and picked up a couple to move on. Thanks for keeping this cache around, lots of neat goodies in the bucket.</groundspeak:text>

Picked up a few TBs and left some toys.
Did not realize this was 2mi down a forest dirt road.  It can be done in a sedan, but probably not a good idea - but I made it!  Parked .14mi away where the road looked way too muddy to go on.  Maybe I took the harder way in? 
Fun to find a large cache!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Part of the Argentine Railroad Grade series. A small cache at Pavilion Point. This cache has room for small trade items and travel bugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two ways to get to the cache location. From Silver Plume, the Argentine Pass railroad grade is a good hiking or biking trail, but does not allow motorized vehicles. This route is about a 3 mile hike that passes several old mines along the way. There are many side trails that lead to even more abandoned mines to explore. Bring plenty of water, as there is little along the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The alternative route leaves from Guanella Pass Rd., south of Georgetown. This road allows motorized vehicles. I recommend a high clearance vehicle, with 4 wheel drive vehicle (or ATV/dirt bike), depending on the time of year. Start up the mostly paved Guanella Pass Rd, then take the dirt road to the right at N 39° 40.990 W 105° 42.175. Follow the arrow 'til you get to the cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the cache location is an old chimney and a scenic view of Silver Plume, Clear Creek, and the Georgetown Loop Railroad. The large chimney is all that remains of a historic pavilion overlooking Georgetown and the surrounding valleys. The pavilion was a favorite destination for day trips during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The location of the hiding spot is fairly obvious, but please don't move any rocks until you know it's the right one. The cache will be visible, though not easy to spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;DR29W67 - Dirt Road&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 40.990 W 105° 42.175&lt;br/&gt;Beginning of the dirt road to Pavilion Point.&lt;br/&gt;PS29W67 - Park Here&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 41.657 W 105° 43.939&lt;br/&gt;Parking area for hiking Argentine Pass RR grade.&lt;br/&gt;SO29W67 - Scenic Overlook&lt;br/&gt;N 39° 41.731 W 105° 42.206&lt;br/&gt;A scenic overlook of Silver Plume, Clear Creek, and the Georgetown Loop Railroad.</groundspeak:long_description>

I decided for this cache I would go to the store and buy a variety of geocaching items for the cache contents. Please trade like items to help keep this cache nice. I hope you enjoy this cache. There are cactus, yuca plant, and shrub oak on this cache. I recommend you wear pants and a good pair of shoes. The trail to follow looks like it's from animals. Also the above parking coordinates is the only place you can park for this cache. Anywhere else is considered private land. Pay attention to the signs and fence lines as well, as will all open space areas, not all is public and it's clearly marked and easy to see where you can go and not go. There is a 425 foot Altitude change from parking to cache location. As the crow flies the round trip is 1.5 miles. If you are lucky you might get to watch a train.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual cache at a historic site in the
Arapahoe National Recreation Area on the shore of Monarch
Lake.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Monarch Lake, at an elevation of 8337 feet, is a scenic gem with
12,000  foot peaks for a backdrop and a “picture
postcard” island in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Take a three-quarter mile hike over an easy to moderate trail to
the cache. The trail meanders around Monarch Lake for a total
distance of 4.5 miles. Parking waypoint below. A pass is required.
One-day, three-day, or weekly passes may be purchased at an obvious
kiosk. Federal land annual passes will also work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;History:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monarch was once a bustling town and the rail head of the Rocky
Mountain Railroad. Boulder businessmen T.S. Waltemeyer, Frank
Wolcott, and Charles A. Wolcott heard about traces of gold, silver,
and mostly copper at the junction of the Arapahoe Creek and the
South Fork of the Colorado River. In 1905 they established the
Monarch Consolidated Gold and Copper Mining and Smelting Company
and built their company on the assumption that a major belt of
minerals extended east through the Continental Divide. The Monarch
Company consisted of several subsidiary companies including lumber
companies. With 1740 acres of placer and lode claims, the main
objective of the company was to mine metal ores, but supplement it
with timber and build a railway to benefit the whole company.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Monarch Company shipped heavy machinery by flatbed cars to
Granby on the new Moffat Road. They then put an ad in the paper
asking for bids to haul heavy machinery 16 miles from Granby to
Monarch. The machinery included “5 boilers (eight and a
quarter tons each), one engine (over eleven tons), one flywheel (6
tons), other machinery (from 1 to 5 tons), a carload of nails, and
several hundred pounds of miscellaneous supplies.” The task
of hauling the heavy equipment was made especially difficult by
mud-holes and bridges not made for heavy loads. Denver hauling
companies refused to take on the job and one logging company from
Wyoming abandoned the challenge after the first wagonload stuck in
a mud-hole. Finally Dick McQueary agreed to move the machinery. To
accomplish the job, McQueary purchased several hundred feet of
hardwood planks in Denver, 3 inch thick, sixteen inches wide and
twelve feet long. Accompanying the heavy pieces up the mountain was
a “4 horse team hauling hardwood plank, a 4 horse team
pulling six inch pine poles, 10 feet long, and a four horse team
pulling two ton large nails”. The crew built temporary
bridges across mud-holes by laying pine poles 3 feet apart with
hardwood planks laid across the poles. Two light loads were driven
across to test bridge followed by the heavy load pulled by 12 head
horses. Finally the planks and poles were pulled up to be used at
the next mud-hole. The heavy machinery was hauled in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The town of Monarch included employee housing, business offices, a
post office, and an assembly hall. Grand County's first
hydro-electric generator was in Monarch. The waterworks system was
created by piping water from the falls at Mad Creek and had
pressure up to 300 lbs per inch. In 1907, the Monarch Box Factory
and the Rocky Mountain Railway, a standard-gauge 16 mile line from
Granby to Monarch, were constructed. The Monarch Company created
Monarch Lake by damming the valley, at the junction of Arapahoe
Creek and South fork of the Colorado River, for use with the saw
mill and the box factory. A 2800 foot long chute carried tree
trunks down the hillside to the lake where they hit the water and
could bounce up to 50 ft high. Then a stern-wheel steamer pushed
logs into a system of canals and flumes that led down to the saw
mill and box factory. The box factory only operated for 2 or 3
months before it was totally destroyed by fire. In the fall of
1907, the Monarch Company declared bankruptcy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The railway continued to be used for a number of years. Ed
McDonald, a dude rancher, put a Cadillac touring car on flanged
iron wheels to carry mail, supplies, and guests to his ranch. The
center of town was preserved and developed by the Dierks as a
summer resort called Ka Rose, after Katherine Rose Dierks, the
owner's daughter. In 1912, the rail line was used for transporting
fisherman along the river by Ernest F. Behr, a former Colorado and
Southern engineman. Finally, in 1918, the rails were sold to a junk
dealer in Denver to satisfy the World War I need for scrap
metal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since 1947, the Monarch town site, mill site, and box factory have
been under the waters of Lake Granby. In 2002, a year of low water,
there were still a few signs of this town on the dried lake bed
(see waypoint below). Today, at Monarch Lake, you can still see
some of the original machinery as well the flume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Information primarily taken from the
Grand County History website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Please take some time to reflect back
on the lives of these pioneers and the effort it took to make
Colorado such a great state!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Code Phrase:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter the number cast (upside down) on the lake-side base of the machinery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please do NOT put the answer (even encrypted) in the
log.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Back In Time
Series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back In Time is a series of caches placed near historic sites to
remind us to &lt;strong&gt;remember our
past&lt;/strong&gt;. We can learn so much from studying the past.
This series will provide a history tour of Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Their days are gone but not
forgotten!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Additional Waypoints:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Parking: N 40° 06.677 W 105° 44.836&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monarch Town Site View Point: N 40° 07.900 W 105° 46.400&lt;br /&gt;Approximate viewing point for Monarch Town Site when Lake Granby water is low.     </groundspeak:long_description>

Nothing tricky about it - quick and easy smiley in commeration of our 14th wedding anniversary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a simple find that should be a quick smiley. The only thing that would be considered abnormal for this cache is the container itself. We spent a little extra time decorating this ammo can. We experimented with the painting and decoration. We also added a few extras that are becoming standards for our hides. A moleskine notebook that we decorated ourselves. The bottom of the ammo can has a cork board lining to keep special swag clean.&lt;br/&gt;I hope you enjoy it. I also filled it with some silly swag. The entire crew hid this one together to celebrate our 14th Anniversary. GeoWifey was even surprised by some special swag that was hidden inside just for her. I won't say what it was but it came in a little light blue box.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;strong&gt;A Brief History of the
Site&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This site used to be the location of the 7 Utes Lodge and M - M
Camp for Boys. The M - M Camp for Boys was a summer camp only. In
1975, the name was changed to the 7 Utes Lodge and the facility was
opened for year round guests.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Incidently, the lodge was open year round before Cameron Pass (Hwy
14) was paved. Cameron Pass was not passable in the winter. The 7
Utes Lodge owners would take a snowcat over Cameron Pass to pick-up
guests. The guests were served champagne during the ride back to
the lodge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the activites included snowmobiling, cross country skiing,
snowshoeing, hunting, fishing, backpacking, horseback riding,
target practice, archery, and just enjoying the peaceful Colorado
mountains.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the mid-1990's, the land was returned to public use. The 7 Utes
Lodge buildings were auctioned off. However, there is one cabin
still standing at the site. For those who remember the lodge, it
was the craft shop.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;How Do We Know All This&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our family used to own and run the 7 Utes Lodge and M - M Camp for
Boys. This location holds many fond memories for both our family
and past guests.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Please share your memories!&lt;/strong&gt;    </groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This location is an overlook of the old Christman Field Airport;
in the distance to the West. It was put into use in the 1940s and
later used for National Guard training. Now the main airstrip is
covered by 8,000 solar panels making 2 megawatts of power for
CSU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this is not a web cam cache, another view of the solar
array can be seen online from the CSU Department of Atmospheric
Science buildings located south of the array.&lt;/p&gt;

be a good idea to have your geo-tweezers handy.


&lt;p&gt;Leafy Spurge is a perennial, not native to the USA. It has been
in this area since the 1960s and is toxic to most livestock. It is
rapidly taking over in many of our pasture lands and is an irritant
to humans, so don't get the milky sap on you. It is possibly the
most difficult weed to control in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you're here, stop a moment and look to the East. It's
plain to see why this area was so attractive to the early
settlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log only. Please replace the cache exactly as you found it and
happy caching!&lt;/p&gt;   </groundspeak:long_description>
