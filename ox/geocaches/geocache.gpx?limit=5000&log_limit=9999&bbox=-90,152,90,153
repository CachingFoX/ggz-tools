Croaky Hollow nearby with safe haven for frog breeding. 

 The second of our Bray Park pioneer tributes. John Bray is the husband of Mary Bray our first cache in the area. 
The cache can be approached from a number of ways all with relatively easy access along paths suitbale for wheelchairs and strollers to witihn a few metres of the cache.
The area can be busy at times and may attract long term mini muggles due to the amount of things for them to play on. 
However, the cache is set aside from that equipment and can still be accessed with stealth. 

John Bray Park was gazetted in 1974. John is the husband of Mary and son of Nathaniel and Jessie Bray. Pioneers in the Pine Rivers area. Bray Park is named for this pioneering family.
John Bray was Pine Rivers Councillor for 27 years 1946-1973. John was also Chairman of the council from 1950.

Congratulations to VWnuts for FTF and to others close by.  Cache replaced in new location after being muggled.

Glad to repay some caches for those in the area who have put so many out for us to find. Love the friendly rivalry of local GCers and can't wait to see more.</groundspeak:long_description>

Coords were good and after a quick look around, I spotted it. Retrieval was a bit more complicated for poor Loki but I got there. The cache had been left open by previous finders (muggle kids by the looks of the log book) and the bag was open so there is a bit of condensation in the bag. I tried to dry it out as best I could and the log is ok. Hopefully that will be enough. A lovely area to visit anyway. Thanks shaddow_hound</groundspeak:text>

Not exactly sure what 'awesomeness' means on this OC site, but yes, I guess it's kind of awesome.

We decided to place a cache in this area to mark the opening of a war memorial for Redbank. 

The Memorial was formally opened on the 12th of October 2008. At this time there are no names on the monument but the local RSL will be completing its research and adding names in the coming months. The trees in the park were planted way back in 1995 by students from Redbank State School and are well established.

Take care with the geokids as the roads all round can get pretty busy. Also be aware that the residents in the nearby houses seem to take a fair bit of interest in what people are doing in the park, particularly the bloke in the first house.

23rd December 2008. I have had to move the cache to a new spot, it is more exposed to muggles but hopefully harder for them to spot. Take care when searching to not be seen, and make sure you cover it well when you put it back. It seems that there are a few grubs around that leave their rubbish in the park, watch out for broken glass.

You’re looking for a small plastic container, that holds a few swaps and a log book. </groundspeak:long_description>

Who is Alf Kalamafoni? I often wonder as I ride my bike over his bridge and past his plaque. So I thought I may as well place a cache here and see if I can find out. a quick google search revealed that he was a Councillor of Ipswich City Council from 22 March 1995 to 4 May 1998. If you want, post any additional information you may have on him as part of your log. Other than that there is not much to do here, so I figured a micro was good enough. There is easy parking nearby, and a house pretty close so stealth may be required.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A nice easy Cache in a little suburban park. At christmas the street is closed so if you come by car you will have to park down the street and walk the last few hundred metres. A torch may be helpful at night. You could also park at the end of Bailey St and take a short stroll through the bush.

We wanted to place a cache in this area for people to come and look at the christmas lights. Brenda Ct is usually ablaze with lights on most houses come Christmas, and there is always a lovely festive atmosphere. Bring the kids and spend some time to soak it in. If you have the time continue on to Collingwood Park lights up 1 which is near Paul Tully Ave. 

The cache is a small round container, which is full of Christmas type swaps, there is a flashing badge for the first to find. Please cover it well when replacing so the local kids don't muggle it.

I have now moved this cache a bit further from the local muggle population, but you will still need to be careful and pick your time. </groundspeak:long_description>

Paul Tully Ave is usually ablaze with lights on most houses come Christmas, and there is always a lovely festive atmosphere. Bring the kids and spend some time to soak in the atmosphere. If you are lucky you may come accross the Salvation Army band playing Carols, or you may see Santa in his specially decorated Truck, handing out lollies for the kids.

There are many ways to access this area, but the closet would be via Goss Drive. Maybe best taken as a 'drive by' as it is just off the road.

 The cache is a small metal tin, just big enough to fit a half a pencil, a logbook and one kid's toy.

 Make sure you take time to walk/bike around the many paths in this area, and visit the many parks. It seems Collingwood Park is a cache hiders and finders heaven.</groundspeak:long_description>

We often come here for the geobaby to have a play. Its a nice little park with some good climbing and play equipment for the kids, sadly there are vandals about and every now and then some of it gets damaged. The council have been pretty quick to fix things up though. While your in the area there are a few other caches nearby, take a walk and enjoy the parks. 

This one should be pretty easy to find, although the area is exposed to houses on all sides and there are often kids enjoying the park. Please ensure you replace and cover it well.

FTF goes to Missbhavin, well done. </groundspeak:long_description>

Storage capacity is 11,000 megalitres with a catchment area of 9,800 hectares. Maximum water depth in the dam is 34 metres. The wall is 44 metres high and at the crest it is 229 metres in length.
The road from Kyogle is tar until the turnoff, approx 7km from the dam. 
The dam has a reputation as one of the best Australian Bass fishing areas in the state however a fishing license is required.
Near the dam wall there is a public access area with picnic tables, toilets and barbecues. A small well maintained Golf Course is located at the Dam.

Accommodation is available at Toonumbar Waters Retreat. Camping is permitted at Bells Bay with a small fee required to assist with maintaining the facilities here. Bells Bay 
Camping Ground is secluded in magnificent forest.  

The cache is located at the Bells Bay camping ground. A nice spot for a weekend of fishing, walking or just relaxing. Facilities at Bells Bay campground include, shelter sheds, toilets, rainwater tanks, barbecues, jetty and boat ramp. Speed limit on the dam for boats is 8km/h.

The road into the campground is about 2km long and can be in poor condition after rain, 2wd vehicles not advised. During dry weather however any vehicle should not have any problems negotiating the road..

The cache is a regular sistema type and contains a Geocoin, CD game and a few other trinkets.

We placed this cache while on a recent 4wd trip into the hinterland West of Wauchope. Sonneys Waterfall is one of a series of small falls on Sonneys creek. Access to this area is via Knodingbul road approx 45km North West of Wingham. If heading North on Knodingbul road take a left turn at Blue Mountain Creek road S31 32.757 E 152 10.274.
The area is accessible by 2wd vehicles but caution should be exercised especially in the wet.

Approximately 6.7km along Blue Mountain Creek road you will arrive at the picnic area. S31 31.703 E 152.08.402. It looks like it has been seldom used as the only table is getting difficult to see. 

From here follow the sign that points to the waterfall. The walk takes approximately 20 minutes each way and please make sure you check for leeches and ticks when you return. When you arrive at the GZ co-ordinates take a bearing of 140 degrees. This will point to a high bank to the right of the falls. The cache has been placed fairly high up the bank to avoid possible flooding in times of wet weather. A degree of clambering up the steep slope is required to access the cache. It looks as though there are several tracks on this slope that have been used in the past by people endeavouring to go further upstream to the other falls. Also beware of stinging nettles at the base of the falls. The cache is located in a small cleft of rock. The cache is a regular sized Sistema container

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We discovered this lookout on a recent 4wd trip through several national parks. Rowleys Lookout is located in Tapin Tops National Park. Access is via Knodingbul Road approximately 400kms north of Sydney and 30kms north-west of Wingham. As you make the steady climb from the pastoral land near Wingham, warm temperate sub-tropical rainforests meld with scarpland eucalypt forests, providing a lush mountain environment. Lookouts like Rowley's Rock provide panoramic views to Taree and the ocean beyond. 

The park is accessible by two wheel drive vehicles year round and has good picnic and camping facilities. Some real &quot;gems&quot; of nature await the enthusiast.
This area has local Aboriginal significance with the name &quot;tapin&quot; meaning dingo in the local language.

This stunning rock outcrop has 360 degree/views, 1018m above sea level. To the south east you look down Caparra Creek and to the west, into the extensive forested hinterland, including Bulgan Nature Reserve. If you're intending to use the viewing platform, park your vehicle in the car park off Rowley's Road and take the 45 minute strenuous walk to the top. It's worth it
If you have a 4WD it is a 400m walk to the summit which is 1018 metres above sea-level
