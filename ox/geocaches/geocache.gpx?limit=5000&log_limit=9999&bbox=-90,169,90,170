            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The container is 1.5 litre “Prestige Perfect Seal” transparent container with a push on lid (please push lid on firmly). It is hidden at chest level but is invisible from 0 metres. On the lid is written “Geocache”.

&lt;p&gt;Take some time out to admire the view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When hidden it contained:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log book with pencil and sharpener.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fishing float key ring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1964 Australian (Perth) penny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roxburgh postcard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clyde fridge magnet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NZ “Touring &amp; Accommodation Map”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The township had its genesis in the discovery of gold. The early miners used water from the surrounding catchments to sluice the gold from the old creek and river beds. Many of the old water races can still be seen on the surrounding hillsides.  In time these water races came to be used to deliver irrigation water to the stone fruit orchards that succeeded gold mining as the principal source of income in this valley. The development of hydro electrical generation started with the damming of Lake Onslow. Today there are a number of small storage lakes, canals and generation plants on the Teviot River from its source at Lake Onslow to its confluence with the Clutha River on the east bank at Roxburgh. It was at this confluence that alluvial gold was discovered by Young and Woodhouse in 1862. The water use is truly multi use as a considerable volume of water is still taken by means of the old water races to fill irrigation dams on the eastern terraces of the Clutha River. Two of the generation stations are within a short distance of the Geocache Site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the gold is to be found in the brilliant autumn colours that adorn the trees in this valley, and in the export value of the Cherries and Apricots grown here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross over the river and turn north, then turn right after 0.15 km.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The Cache is hidden under a rock overhang facing the township, Turn your back on two smallish kowhai trees one at about ten meters and then another twelve meters further on, to the west (bearing 240° magnetic), and then put your right hand out at chest height.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

      children.&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Clutha River can be
dangerous, those who fall in seldom fall out
again.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Having said that it is no more hazardous than being
near water with children, anywhere. As the cache is hidden close to
the road and also close to the picnic area you will need to watch
out for &quot;Muggles&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to move a largish rock to get at the
container. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please replace the rock so that it remains
well hidden.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good spot to stop for a picnic either
&quot;going to...&quot; or &quot;coming from.....&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
 or, in season, try your luck at some salmon or brown trout
fishing. I am trying to find out who or what &lt;b&gt;Black Jack&lt;/b&gt; was.
When, or if, I do I will post a note with the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a 880ml, clear, &quot;Klipit&quot; type
(replaced 11/08/2005 also books taken out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When hidden it contained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Log book, pencil and pencil
sharpener&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some Paperback Books for book
swapping&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Roxburgh badge (could be used
as an earring.?)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Roxburgh
Postcard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some brochures describing local
walkways and attractions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;My signature item, an Aussie
Penny (all I can afford.)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

No need to cross fence into private land!! The home owners around the Booth knows about the cache.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Tollhouse appears to have been originally located at 'Waihola Gorge' where it stood for around ten years housing the toll keeper who collected the tolls from the passing traffic on this main route between Dunedin and Central Otago.

The charges were complex and depended on factors such as the kind of wheeled vehicle, the number of harnessed animals, the number of stock and the job of the individual traveller. In 1876, the Bruce County Council (which took over the administration of roading following the abolition of the Provincial Government) shifted the building to nearby Clarendon where it performed additional services as a Post Office. In Bruce County the toll system was abolished in the 1880s and the Tollhouse was bought by local farmer and Otago businessman Henry Driver and shifted to Helensbrook, where it remains today. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/RegisterSearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=3212&quot;&gt;Some info on the booth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a&gt;Some info on the booth in the paper&lt;/a&gt;. Looking for a silver round tube... Please NOTE that you must sign the log book for each individual cacher, Finds logged not corresponding with the logbook wil be deleted. Please take some time before leaving to ensure that the cache is re-hidden exactly as you found it.</groundspeak:long_description>
