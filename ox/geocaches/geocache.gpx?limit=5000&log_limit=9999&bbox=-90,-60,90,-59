In 1758 the Fortress of Louisbourg fell for the last time to an attacking British force of nearly 13,000 troops.

The British garrisoned the town after its fall, starting in 1760 the British systematically demolished the fortifications leaving the town inside to fall to ruin.</groundspeak:long_description>

Until the experience of the 1745 siege taught them otherwise, Louisbourg's Engineers felt that an attack from the landward side of the town was unlikely.

The immense fortifications surrounding the town as well as the craggy coast and marshy terrain near Louisbourg ruled out an assault from that direction in their minds.</groundspeak:long_description>

In 1961 the Government of Canada began a $25 million project aimed at reconstructing approximately one-quarter of the original town and fortifications. Within this area the buildings, yards, gardens and streets are being recreated as they were during the 1740s, immediately preceding Louisbourg's first siege. This cache commemorates the 50th Anniversary of the Reconstruction of the Fortress of Louisbourg.</groundspeak:long_description>

About 14 meters of coastal land has been lost at Louisbourg since the mid-18th century (Sea level has risen about 80cm). This means that once land-fast structures are now within reach of the high tide, and will soon be lost to the sea.

Today technology, such as GIS (Geographical Information System) software, LiDAR (light detection and ranging) for detailed topography, and GPS receivers for mapping cultural sites help the archaeologists relate plotted sites to the landscape, built structures, and historical plans more easily and more accurately than in the past.</groundspeak:long_description>

The economic base of Île Royale was the cod fishery. Salted, dried cod was the major export from Louisbourg. Its value was greater than that of the fur trade and the fish – eaten on days of abstinence - fed millions in France and in France’s colonies.</groundspeak:long_description>

From May 16 – October 15 your visit begins at our Visitor Reception Center.  From October 16 to May 15 please call ahead (902) 733 2280 to arrange your visit.¿¿

You are looking for a small green container containing a log book and pencil. Read the information sheet in the cache and let your mind’s eye takeover!

The geocache is a partnership of the Atlantic Canada Geocache Association, Parks Canada, and the Fortress of Louisbourg Association. Please pay appropriate site entry fees.

As per the Parks Canada geocaching policy: Trade items are not permitted in caches, this includes Travel Bugs.

In the 18th century, Louisbourg’s ice-free harbour was one of the busiest in North America. Fishing boats, merchant ships, and naval vessels filled the harbour every summer, bringing people and goods from all corners of the world.

Features which were there in the 18th century such as ships riding at anchor, Royal and Island Batteries, careening wharf, and navigational aids exist today only in the mind's eye.</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache can be reached in a truck or ATV, would not recommend in a car but I suppose it can be done.

The Homeville-Milton road runs between Broughton Rd. and Highway 255 (Comes out right by the Waddens Cove Road.

(from original) 
The cache is located on the old backpit road between Birch Grove and Morien on the old S&amp;L railroad in about a kilometer from highway.

Being where as this our first cache we made it pretty easy cache is in rubbermaid type box. Contents are:Canada pins , sparky patch guitar pick, 2-lanyards campbell mine pin ,globe paperweight , 6 canada stickers, and a loonie for non canadians.

------

This was my first find, and was the cache that got me started in this wonderful hobby. This cache meant a lot to me, but was unfortunately archived unnecessarily in 2008.

This is a completely new cache in the exact location of the old one. Contians only the trading items found in the old cache with some new things added + new log book and pencil. Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

Best way to get to it is to walk in from Long Beach Rd/No. 6 Mines rd. There is a road going in that is gated, hard to miss. Follow the road in, its also an ATV trail. The Geocache is located next to a pole from the old rail line. Its pretty grown in, if you go the right way it will be fairly easy, go the wrong way and it will be fairly difficult.</groundspeak:long_description>

ROUTE #1 
To get to it you must drive to Scooner Pond near the Donkin Minesite on No.6 Mines Rd. The trail starts near Stagunner's &quot;A survey marker is nearby #2 so is a geocache&quot;, proceed to walk along this ATV path (or drive if you have an ATV) until you reach the cache.

ROUTE #2
Find the road to the &quot;Pump House&quot; in Donkin, go down the road and you will see an ATV trail, follow the trail until you reach an intersection, turn right and keep going.

ROUTE #3
The other end of the trail doesn't actually not go anywhere. It connects on to the same road that my &quot;Donkin Pole Line Geocache&quot; is on, this trail is on the left and may be tricky to find, if not using an ATV in this direction wear boots and expect some puddles.</groundspeak:long_description>
