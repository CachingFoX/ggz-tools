            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is our first attempt at placing a cache. It's at a quiet area of Moree with tables and relaxing area. You won't generally see many muggles but they may still be watching from the nearby TAFE or homes ;)

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The cache is a small plastic container painted black. It's got some swaps in it, log book and pencil. We put a Geo-coin in there to start off as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Situated on the banks of the Mehi River and representing great significance to Moree's history is Mary Brand Park named after Moree's first store-keeper and hotelier, Mary Brand. Featuring a traditional four-room slab hut 'Meei Cottage', Mary Brand Park offers a spectacular opportunity to relax under the shady canopies of century-old fig trees whilst enjoying the various bird and wildlife that inhabit the surrounding parklands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A must for photographers and an ideal picnic area; the park backs on to the Mehi River jetty where it is popular for fishing and water sports.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The park commemorates Mary Brand's return to Moree after the death of her first husband, James Brand. Mary built her second store in Moree on this site. She also founded the town's first Hotel, the Moree Inn in 1861.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
** The store at the location burnt down shortly after the cache was placed but the history is still there :)</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;From Moree Plains Shire website;&lt;/h3&gt;
In a setting of beautiful white &amp; rose pink bauhinias, &lt;strong&gt;Kirkby Park&lt;/strong&gt; features the heritage-listed Moree Band Rotunda which is still in use today. Known colloquially as the &quot;Rocket Park&quot;, it also features a distinctive rocket which is one of only three still standing in Australia. The original rocket was built in Kirkby Park in 1972 to commemorate the Centenary of Education. &lt;br /&gt;
The old rocket still stands in the park but now, a new giant, brilliantly colourful model has been built standing 14.9 metres tall! Hosting a children's dream playground, the rocket was launched on 11 July 2009 by astronomer in charge Dr Fred Watson.The $220,000 rocket no doubt contributed to Moree’s Kirkby Park being named the third best place to play in NSW, according to the Daily Telegraph on Monday, July 6 2010.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache will take you to the Combadello Weir which is West of Moree on the Gwydir Highway and is known as a excellant fishing spot.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There needed to be a cache placed along this way and it is a really nice area to see, a good quick distraction along the road which connects Moree to Collarenebri.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is one of 3 main weirs located around Moree. It is well known as a fishing and bird watching spot. It does not have any facilities and any car, caravan etc can get there without problems and plenty of space to turn around although take care if it has been raining or the area is wet. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a small plastic container with a log book inside as well as 4-5 small swaps. The starting reference point is just the where the access road meets the Highway.&lt;br /&gt;
CONGRATS TO Quasar3671 FOR THE FTF!!! :)

The basketball court is not too great to play basketball on. The ball usually rolls down the side of the hill and it gets annoying chasing it every time you miss the backboard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is my the first cache I've hidden, so I hope it's alright!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a sort of cylindrical shape.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Woke up this morning and found an email notification in my mailbox that a new Opencaching cache had been published. This is a very very rare event. In fact I don't think I've ever recieved one before. Anyway decided that I wasn't in a position to race out to try for the FTF and would just pick it up as my daily cache before work in Lyneham,. 

Got to the site and groaned that it was in a playground. Went all over the equipment several times before finally expanding my thinking and finding a quite nasty (but good) hide. Took a while to encourage the lid off and then a virgin logsheet. I know Opencaching is barely looked at but I also know that TE and MBO certainly do (or did)

A wander back down to Mac House and all's good with the day.

TFTC and the swoopers.

(BTW you will get many many more visits listing on the GC site)

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Please read below for the All the Rivers Run Challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is the 1st part of the All the Rivers Run Series which starts along the Molonglo River and provides a part of the co-ordinates necessary to find All the Rivers Run Puzzle No. 1 on the Murrumbidgee River.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access to this cache can be done from a number of directions so I'll leave it up to you on deciding which way you'll approach this one. No matter which direction you come please be aware parts of this area of the Molonglo River does have some steep sides and drops with loose ground. If you choose to do this cache at night be very careful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get to this cache please do not not cross Private Property without permission. In the A.C.T. all major rivers have a corridor on either side that allows for public access (apart from a few exceptions) and general protection of the natural environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also be careful when it has rained or is raining as the river levels may rise suddenly. Expect a few blackberry bushes along the way but in most circumstances they can be avoided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is an ammo box and on the inside of the box is 1 number that will be used to obtain the final locations for All the Rivers Run Puzzle No. 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consider this number as A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALL THE RIVERS RUN CHALLENGE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an added incentive I will give the first person a geocoin who completes this multi in 1 day (ie by foot/push bike between 12.01.01am to 11.59.59pm of the same day) and has signed (dated with the individual's personal signature - no stickers) all the cache log books (All the Rivers Run Numbers 1-5 and Puzzle No. 1). I will check the logs to ensure claim is legitimate and of course I will have to rely upon your honesty in this matter also.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am also seriously considering making a limited edition &quot;All the Rivers Run Challenge&quot; pathtag to give to those cachers who meet the above requirements and there will be a Honor Roll listing with the All the Rivers Run Puzzle No. 1 webpage naming those successful people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can attempt this challenge more than once but you will still need to sign the log books on the day of your attempt.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A short bike ride from Belconnen took us straight to the track/road.  Depending on how you approach this cache it will require climbing amongst the blackberries - so come with a decent pair of shoes so that you don't slip and long pants/gaiters. Good view to a fast flowing Molonglo River - interesting to see the impact of the last heavy rains ie: much erosion. We left a small skateboard replica in the container to join many other trinkets. We did not take anything. Look forward to finding the other caches in the group to work out the puzzle. Many people have visited this cache but not reported on this site. Thanks  for this adventure RBirtles. </groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Logs pretty much the same for all as I DID THEM ALL IN THE ONE DAY. Pics taken for all too.

Parked car at Coppins crossing in the dark at 6am, then proceeded to walk to #1. Arrived there at 6:15am by torchlight, light drizzle. My eyes coped with the pre-dawn overcast sky very well and I could see Black Mountain tower glowing over in the distance and dawn just arising. Nice little views of the Molonglo too. Nice spot #1.
Walked back to car, got out the Mountain bike, crossed the Molonglo, and then proceeded to ride and slosh down the track on the Nth side for some considerable distance until I was nearly directly above #2. Dumped bike, then I zig-zagged down the very steep embankment following well defined GOAT tracks. Arrived at #2 well hidden a la natural. Relieved the cache of its TB and Geocoin. Nice spot #2. Arrived there 7:50am.
Consulted GPS, Hmmmm, I need to cross the river for nos 3&amp;4. So, I crossed there and then – LOTS of water flowing, but OK. Then it was a pretty severe bush bash, steep gullies, deep side creeks (all flowing vigoursly), having enough of this I made for MUCH higher ground and followed the fence line till I was on the spur leading to No. 3. Down the spur I went, found no. 3 – WOW – TOP SPOT! Seeing the water flow through here is quite something – it must be speccie when in flood.  Arrived there 8:55am. Admired the geology and scenery for a while, then back up the hill a bit and headed off to #4.
Down again to the rivers edge for #4, another nice location. Arrived there 9:30am. Then I crossed the river there and went straight up and up and up till I had clear grass and an easy stroll back to the bike, admiring the gorge scenery from the heights as I went.
A drizzly ride back to car, hopped in car and drove to near #5. Met the local farmer and had a good chat as I wandered down the road.  Onwards to #5 – approached from the high ground, got to GZ coords, but no cache – looked vertically down, hmmmm, it must be down there. So backtrack a bit, round I go, and there I find it – another nice little hide with trickiness. (easily retrieved in the wet as there were good footholds). #5 – another great spot. Arrived there at 12:10pm.

GZ calculated, off I go, some tracks, some bushbashing, some rocks, arrived at GZ – Hmmmmm, this is NOTHING like rBirtles would do, and nothing like the other wonderful locations. Blackberries and more blackberries in the middle of more blackberries. Hmmmm, consulted my numbers, yep, all OK.  Arrived there 1pm. 
(*^&amp;^%^%^()*&amp;(*^%(*&amp;&amp;* - There was clearly something wrong with the formula, and I had no idea what as the numbers and formula were quite specific. OK, whip out phone and call rBirtles – DAMN – no signal down here. UP I go and UP I go, ah, at last, a signal, nobody home. Double Damn. Wrung out all my clothes as by now there was a fair bit of rain, and I was literally STEAMING. Waited a while, tried again, nothing. Dejected, I then wandered off back to the car, found a much easier way back. Took off gaiters, boots etc etc, and was about to drive off, ring ring…..hello – Yay, mr. Birtles with the correct coords. A bit of chat, and OMG – That’s further than I went before, and the rain is still falling. Oh well, I’m wet, WARM &amp; steamy, still OK after some lunch, so off I went. Some considerable time later (hey, after 15km walking and 16km riding one is allowed to slow down a bit), I found the elusive cache. Arrived there 3:30pm.
ANOTHER nice location. Then returned back to car, completing 16km bike riding and 21km walking for the day with considerable rock climbing.

In summary, 2 FTF’s (#2 and final Puzzle), [red][b], one top series of spectacular caches with simply excellent locations[/b][/red], [blue][b] Easily #3 was the top spot, such a wonderful geological and scenic spot.[/b][/blue]

Thanks rBirtles for the wonderful series, the sustenance and the geocoin too, well done.</groundspeak:text>

You can catch Koi, Carp, Redfin and occasionally native fish from this area. You can even take in a wedding party, jogger, barbecue or cyclist or two. I recommend the use of corn or bread for Carp or Koi. The water rats, possums, and swans are friendly. Especially if you have anything that even remotely seems like food! </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My first cache ever so it was pretty cool. It was an easy 29km bike ride from Belconnen to get here although bitterly cold at 8am on a Canberra winter's morning. There was plenty of varied bird life including a large Black Comorant standing nearby with wings spread wide to absob the sun's warm rays. This scene made for a great photo that I happily snapped up. Despite the number of joggers around it was a relatively peaceful place and a great spot for fishing, and very easily accessible by all. Thanks ArcherACT - you have inspired me to set up cryptic caches around the lake - hope you get to enjoy them - see ya. PS. I left behind a small butterfly clip for the next person - there was nothing to take but the thrill of find was enough for me.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Lucian and I took a late afternoon drive from Belconnen to Queanbeyan. This cache was located on the wet ground. The small plastic container was very damp inside. The last vistor was on the 11 June 2011 but it was evident that they had trouble writing on the wet paper. We were not able to log our find as the paper was much too damp but we did return the cache to the same location.  Unfortunately a beautifully white cockatoo had met it's fate in the park and lay beside the cache. A sad ending to such a beautiful day.</groundspeak:text>
