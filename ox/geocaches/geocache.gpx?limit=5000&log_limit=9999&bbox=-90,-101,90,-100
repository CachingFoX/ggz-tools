road south of the cache not the interstate.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
A view from the parking location a few years back at
sunset.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; When my son was an infant and we went to San Antonio he would every
time like clock work both going and coming from San Antonio wake up
and want to be fed just before we got to this location.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So of course I had to place a cache here! Should be a fairly easy
grab I hope you enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;

This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas. The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for specific details and instructions.


Meade State Park was originally carved out of the Turkey Track Ranch in 1927.  Meade State park rests in the High Plains of southwest Kansas, just west of the Red Hills, 8 miles south and 5 miles west of Meade on Highway 23.  The state park and wildlife area comprise 803 acres of land and water.  The park features overnight camping, with or without electrical and water hook-ups.  The lake is surrounded by many trees that provide shade for camping and picnicking.  In the 80 acre lake, bluegill, channel cat, crappie and large mouth bass are plentiful and provide excellent opportunities for the angler.   A boat dock is available for the unloading of boats.  A swimming beach area has been marked off.   For nature lovers who like to identify various different trees, grasses, flowers and birds, a nature trail has been marked at the northwest corner of the lake.  Meade State Park is happy to have group gatherings at the park.

The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name! Keep all of your certificates together as you travel across our beautiful state completing the Challenge. At the end of the Challenge, mail your entry forms and all collected certificates to KWPT to become eligible for prizes such as camping permits, annual park permits, and more. Completed entry forms and all collected certificates must be received by KWPT by November 1, 2011. See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for complete details and instructions.

The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for specific details and instructions.


Rich in history, this park provides an ideal setting for camping, boating, swimming, hiking, hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation.  The Steele home, the dwelling of the original settlers on the area, has been preserved much as it was 100 years ago.  The park also boasts the northernmost pueblo in the U. S. - El Cuartelejo.  Hidden in the western Kansas prairie, Scott State Park is a startling oasis of natural springs, deep wooded canyons, and craggy bluffs.  The 1,020-acre park surrounds the 100-acre, spring fed Scott State Fishing Lake.  Nature trails accommodate hikers, horseback riders, and naturalists and provide excellent opportunities to observe wildlife in natural habitats.  Wild turkey, deer, bobcat and beaver are common in the area.  A horse camp area provides amenities for equestrian visitors.

The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name! Keep all of your certificates together as you travel across our beautiful state completing the Challenge. At the end of the Challenge, mail your entry forms and all collected certificates to KWPT to become eligible for prizes such as camping permits, annual park permits, and more. Completed entry forms and all collected certificates must be received by KWPT by November 1, 2011. See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for complete details and instructions.

This area is full of history. First and most recently is this Geocache located on County Camp area. Originally this was a North Dakota state highway rest stop built around 1970. It was closed and unused for several years until ownership was transferred to Morton County Parks about the year 2000. Several more years of planning and construction resulted in a popular camp area.
 Across the fence line is the site of “Fort Rice” military POST established 7/7/1864 by General Alfred H Sully as a field base for several expeditions. Named for General James C Rice who died during the Civil War. Fort rice was the first and one of the most important military POSTs on the upper Missouri River serving many expeditions up to 11/25/1878 when it was abandoned. In 1913 the State of North Dakota acquired Fort Rice military POST and in 1940 WPA (Works Progress Administration) marked the Foundations and corners of the buildings. Short history and map is on a site marker in the historic site. Also near this location is the Fort Rice military Cemetery. Enjoy this area while you search for a micro-Geocache, bring a pencil to sign the log.</groundspeak:long_description>

 a look back at the past if you stop, look and listen.
