            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Covering more than 292,000 hectares, Nitmiluk National Park is&lt;br/&gt;located north-east of Katherine. Its northern edge borders Kakadu&lt;br/&gt;National Park and shares the magnificent Arnhem Land escarpment.&lt;br/&gt;Nitmiluk is home to the spectacular Katherine Gorge, a series of 13&lt;br/&gt;sandstone gorges carved over thousands of years by the Katherine&lt;br/&gt;River. The impressive gorge walls and white sandy beaches can be&lt;br/&gt;explored on foot, by canoe or on a cruise and are stunning from the&lt;br/&gt;air on a scenic helicopter flight. The Nitmiluk Visitors Centre,&lt;br/&gt;located at the start of the first gorge, is adjacent to a serene&lt;br/&gt;picnic area. Previously known as Katherine Gorge National Park, the&lt;br/&gt;Park was handed back to the local Aboriginal people and renamed&lt;br/&gt;Nitmiluk, meaning 'Cicada Place'. The Park is jointly managed by&lt;br/&gt;the Northern Territory Government and the Jawoyn people in&lt;br/&gt;accordance with traditional Jawoyn law. Aboriginal culture is&lt;br/&gt;strong in the area and there are many Aboriginal rock art sites&lt;br/&gt;dotted throughout the Park. There are many adventure activities on&lt;br/&gt;offer in Nitmiluk National Park. It is a haven for nature lovers,&lt;br/&gt;with its rugged landscapes, dramatic waterfalls and lush gorges&lt;br/&gt;providing an abundance of flora and fauna. During the Dry, roughly&lt;br/&gt;from April to October, the Katherine Gorge waters are placid in&lt;br/&gt;most spots and ideal for swimming and canoeing. There may be&lt;br/&gt;freshwater crocodiles in parts of the river but, unlike their&lt;br/&gt;saltwater cousins, they rarely attack unless cornered and provoked.&lt;br/&gt;Park your car at the car park at S 14.18.843 E 132.25.382 &amp;&lt;br/&gt;proceed up the walking track for about 20 minutes to the lookout.&lt;br/&gt;You will encounter quite a lot of steps to get to the top of the&lt;br/&gt;gorge so a reasonable degree of fitness is required &amp; it is&lt;br/&gt;recommended that you take something to drink &amp; sun protection&lt;br/&gt;as well. You have the option of doing the round circuit back to the&lt;br/&gt;information center but turning off to the car park before reaching&lt;br/&gt;the info center. This will take well over an hour or you can&lt;br/&gt;retrace your steps from GZ back to the car park if you can’t&lt;br/&gt;spare as much time. The cache container is an ammo tin that should&lt;br/&gt;be quite easy to find. Please be mindful of muggles when retrieving&lt;br/&gt;the cache &amp; make sure that the cache is not left visible when&lt;br/&gt;you return it to its hide. Enjoy this beautiful place &amp;&lt;br/&gt;don’t forget that there are a few other caches nearby to&lt;br/&gt;discover if you haven’t already. &lt;a href=&quot;http://s07.flagcounter.com/more/I19&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
