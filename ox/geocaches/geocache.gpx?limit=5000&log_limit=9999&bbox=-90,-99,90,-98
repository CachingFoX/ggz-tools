Enjoy the history lesson while here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Convair F-106 Delta Dart was the primary all-weather interceptor aircraft for the United States Air Force from the 1960s through the 1980s. Designed as the so-called &quot;Ultimate Interceptor&quot;, it has proven to be the last dedicated interceptor in USAF service to date. The F-15A started replacing the F-106 in 1981, with the &quot;Sixes&quot; typically passed on to Air National Guard units. The F-106 remained in service in various USAF and ANG units until 1988.&lt;br/&gt;General characteristics:&lt;br/&gt;Crew: 2&lt;br/&gt;Length: 70.7 ft (21.55 m)&lt;br/&gt;Wingspan: 38.25 ft (11.67 m)&lt;br/&gt;Height: 20.28 ft (6.18 m)&lt;br/&gt;Wing area: 695 ft²/64.57m² (Conically-Cambered Wing)&lt;br/&gt;Empty weight: 24,861 lb (11,274 kg)&lt;br/&gt;Powerplant: 1× Pratt &amp; Whitney J75-17 afterburning turbojet, 24,500 lbf (109 kN)&lt;br/&gt;Performance:&lt;br/&gt;Maximum speed: 1,328 mph, 2,138 km/h&lt;br/&gt;Range: 1,809 mi (2,913 km) combat&lt;br/&gt;Ceiling: 52,700 ft (16,062 m)&lt;br/&gt;Rate of climb: 29,000 ft/min (150 m/s)</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache IS at the posted coordinates. The challenge is to
have a MINIMUM of 249 finds before searching for this one!&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know, I know - it's not about the numbers. Except sometimes,
it IS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've placed this one to honor those cachers who've reached the
2nd milestone on their journey into the big leagues!! It's an
important number that shows you've stuck with it, and you deserve
to be recognized!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not search for this cache until you hit 249 finds or
more... your log WILL be deleted. (sorry, them's the rules)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify: You don't need to make this cache your 250th find
for it to count - you just need to have any amount of caches over
249.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you DO make this cache your 250th find and show us the stats
to prove it (either a screen shot of your log or stats page), I'll
add you to the list on the description page as an &quot;Official Member
of Alamo City's 250 Finds Club!&quot; (Pride arrives with 250
smileys.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The
following prestigious cachers made this cache their 250th
find:
~~FlyingZZ~~
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Team OCD for posting the various &quot;### Smileys -
Milestone Challenge&quot; caches and the inspiration for this one.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache IS at the posted coordinates. The challenge is to
have a MINIMUM of 99 finds before searching for this one!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know, I know - it's not about the numbers. Except sometimes,
it IS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've placed this one to honor those beginner cachers who reach
the milestone that brings them into the big leagues!! It's an
important number, and you deserve to be recognized!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not search for this cache until you hit 99 finds or
more... your log WILL be deleted. (sorry, them's the rules)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify: You don't need to make this cache your 100th find
for it to count - you just need to have any amount of caches over
99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you DO make this cache your 100th find and show me the stats
to prove it (either a screen shot of your log or stats page), I'll
add you to the list on the description page as an &quot;Official Member
of Alamo City's100 Finds Club!&quot; (Pride arrives with 100
smileys.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The
following prestigious cachers made this cache their 100th
find:
~~The 4
Coles~~
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Team OCD for posting the original &quot;100 Smileys -

&quot;eggceptional&quot; cachers we've met along the way!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BYOP, room for log and micro coins. Not recommened for small
children or those leary of caches along busy roadways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***UPDATE
10/10/10***&lt;br /&gt;
Based on some logs regarding the traffic near the cache, I'm
updating the D/T to 2/1.5.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the &quot;2000 Cheeseburger Dreams&quot; event celebrating 2000 finds
for ItsLoveInStereo and bannapoo, we received a package of camo
eggs for future cache placements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to create a series of caches in honor of those
eggceptional Eggspert cachers we've had the pleasure of meeting and
caching with along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is in honor of Cape Cod cachers &quot;erycka &amp;
wichie.&quot; ABNscot13 met wichie on the trail on Cape Cod and was the
1st cacher to log his yellow jeep TB (a real yellow jeep no less)
and then ran into wichie again going for his 1st FTF on &quot;PEZHEAD's
The Hobbitt&quot; (a great co-FTF ). ABNscot13 also had the pleasure of
joining erycka &amp; wichie and 11 other cachers for the group FTF
on &quot;Geocacher's Challenge II&quot; which also happened to be their 600th
find. They are also the owners of one of our favorite series of
caches: Cape Cod Towns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erycka &amp; wichie are eggceptional Eggspert cachers because
they've found 1322 caches and hidden 40 caches with 79 FTF's since
starting their caching adventures just over 2 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hats off to erycka &amp; wichie!!!&lt;/p&gt;

Leave the small colored beads, they'll help keep it dry. Please replace carefully to make sure it doesn't get moved by wind or rain or muggle.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is our first hidden cache and hope it will be well
received. We've hidden a small container in this quickly developing
area. There's no room for a writing stick so BYOP. The difficulty
rating is due to the high muggle traffic, but you should be able to
park within 20-50 feet of ground-zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is dedicated to one of my favorite movies as a kid,
to Monkey (of Bug&amp;MonkeyShow) for soon to be obvious reasons,
and the character who spoke the words of wisdom below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite quotes:&lt;br /&gt;
D: Hey, what kind of belt do you have?&lt;br /&gt;
M: Canvas. JC Penney, $3.98. You like?&lt;br /&gt;
D: [laughs] No, I meant...&lt;br /&gt;
M: In Okinawa, belt mean no need rope to hold up pants.&lt;/p&gt;

their paces and be a good challenge for the newer cachers.&lt;/p&gt;

will be plentiful OR the muggles will be descending like

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;A character in a popular 1980's sci-fi movie was known for
spouting off with this phrase,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

for a ______.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you name the movie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one should be easy for the more experienced cachers and a
nice challenge for the newer cachers. Parking is plentiful, but so
are the muggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would pay for this cache?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old King Cole
was a merry old soul&lt;br /&gt;
And a merry old soul was he;&lt;br /&gt;
He called for his pipe, and he called for his bowl&lt;br /&gt;
And he called for his fiddlers three.&lt;br /&gt;
Every fiddler he had a fiddle,&lt;br /&gt;
And a very fine fiddle had he;&lt;br /&gt;
Oh there's none so rare, as can compare&lt;br /&gt;
With King Cole and his fiddlers three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very near this location you should be able to find a pipe, a
bowl, and maybe even a fiddle or two.&lt;/p&gt;

As we just started searching for this one we noticed another vehicle pull up and the &quot;race&quot; was on.  We got to meet some fellow geocachers and together we all found the cache.  It seems both GPSr's were off by a 10 feet or so.  Just think of where you would hide the cache if you were hiding it in this area.

In: Nada
Out: TB

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The container is homemade from PVC painted green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you replace the cap, don't screw it on any further than
when it's snug and the red lines line up. If it gets too tight it
will seize up and will take a wrench to open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please replace the container cap down and the bottom
&quot;UP&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original cache included a new TB inside. Thanks to buddyfitz11
for creating this cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Went up a little hill on the north side of Reed road and looked all around the barbed wire fence, around trees, etc. Couldnt find it. I then went to look around the median for it since there was a big display. Nothing there. Im thinking after about 1 1/2 years, some maintenance crew just destroyed it.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A triple-double is a basketball term, defined as an individual
performance in a game in which a player accumulates double-digit
totals (i.e., 10 or more) in any three of these categories: points,
rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots. The most common way
for a player to achieve a triple-double is with points, rebounds,
and assists, though on occasion elite defensive players may record
10 or more steals or blocked shots in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea behind this cache is to promote and recognize variety
in Geocaching, and to be interesting and just plain fun, especially
for geocaching Spurs fans!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Challenge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is at the posted coordinates, but in order to log a
'Found It' on it you must have a &quot;Triple-double&quot; in Geocaching, in
other words you must have found 10 or more Geocaches in three of
the following categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Traditional Cache&lt;br /&gt;
• Multi-Cache (offset Cache)&lt;br /&gt;
• Letterbox Hybrid&lt;br /&gt;
• Event Cache&lt;br /&gt;
• Cache In Trash Out Event&lt;br /&gt;
• Mega-Event Cache&lt;br /&gt;
• Mystery or puzzle caches&lt;br /&gt;
• Earthcache&lt;br /&gt;
• GPS Adventures Maze Exhibit&lt;br /&gt;
• Virtual Cache&lt;br /&gt;
• Webcam Cache&lt;br /&gt;
• Locationless (Reverse) Cache&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is placed in an urban area where you can easily find
equipment to play basketball or find fan gear for NBA and college
teams. You could even find a place where you could grab a bite to
eat and watch a game or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Verification:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you complete the challenge find and sign the physical cache
log and when I see an online log entry, I'll verify your
Triple-Double eligibility from your profile page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Consequences &amp; Repercussions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any unverified listings will be immediately deleted and your
GPSr, computer, iPhone and/or first born will be confiscated. My
attorney says I should tell you the part about your first born is a
joke!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to k.f.boom for posting the original &quot;Triple-Double
Challenge Cache&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=55f49bba-ceab-412e-9b22-6f911671aae5&quot;&gt;GC2BYP9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

Until you find it you can't see it. Once you find it you'll know what it looks like. In case you're wondering, its not an elephant. I couldn't lift one up that high or push it into a square tube that size. To CAP it OFF, enjoy hunting and consider bringing cookies to the laddies. </groundspeak:long_description>

A few days ago I saw that bunch of Geo-Jalopy caches on a nice little road not far from our campground.
As the weather was not that good and a little cloudy I decided to go for them and try to break my record of 31 in a day.
Got forty today !    
Thank You to those geocachers who take the time for placing those many caches so we, snowbirds can have a lot of fun geocaching during our winter in the south.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Despite the traffic, the area in front of this neighborhood can be quite pleasant for a casual stroll.  We'll often venture out here in the evenings for a change of pace from our usual walk.  Perhaps the sidewalks along this part of Bulverde will one day extend up and down this portion of the road, giving us more opportunity to walk/run outside of the neighborhood. As for the cache, I don't want to give any more hints than what the title gives, as it would be too easy, and would totally give it away.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As with the other cache that I placed nearby, please don't block either of the two entrances to the neighborhood.  There is room to pull over and park off the road at the corner of Bulverde and Smithson Valley Road.  Often times you'll see groups of cyclists gathered there at the corner taking a break from their ride.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There's no room for swag or a writing utensil, so BYOP, and maybe some tweezers to get the log out of the container.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache is a small plastic tube large enough for some swag, log, and pen.  Original contents are log, pen, and a Starbucks eGift Card for the First to Find.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is my first cache placement.  I couldn't come up with a name for it, as everything I wanted to use was taken already (though that doesn't really matter- just do a search for &quot;Almost Home&quot; and you'll see what I mean).  I decided to go with the obvious and give it the name of the neighborhood I was placing it in front of.  Two caches existed prior to this one with the word 'Belterra' in it.  One is very interesting indeed.  I am sure it won't take nearly as long to find my cache as it took to find the original Belterra.  Do a search for GC3DF7 on the GC site sometime and read the description and logs.  The cache was placed in February of 2002 and wasn't found until January 2012.  If you want to attempt that one, it's only a little more than 3600 miles away, but you would be the STF!  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The power lines may throw your GPS off. Not recommended during rush hour (morning and evening).  It may be hard to find a good place to park, please do not block traffic in and out of the gates to Belterra.  Parking there may draw too much attention. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a nano container on the side of the road.  Parking on Bulverde may be dangerous, so please park on W R Larson Rd and walk the short distance to the cache. There's only room for the log, so BYOP!
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I've been placing caches along Bulverde Rd for a couple of reasons.  I live nearby so it's easy for me to maintain them, but also, I thought it would be kind of neat to piggyback off of the Milestone Miles series, or rather add a number of caches along the route to sort of extend the experience for people. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A note about parking off of W R Larson, if you park close to the business, you might be visited by a couple of barking guard dogs.  I've never encountered them outside of my vehicle, but they sometimes like to bark at your car and chase you a bit as you drive by, so just be careful.  There used to be a dog here that would hang out at the front of the building.  We used to give it treats and water, and you could tell others were doing the same.  She was a sweet dog, I think someone who works in the building finally took her home with them, as we have only seen her a few times over the last few months while the business is open.  Hopefully she has a good home now! </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a large, mega container, that contains about twenty smaller containers within.  Each container within has a log sheet of it's own.  Please take one, and only one.  No tricks, please!
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I remember trick or treating when I was a kid, my friends and I would occassionally arrive at a house that was lit up and decorated for the season, but no one was home (or maybe they just didn't want to answer the door).  On the porch we would find a bowl of candy, sometimes, full, sometimes empty.  Usually, there would be a note nearby saying to take some candy, maybe it would say, &quot;take one, and only one&quot;.  The quesiton for us, at that young age, was &quot;do we take only one, or take a bunch&quot;?!  Sometimes we would find those bowls empty, so obviously, some trick or treaters didn't struggle with the same moral question as we did.  In the end, we always took only what we were instructed to take.  So please, take a single container (log included) and go out and hide it!  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose of this cache is to give other cachers, new and experienced, a chance to grab a container so that they may hide it and publish a cache of their own.  There are about 15 cryo tubes, a couple of small bison tubes, and a couple of small to medium size Geocaching.com official containers.  The FTF, of course, gets first dibs on the container they choose.  The cache sits at the foot of a tree, near the corner of 281 and Bulverde Road (parking available at Walgreens).  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is starting out with some regular swag as well, a few things for the kid cachers; a ball, a pencil and pencil sharpener, a couple of erasers, a small yo yo, and a little ball and paddle toy. I haven't decided quite yet, but this cache may only be temporarily available as it is Halloween themed. Happy Halloween and happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>No hint required, it's pretty big and it's at the foot of a tree.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

The cache is placed in front of a new neighborhood.  Maybe this cache will welcome new geocachers moving into the area!  Any who... I don't do extra smilies, but I would like to know in the logs, who out there gets the reference made in the title?  I'm sure many will know what I'm referring to, but it would be interesting to see if it's still a commonly known pop culture phrase.</groundspeak:long_description>

  &lt;p&gt;I think this cache is pretty easy, but of course 
  I placed it after finding &quot;9key's Evil Cache Deaux&quot;, so my sense of easy may 
  be slightly warped now! Drive in the main entrance to park, get as close to 
  cache as you can, then park and walk in the last 1/4 mile. If you weave around 
  through the trees a little, it's an easy path in, don't try to walk straight, 
  or you'll bushwhack. Have fun, left a few various goodies to find! Make sure 
  you check out all the other great caches in the area! Bring a camera, swim 
  suit and float to really have fun at this park...and plenty of drinking 
  water!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*This cache is already approved by the State Park. It is moved over from GC.com.
Parking is available at parking lots throughout the park. The closest one is near the ranger pay station.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">To reach the park from Ranch Road 620 in Lakeway, turn west onto
Lohmans Crossing Rd. After about 1.5 miles, turn left on Lakeway
Blvd. Follow it for about 1.1 miles and then turn left on Hills
Drive followed by a right turn on Trophy Dr. The trailhead is
located at N30°20.980' W97°59.797'. The city recommends that you
park at the swim center across the street, but we usually park
right at the trailhead. 
&lt;p&gt;The trails are well marked and maintained, but I recommend that
you click here for more information and for a trail
map that you can print and carry with you on the trail. (Use a
color printer if possible, and set to landscape.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to the cache, you will follow the Access Trail (not the
gravel road) for about 1/3 mile, then turn right on the Rim Trail.
Next, turn left on the Canyon Descent Trail. The cache is located
near the Lower Canyon Trail, which forms a loop, so you can go
either direction once you intersect with this trail. &lt;b&gt;The cache
is located within 175 feet of the trail, so please stay on the
trail until you are within this distance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike to the cache is about 2 miles round trip, and I highly
recommend that you take the time to explore the other trails here
as well, as they all lead to some very scenic views throughout the
park.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Beautiful canyon, I'd like to come back after we've had some rain so we can see what this looks like when full of water. With a patchwork of fall colored trees on the hillside opposite this was really magnificent today.

I'm [i]really[/i] glad I didn't try this 'one mile' (not to mention the 500ft up and down) in the middle of Summer though!

He liked the plot because it contained the exact number of oak trees as the number of sons that he had, four.  </groundspeak:long_description>

Cache is a top of hill on the hilltop circle trail &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The view of most of Possum Kingdom lake is well worth the trip alone. The trails are good in dry weather, a bit rocky but wide and curvy with a few steep spots. Once you reach the top the trail is flat with some of the most beautiful views I have ever seen. The container is a plastic camo covered coffee can. Hope to keep it stocked with quality stuff to make it worth the trip. I hope you will enjoy PK Lake and the views as much as I do. I come up a couple of times a month to restore my mind, body and soul. </groundspeak:long_description>

Trails are wide and fairly easy to navigate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will enjoy an excellent hike up new trails here at PK. The trails are wide and not too steep for most of the trail. There are breathtaking views of Hell's Gate from the top. &lt;br/&gt;The cache container is a small bucket with a screw top lid. You will need to squeeze the red tab and spin the lid off. It is hidden within a pile of rocks. As always be on the look out for snakes. I have never seen one here but it helps to be cautious. Enjoy the cache, hike and awsome views.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I named the cache after Mike Myers' character Guru Pitka.&lt;br/&gt;in the movie the Love Guru I rented this weekend and liked it so much I played it three times. The cold weather kept me inside all day Sat. and the other two movies I rented were really bad. But it was a great movie, Jessica Alba certainly added to the movie's appeal :-)</groundspeak:long_description>

You will be traveling on gravel, sand, dirt, grass roads, and &lt;br/&gt;even a few steep hills to climb and go down. You might want to trade your car for a Jeep, or just ride a mountain goat. If it is raining or the roads are wet, Don’t Go.  &lt;br/&gt;I hope no one gets lost, but if you do, don’t call me, call 911 and give them your coordinates and &lt;br/&gt;within a day or two they will find you! All jokes aside, you will see some beautiful country, deer and other animals.  You will pass by many electric wind farms that are being built in some of the areas, quite interesting.  So happy hunting and be careful, and most of all, be discrete.  There are a lot of muggers in the area, like animals and a few humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Practice stealth if warranted, and rehide the cache as you find it so the next person can have the same challenge.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you and good luck.</groundspeak:long_description>

You will need to be&lt;br/&gt;smarter than a 5th grader (or cheat) to solve the puzzle to find&lt;br/&gt;the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache will take you to Antioch School, which is the only one room school in Adams County still on its original site. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  The school district discontinued in 1970.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Antioch School is a one-room red brick rural schoolhouse, constructed in 1902 and located on an Adams County hillside near Pauline in Little Blue Township. The one story vernacular building has a hipped roof with wooden shingles. The central doorway is located in a brick vestibule which has a tower topped with distinctive pyramidal roof. Storage sheds are symmetrical located on each side of the vestibule and are later additions (1930s). Three windows, evenly spaced ten feet apart, are located on both the north and south walls. A brick chimney is located on the north side of the building. The classroom area measures 22 feet in width and 33 feet in length. Original beaded wainscoting is intact on all interior walls. &lt;br/&gt;Two frame privies are located on the school grounds, one to the far north and the other to the far south as proscribed by School Laws of Nebraska for 1901. A storm cellar is also located on the grounds, directly west of the main entrance. In its prominent hillside setting, the Antioch school is an excellent example of a one room rural schoolhouse in its original setting.&lt;br/&gt;** Please do not enter the buildings or storm cellar.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We moved our house from north of
Harvard to Juniata back in 2004 and we had the thought of doing a
multi cache of the route our house took but realized no one
probably cares. (but us) 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
          
           
           
           
           
           
           
           
           &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Moving the house was quite the
memorable experience&lt;br /&gt;
 During the move we passed over several bridges.  
 &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
           
           
           
             
              
             
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
           
           
           
           
           
           
           
           
   
&lt;p&gt;    and one of
the moments was when we saw the weight limit of this
one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   
       &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Move
was all done we were told our house probably weighed a lot more
than the bridge was rated for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like
to see where the house ended up do GC2M64D&lt;/p&gt;

Platte River Cache
Series&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a series of caches to
highlight a very popular bird watching area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The central Platte River
valley is an important stopover for migratory water birds, such as
the Whopping Crane and Sandhill Crane, in their yearly traversal of
the Central Flyway.  Cranes are among the oldest living birds
on the planet.  Fossil records placed cranes in Nebraska more
than nine million years ago, long before there was a Platte River,
which by comparison, is only 10,000 years of age.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These caches have been placed
by 3 families of Geocachers who are all related.  We are
hoping that this series of caches will have easy access for
travelers from I-80 and that they will check out some of the other
great caches in the area while here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the caches are pretty
easy park and grab caches--but we did try to throw in a few that
hopefully will be a bit of a challenge!  We have placed these
caches on public property.  Please be respectful of the
landowners in the area and please do not cross any
fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the months of March and
early April Muggles will be very present in the area to watch the
Crane Migration.  Please watch out for them!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Platte River Cache
Series&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a series of caches to
highlight a very popular bird watching area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The central Platte River
valley is an important stopover for migratory water birds, such as
the Whopping Crane and Sandhill Crane, in their yearly traversal of
the Central Flyway.  Cranes are among the oldest living birds
on the planet.  Fossil records placed cranes in Nebraska more
than nine million years ago, long before there was a Platte River,
which by comparison, is only 10,000 years of age.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These caches have been placed
by 3 families of Geocachers who are all related.  We are
hoping that this series of caches will have easy access for
travelers from I-80 and that they will check out some of the other
great caches in the area while here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the caches are pretty
easy park and grab caches--but we did try to throw in a few that
hopefully will be a bit of a challenge!  We have placed these
caches on public property.  Please be respectful of the
landowners in the area and please do not cross any
fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the months of March and
early April Muggles will be very present in the area to watch the
Crane Migration.  Please watch out for them!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Platte River Cache
Series&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a series of caches to
highlight a very popular bird watching area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The central Platte River
valley is an important stopover for migratory water birds, such as
the Whopping Crane and Sandhill Crane, in their yearly traversal of
the Central Flyway.  Cranes are among the oldest living birds
on the planet.  Fossil records placed cranes in Nebraska more
than nine million years ago, long before there was a Platte River,
which by comparison, is only 10,000 years of age.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These caches have been placed
by 3 families of Geocachers who are all related.  We are
hoping that this series of caches will have easy access for
travelers from I-80 and that they will check out some of the other
great caches in the area while here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the caches are pretty
easy park and grab caches--but we did try to throw in a few that
hopefully will be a bit of a challenge!  We have placed these
caches on public property.  Please be respectful of the
landowners in the area and please do not cross any
fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the months of March and
early April Muggles will be very present in the area to watch the
Crane Migration.  Please watch out for them!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Platte River Cache
Series&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a series of caches to
highlight a very popular bird watching area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The central Platte River
valley is an important stopover for migratory water birds, such as
the Whopping Crane and Sandhill Crane, in their yearly traversal of
the Central Flyway.  Cranes are among the oldest living birds
on the planet.  Fossil records placed cranes in Nebraska more
than nine million years ago, long before there was a Platte River,
which by comparison, is only 10,000 years of age.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These caches have been placed
by 3 families of Geocachers who are all related.  We are
hoping that this series of caches will have easy access for
travelers from I-80 and that they will check out some of the other
great caches in the area while here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the caches are pretty
easy park and grab caches--but we did try to throw in a few that
hopefully will be a bit of a challenge!  We have placed these
caches on public property.  Please be respectful of the
landowners in the area and please do not cross any
fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the months of March and
early April Muggles will be very present in the area to watch the
Crane Migration.  Please watch out for them!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Had to jump over a flooded creek. Will need my rubber boots to go on with this series. So much water! Decided to skip the next two ones.

Platte River Cache
Series&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a series of caches to
highlight a very popular bird watching area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The central Platte River
valley is an important stopover for migratory water birds, such as
the Whopping Crane and Sandhill Crane, in their yearly traversal of
the Central Flyway.  Cranes are among the oldest living birds
on the planet.  Fossil records placed cranes in Nebraska more
than nine million years ago, long before there was a Platte River,
which by comparison, is only 10,000 years of age.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These caches have been placed
by 3 families of Geocachers who are all related.  We are
hoping that this series of caches will have easy access for
travelers from I-80 and that they will check out some of the other
great caches in the area while here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the caches are pretty
easy park and grab caches--but we did try to throw in a few that
hopefully will be a bit of a challenge!  We have placed these
caches on public property.  Please be respectful of the
landowners in the area and please do not cross any
fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the months of March and
early April Muggles will be very present in the area to watch the
Crane Migration.  Please watch out for them!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Platte River Cache
Series&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a series of caches to
highlight a very popular bird watching area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The central Platte River
valley is an important stopover for migratory water birds, such as
the Whopping Crane and Sandhill Crane, in their yearly traversal of
the Central Flyway.  Cranes are among the oldest living birds
on the planet.  Fossil records placed cranes in Nebraska more
than nine million years ago, long before there was a Platte River,
which by comparison, is only 10,000 years of age.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These caches have been placed
by 3 families of Geocachers who are all related.  We are
hoping that this series of caches will have easy access for
travelers from I-80 and that they will check out some of the other
great caches in the area while here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the caches are pretty
easy park and grab caches--but we did try to throw in a few that
hopefully will be a bit of a challenge!  We have placed these
caches on public property.  Please be respectful of the
landowners in the area and please do not cross any

Platte River Cache
Series&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a series of caches to
highlight a very popular bird watching area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The central Platte River
valley is an important stopover for migratory water birds, such as
the Whopping Crane and Sandhill Crane, in their yearly traversal of
the Central Flyway.  Cranes are among the oldest living birds
on the planet.  Fossil records placed cranes in Nebraska more
than nine million years ago, long before there was a Platte River,
which by comparison, is only 10,000 years of age.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These caches have been placed
by 3 families of Geocachers who are all related.  We are
hoping that this series of caches will have easy access for
travelers from I-80 and that they will check out some of the other
great caches in the area while here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the caches are pretty
easy park and grab caches--but we did try to throw in a few that
hopefully will be a bit of a challenge!  We have placed these
caches on public property.  Please be respectful of the
landowners in the area and please do not cross any
fences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the months of March and
early April Muggles will be very present in the area to watch the
Crane Migration.  Please watch out for them!!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We think that this area needs another night cache. With a few pointers from fellow geocachers and help from CRKAT we managed to get it placed and tested. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be courteous while in the area because there most likely will be people camping near the parking coordinates, which are in the campground. Please be sure to park at the listed coords-usually the gate to the park is closed and locked at dusk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Items you will need to complete cache are:  A good flashlight (we used a maglight to set it up), paper and pencil.  It might also be handy to print out a trail map using link.  www.freewebs.com/baderpark&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After parking at the parking coordinates, please proceed to the trail head coords, then follow the trail to the listed beginning coordinates (main coords for cache).  Now you will begin looking for 1 inch round reflectors of various colors (you are not looking for painted fence posts).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Near each reflector there is a tag with a clue on it. You will need to write these down as you find them. The final clue is identified with 3 reflectors.  Once you collect all the clues you will be able to find the final Cache!!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need to return to the trail after retrieving each clue to see the next reflector.  Depending on the season you may not be able to see the next reflector (depending on height of grass), if this is the case just continue on the trail and you should see it WITHIN 15 feet (or the next hill).  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The trail is in the prairie and you will need to leave the trail only to get the clues. By doing so you DO NOT HAVE TO CROSS BUT will be in the same general area as barbed wire fence, ALSO IN THE AREA IS downed tree branches so PLEASE BE CAREFUL.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The final cache is located near a trail, which you can take back to the parking area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF prize is a couple of day passes to Bader Park.&lt;br/&gt;Happy Hunting!!!!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: 102FEB9 - 10&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: 112FEB9 - 11&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: 122FEB9 - 12&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: 132FEB9 - 13&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: 142FEB9 - 14&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN2FEB9 - final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PK2FEB9 - Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 59.264 W 098° 08.960&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S12FEB9 - #1&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S22FEB9 - 2&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S32FEB9 - 3&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S42FEB9 - 4&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S52FEB9 - 5&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S62FEB9 - 6&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S72FEB9 - 7&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S82FEB9 - 8&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S92FEB9 - 9&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TH2FEB9 - Trailhead&lt;br/&gt;N 40° 59.251 W 098° 09.037</groundspeak:long_description>

Some call them a challenge. In any case, they are small, and it could be tough to find them. This one is located in Mitchell, SD. Parking is available very close to the cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Being a blinkie, you will need to bring a writing instrument. As always, try to use stealth!

There can be alot of muggle activity when the grounds are in use, but most of the time it is very quiet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a small camoed container, with log book, pencil, and a few small tradeables to get it going.  Should be accessible year round via the wakling path, though the find might require some wading/digging in winter. </groundspeak:long_description>
