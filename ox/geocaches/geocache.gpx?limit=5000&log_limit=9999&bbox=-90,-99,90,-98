The Convair F-106 Delta Dart was the primary all-weather interceptor aircraft for the United States Air Force from the 1960s through the 1980s. Designed as the so-called &quot;Ultimate Interceptor&quot;, it has proven to be the last dedicated interceptor in USAF service to date. The F-15A started replacing the F-106 in 1981, with the &quot;Sixes&quot; typically passed on to Air National Guard units. The F-106 remained in service in various USAF and ANG units until 1988.

me a story about how she rescued one as a tiny baby and hand fed it
formula till it was full grown, when she released it to wildlife
rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I think this cache is pretty easy, but of course 
  I placed it after finding &quot;9key's Evil Cache Deaux&quot;, so my sense of easy may 
  be slightly warped now! Drive in the main entrance to park, get as close to 
  cache as you can, then park and walk in the last 1/4 mile. If you weave around 
  through the trees a little, it's an easy path in, don't try to walk straight, 
  or you'll bushwhack. Have fun, left a few various goodies to find! Make sure 
  you check out all the other great caches in the area! Bring a camera, swim 
  suit and float to really have fun at this park...and plenty of drinking 
  water!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
*This cache is already approved by the State Park. It is moved over from GC.com.
Parking is available at parking lots throughout the park. The closest one is near the ranger pay station.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">To reach the park from Ranch Road 620 in Lakeway, turn west onto
Lohmans Crossing Rd. After about 1.5 miles, turn left on Lakeway
Blvd. Follow it for about 1.1 miles and then turn left on Hills
Drive followed by a right turn on Trophy Dr. The trailhead is
located at N30°20.980' W97°59.797'. The city recommends that you
park at the swim center across the street, but we usually park
right at the trailhead. 
&lt;p&gt;The trails are well marked and maintained, but I recommend that
you click here for more information and for a trail
map that you can print and carry with you on the trail. (Use a
color printer if possible, and set to landscape.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to the cache, you will follow the Access Trail (not the
gravel road) for about 1/3 mile, then turn right on the Rim Trail.
Next, turn left on the Canyon Descent Trail. The cache is located
near the Lower Canyon Trail, which forms a loop, so you can go
either direction once you intersect with this trail. &lt;b&gt;The cache
is located within 175 feet of the trail, so please stay on the
trail until you are within this distance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hike to the cache is about 2 miles round trip, and I highly
recommend that you take the time to explore the other trails here
as well, as they all lead to some very scenic views throughout the
park.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Beautiful canyon, I'd like to come back after we've had some rain so we can see what this looks like when full of water. With a patchwork of fall colored trees on the hillside opposite this was really magnificent today.

I'm [i]really[/i] glad I didn't try this 'one mile' (not to mention the 500ft up and down) in the middle of Summer though!

We placed this cache on our way to Colorado Bend SP(our local SP). We love historical locations and this was a perfect place to place the cache. Hope that you find this location as informative as we did. The container only contains a log. BYOP. The container is a camo taped milk bottle. Please return container back to original location.

I request that if you take one please leave one.
The container is a small ammo can and is against the fence next to the gate to my property. Please park in the drive.

If I am there the gate will not be locked and come on it for a visit. </groundspeak:long_description>

The view of most of Possum Kingdom lake is well worth the trip alone. The trails are good in dry weather, a bit rocky but wide and curvy with a few steep spots. Once you reach the top the trail is flat with some of the most beautiful views I have ever seen. The container is a plastic camo covered coffee can. Hope to keep it stocked with quality stuff to make it worth the trip. I hope you will enjoy PK Lake and the views as much as I do. I come up a couple of times a month to restore my mind, body and soul. </groundspeak:long_description>

You will enjoy an excellent hike up new trails here at PK. The trails are wide and not too steep for most of the trail. There are breathtaking views of Hell's Gate from the top. 
The cache container is a small bucket with a screw top lid. You will need to squeeze the red tab and spin the lid off. It is hidden within a pile of rocks. As always be on the look out for snakes. I have never seen one here but it helps to be cautious. Enjoy the cache, hike and awsome views.

I named the cache after Mike Myers' character Guru Pitka.
in the movie the Love Guru I rented this weekend and liked it so much I played it three times. The cold weather kept me inside all day Sat. and the other two movies I rented were really bad. But it was a great movie, Jessica Alba certainly added to the movie's appeal :-)</groundspeak:long_description>

I spent the weekend at the lake and rented the Love Guru with Mike Myers. It was cold on Saturday so I spent the day inside and watched the movie 3 times. Well, the other two movies were awful. I had this Steve Miller &quot;The Joker&quot; song from the movie in my head all weekend so I named one of the caches after one of the lyrics in the song 
Some people call me the space cowboy, yeah
Some call me the gangster of love
Some people call me maurice
Cause I speak of the pompitous of love

People talk about me, baby
Say Im doin you wrong, doin you wrong
Well, dont you worry baby
Dont worry
Cause Im right here, right here, right here, right here at home

Cause Im a picker
Im a grinner
Im a lover
And Im a sinner
I play my music in the sun

Please enjoy the new trails and the awsome views of my favorite place on Earth.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the Pratt Operations Office and the 2011 KWPT State Parks Challenge! This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas. The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for specific details and instructions.


The Department of Wildlife and Parks’ Operations Office and Wildlife Museum share grounds with the Pratt Hatchery, and many visitors tour the facilities each year. The hatchery grounds consist of 87 culture
ponds and two concrete raceways.  The primary water supply for the hatchery is a shallow five-acre
reservoir on the Ninnescah River at the east edge of Pratt’s Lemon Park. With the supplemental help of two wells, the hatchery is capable of running 3,000 gallons of water per minute through the gravity-flow system.  Water flows continuously through the hatchery and back into the Ninnescah, giving the facility high-quality water. Fish species raised at the Pratt Hatchery include walleye, wiper (white bass/striped bass hybrid), sauger, saugeye (walleye/sauger hybrid), large- mouth bass, channel catfish, and bluegill. 


The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name! Keep all of your certificates together as you travel across our beautiful state completing the Challenge. At the end of the Challenge, mail your entry forms and all collected certificates to KWPT to become eligible for prizes such as camping permits, annual park permits, and more. Completed entry forms and all collected certificates must be received by KWPT by November 1, 2011. See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for complete details and instructions.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Smokey Hill Wildlife Area and the 2011 KWPT State Parks Challenge! This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas. The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for specific details and instructions.

The wildlife area offers an abundance of game and generally moderate hunting pressure.  Several multi-use trails originating from Kanopolis State Park lead into the wildlife area.  These trails allow hike, bike and horseback riding, and are closed to all but foot traffic from November 1 through January 31 annually. There is no horse access other than through the state park, while bikers and hikers can access the trails from the Alum Creek parking lot as well.  The wildlife area trails are closed from Nov1-Jan 31 annually to limit hunter disturbance and for safety.  Wildlife viewing and photography opportunities are plentiful. In the winter several bald eagles and ospreys fish the river.  Songbirds and wildflowers brighten the landscape throughout the area.

The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name!

In Dakota Sandstone Country are five acres of curious sandstone formations that have an Alice in Wonderland effect on visitors.  Located one mile south of Carneiro in Ellsworth County, Mushroom Rock State Park is one of the truly amazing wonders of Kansas.  This unique geological oddity has drawn people including Indians, mountain men, soldiers, and present day visitors.  Kit Carson was to have said
that the area was his “favorite little place.”

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Lovewell Wildlife Area and the 2011 KWPT State Parks Challenge! This multi-cache is part of a state-wide contest with a total of 31 participating State Parks and Wildlife Areas. The contest ends on November 1, 2011, and only Official KWPT Challenge caches are eligible for this statewide contest.  Normal park access fees apply. 

See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for specific details and instructions.


Lovewell Wildlife Area has 2,215 acres of public hunting area available around the reservoir.  Lovewell Dam impounds approximately 3,000 surface acres of water and is situated on White Rock Creek.  Expect lower water levels in the late summer through winter months but the reservoir is refilled annually by diverting water from the Republican River at Guide Rock, Nebraska into a canal that empties into the northeast corner of the reservoir.  Species managed for include deer, turkey, waterfowl and upland game like pheasant, quail, rabbit and squirrel.

The posted coordinates will take you to the first part of a two-stage multi-cache. This container will be marked &quot;First Geocache&quot; where you will discover a logbook to sign, and the coordinates to the second stage. Once you find the container marked &quot;Second Geocache&quot;, sign the logbook, take a certificate, and then record your find here. Please do not share coordinates or coupons with other players, and make sure your signature in the logbook matches your online user name! Keep all of your certificates together as you travel across our beautiful state completing the Challenge. At the end of the Challenge, mail your entry forms and all collected certificates to KWPT to become eligible for prizes such as camping permits, annual park permits, and more. Completed entry forms and all collected certificates must be received by KWPT by November 1, 2011. See the KWPT webpage http://kdwp.state.ks.us/news/Other-Services/Outdoor-Activities/Geocaching for complete details and instructions.

The cache will take you to Antioch School, which is the only one room school in Adams County still on its original site. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  The school district discontinued in 1970.  

Antioch School is a one-room red brick rural schoolhouse, constructed in 1902 and located on an Adams County hillside near Pauline in Little Blue Township. The one story vernacular building has a hipped roof with wooden shingles. The central doorway is located in a brick vestibule which has a tower topped with distinctive pyramidal roof. Storage sheds are symmetrical located on each side of the vestibule and are later additions (1930s). Three windows, evenly spaced ten feet apart, are located on both the north and south walls. A brick chimney is located on the north side of the building. The classroom area measures 22 feet in width and 33 feet in length. Original beaded wainscoting is intact on all interior walls. 
Two frame privies are located on the school grounds, one to the far north and the other to the far south as proscribed by School Laws of Nebraska for 1901. A storm cellar is also located on the grounds, directly west of the main entrance. In its prominent hillside setting, the Antioch school is an excellent example of a one room rural schoolhouse in its original setting.
** Please do not enter the buildings or storm cellar.  The cache is not located there –you will need to solve the puzzle to find the cache **

Harvard to Juniata back in 2004 and we had the thought of doing a
multi cache of the route our house took but realized no one
probably cares. (but us) 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  
          
           
           
           
           
           
           
           
           &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Moving the house was quite the
memorable experience&lt;br/&gt;
 During the move we passed over several bridges.  
 &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
           
           
           
             
              
             
     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
           
           
           
           
           
           
           
           
   
&lt;p&gt;    and one of
the moments was when we saw the weight limit of this
one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   
       &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Move
was all done we were told our house probably weighed a lot more
than the bridge was rated for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like
to see where the house ended up do GC2M64D&lt;/p&gt;

Platte River Cache
Series&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is a series of caches to
highlight a very popular bird watching area.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The central Platte River
valley is an important stopover for migratory water birds, such as
the Whopping Crane and Sandhill Crane, in their yearly traversal of
the Central Flyway.  Cranes are among the oldest living birds
on the planet.  Fossil records placed cranes in Nebraska more
than nine million years ago, long before there was a Platte River,
which by comparison, is only 10,000 years of age.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
These caches have been placed
by 3 families of Geocachers who are all related.  We are
hoping that this series of caches will have easy access for
travelers from I-80 and that they will check out some of the other
great caches in the area while here.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Most of the caches are pretty
easy park and grab caches--but we did try to throw in a few that
hopefully will be a bit of a challenge!  We have placed these
caches on public property.  Please be respectful of the
landowners in the area and please do not cross any
fences.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
During the months of March and
early April Muggles will be very present in the area to watch the
Crane Migration.  Please watch out for them!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Platte River Cache
Series&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is a series of caches to
highlight a very popular bird watching area.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The central Platte River
valley is an important stopover for migratory water birds, such as
the Whopping Crane and Sandhill Crane, in their yearly traversal of
the Central Flyway.  Cranes are among the oldest living birds
on the planet.  Fossil records placed cranes in Nebraska more
than nine million years ago, long before there was a Platte River,
which by comparison, is only 10,000 years of age.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
These caches have been placed
by 3 families of Geocachers who are all related.  We are
hoping that this series of caches will have easy access for
travelers from I-80 and that they will check out some of the other
great caches in the area while here.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Most of the caches are pretty
easy park and grab caches--but we did try to throw in a few that
hopefully will be a bit of a challenge!  We have placed these
caches on public property.  Please be respectful of the
landowners in the area and please do not cross any
fences.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
During the months of March and
early April Muggles will be very present in the area to watch the
Crane Migration.  Please watch out for them!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Platte River Cache
Series&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is a series of caches to
highlight a very popular bird watching area.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The central Platte River
valley is an important stopover for migratory water birds, such as
the Whopping Crane and Sandhill Crane, in their yearly traversal of
the Central Flyway.  Cranes are among the oldest living birds
on the planet.  Fossil records placed cranes in Nebraska more
than nine million years ago, long before there was a Platte River,
which by comparison, is only 10,000 years of age.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
These caches have been placed
by 3 families of Geocachers who are all related.  We are
hoping that this series of caches will have easy access for
travelers from I-80 and that they will check out some of the other
great caches in the area while here.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Most of the caches are pretty
easy park and grab caches--but we did try to throw in a few that
hopefully will be a bit of a challenge!  We have placed these
caches on public property.  Please be respectful of the
landowners in the area and please do not cross any
fences.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
During the months of March and
early April Muggles will be very present in the area to watch the
Crane Migration.  Please watch out for them!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Platte River Cache
Series&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is a series of caches to
highlight a very popular bird watching area.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The central Platte River
valley is an important stopover for migratory water birds, such as
the Whopping Crane and Sandhill Crane, in their yearly traversal of
the Central Flyway.  Cranes are among the oldest living birds
on the planet.  Fossil records placed cranes in Nebraska more
than nine million years ago, long before there was a Platte River,
which by comparison, is only 10,000 years of age.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
These caches have been placed
by 3 families of Geocachers who are all related.  We are
hoping that this series of caches will have easy access for
travelers from I-80 and that they will check out some of the other
great caches in the area while here.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Most of the caches are pretty
easy park and grab caches--but we did try to throw in a few that
hopefully will be a bit of a challenge!  We have placed these
caches on public property.  Please be respectful of the
landowners in the area and please do not cross any
fences.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
During the months of March and
early April Muggles will be very present in the area to watch the
Crane Migration.  Please watch out for them!!</groundspeak:long_description>

valley is an important stopover for migratory water birds, such as
the Whopping Crane and Sandhill Crane, in their yearly traversal of
the Central Flyway.  Cranes are among the oldest living birds
on the planet.  Fossil records placed cranes in Nebraska more
than nine million years ago, long before there was a Platte River,
which by comparison, is only 10,000 years of age.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
These caches have been placed
by 3 families of Geocachers who are all related.  We are
hoping that this series of caches will have easy access for
travelers from I-80 and that they will check out some of the other
great caches in the area while here.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Most of the caches are pretty
easy park and grab caches--but we did try to throw in a few that
hopefully will be a bit of a challenge!  We have placed these
caches on public property.  Please be respectful of the
landowners in the area and please do not cross any
fences.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
During the months of March and
early April Muggles will be very present in the area to watch the
Crane Migration.  Please watch out for them!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Platte River Cache
Series&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is a series of caches to
highlight a very popular bird watching area.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The central Platte River
valley is an important stopover for migratory water birds, such as
the Whopping Crane and Sandhill Crane, in their yearly traversal of
the Central Flyway.  Cranes are among the oldest living birds
on the planet.  Fossil records placed cranes in Nebraska more
than nine million years ago, long before there was a Platte River,
which by comparison, is only 10,000 years of age.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
These caches have been placed
by 3 families of Geocachers who are all related.  We are
hoping that this series of caches will have easy access for
travelers from I-80 and that they will check out some of the other
great caches in the area while here.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Most of the caches are pretty
easy park and grab caches--but we did try to throw in a few that
hopefully will be a bit of a challenge!  We have placed these
caches on public property.  Please be respectful of the
landowners in the area and please do not cross any
fences.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
During the months of March and
early April Muggles will be very present in the area to watch the
Crane Migration.  Please watch out for them!!</groundspeak:long_description>

Adding some wood helped me crossing the flooded creek.

Platte River Cache
Series&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is a series of caches to
highlight a very popular bird watching area.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The central Platte River
valley is an important stopover for migratory water birds, such as
the Whopping Crane and Sandhill Crane, in their yearly traversal of
the Central Flyway.  Cranes are among the oldest living birds
on the planet.  Fossil records placed cranes in Nebraska more
than nine million years ago, long before there was a Platte River,
which by comparison, is only 10,000 years of age.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
These caches have been placed
by 3 families of Geocachers who are all related.  We are
hoping that this series of caches will have easy access for
travelers from I-80 and that they will check out some of the other
great caches in the area while here.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Most of the caches are pretty
easy park and grab caches--but we did try to throw in a few that
hopefully will be a bit of a challenge!  We have placed these
caches on public property.  Please be respectful of the
landowners in the area and please do not cross any
fences.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
During the months of March and
early April Muggles will be very present in the area to watch the
Crane Migration.  Please watch out for them!!</groundspeak:long_description>

We were introduced to this park a couple of months back and thought this would be a great area to place some geocaches.  Bader Park is a river front park owned by Merrick County.  There is a $4.00 per car park admission fee that is used to cover operating costs and park improvements. As always please help keep the park clean, fun and safe for all visitors.

Allthough it is close to the road-this cache needs to be accessed through the park entrance.  Do not park on the roadway.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We think that this area needs another night cache. With a few pointers from fellow geocachers and help from CRKAT we managed to get it placed and tested. 

Please be courteous while in the area because there most likely will be people camping near the parking coordinates, which are in the campground. Please be sure to park at the listed coords-usually the gate to the park is closed and locked at dusk.

Items you will need to complete cache are:  A good flashlight (we used a maglight to set it up), paper and pencil.  It might also be handy to print out a trail map using link.  www.freewebs.com/baderpark

After parking at the parking coordinates, please proceed to the trail head coords, then follow the trail to the listed beginning coordinates (main coords for cache).  Now you will begin looking for 1 inch round reflectors of various colors (you are not looking for painted fence posts).

Near each reflector there is a tag with a clue on it. You will need to write these down as you find them. The final clue is identified with 3 reflectors.  Once you collect all the clues you will be able to find the final Cache!!  

You will need to return to the trail after retrieving each clue to see the next reflector.  Depending on the season you may not be able to see the next reflector (depending on height of grass), if this is the case just continue on the trail and you should see it WITHIN 15 feet (or the next hill).  
 
The trail is in the prairie and you will need to leave the trail only to get the clues. By doing so you DO NOT HAVE TO CROSS BUT will be in the same general area as barbed wire fence, ALSO IN THE AREA IS downed tree branches so PLEASE BE CAREFUL.
 
The final cache is located near a trail, which you can take back to the parking area.

FTF prize is a couple of day passes to Bader Park.
Happy Hunting!!!!!!

Once we finally found time to hike the Tall Grass Praire we knew
that it MUST have it's own series of caches. Enjoy your hike in the
natural prairie setting. Bader Park is a river front park owned by
Merrick County. There is a $4.00 per car park admission fee that is
used to cover operating costs and park improvements. As always
please help keep the park clean, fun and safe for all visitors. We
have permission from the park manager to place this cache. Be aware
if water level is high you may have to wade across a couple places
on the trail.</groundspeak:long_description>
