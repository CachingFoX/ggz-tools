Both [b]RockFiend[/b] and [b]ScurvyDog[/b] educated [i]TGRs[/i] on this kind of hide in 2004.  Worse, recall that they used an even more evil attachment mechanism on a few! [}:)]  

That's why it is important to [i]Geo-Range[/i] beyond one's local area to pick up on the various hide styles employed elsewhere, unless cherry picking low hanging fruit like [i]LPCs[/i] is your thing, solely for the numbers. [V]

Good hide bajatym ... wonder if the nearby beach cache hidden by those screwy surfers is still in play?  That was an excellent example of a great hide!

attracting Steekers of all kinds. Find the Steekers, and you'll
find the cache.

This is a fun &amp; easy 2 part
Multi cache&lt;br /&gt;
The posted coords are WP1&lt;br /&gt;
When you get there, you must find a hidden Game Piece&lt;br /&gt;
Read the instructions on the Game Piece, and play the Game&lt;br /&gt;
to get the coordinates for the final cache
location.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have successfully found
the final coords,&lt;br /&gt;
Shake and Rattle the Game real good to keep it a challenge&lt;br /&gt;

We read ahead and found out the paper log was full so we brought a new one so future geocachers can add their entries. My 5 year old left a little treasure. We also found a Groundspeak &quot;The Travel Bug&quot; connected to a Gumby guy. We plan on moving it to a new location.

My dear friend and intrepid traveler,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After much planning, I have prepared a new and exciting challenge
for you. Called &lt;b&gt;Around the World in 80
Caches!&lt;/b&gt;, it requires patience, ingenuity, and the
ability to handle the unexpected. In this journey, you will be
venturing into several countries, 80 in all, in search of concealed
artifacts. The countries will lead you to continents, and the
continents will lead you to the ultimate prize, hereafter known as
&quot;The World.&quot; Based on your experience and past adventures, I am
confident you will succeed. As always, travel safe and be sure to
document your findings. I look forward to hearing all about your
grand expedition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your great admirer,&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; Information in this cache will help you
solve &lt;b&gt;Antarctica: ATW80&lt;/b&gt;
(GC1MGBZ), a puzzle cache tied to the related countries.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya,
also historically known as Liverpool Island or Lindsay
Island)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is an uninhabited
sub-antarctic volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean, It is a
dependent area of Norway and is not subject to the Antarctic

&lt;p&gt;Bouvet Island is the most remote island in
the world. The nearest land is Queen Maud Land, Antarctica, over
1,000 miles away to the south, which is itself
uninhabited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has no ports or harbours, only offshore
anchorages, and is therefore difficult to approach. Wave action has
created a very steep coast. The easiest way to access the island is
with a helicopter from a ship. The glaciers form a thick ice layer
falling in high cliffs into the sea or onto the black beaches of
volcanic sand. The 29.6 km (18.4 miles) of coastline are often
surrounded by an ice pack. The highest point on the island is
called Olavtoppen, whose peak is 780 m (2,559 ft) above sea level.
A lava shelf on the island's west coast, which appeared between
1955 and 1958, provides a nesting site for birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bouvet Island was discovered on January 1,
1739, by Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier, who commanded the
French ships Aigle and Marie. However, the island's position was
not accurately fixed having been placed eight degrees to the east,
and Bouvet did not circumnavigate his discovery, so it remained
unclear whether it was an island or part of a continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an easy 2 part Multi Cache, at the
posted Coords, look for the hidden object to find the coords for
WP2.&lt;br /&gt;
 the final location of the Cache, a camo'd Decon container placed
out of view.&lt;br /&gt;
 Contains a Log Sheet, pencil and small trade items, with room for
small TB's and coins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun, and collect the code in the cache

Only to find out that the City of HB does not allow you to just land in any parking lot you want. I told the FAA and the cops that I only need a few minutes and then I would move the helicopter. While they closed the street and where trying to figure out why I had landed here. I found WP1 and now off to WP2. I looked and looked are you kidding me. This blends in way to well here. Ok now to WP3. I looked down then up then over. Where could it be. These containers hide so darn well. Now that I had signed the log and had the code. I had to get back and move the helicopter. I just walked up and jumped in. There was dust all over the cop cars and they did not look happy. Maybe you should add to the cache page that you really don't need a helicopter to find this cache. </groundspeak:text>

My dear friend and intrepid traveler,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After much planning, I have prepared a new and exciting challenge
for you. Called &lt;b&gt;Around the World in 80
Caches!&lt;/b&gt;, it requires patience, ingenuity, and the
ability to handle the unexpected. In this journey, you will be
venturing into several countries, 80 in all, in search of concealed
artifacts. The countries will lead you to continents, and the
continents will lead you to the ultimate prize, hereafter known as
&quot;The World.&quot; Based on your experience and past adventures, I am
confident you will succeed. As always, travel safe and be sure to
document your findings. I look forward to hearing all about your
grand expedition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your great admirer,&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; Information in this cache will help you

&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;SUDAN (officially the Republic of
Sudan)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a country in
northeastern Africa. It is the largest in the African continent and
the Arab World, and tenth largest in the world by area.&lt;br /&gt;
 In Sudan's 1993 census, the population was recorded to be 25
million. No comprehensive census has been carried out since then
due to the continuation of the civil war. A 2006 United Nations
estimate put the population at about 37 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sudan has 597 tribes that speak over 400
different languages dialects, but there are two distinct major
cultures – Arabs with Nubian roots, and non-Arab Black Africans –
consisting of hundreds of ethnic and tribal divisions and language
groups.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Great Cache, took me forever to find it because my old Rino 110 kept dropping to 80ft accuracy around the location and I wasn't paying attention on here and never saw the hint (don't be afraid to stick your head around it) which was my first suspect but i didn't look good enough so I went digging around for about an hour. There's a couple papers in there that are water damaged and i found a spider too, other wise though the new log is in good condition but I recommend the owner put it in a ziploc bag. Not too many muggles when I went in the evening just occasional joggers, dog people, and some kids smoking weed a lot, mistakened an old blue marijuana container for the cache at first. Well worth it though, it led me on a nice hike through Gum Grove which I didn't even knew existed until now. Very fun TFTC 

There was one thing left for swap in it which I traded for something of greater value that should be cool for the next person to find this just to add to the fun.

&lt;p&gt;Guidelines for this series are listed below:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. &lt;b&gt;FTF&lt;/b&gt;'er should place the next cache in the series&lt;br /&gt;
(LBC/Lakewood/W of the 605 cities : Curse of the &lt;b&gt;FTF&lt;/b&gt; #7
)&lt;br /&gt;
within 1 month. Otherwise the curse will prevent you from
ever&lt;br /&gt;
getting another &lt;b&gt;FTF&lt;/b&gt; again!!! Muahahahaha!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. You can only be a &lt;b&gt;FTF&lt;/b&gt; for this series once. This is
to&lt;br /&gt;
give others a chance to be a &lt;b&gt;FTF&lt;/b&gt;'er.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Cache can be any type of cache (Puzzle, Multi,
Traditional,&lt;br /&gt;
etc.). Now you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you willing to add your name to the list?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no requirement besides the standard signing of
the&lt;br /&gt;
cache log to prevent you from logging this cache when found.&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone should log their find, and hopefully the &lt;b&gt;FTF&lt;/b&gt;
person&lt;br /&gt;
will play along and place another cache, but it is in no way
a&lt;br /&gt;
requirement for logging your find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Luck and Happy Geocaching - or Be Cursed!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;All you need to do is solve the puzzle below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of parking around the area but you will need
to walk to GZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container is 4x4x1.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See directions on back to open and reverse the
directions to close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be sure to return the cache to the same
spot. BYOP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terrain is easy with a short off-road at the
end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Not much else to say, so here's the
puzzle:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;1,2,s&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;12,4,d&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;4,5,d&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;15,2,p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;6,4,d&amp;gt; and

&amp;lt;2,3,s&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;18,2,p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;14,4,p&amp;gt; and
&amp;lt;1,1,s&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email me if you get stuck&lt;/p&gt;

Knowing they would be out for a while, everyone decides to bring some pie to enjoy later. The product of their position and a &quot;slice of the pi&quot; describes how much pie they brought. Worried about being hungry later, they each stop at the store and add one more &quot;slice of pi&quot; to their total of pie. Concerned about their weight, they each decide to share their total pie with their families. Each friend divides their current stock of pie by a &quot;slice of pi&quot;. Along the way, ants smell the pie and each friend looses a &quot;slice of pi&quot;. The resulting pie count brings them to the cache where they eat their pie and enjoy the view.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;_______________________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geochecker.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=d1042cb70ab23ddd567124db59bbdf5d&amp;action=check&amp;wp=47433252544d31&amp;name=4f6e2074686520426c61636b2050617468&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

When he introduced the Tenth Amendment in Congress, James Madison
explained that many states were anxious to ratify this amendment,
despite critics who deemed the amendment superfluous or
unnecessary. This is what James Madison said then:
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I find, from looking into the amendments proposed by the State
conventions, that several are particularly anxious that it should
be declared in the Constitution, that the powers not therein
delegated should be reserved to the several States. Perhaps words
which may define this more precisely than the whole of the
instrument now does, may be considered as superfluous. I admit they
may be deemed unnecessary: but there can be no harm in making such
a declaration, if gentlemen will allow that the fact is as stated.
I am sure I understand it so, and do therefore propose it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Third one of these..........Congrats to Druids for FTF!!!#99!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his 1850 Disquisition on Government, John C. Calhoun argued that&lt;br/&gt;a written constitution would never be sufficient to contain the&lt;br/&gt;plundering proclivities of a central government. Some mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;for assuring consensus among the citizens of the states regarding&lt;br/&gt;&quot;federal&quot; laws would be necessary. Consequently,&lt;br/&gt;Calhoun proposed giving citizens of the states veto power over&lt;br/&gt;federal laws that they believed were unconstitutional (the&lt;br/&gt;&quot;concurrent majority&quot;). He also championed the&lt;br/&gt;Jeffersonian idea of nullification. To Calhoun (and Jefferson),&lt;br/&gt;states' rights meant that the citizens of the states were&lt;br/&gt;sovereign over the central government that they created as their&lt;br/&gt;agent, and could only be so if such mechanisms – including&lt;br/&gt;the right of secession – existed.</groundspeak:long_description>

Coordinates are not at those posted above.

This is the complimentary cache of State vs.
State—CSUN.  I am on or near both the campus of CSUN
and that of CSULB almost every week. Both schools have baseball
teams that play in the Big West Conference. I have placed these two
caches to celebrate the start of the 2011 baseball season.

Assume a standard college baseball field that is oriented in the
same manner as the CSULB Blair field (the cache Winning The Mat--
GC11B12 might get you close enough to see). The above coordinates
represent the pitchers mound and the cache is at second base.&lt;br /&gt;

Good exercise to get to and from GZ.  It is diffIcult to beat the pirahna to a parking lot but there's a chance when a little effort is involved. 

Check out www.dgpstats.com for those that prefer making it about the challenge instead of finding 1/1s faster than the speed of light in a vacuum.  Next year, they plan to expand to include the rest of SoCal.  Something to look forward to.

It's All Good, but Challenges Are Great!

There is plenty of parking (best on PV Drive North) and this should be a fairly quick P&amp;G... but you may want to take a nice break from your day here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a nano container in a park that holds a little history for me. In high school I worked summers for YES - Youth Employment Service - that matched up money hungry kids with people needing someone to do backbreaking work, for cheap. My first job with YES took place at the edge of this park. Once at the park, if you look to the west, you will see the backyards of 2 houses both with the commonly seen &quot;white 3 rail fence&quot;. Back in the day, I dug the holes and placed the posts for these fences and all for a whopping $1.75 an hour, free lunch and all the water I could drink! With this info you just guess how old I am... enjoy the park.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;You will need to bring a pen and a TOTT may help but is not necessary. Please replace it as you found it.&lt;br/&gt;--------------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This spot is center stage to an audience of windows. I used a Surefire flashlight with a red lens cover to find the hiding spot and hide cache. I wore all black. Park in legal spot.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is the first of many caches we have decided to hide on this 1.8 mile stretch along the Redondo Beach bluffs. They will be hidden along the beach-side bike/walking path and the upper walking path parallel to Esplanade. Parking along the street and at either end of the path will require a fee, so to avoid those pesky meters, we recommend parking a block or so away, then walking to the beach.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cache is located near the Avenue C lifeguard station, one of the many lifeguard/bathroom stations just off the lower beach-side esplanade. A TOTT will be helpful in cache extraction and tweezers will be helpful for log extraction. Be sure that you roll up the log extremely tight so that it will fit within the container. Also, BYOP! As always, keep an eye out for muggles in your search for the cache.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;We have decided to hide several caches on this 1.8 mile stretch along the Redondo Beach bluffs. They will be hidden along the beach-side bike/walking path and the upper walking path parallel to Esplanade. Parking along the street and at either end of the path will require a fee, so to avoid those pesky meters, we recommend parking a block or so away, then walking to the beach.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden at the southern end of the 'middle' walking path. There are some stairs down and some stairs going up. Which way will you go? You're looking for a small film canister hidden out of reach of the muggles, but not the cachers! As always, practice your stealth and keep an eye out for muggles! Be sure the cache is secure in its hiding spot when returning the cache.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Park your car, and enjoy a nice walk around Old Torrance!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout this multi, you will be visiting landmarks that have earned recognition from the Torrance Historical Society. Through their ongoing landmark plaque program, they have now placed thirteen plaques on landmarks that have been deemed historic. You may want to take the time to visit the rest of these sites and their plaques. To see the full list of landmarks, and more information on the Torrance Historical Society, visit www.torrancehistoricalsociety.com.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now for the cache!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the original landmarks remain; some are taken over by businesses. At each landmark, you will have to find a number. Once you’re done, some simple calculations will produce the coordinates. The landmarks can be visited in any order:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torrance Public Library – N 33° 50.099 W 118° 19.084&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the front lawn of the building, you will see a bust of the city’s late founder Jared Sydney Torrance. Find the year this bust was dedicated and take the last two digits of the year and called that number A.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is currently the location of the Torrance Historical Society Museum. Stop inside and learn a little about our fair city!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company – N 33° 50.135 W 118° 18.968&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In front of the building, there is a lamppost. On the lamppost, you will find an 8-character number ending with the letter “E”. Take the first two digits and call that number B.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is now the host of the Red Car Brewery &amp; Restaurant. Stop in for your mid-cache beer!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torrance Post Office Marcelina Station – N 33° 50.016 W 118°18.951&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the southern corner of the building, there is a year on the cornerstone. Take the last two digits of that year and call the number C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Torrance Post Office Marcelina Station is STILL here! Amazing!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Torrance City Hall – N 33° 50.018 W 118° 19.015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Above the door, there is a mosaic. Count the number of birds on the mosaic and that number will be D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This building is now the host of a local office of Time Warner Cable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The calculations will only involve the minutes and seconds of the latitude and longitude. For example, if you add 1,234 to N 33° 50.000, the result is N 33° 51.234.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Latitude of posted coordinates) – B + C + D – 2 = Latitude of the cache&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Longitude of posted coordinates) – A – C – (D x 2) = Longitude of the cache&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once there, please use your stealth when retrieving the cache. Depending on the day, GZ could be swarming with muggles or completely deserted. You’re looking for a round, camo-taped container. The cache contains a log and some trinkets. Please bring your own writing instrument to sign the log. Once done, please be sure to hide it exactly as you found it.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;We have decided to hide several caches on this 1.8 mile stretch along the Redondo Beach bluffs. They will be hidden along the beach-side bike/walking path and the upper walking path parallel to Esplanade. Parking along the street and at either end of the path will require a fee, so to avoid those pesky meters, we recommend parking a block or so away, then walking to the beach.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden nearby to some beachfront property with some nice views, like the many others along the 'middle' path. You should be able to see it during the day, and possibly at night if you have a strong flashlight. Once you spot the cache, you will need to use a ferrous-friendly TOTT to 'fish' out the cache. When you're done, be sure to replace the cache in the right orientation (as indicated on the container) and make sure that the cache fits smoothly in the hiding spot. As always, practice your stealth, and watch out for muggles, especially from above, although habitants of the nearby building seem to be friendly enough and may even help you find the cache. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FWI: especially in the cool mornings, this small area can become a snail pit (molluscophobia sufferers, plan your trip accordingly!). If you're coming out here at about that time, watch your step!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Glad this cache was not retrieved while same homeless muggle slept at GZ.  Did that once in HB and the muggle never awoke, but the log was signed and replaced without incident.  It's the stories that keep the game fun and compelling for newbie geocachers and veterans alike.

Your Red Lights &amp; Sirens cache is greatly appreciated!  [:D]

&lt;p&gt;This is a tribute to one of our favorite breakfast activities: doing the L.A. Times Crossword.&lt;/p&gt;

Go to the following link for your puzzle: http://img.geocaching.com/cache/large/1a12fbcb-8f38-404c-a019-de34abdffcfb.jpg

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for the decimal minutes of N 33 50. _ _ _ W 118 20._ _ _. ZEROs will be a 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won't have too much trouble getting the cache if you make sure you are stealthy in your search. Just beware of muggles around you during your search. Inside the cache, you will find a pair of letters. Jot down the letters for the solution to the &lt;strong&gt;L.A. Times Crossword: Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;. When you replace it, put the cache on the horizontal piece, lid side up! The magnet is there but not really useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

It should be noted that there are hours for this cache. I was there after the posted hours (by 1/2 hour.) The gate was still open, and I pretended that I didn't see the sign. :-O No one stopped me, and I had the cache in hand within just a few minutes. I still hadn't seen anyone by the time I left the premises.

Thanks for the cache!

P.S. The cache might have migrated, because I didn't see any nuts and bolts or a globe.</groundspeak:text>

If not, Read below&lt;br/&gt;for the history. &lt;br/&gt; Hope you enjoy the cache and history. Might not want to do this&lt;br/&gt;one at night.. It's smaller than a film can. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Beach Boys Historic Landmark commemorates the site of the&lt;br/&gt;childhood home of Brian, Carl, and Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys.&lt;br/&gt;The monument, located at 3701 W. 119th Street, Hawthorne,&lt;br/&gt;California, stands on the site of their childhood home, which was&lt;br/&gt;demolished in the mid-1980s during construction of the Century&lt;br/&gt;Freeway. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Music industry notables such as Dick Clark and the Rock and Roll&lt;br/&gt;Hall of Fame were among the letter-writers who supported the BBHL's&lt;br/&gt;landmark application process. Its status as a California State&lt;br/&gt;Historic Landmark was granted by the California State Historic&lt;br/&gt;Resources Commission in a unanimous vote on August 6, 2004, in&lt;br/&gt;Ontario, California, and the monument was dedicated on May 20,&lt;br/&gt;2005.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The image face of the landmark was inspired by the album cover&lt;br/&gt;of Surfer Girl. The current lineup of the Beach Boys at that time&lt;br/&gt;was Brian, Carl, and Dennis; their cousin Mike Love; and David&lt;br/&gt;Marks. Al Jardine, the group's original guitarist, would later&lt;br/&gt;rejoin the band soon before David's departure. Six 45 gold records&lt;br/&gt;circle the base of the landmark with the names of the six Beach&lt;br/&gt;Boys represented on the monument's image face. The names of donors,&lt;br/&gt;Wilson friends and family members, and the Beach Boys Landmark&lt;br/&gt;Committee can be found engraved in the monument bricks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History From: Wikipedia&lt;br/&gt;Used under terms of the GNU FDL.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I found this cache the same month that it was published on geocaching.com in 2008. Finally getting around to finding and logging on opencaching.com.

I didn't find it where I thought I remembered finding it back then. The hint helped.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A new cache was just published! But when I got there, it had
already been found 5 times and there was nothing in it but a
log!
Apparently, the hider left a geocoin, dollar, some geo-trash, and a
travel bug in the cache, but they were all gone by the time I got
there. None of the cachers left anything!&lt;br /&gt;

Looks like the first 5 finders were &lt;b&gt;c31337&lt;/b&gt;,
&lt;b&gt;Muppet_Boy&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;&quot;spoon + groupee&quot;&lt;/b&gt; (team),
&lt;b&gt;han_solowe&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;hammd&lt;/b&gt;. They appear to have had some
adventures while trying to grab the FTF !&lt;br /&gt;
One of them got a flat tire on the way to the cache. Another was
pulled over by the police!&lt;br /&gt;
One cacher was taking a relaxing bubble bath when the cache was
published, but still went for it! He probably should have been at
the Geocachers Anonymous meeting that the another of the first 5
cachers was at. (&quot;I'm just going out for a smoke, he said. Leaving
a GA meeting for an FTF - i don't think he's making much
progress!)&lt;br /&gt;
And another cacher had a dead blackberry. But still went for the
ftf when he found out about the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you figure out what happened to who, when they found it, and
what they took?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;c31337 found it after the cacher that took the geo-trash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cacher who was attending the Geocachers Anonymous meeting
is neither hammd nor &quot;spoon + groupee&quot;, both of whom did not see
the travel bug in the cache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;han_solowe did not see the geocoin in the cache, but didn't
remove the geo-trash which he saw in the cache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muppet_Boy found the cache before the cacher who was attending
the GA meeting. Neither of these cachers took the dollar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hammd was not pulled over for speeding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The person who was taking a relaxing bubble bath when the cache
posted saw the geocoin, but took a different item and didn't see
TNLNSL in the log.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cacher who got a flat tire found it after han_solowe, who
found it after the cacher who was pulled over for speeding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hammd (who did not take the dollar) found the cache before the
cacher that had a dead blackberry. Neither &quot;spoon + groupee&quot; nor
c31337 got a flat tire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

To get the coordinates, input your answers into This form.&lt;br /&gt;
meta: Sorry, this one can't be solved in the 'field'. Thanks to
Journeyman for beta-testing the puzzle. If the form says you are
wrong, you have a logic error somewhere! There is only one answer!.
For the final, I recommend visiting on weekends as there will be
far fewer muggles. For parking, if the gate is closed i think
you'll be fine parking right at GZ. If you have trouble finding the
cache, feel free to email me for a lifeline, i can usually respond
quickly. </groundspeak:long_description>

Mayor James Hahn's $9 billion plan to modernize Los Angeles International Airport. The entire residential acquisition program, which was supposed to conclude by 2006, had an estimated budget of $485 million and is not included in the overall $9 billion bill to renovate LAX.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of the 280 homes once occupying Manchester Square, only 35 remained (as of 2004). Tree lined streets remind of what was.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background on the area and LAX Modernization: Who killed Manchester Square? and Manchester Square, LAX's money pit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In all likelihood you should not have muggle problems. The area is totally deserted.

A bit of a line up across the road to get small holey things and on my side of the road at the lights and with the official muggle pulling someone over on the other side by the gas station, took a lot of interest off of what I was doing. TFTC.  [:D]</groundspeak:text>

I was just parking my car across the street when another car pulled up and out popped a gent with a cache page and GPSr walking towards the intersection.  I'm not that fast in the up-take, but I figured he was heading for the same cache.  So, I joined him.  Nice meeting you Eric.  He found it in about 10 seconds and then we proceded to take the next 10 minutes trying to retrieve the log.  Seems like all the stickers have expanded the log to quite a snug fit.  Had to take the container back to the cars for tools to extract it.  Nice hide though.  TNLNSL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Fox Hills Park is a 10 acre park located in the Fox Hills
neighborhood. It's pretty nice, but really tough to park! Many
condos and apartments surround the park and they tend to take all
the spaces
Good luck! &lt;br /&gt;
The park offers the following amenities: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recreation Hut with Restroom facilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Picnic Areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moonbounces allowed with proper permit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 Barbeques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children's Play Equipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Basketball Court&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Soccer Field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tennis Court&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Night Lighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grass area&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Park hours are 5:30AM to 9:45PM. Dogs are NOT allowed in this park.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Cache Info:&lt;/b&gt; Very small bison tube, It is off the path and
muggle shielded, but there is no need to go diving in the bushes at
all. You can spot the cache from several feet away.&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy. &lt;br /&gt;

Light by Chris Burden






&lt;p&gt;
This forest of city street lights,
called “Urban Light” was created by artist Chris
Burden. Despite initial appearances, the arrangement is not a
perfect grid. Depending on where the viewer stands, the lamps
arrange themselves in different angles and arrays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These 202 cast iron lamps once lit
the streets of Los Angeles. Burden bought one at the Rose Bowl flea
market, and soon collecting and restoring street lights became an
obsession. He painted them all the same neutral gray, in order to
draw the eye to all the different varieties of cast iron
decoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Burden says that street lamps like
these were symbols of a civilized and sophisticated city—safe
after dark and beautiful to behold. The lights all still work, and
they are now powered by solar energy. They are switched on every
night at dusk, until 10pm. At night, Burden says his sculpture
becomes transformed into “a building with a roof of
light.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This is a high muggle area. Use stealth. The cache, a small
magnetic altoids tin can, has no room for a pen or pencil so BYOP.
Put it back as found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt; 
The La Brea Tar Pits are a famous cluster of tar pits around which
Hancock Park was formed, in the urban heart of Los Angeles. Asphalt
or tar (brea in Spanish)
has seeped up from the ground in this area for tens of thousands of
years. The tar is often covered with water. Over many centuries,
animals that came to drink the water fell in, sank in the tar, and
were preserved as bones. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tarpits.org/&quot;&gt;George C. Page Museum&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to
researching the tar pits and displaying specimens from the animals
that died there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The La
Brea Tar Pits and Hancock Park are situated within urban Los
Angeles, California, near the Miracle Mile district.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tar pits are composed of heavy oil fractions called asphalt, which
seeped from the earth as oil. In Hancock Park, crude oil seeps up
along the 6th Street Fault from the Salt Lake Oil Field, which
underlies much of the Fairfax District north of the park. The oil
reaches the surface and forms pools at several locations in the
park, becoming asphalt as the lighter fractions of the petroleum
biodegrade.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This seepage has been happening for tens of thousands of years.
From time to time, the asphalt would form a pool deep enough to
trap animals, and the surface would be covered with layers of
water, dust, and leaves. Animals would wander in to drink, become
trapped, and eventually die. Predators would also enter to eat the
trapped animals and become stuck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As the bones of the dead animals sink into the asphalt, it soaks
into them, turning them a dark-brown or black color. Lighter
fractions of petroleum evaporate from the asphalt, leaving a more
solid substance, which holds the bones. Apart from the dramatic
fossils of large mammals, the asphalt also preserves very small
&quot;microfossils&quot;: wood and plant remnants, insects, dust, and even
pollen grains.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Radiometric dating of preserved wood and bones has given an age of
38,000 years for the oldest known material from the La Brea seeps.
They still ensnare organisms today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache, a camouflaged metallic container, is available daily
between 6:00am and 10:00pm&lt;br /&gt;
Free and paid parking is available near by.&lt;br /&gt;
Feel free to upload picture(s) of your visit to this

Q: a brick weighs a pound
and a half plus half a brick. how much does a brick and a half
weigh?
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have the answer
open the .pdf linked below and you'll be prompted for a password.
The password is the answer to the problem. There's a catch, you
can't input the password as numbers, you have to input it as words
with no spaces. For example:
&lt;br /&gt;
If you came up with 10 then
enter tenpounds
If you came up with 10.5
then enter tenandahalfpounds

The hardest part will most likely be getting above the first watterfall. The hike to the waterfall is easy you just have to do some climbing and jumping to get to the cache. When you find the cache, please make sure the rope is tied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 1 mile hike from the trailhead in Temescal canyon to the waterfall. Once you get to the waterfall you must climb the rockwall next to the watterfall to get to the area behind the waterfall. This geocache involves involves a lot of climbing and jumping. Ge prepared to get dirty and, if your not carefull, a little wet. Once you get to the next waterfall (Click on the picture to see it). Climb up the rocks next to it and look around. This cash is a large tupperware. You probably do not want to look for this cache after it just rained because there will be too much water in the pools and streams and the rocks might be too slippery. If you come on the right day you may see some orange newts in the water. You should also be watching out for poison oak, ticks, and rattlesnakes. If you get to the cache you may want to keep walking up and you can find more pools and waterfalls. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">THE
BEVERLY HILLS ZOO 


Smack dab in the midle of Beverly Hills, the Zoo was built in
1933. It's home to elephants, giraffes, gorillas, lions, tigers
etc... Even though it's not open to the public, the animals can be
seen from the sidewalk. The Zoo is a gem and its existence not
known to many people. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Highlights 
Elephants of Asia -
The state-of-the-art habitat is the largest exhibit in the Zoo's
history. It showcases the elephants and inform visitors about the
challenges they face in the wild. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Gorilla Reserve - A
new habitat that is home to a western lowland gorilla. Only a fence
separates Zoo guests from the largest primate in the
world. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Jungle Giraffe - There
is only one species of giraffe, with nine currently recognized
subspecies. The Zoo has a herd of Masai giraffes, native to Kenya,
that have patterns that look like oak leaves. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Tigers Habitat -
Mesmerizing and gorgeous, but also endangered, our tigers are
always a pleasure to watch. Their exhibit was designed to closely
resemble a natural jungle habitat and was built on a steep slope
that gives the big cats plenty of exercise. 
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;


Please observe the
following: 
Do not
trespass 
Do not disturb the
residents 
Do not feed the
animals 


The cache is a small altoids tin can. Magnetic and it is not
on private property. BYOP.


Congratulations
to indiandunes for FTF!!</groundspeak:long_description>

To get&lt;br/&gt;to this cache you must follow the trail a little further than&lt;br/&gt;PALISADES HIGH POINT. This peak is about 1756 feet tall and has&lt;br/&gt;great views of Los Angeles, the ocean, and Catalina Island. This&lt;br/&gt;peak is slightly taller, about 31 feet more, than PALISADES HIGH&lt;br/&gt;POINT.&lt;br/&gt;Another possible way to get to the cache is from the backbone&lt;br/&gt;trail, use the waypoint to know when to turn of the backbone trail&lt;br/&gt;and follow another trail.&lt;br/&gt;At any places in the trail where you are unsure to go, just keep&lt;br/&gt;following the trail up towards the top of the highest peak.Additional Hidden Waypoints  MN22N9E - Trailhead from the Backbone Trail  N 34° 04.929 W 118° 32.130  This is the point where you turn of the Backbone Trail.

Multi-Cache!  This is a 4 stage Multi-Cache hunt with a small container hidden with small items and a log at the end.  It can definitely be done in a very short amount of time, and should not take more than an hour to complete the entire hunt!  Please feel free to bring a camera along and take pictures to post here of the experiences you have with these incredible views.  NOTE:  The caches are hidden in 4 different areas, 3 cache markers are similar, 1 is different, all are hidden the same.  Coordinates listed are to the 1st stage of the hunt.  Please be aware that these are high traffic areas and make sure no one is looking when you grab and replace the caches, and please replace EXACTLY as you found, so they stay hidden out of sight. &lt;br/&gt;*7/2010 update* - after a few months of non activity, I was finally able to get back up to the cache location and replace cache #1.  I also left a more semi-permanent mark while i was there. I then traveled to the rest of the cache locations and did the same, which is good I did, as cache location #3 would have disappeared after the 1st person found it (it was falling apart).  I left my Mark there as well.  If you found the 1st one, you should be able to figure this out as well.  Actually, I suppose I left my Mark on Cache #2 as well.  As for the final...well, you're on your own!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ENJOY THE VIEWS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S21E55H - 2nd Stage of Enjoy The Views Multicache&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: V31E55H - 3rd Stage of Enjoy the Views!&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;3rd stage in the Enjoy the Views Multi-cache, located near Runyon Canyon park in a guard rail, which overlooks the entire Downtown Los Angeles area.&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: V41E55H - Final Stage of Enjoy the Views Multi-cache&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;This is the 4th and Final stage in the Enjoy The Views!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Americana at Brand&lt;/b&gt; is a
large outdoor shopping community in Glendale, California. The site
is owned by Caruso Affiliated, a real estate development of many
other projects such as The Grove at Farmers Market in Los Angeles,
CA. Americana at Brand has 75 retail shops and a variety of dining
options. The Americana includes 100 condominiums and 238
apartments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Americana project stirred
debate in Glendale for four years; with some merchants fearing the
Grove-style &quot;lifestyle center&quot; would hurt businesses for stores
along Brand Boulevard and in the Glendale Galleria. Some residents
worried about overdevelopment and traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both The Americana and The Grove
are organized upon the idea of a city center—with a mix of
architectural styles, building heights and materials used, as well
as vast open spaces at the projects' center. Caruso Affiliated
often sets their developments in place and time. The architectural
style of the Americana is meant to reflect the industrial era,
including a massive elevator shaft with exposed steel beams, in
contrast to The Grove, which is based on 1940s Charleston, South
Carolina. The Americana at Brand is much like The Grove in that it
is designed to appear like a public space, but is private property,
and is protected as such. However, the 2-acre park in the center of
the complex is entirely public property, further blurring the line
between public and private space. Even though the park is public,
the policy is that personal photography, other than that of friends
or family, is forbidden. The private security force that patrols
the grounds is quick to stop guests from taking pictures. Security
also restricts the size of dogs that one may bring into the mall
and to the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache, a magnetic mint tin
camouflaged to match the structure it's attached to, is avaivable
at the following hours:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mon. - Thurs. : 10 am - 9
pm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fri. - Sat. : 10 am - 10
pm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sun. : 11 am - 8 pm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1 hour free parking is
available.&lt;br /&gt;
Please place container exactly where you found it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The cache is not on level 8 anymore. Level 8 is restricted to
employees.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for visiting this cache.

&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=033d4a28-e049-4812-b498-28a0ebc62632&quot;&gt;joetrain1&lt;/a&gt; for

cancer after a seven year struggle. Her life was cut way too short
at 45.
&lt;p&gt;She always wanted to be layed to rest here at Forest Lawn, but
alas is alone without nearby family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Placed this cache in her memory.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
Please be respectful of the cemetery grounds, properties, and other

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">#012 - Caching w/ muggle brother clutch_ac. Funny this was as soon as we parked to get this one the 7.2 Mexicali earthquake happened and the car was moving around like we were in a boat. We didn't know what it was. This one was pretty challenging. Looked all over and almost gave up but finally found it. Last place I would have looked. There was something in plain sight that I thought was the location of the cache if it had been muggled but it turned out that wasn't it. Might want to use something stronger to retain it though. SL.

Should be an easy park and grab. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The cache is a small video tape box with geocaching symbols and markings, only big enough to fit a log inside, but it is not a nano.  Please bring your own pen.&lt;br/&gt;While at work this week in one of my offices and doing a few caches around the area, I thought this spot would be a good location for a quick park n' grab.  This should be easy for experienced cachers, but building proximity and tree cover may throw you off for just a moment.  When you see the location, you will understand the reason for the name of this cache.&lt;br/&gt;Good Luck!</groundspeak:long_description>

If you use some stealth and cunning, you may be able to retrieve this cache around midnight.  A partner would definitely be helpful on this one.  Since this is such an unusual cache, we have included a cipher that, once broken, will unveil the true location of the cache.  If you are having trouble breaking the cipher, you may consider reading &quot;Cryptanalysis, a study of ciphers and their solution,&quot; by Helen Fouche Gaines.  Page 12 would probably be of great help.  I borrowed a copy from the Glendale Public Library.  If you'd like to be a cheater on this one just pick up a Bible and look up Revelations chapter 6, verse 5 and you shall have your clue.  Happy Hunting!  This is a Traditional Cache, not a Puzzle Cache  The cache is right at the listed grid coordinates.  The cipher is meant to narrow down all of the possible places where the cache could be hidden, to exactly where the cache  container actually is.  It's probably going to leave a lot of people scratching their heads.  They just have to pause and think outside of the box for a minute or two.</groundspeak:long_description>

I did cheat by just reading the decoded hint in the description, instead of working through the cryptology, but the hint was spot on. This cache is actually very easy to find, but not that easy to get at without Joe Q Public obseving you. I attempted to retrieve it at 1:30AM and had to wait over an hour before I could work on getting the cache. You should also bring at least 2 long thin flat objects to lift the cache from its hiding place. Otherwise, a very ingenious cache and a fun start for my geocaching experience.</groundspeak:text>

First one I've ever done.  The look on my girls faces was worth a trillion dollars.
We did it in a spur of the moment. and were not really prepared.
Signed log.   Took something (insignificant to most but a treasure to us.).  Left something.  (clue: bear)
Will return to leave something realy sweet.

Awesome job to Team Varmints for a clever and awesome job on the hide.
It was close to midnight!  The clue is just perfect.  My nine year old saw it and figured it out.  She is very proud.  WE have definately been bit by the opencache/geocache bug!  And we don't want the antidote!

Warning!  If you are a vampire think twice before reaching inside!</groundspeak:text>

Very easy in, easy out, but remember, Beware of the Dogs...or in this case...maybe some Spiders...or....?! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Beware of the Dogs has a new location, and a new Cache!  My previous cache was located a few miles away, and I moved, and took the cache with me to better keep an eye on it.&lt;br/&gt;The cache originally was a Brent's bagel chip jar, but it is now an Ammo Box filled with a notepad, pen, Travel Bugs (when they are in there), guitar picks, small cars, stickers and other small items. This is a quick cache, and should not be too terribly hard to find.  Feel free to bring a biscuit for the dogs, and swap Travel Bugs. This is my property, and the dogs may be right on the other side, depending on when you are there.  Just be careful reaching for it...who knows what may be there!  May be harder to find at night...and after finding this cache, perhaps you will be in the mood for some burgers at another nearby cache as well as someone else's ghost cache...&lt;br/&gt;**Please remember to replace cache well back in place, so it will not be visible to casual passerby's.  There is No Need for a poking stick.  If you just walk while looking with some Cache Sense, you should have no problems.  Thanks!**</groundspeak:long_description>

Wear good hiking boots or shoes and be careful! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Here's my first cache!  I stumbled on this trail by accident and decided to find a place on it to stash my container...which was a clear rubbermaid Bottle with a Blue lid.  That disappeared a while ago, and I have just replaced it with a small AMMO box filled with lots of goodies. (as of 6/29/08).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wanted to place something that did not take hours to find...but still gave a little challenge.  Please place it back as hidden as you found it.  Please make sure it is secure before you leave.  Thanks and Good Luck!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Note...i have seen many people talking about how hard this cache was...well, all i have to say is, you are totally going the incorrect way then.&lt;br/&gt;i made this cache to be an easy quick find that should take no more than 20 minutes to get there and back...if it takes you longer, you are obviously going the incorrect way, even it you can get there...so try to identify the area from the pictures, and go from there...GOOD LUCK!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This trail can be steep and slippery at times, but you really should be able to get there and back relatively quickly.&lt;br/&gt;This cache is up and running again after a long downtime.

We found the assumed unexpected trail and stairs that led to a steep trail (most likely a deer trail) but found nothing. Once reaching the top of the mountain, we looked at our phones again and realized that the item was first placed there in 2002 and last updated in 2008...

state.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Sun Valley community is located in a geographically
separated&lt;br /&gt;
valley, between the City of Sparks on the east and the City of
Reno&lt;br /&gt;
on the West. Over time, the community has evolved&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
from a primarily affordable place to live to a diverse
community&lt;br /&gt;
with a growing sense of civic pride. Over the next 20 years,
the&lt;br /&gt;
community will provide additional employment opportunities,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
connected with local serving office, commercial and tourist&lt;br /&gt;
commercial businesses, and a mixed range of residential&lt;br /&gt;
opportunities. Over this period, the distribution of land uses
and&lt;br /&gt;
the provision of public facilities and infrastructure will
enhance&lt;br /&gt;
and facilitate a community character that focuses on Sun
Valley&lt;br /&gt;
being a safe and healthy place to live, raise a family, work, run
a&lt;br /&gt;
business,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
recreate and retire. The community expresses a strong desire
to&lt;br /&gt;
manage growth levels and traffic patterns so that traffic&lt;br /&gt;
congestion and related air quality do not reach undesirable&lt;br /&gt;
levels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The majority of Sun Valley will be known as the Suburban
Character&lt;br /&gt;
Management Area (SCMA).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

This area will contain residential densities of one unit per
acre&lt;br /&gt;
or greater.</groundspeak:long_description>

Founded in 1732, Vincennes is the oldest continually inhabited
European settlement in Indiana and one of the oldest settlements
west of the Appalachians.
&lt;p&gt;As the first city founded in Indiana, originally a French fur
trading outpost, Vincennes served as the home of the United States
ninth president William Henry Harrison during his governorship of
Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the early city buildings display direct influences of
French architecture, while many buildings and homes in the Old Town
section of Vincennes are dated pre-1900.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City of Vincennes is also one of only 3 communities in the
entire state of Indiana with a National Park within our City
limits.&lt;/p&gt;

The George Rogers Clark National Historic Park &amp; Monument is
located in the southwestern corner of the City.
&lt;p&gt;The Indiana Military Museum is dedicated to fostering the
memory, understanding and appreciation of U.S. military history.
The museum has one of the most outstanding displays of vintage
vehicles, weaponry, uniforms and artifacts from the Civil War
through WWI, II, Korea, Vietnam and Desert Storm&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Superior is a city in and the county seat of Douglas County,
Wisconsin, United States.[2] The population was 27,368 at the 2000
census. Located at the junction of U.S. Routes 2 and 53, it is just
north of and adjacent to both the Village of Superior and the Town
of Superior.
&lt;p&gt;Superior is situated at the western end of Lake Superior in
northwestern Wisconsin. Bordered by St. Louis Bay, Superior Bay and
Allouez Bay, it is also framed by two rivers: the Nemadji and the
St. Louis. Superior, and the neighboring city across the bay,
Duluth, Minnesota, form a single metropolitan area called the Twin
Ports and share a harbor that is one of the most important ports on
the Great Lakes. Both cities have museum ships (SS William A Irvin
in Duluth and SS Meteor in Superior) devoted to the local nautical
heritage. Superior was the last port of call for the Edmund
Fitzgerald before its famous 1975 sinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The City of De Soto is located in the southeastern part of
Missouri, approximately 45 miles south of St. Louis. De Soto is in
Jefferson County, which is one of the fastest growing counties in
Missouri.
&lt;p&gt;De Soto was part of the Louisiana Territory and was transferred
from France to Spain and back to France again and in 1803 was sold
to the United States. During that same year, Isaac Van Metre came
to the place that was later named De Soto and erected a cabin. A
marker now stands to commemorate the first log cabin built in De
Soto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1859, the St. Louis Iron Mountain Railroad built a Depot.
Later named the Missouri Pacific Railroad, it established a major
rail car repair facility in De Soto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city is known as &quot;Fountain City&quot; because of the numerous
artesian wells. Water from these wells and springs was bottled and
shipped by tank car to the 1904 World Fair in St. Louis.[5]&lt;/p&gt;
This car is for sale in Desoto, Missouri!

Coordinates are not at those posted above.

This is the complimentary cache of State vs.
State—CSULB.  I am on or near both the campus of CSUN
and that of CSULB almost every week. Both schools have baseball
teams that play in the Big West Conference. I have placed these two
caches to celebrate the start of the 2011 baseball season.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assume a standard college baseball field that is oriented in the
same manner as the CSUN Matador game field (the cache Matador
Baseball--GC2MQZ7 might get you close enough to see). The above
coordinates represent the pitchers mound and the cache is at home
plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The city was incorporated in 1819, as a merger of two towns
situated along the Alabama River. It became the state capital in
1846. In February 1861, Montgomery was selected as the first
capital of the Confederate States of America, until the seat of
government moved to Richmond, Virginia in May of that year.[6]
During the mid-20th century, Montgomery was a primary site in the
African-American Civil Rights Movement, including the Montgomery
Bus Boycott and the Selma to Montgomery marches.[6]
&lt;p&gt;Prior to European colonization, the left bank of the Alabama
River was inhabited by the Alibamu tribe of Native Americans. The
Alibamu and the Coushatta who lived on the opposite side the river
were adept mound builders.[10] Present-day Montgomery is built on
the site of two Alibamu towns: Ikanatchati (or Ecunchatty or
Econachatee), meaning &quot;red earth&quot;; and Towassa, built on a bluff
called Chunnaanaauga Chatty.[11] The first Europeans to come
through central Alabama were Hernando de Soto and his expedition,
who came through Ikanatchati and camped for one week in Towassa in
1540.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Stamps is a small town located in Lafayette County. It is the only
town in the nation named 'Stamps' and is around 2.5
hours from Little Rock. The town was named in honor of Hardy James
Stamps, an early settler of the area, and was the childhood home of
author Maya Angelou.
&lt;p&gt;Stamps was the childhood home of author Maya Angelou and was
depicted in her book, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. Angelou
spent much of her youth in the town in the home of her paternal
grandmother. Her grandmother ran the only African American general
store in the African American community.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Hiawatha is named after a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow called
The Song of Hiawatha. In the poem is legendary Onondaga and Mohawk
Indian leader Hiawatha. Adjacent to the former Ioway-Sac
reservation and the present-day Ioway Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska,
Hiawatha is called Hári Wáta in Ioway, meaning &quot;I am looking far
away&quot;.[4] This name may be the result of choosing Ioway words that
sound like the English name. It has nothing to do with the
Onondaga-Mohawk leader.
&lt;p&gt;Hiawatha is nicknamed the &quot;City of Beautiful Maples&quot; because of
its countless trees that produce delightful colors in the fall
season. The city also has the oldest Halloween parade in the
nation, starting in 1914. The year 2007 marked Hiawatha's 150th
anniversary.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

In the Hawaiian language, kona means leeward or dry side of the
island, as opposed to ko'olau which means windward or the wet
side of the island. In the times of Ancient Hawai?i, Kona was the
name of the leeward district on each major island. In
Hawai'i, the Pacific anticyclone provides moist prevailing
northeasterly winds to the Hawaiian islands, resulting in rain when
the winds contact the windward landmass of the islands - the winds
subsequently lose their moisture and travel on to the leeward (or
kona) side of the island. When this pattern reverses, it can
produce a Kona storm from the west. Kona has cognates with the same
meaning in other Polynesian languages. In Tongan, the equivalent
cognate would be tonga; for windward, the associated cognate would
be tokelau.
&lt;p&gt;Kona is the home of the world-famous Ironman World Championship
Triathlon which is held each year in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volcanic slopes of Hualalai and Mauna Loa in the Kona
district provide an ideal microclimate for growing coffee. Kona
coffee is considered one of the premium specialty coffees of the
world.&lt;/p&gt;

Mason was first known as Number One, the first in a line of border
towns including area allotted to this state by Massachusetts upon
establishment of New Hampshire as a separate state in 1741. The
town's charter was granted in 1749 by Colonial Governor Benning
Wentworth, and in 1768 his nephew, Governor John Wentworth, named
it in honor of New Hampshire's founder, Captain John Mason. Captain
Mason was the holder of patent with title to the land that became
New Hampshire. Greenville would be set off from Mason in 1872. [2]

Near the town's center is the boyhood home of Samuel Wilson, the
meat-supplier who is believed to have inspired the Uncle Sam
character. The private house is today identified by a state
historical marker. Another prominent local figure was Elizabeth
Orton Jones, an author, illustrator and teacher better known as
&quot;Twig&quot;, instrumental in recording the history of the town. Pickity
Place, a local cottage built in 1786, was the model for the
grandmother's house in Jones' 1948 illustrated version of Little
Red Riding Hood. It was also the home of Ron Harry, Boston Garden
organist from 1983-1995 and for the Boston Celtics in the TD
Banknorth Garden until his death in 2004.

Morris is a rural community on the prairie of West Central
Minnesota. With an approximate population of 5,200, Morris is
located 165 miles northwest of Minneapolis/St. Paul and 100 miles
southeast of Fargo/Moorhead. Morris is also the home of the
University of Minnesota Morris.&lt;br /&gt;
In 1975, Morris was the site of the largest earthquake of the last
century in the state, rated at between 4.6 and 4.8 in magnitude.
Eighteen years later, on June 4, 1993, another quake slightly shook
the community. This one measured 4.1 in magnitude and ranks as the
third largest earthquake in Minnesota of the 1900s.&lt;br /&gt;

Darby is a small town located south of Hamilton in Southwestern
Montana. With a population in 2004 of only 814 people, the town is
a quiet one with spectacular scenery and fabulous fishing
opportunities.
&lt;p&gt;The Painted Rock State Park and reservoir, as well as other
streams, rivers and lakes make Darby prime territory for the
fishing enthusiast. With Brook Trout, Mountain Whitefish, Rainbow
Trout, and Westslope Cutthroat Trout prevalent, Darby and its
surrounding areas is the perfect fishing destination.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
Traces of human occupation in the Yarmouth area date to about
2,000&lt;br /&gt;
BC. During the years prior to the arrival of the Europeans,
many&lt;br /&gt;
Native American cultures are believed to have existed in the
area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When settlers arrived at Yarmouth's site around 1636, they
found&lt;br /&gt;
a fort already built. The fort had for some time been occupied
by&lt;br /&gt;
George Felt, who had in turn purchased it from John Phillips,
a&lt;br /&gt;
Welshman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yarmouth is home of DeLorme, the large map-making company,
with&lt;br /&gt;
its headquarters located on Route 1 to the north of the town.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

This will be the easiest puzzle ever. I mainly wanted to place one
for Memorial Day and this format enables me to bring cachers to an
appropriate location where I once tried to place a cache, but I was
unable to use the spot for a cache or a waypoint for legal reasons.

&lt;p&gt;The cache is at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N34 15.88x&lt;br /&gt;
W118 30.99z&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;x=8 times the # of Coast Guard Metal of Honor recipiants&lt;br /&gt;
z=# of Air Force Metal of Honot recipiants less 11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final cache is near VFW 2323.&lt;/p&gt;

Bermuda Hundred was the first incorporated town in the English
colony of Virginia. It was founded by Sir Thomas Dale in 1613, six
years after Jamestown. At the southwestern edge of the confluence
of the Appomattox and James Rivers opposite City Point, annexed to
Hopewell, Virginia in 1923, Bermuda Hundred was a port town for
many years. The terminology &quot;Bermuda Hundred&quot; also included a large
area adjacent to the town itself. In the colonial era, &quot;hundreds&quot;
were large developments of many acres, arising from the English
term to define an area which would support one hundred heads of
household. The port at the town of Bermuda Hundred was intended to
serve other &quot;hundreds&quot; in addition to Bermuda Hundred.
&lt;p&gt;The area of the peninsula between the James and Appomattox
rivers on which Bermuda Hundred is located was part of the Bermuda
Hundred Campaign during the American Civil War (1861-1865).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern times, it is no longer a shipping port, but remains as
a small community in the southeastern portion of Chesterfield
County, Virginia, United States.&lt;br /&gt;
Bermuda Hundred was started in 1613, after the English settlers
made peace with the Virginia natives - in part with Pocahontas'
help. It was named after the traumatic shipwreck of the &quot;Third
Supply&quot; bringing reinforcements to Virginia in 1609. The leaders of
that expedition were shipwrecked in Bermuda and had to take their
wrecked ship apart and build two smaller ships to finally get to
Virginia. Shakespeare incorporated the tale into a play, The
Tempest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TULSA, TEXAS. Tulsa was southeast of Wink in southern Winkler
County. Though the settlement was a product of the oil discovery of
July 16, 1926, in the Hendricks oilfield,qv it never boomed. A
townsite was laid out, and several buildings were erected. A Tulsa
post office opened on August 20, 1927, with Cora Higgins as
postmistress and closed in 1929, when the building was moved to
Wink. Tulsa reported two businesses in 1931 and one in 1933, when
the population was twenty-five. After 1948 the store closed, and
the community, which was named for the Oklahoma boomtown,
vanished.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Cinder &amp; Concrete Block Corporation is headquartered in
Maryland. Cinder blocks differ from concrete blocks in other ways
besides their hollow design. Concrete blocks are made from a slurry
of cement and small aggregate, such as small stones or gravel.
Cinder blocks, on the other hand, are made from a combination of
cement and cinders, the dusty remnants of burned coal. The result
is a lighter weight block formed into a rectangular masonry block.
Although many people use the terms &quot;cinder blocks&quot; and &quot;concrete
blocks&quot; interchangeably, a true cinder block will always be lighter
than a concrete block, and the texture of cinder blocks may be
rougher than finished concrete blocks.
&lt;p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
LUDLOW is an irregularly outlined town, bounded north by Plymouth,
east by Cavendish and Chester, south by Andover and Weston, and
West by Mt. Holley, in Rutland county.&lt;br /&gt;
In surface, the town is diversified and pleasing. Upon the west it
is bordered by the Green Mountains, containing within its limits
the eastern declivity of a lofty summit known as the Center
Mountain. In the eastern part is a lofty range of serpentine,
containing the harder varieties of asbestos, talc and hornstone,
and once, undoubtedly, formed the eastern barrier of a large body
of water, whose waves rolled over the central part of Ludlow and
all that portion of Plymouth extending from the line of Ludlow to
the source of Black river. That such a collection of water once
existed, and that it was drained by the wearing away of the
serpentine range through a long course of years, is evident from
traces of the action of water upon the rocks, many feet above their
present level in the bed of the stream, and from the successive
tiers of alluvial table-lands, which, at different heights, and
successively increasing distances from the river, now furnish the
most fertile land in the town. In the southern part of the village
is a curious elevation of earth, whose formation can only be
accounted for by supposing that at this point two streams once
mingled their waters in the lake, forming an eddy, and depositing
the gravel and soil which the autumn and spring rains would loosen
from the surrounding hills. And, in fact, the conformation of the
country about shows that once a stream came from the northwest, in
what is now the channel of Black river, and another from the south
between Center and South mountains and Bear hill in what is now the
channel of Jewell brook, and mingled their waters at this point.
This elevation, called the Hogback, is about seventy-five feet in
height, forty rods in length from east to west, and with just
thickness enough from north to south to admit a narrow foot-path
upon its summit, and as steep as the earth and stones will lie,
while on every side it stands perfectly detached from the
neighboring hills, and surrounded by alluvial flats. Its
composition is earth, pebbles, and small stones, all rounded
evidently by the action of water, and without any of the angular
points and sharp corners found on stones freshly detached from
their native ledge, and arranged in regular strata consisting of
alternate layers of earth, sand and pebbles, dipping at an angle
corresponding with the sides of the hill. Below Cavendish village,
in Cavendish, three miles below the point where the serpentine
range crosses the stream, is another of these rocky barriers, which
once dammed up the waters of Black river. The water has there worn
its bed an hundred feet deep through cliffs of mica slate, for
nearly a mile, leaving traces of its tremendous effort in the large
and disjointed masses of rock and the rugged and overhanging cliffs
which present themselves upon both sides of its channel throughout
the whole course. Again, commencing at the head of the present
rapids and passing off southerly through a portion of Chester into
Springfield, through what is known as the gulf road, to the latter
town, are traces of the ancient bed of the river, consisting of
cliffs and large masses of stone, worn deep in various places, and
presenting large and numerous cavities, evidently the result of the
action of pebbles whirled by the eddies of the stream. The highest
of the table-lands in Ludlow, of which there are three elevations,
was undoubtedly formed by the lake while in its original form; and
the successive disruptions of the serpentine range, before
mentioned, and the barrier at the head of Cavendish falls, would
easily account for the formation of the two lower tiers. </groundspeak:long_description>

Salt Lake City is the capital and the most populous city of the
U.S. state of Utah. The name of the city is often shortened to Salt
Lake. The city was founded in 1847 as Great Salt Lake City by a
group of Mormon pioneers led by their prophet, Brigham Young. Salt
Lake City is still home to the headquarters of The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS, also known as the Mormon Church).</groundspeak:long_description>

The Milky Way is the home galaxy of the Solar System, and of Earth.
The Solar System is located in the Milky Way galaxy around two
thirds of the way out from the center, on the inner edge of the
Orion–Cygnus Arm. The Sun orbits around the center of the
galaxy in a galactic year—once every 225-250 million Earth
years. The &quot;Milky Way&quot; is a translation of the Latin Via Lactea, in
turn translated from the Greek Ga?a??a? (Galaxias), referring to
the pale band of light formed by stars in the galactic plane as
seen from Earth. It is agreed that the Milky Way is a spiral
galaxy, with observations suggesting that it is a barred spiral
galaxy. It contains 200-400 billion stars and is estimated to have
at least 50 billion planets, 500 million of which could be located
in the habitable zone of their parent star.[12] New data suggests
there may be up to twice as many free-floating planets in the Milky
Way as there are stars.[13] The Milky Way is part of the Local
Group of galaxies and is one of around 200 billion galaxies in the
observable universe.

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years
ago, Tony met with his consigliere for lunch at the Sinatra Room.
He got some bad news: that new guy has been dipping into the till.
After some discussion of their options, they decided to send a
message. They ask Jersey Mike to give him the kneecap treatment.
Maybe Mike got carried away, because nobody has seen him since.
Everybody assumes he's been clipped. Maybe you'll be
able to help resolve what happened to him or maybe you'll
just forget-about-it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;N34 CD.ECB
W118 AC.BFE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A=&lt;/b&gt;first
digit in phone # of SR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;B=&lt;/b&gt;digit
thrice in phone # of SR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;C=&lt;/b&gt;last
digit in phone # of SR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;D=&lt;/b&gt;B
less one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;E=&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; squared&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;F=&lt;/b&gt;nothing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is
now an Altoids tin.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These cards
are used in a real world scavenger hunt game where they are found
in&lt;br /&gt;
the real world and captured using your smartphone. You then
level&lt;br /&gt;
up and gain rank based on your score. Points are obtained by&lt;br /&gt;
capturing other people's cards or when your deployed cards
are&lt;br /&gt;
captured by someone else. This is based off of the
fundamentals&lt;br /&gt;
of geocaching and adds another layer of fun to the hunt. Badges
can&lt;br /&gt;
be earned by unlocking specific achievements.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do munzees look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cards come in any size or shape but all must contain a
QR-code&lt;br /&gt;
style barcode. The barcode combined with your GPS coordinates
are&lt;br /&gt;
the essential gameplay elements of these cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cards can be hidden in containers, camouflaged or even
in&lt;br /&gt;
plain view.&lt;/p&gt;

FTF to psubrian from Minn.(he should find Morris, MN--GC2DR9G!)



Louisiana is the only state in the U.S. with political subdivisions
termed parishes, which are local governments equivalent to
counties. The largest parish by population is Jefferson Parish, and
the largest by land area is Cameron Parish. Its capital is Baton
Rouge and largest city is New Orleans.&lt;br /&gt;
Some Louisiana urban environments have a multicultural,
multilingual heritage, being so strongly influenced by an admixture
of 18th century French, Spanish, Indian and African cultures that
they are considered to be somewhat exceptional in the U.S. Before
the American influx and statehood at the beginning of the 19th
century, the territory of current Louisiana State had been a
Spanish and French colony. In addition, the pattern of development
included importing numerous African slaves in the 18th century,
with many from the same region of West Africa, thus concentrating
their culture.&lt;br /&gt;
Louisiana was inhabited by Native Americans for many millennia
before the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century. Many current
place names in the state, including Atchafalaya, Natchitouches (now
spelled Natchitoches), Caddo, Houma, Tangipahoa, and Avoyel (as
Avoyelles), are transliterations of those used in various Native
American languages.&lt;br /&gt;
Louisiana and her Caribbean parent colony developed intimate links
during the 18th century, centered on maritime trade, the exchange
of capital and information, and the migration of colonists. From
such beginnings, Haitians exerted a profound influence on
Louisiana's politics, people, religion, and culture. The colony's
officials, responding to anti-slavery plots and uprisings on the
island, banned the entry of enslaved Saint Dominguans in 1763.
Their rebellious actions would continue to impact upon Louisiana's
slave trade and immigration policies throughout the age of the
American and French revolutions. </groundspeak:long_description>

Those of us men who came of age in the 1960s and 1970s lives were
impacted by our lottery numbers.

&lt;p&gt;A lottery drawing - the first since 1942 - was held on December
1, 1969, at Selective Service National Headquarters in Washington,
D.C. This event determined the order of call for induction during
calendar year 1970; that is, for registrants born between January
1, 1944, and December 31, 1950. Reinstitution of the lottery was a
change from the &quot;draft the oldest man first&quot; method, which had been
the determining method for deciding order of call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 366 blue plastic capsules containing birth dates
placed in a large glass container and drawn by hand to assign
order-of-call numbers to all men within the 18-26 age range
specified in Selective Service law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With radio, film, and TV coverage, the capsules were drawn from
the container, opened, and the dates inside posted in order. The
first capsule - drawn by Congressman Alexander Pirnie (R-NY) of the
House Armed Services Committee - contained the date September 14,
so all men born on September 14 in any year between 1944 and 1950
were assigned lottery number 1. The drawing continued until all
days of the year had been paired with sequence numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My lottery number was 46 and Jerry Seinfeld's was 172!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The caches is at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 205 117&lt;br /&gt;
338 8 212 341&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=df848de5f11fd1a8c6f5cf2d32078acc&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=47433257523948&amp;amp;name=4d7920566965746e616d204c6f7474657279&quot;&gt;

Notice the five tiled digits south of you. Add them together and
multiply the result by six. Add your result to the decimal portion
of the North coordinate(541) and this is the decimal portion of the
final. Now notice the first digit on the street sign. Add this to
the decimal portion of the West coordinate. You now have the final
coordinates, it is probably simpler to walk to the final location
than it would be to drive to and park.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN2KXAD - Final

navigation, metrology, astrometry, binocular vision, model rocketry
and gun direction of weapons.
&lt;p&gt;The use of triangles to estimate distances goes back to
antiquity. In the 6th century BC the Greek philosopher Thales is
recorded as using similar triangles to estimate the height of the
pyramids by measuring the length of their shadows at the moment
when his own shadow was equal to his height;[1] and to have
estimated the distances to ships at sea as seen from a clifftop, by
measuring the horizontal distance traversed by the line-of-sight
for a known fall, and scaling up to the height of the whole
cliff.[2] Such techniques would have been familiar to the ancient
Egyptians.

Casa Grande is a rapidly growing city in Pinal County,
approximately halfway between Phoenix and Tucson in the U.S. state
of Arizona. According to 2007 Census Bureau estimates, the
population of the city is 41,152.[2] It is named after the Casa
Grande Ruins National Monument, which is actually located in
Coolidge.&lt;br /&gt;
Casa Grande was founded in 1879 during the Arizona mining boom and
became Incorporated in 1915. A major railroad terminated in Casa
Grande, which was originally named &quot;Terminus&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
One of the founding fathers of Casa Grande was Thompson Rodney
Peart. Peart Road, Peart Park, and the Peart Center, all of which
are notable fixtures of Casa Grande, are named after him.&lt;br /&gt;
Casa Grande was home to a collective farm society which was part of
the New Deal. </groundspeak:long_description>

Congrats to techylady FTF!!!
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
Hagar Township is located in Northern Berrien County along
the&lt;br /&gt;
shoreline of Lake Michigan. The township is not as densely&lt;br /&gt;
populated as some of the other lakeshore towns and the cost
of&lt;br /&gt;
living in Hagar Township is generally lower. The township
comprises&lt;br /&gt;
mainly grain and fruit farmers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hagar Township's community vision is to maintain the status
quo&lt;br /&gt;
of a rural, farming community while attracting some clean,
light&lt;br /&gt;
industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community is beautifully located amidst dense woods
and&lt;br /&gt;
along sandy beaches. It is easily accessible from I-96 and
M-63.&lt;br /&gt;
Hagar Township is beautifully located, very quiet, and within&lt;br /&gt;
proximity of several shopping and recreational areas in
Berrien&lt;br /&gt;
County and neighboring Van Buren County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

I set out to drive to find this cache today by first getting on the
405 North at Devonshire St. in Mission Hills. I proceed north to
the 210 freeway where I then went toward Pasadena. I continued to
the 118 freeway where I went west. As I returned to the 405
freeway, I realized I had just gone in a circle of sorts.
&lt;p&gt;On my round-trip, I passed points three points as seen on the
map. All three points just happen to be on a circle and the cache
is at the center of that circle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
Laurel was founded in 1683 and incorporated as a town on April
13,&lt;br /&gt;
1883 and was considered one of the wealthiest in the state,
with&lt;br /&gt;
2,500 residents. The town consisted of eleven general stores,
seven&lt;br /&gt;
grocery stores, five millinery, three clothing, three drug
stores,&lt;br /&gt;
two furniture stores, on stave factory, one carriage factory,
one&lt;br /&gt;
sawmill, two blacksmith shops, two wheelwright shops, two
butcher&lt;br /&gt;
shops, two shoe shops, two barber shops, two hotels, five&lt;br /&gt;
physicians, one dentist, and three churches. In the summer of
1899&lt;br /&gt;
a lighted kerosene lamp was overturned in a stairway near
Central&lt;br /&gt;
Avenue and Market Street. Without fire-fighting apparatus,
the&lt;br /&gt;
entire section of the north side of Market Street was destroyed.
In&lt;br /&gt;
an effort to prevent further disastrous fires, the Laurel
Volunteer&lt;br /&gt;
Fire Department was organized October 25, 1899.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Prior to 1883 Laurel was governed by a Board of Commissioners&lt;br /&gt;
consisting of three members, with a fourth member being added&lt;br /&gt;
later. In 1917 a new charter was approved and three&lt;br /&gt;
Councilperson-at-large were added. In 2001, a change in the
town's&lt;br /&gt;
charter was approved, with the Town Council now consisting of
six&lt;br /&gt;
members, with terms of four years and a Mayor with a two year&lt;br /&gt;
term.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Over Laurel's years of existence, the town has had five
persons&lt;br /&gt;
from the area serve as Governors of the state. Nathaniel
Mitchell&lt;br /&gt;
(1805 - 1808); John Collins (1821 - 1825); William Barkley
Cooper&lt;br /&gt;
(1841-1845); William Ross (1851 - 1855); and Elbert Nortrand
Carvel&lt;br /&gt;
(1949 -1953,1961 - 1965).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Laurel also is home to more historic buildings than any town
in&lt;br /&gt;
Delaware with 800 on the National Historic Record.</groundspeak:long_description>

In 1865, two Erie families associated by marriage, joined in a
modest venture to manufacture door hinges. The Selden and Griswold
union paved the way for The Griswold Manufacturing Company of Erie,
Pennsylvania, recognized world wide as producers of fine cast iron
products, especially cookware.
&lt;p&gt;Between 1865 and 1957 when they closed production of the plant
at the corner of 12th and Raspberry Street, their line of cookware
had been sold and used around the world. Their designers and
engineers produced many patents spanning almost 100 years of
manufacture. Before the turn of the 20th century, they added cast
aluminum products to their line. In the 1920's they enameled some
cookware and by the 1930's they offered electric items to their
product list. They produced commercial pieces for use in
restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company was in trouble by the 1940's for a variety of
reasons. Many products were being introduced by other cookware
companies that seemed more attractive to modern cooks. Problems
within the company between management and employees widened, the
quality of the products seemed to decline, and in 1957 the doors of
GMC closed leaving 60+ employees without jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most of the GMC cookware is a desired collectible, almost
all collectors avoid the small Griswold logo era. The former
quality and casting isn't there, for the most part. There seems to
be a much larger demand for cast iron, compared to those seeking
cast aluminum, enameled, electric, or plated pieces. Eventually,
Griswold's strongest competitor, The Wagner Manufacturing Company
of Sydney, Ohio, ended up with ownership of their molds. The
&quot;double stamped&quot; Wagner/Griswold emblems are not considered
important collector's items, nor are the items that say Griswold
but were really manufactured in Sydney, Ohio by Wagner.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Orthopaedic Trauma Institute is part of UC San Francisco and works
out of San Francisco General Hospital.

In the mid-1980s Dr. Lorraine Day(who was an associate professor
and vice chairman of the department of orthopedics at the UCSF
medical school and chief of orthopedic surgery at San Francisco
General Hospital) received considerable media attention related to
the risk of acquiring AIDS through exposure to the blood of AIDS
patients during trauma surgery, publishing a book, AIDS: What the
Government Isn't Telling You, wherein she states that in 1989 she
retired from surgery due to the excessive risk of acquiring AIDS.
&lt;p&gt;Her career has become quite contraversial since then!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A section of 1st Street near the San Fernando / Sylmar Metrolink
station has been officially renamed Frank Modugno Drive after the
late civic leader.
&lt;p&gt;Modugno was well known for his involvement in community
organizations around the northeast San Fernando Valley, including
the Kiwanis Club, the Elks Club, the San Fernando Chamber of
Commerce, Boy Scouts of America, and the Los Angeles Police
Department's youth drug-education program known as DARE.


He also served on the board of trustees at Holy Cross Community
Hospital in Mission Hills, worked to preserve the historic San
Fernando Mission, and helped guide the growth of Mission College in
Sylmar as a president of its foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1966, Modugno was named the city of San Fernando's Man of the
Year. He worked for several elected officials, including former Los
Angeles County Supervisor Warren Dorn.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

round trip.

Use letter codes from the caches below to find the actual

In addition, note the number of letters in the state that is listed
on my bookmark twice=Z.

I am standing less than 2 feet from the cache using the electronic
compass on my garmin gps set at True north.
&lt;p&gt;At 7.874 degrees, I am centered on three trees(really four
trees) on Mission Peak(really Mission Point)(N34 18.635 W118
31.982).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 109.395 degrees, I am centered on four stacks (at 9430 San
Fernando Road, in Sun Valley)(N34 14.673 W118 23.570).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 179.706 degrees, I find the end of the long straight stretch
of Reseda Blvd. where it crosses the 101 Freeway(N34 10.399 W118
32.178).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a clear day, I can center on the US Bank Tower in downtown
Los Angeles(N34 03.068 W118 15.263), at 135.010 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

Contrary to common belief the City of Newton, incorporated in 1860,
was named for Newton Doolittle, whose father, Roger Doolittle, gave
part of the land for the site, and not for Sir Issac Newton, the
English philosopher-mathematician. Newton Doolittle's portrait
hangs in the City Hall, presented by his descendants at the
Centennial celebration in 1961.
&lt;p&gt;Newton County was admitted into the State in February, 1836.
Settlers closely followed the Dancing Rabbit Creek Treaty and the
Choctaw Land Purchase of 1830. Within 25 years there were several
small towns and a railroad, the Southern--now Kansas City
Southern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newton was one of the later towns in the county to be settled,
with trading settlement first at Garlandsville on the stage coach
route, then moving to Newton. The first train of cars on the
Southern line arrived at Newton in September, 1860.

It is called the &quot;proving ground of champions&quot; and the
ultimate test for America's young riders. Those who win it
often go on to ride professionally, and the roster of winners reads
like a who's who of equestrian sports. For spectators, it is
poetry in motion, where horse and rider seem to float effortlessly
through difficult maneuvers. For the young competitors, it is about
grace and style and a tremendous amount of dedication and hard
work...
&lt;p&gt;The ASPCA Maclay, a championship class at the National Horse
Show, was initiated in 1933 by Alfred B. Maclay, an ASPCA board
member, accomplished horseman and president of the National Horse
Show. Maclay conceived of a trophy that would inspire young riders
to develop the best horsemanship skills and instill in them respect
and compassion for their equine partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1883 at the original Madison Square Garden, the
National Horse Show is America's oldest indoor horse show,
firmly established as a major fixture on the national and
international sports and social event calendars. The National has
now become one of America's most prestigious outdoor horse
shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Horse Show Association's primary activity is
the annual production of the National Horse Show and all ancillary
events. Over its 121 years of history, the National Horse Show has
provided financial aide to many worthwhile charities.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Here's some caches that serve as a short archeological tour of&lt;br/&gt;the Lower Little Tujunga area. Many years ago, for a short time,&lt;br/&gt;the area was rather busy with prospectors, ranchers, folks hiding&lt;br/&gt;out from the prohibitionists, bikers, hippies, klansmen you name&lt;br/&gt;it. Forgotten roads and camps and structures litter the area. This&lt;br/&gt;series of caches (and many others around here) highlight some of&lt;br/&gt;these curious sites. So grab your GPS and enjoy these little trips&lt;br/&gt;through time.&lt;br/&gt;What this wall is doing here is anyone's guess, but good thing it&lt;br/&gt;was here when a small group of young soldiers were ambushed. They&lt;br/&gt;used it to take cover &amp; prevailed after a fearsome&lt;br/&gt;firefight.</groundspeak:long_description>

Cascade is situated at the northern end of the valley. Cascade is a
great example of a small Western town that developed as a center of
logging and ranching, adapted to the times as those activities
diminished, and yet managed to maintain its identity. It is still a
working community for the surrounding area of ranches, but the town
has also found a way to welcome and accommodate the increasing
number of people who come to the area for sport, recreation,
adventure, fabulous views and a relaxed lifestyle.
&lt;p&gt;Cascade's location at the southern end of Lake Cascade has made
it a destination for hunters and fishermen for many years. This has
helped the community make a transition to have more of a
tourism-based economy. The lake is approximately 20 miles long and
5 miles wide with 110 miles of shoreline. Its size and the relative
ease of access to most of the shoreline make Lake Cascade a
tremendous resource for all kinds of recreation and in addition the
surrounding mountains offer a myriad of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

other trade objects. A FTF dollar awaits. Congrats to LAEd for
FTF!!!

This trail is dedicated to Dr. Mario A. DeCampos who was a
well-known family doctor in the area and the stone memorial at the
peak is dedicated to him.
&lt;p&gt;Try this hike after a rainstorm and you will be rewarded aplenty
as the Sulphur Spring Fire Road meanders along the northeastern rim
of the San Fernando Valley. You will be following a well maintained
fire road that climbs steadily up to a little grove of four oak
trees just below the summit of Mission Peak. This is a great spot
to have a snack before making the final ascent. There are two ways
to go up: you can follow the obvious steep trail on the eastern
side or you can keep following the fire road around the next bend
to the left and then up a another moderate trail to the left
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mission Point can also be reached more commonly from a trail out
of O'Melveny Park on Sesnon Blvd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch your step near edge.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Look for the pipe- and I would suggest triangulating rather than trying to plow straight up to the cache. The high difficulty is largely because of the last 50 feet or so. Not that hard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I should note that I don't have any of the pictures I took for hints, etc- this is a tragedy- when I got home &amp; started working on the listings I found my memory card was completely fried. Lots of good shots of hints &amp; junk &amp; other stuff were lost so if anyone wants to add a picture or two to any of these pages please feel free.

The city of Astoria is the county seat of Clatsop County, Oregon,
United States.[3] Situated near the mouth of the Columbia River,
the city was named after the American investor (and first
millionaire) John Jacob Astor. His American Fur Company founded
Fort Astoria at the site in 1810. Astoria was incorporated by the
Oregon Legislative Assembly on October 20, 1876.[4]
&lt;p&gt;Located on the south shore of the Columbia, the city is served
by the Port of Astoria with a deep-water port. Transportation
includes the Astoria Regional Airport with U.S. Route 30 and U.S.
Route 101 as the main highways, and the 4.2 mile Astoria –
Megler Bridge connecting to neighboring Washington across the
river. The population was 9,813 at the 2000 census. As of 2007, the
state estimate raised it to 10,045 residents.[5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a strong anit-graffiti group in Sylmar. This area seems
to be a battle area. I feel more comfortable here during daylight
hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cache can be approached from either side of the 210 freeway and
it is nano-ish.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

In early colonial times the term&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Goose Creek men&quot; was used for a group of colonists, mostly settled&lt;br/&gt;a few miles west of Charleston near a stream called Goose Creek.&lt;br/&gt;The Goose Creek men became leaders of the early Indian trade, and&lt;br/&gt;by the 1690s many held important offices in the colonial&lt;br/&gt;government. At first the Goose Creek men dealt mainly in Indian&lt;br/&gt;slaves, while later the deerskin trade dominated. Several colonial&lt;br/&gt;governors were Goose Creek men, such as James Moore.&lt;br/&gt;Naval Nuclear Power School, Nuclear Power Training Unit Charleston,&lt;br/&gt;and SPAWAR are located in Goose Creek and Hanahan on the Naval&lt;br/&gt;Weapons Station Charleston. Nuclear submarines and submarine&lt;br/&gt;tenders were based at the Naval Weapons Station (NWS) in Goose&lt;br/&gt;Creek until the early 1990s, at which time they were homeported at&lt;br/&gt;other naval bases on the Atlantic coast due to a &quot;reduction in&lt;br/&gt;force&quot; (RIF) of US military and naval bases. Large portions of the&lt;br/&gt;Weapons Station were closed in the early 1990s due to the RIF.&lt;br/&gt;Charleston Naval Shipyard (CNSYD) was also closed due to the&lt;br/&gt;&quot;reduction in force&quot;, and is now largely owned by the city of North&lt;br/&gt;Charleston and private companies. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Here's some caches that serve as a short archeological tour of the Lower Little Tujunga area. Many years ago, for a short time, the area was rather busy with prospectors, ranchers, folks hiding out from the prohibitionists, bikers, hippies, klansmen you name it. Forgotten roads and camps and structures litter the area. This series of caches (and many others around here) highlight some of these curious sites. So grab your GPS and enjoy these little trips through time. As you come up Limerock Canyon, try to imagine there was once a road where you're walking. At least I think there was- but it's long gone. After a while you'll pass an old mine. This one only goes back about 10 or 15 feet, but I imagine it was a bear to dig out. After a hard days work the miners would climb on up the hillside to a perch with a nice view of the canyon below. Guess where I put the cache. It's probably easier to go a little past the mine before you start climbing. I should note that I don't have any of the pictures I took for hints, etc- this is a tragedy- when I got home &amp; started working on the listings I found my memory card was completely fried. Lots of good shots of hints &amp; junk &amp; other stuff were lost so if anyone wants to add a picture or two to any of these pages please feel free. It will be appreciated.</groundspeak:long_description>

I couldn't get a good heading at GZ But this is close enough. You'll know which way to head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ok. From the trailhead head up Kagel truck trail. Shortly after coming over the saddle look for an old trail that heads down into the little valley (towards LA Mining Co.). Head that way- you can make that grab first or continue heading down through the head of Limerock Cyn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just keep heading down stream to GZ. You'll see exactly where to head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again a quick warning: Mountain Lions - Poison Oak - Ticks these are just some of the hazards you might see up here. Even though it's a short hike, be prepared - very few people come down (or head up) this way.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Here's some caches that serve as a short archeological tour of the Lower Little Tujunga area. Many years ago, for a short time, the area was rather busy with prospectors, ranchers, folks hiding out from the prohibitionists, bikers, hippies, klansmen you name it. Forgotten roads and camps and structures litter the area. This series of caches (and many others around here) highlight some of these curious sites. So grab your GPS and enjoy these little trips through time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the remains of The Los Angeles Mining Company, a graphite mine that was worked in the early 20's. After digging for over a year they brought a load up to a paint company in San Fransico, but there were too many impurities in the ore and the load was rejected &amp; the mine shut down. The cache is a small black box at the base of an overgrown cement pylon. There is also an old foundation at: N34 19.377 W118 21.355. I think this was a house for the people working here. If you go from the cache in the direction of the foundation theres all kinds of old miney stuff strewn about. Also the mine its self was another 200 feet or so up the small canyon. I could only fine tailings. I think the tunnel is filled in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BIG WARNING! About a quarter mile NE of here I came face to face with a mountain lion. My stupid dog took off after it and luckily the lion chose to flee rather than fight. BE CAREFUL! Had the dog not been with me I don't know if I could have chased it away myself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I should note that I don't have any of the pictures I took for hints, etc- this is a tragedy- when I got home &amp; started working on the listings I found my memory card was completely fried. Lots of good shots of hints &amp; junk &amp; other stuff were lost so if anyone wants to add a picture or two to any of these pages please feel free. It will be appreciated.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Even though this cache is just a tenth of a mile from where you'd park a car, it's a LONG tenth of a mile. Heavy overgrowth and deep under growth make it slow going. Usually I tread pretty lightly, but a keen eye will probably be able to track my route. Basic rule of thumb for finding this cache is: If you don't want to do something, you have to if you want to sign the log. Watch where you put your feet, I'm serious- there was a snake sleeping very close to the cache that I almost stepped on. He didn't look like the rattlers we have around my neighborhood- but after looking at the USGS snake page,&lt;br/&gt;I think he was.&lt;br/&gt;But I didn't see his head or tail, just the redish orange on black stripes.&lt;br/&gt;Wear long pants, sleeves, a hat, water proof shoes, even gloves. There are all kinds of scratchy, icky, thorny things between you and the log.&lt;br/&gt;This ones not for everyone, but if you want to be Indiana Jones for an hour you might have some fun. Bring a friend or at least let some one know where you're going.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second time I took the coords I came up with: N34 19.395 W118 20.411&lt;br/&gt;I may have rated this one higher than it should be, but I would rather err to caution.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall (otherwise known as Sylmar
Juvenile Hall) was named in honor of one of Los Angeles County's
Chief Probation Officers. Established back in the late 70's, Sylmar
Juvenile Hall underwent major development in the late 90's that
resulted in its current capacity to house approximately 700
juvenile detainees. Like Eastlake Juvenile Hall and Los Padrinos
Juvenile Hall, the Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall in Sylmar CA
serves as a temporary holding facility for juvenile detainees
during their court proceedings. Ultimately, the minors will be
released home to their parents, placed in foster care, sent to a
Los Angeles County juvenile camp facility or sentenced to the
California Youth Authority. Located at 16350 Filbert Street,
Sylmar, CA 91342 in the San Fernando Valley.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Here's some caches that serve as a short archeological tour of the Lower Little Tujunga area. Many years ago, for a short time, the area was rather busy with prospectors, ranchers, folks hiding out from the prohibitionists, bikers, hippies, klansmen you name it. Forgotten roads and camps and structures litter the area. This series of caches (and many others around here) highlight some of these curious sites. So grab your GPS and enjoy these little trips through time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I guess the lesson we'll learn with this cache is watch where you put you hands. Victor lies waiting in the tailings of some old project. It looks like people used to work up here &amp; may have been trying to build a road across this little valley. Or it may have been yet another mining prospect. Anyway, as you approach the cache look up to the ridge line, you'll see something took a big bite out of it. There's some junk lying about, but not too much. Please make sure to leave this one as you found it... If possible.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Neat place I found while caching a few years ago. The cache I was looking for back then has been archived, so now you have this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park off Little Tujunga Road at a place called &quot;Barrel Spring&quot; on the map (N34 20.079 W118 20.504) and just walk up the canyon. Judging from all the junk laying around (candles, tents, clothes, beer cans) I'd say this area is a bit of a hangout so use caution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stay to your left. It's only about a quarter mile or so. A successful cacher will have to negotiate 3 or 4 dry waterfalls (DO NOT DO THIS CACHE IN THE RAIN! You'll see why when you get there) and find the small metal box at the base of a skinny bush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I used a hand line to get down the two larger cliffs, but I don't think it's absolutely necessary. I just wanted to make my life easier</groundspeak:long_description>

Steep rock scramble to get to cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adventure Pass Required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park your car where Mendenhal Ridge Road crossed Little Tujunga Canyon Road. Make sure to bring some water. It's a 2 mile round trip with about 500ft elevation gain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last 50 feet on so require some climbing up a steep ravine, nothing too crazy, but if this isn't the kind of thing you're comfortable with, leave this one alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a cammo'ed coffee can with a log &amp; some stuff. Bring a pen in case I forgot to put one in the can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hints (Decrypt)</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>If you make the climb you'll probably see it. Under a big rock, before the ravine splits.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

The
cache is not at the posted coordinates, but you can save a ton of
&quot;cache&quot; by buying in bulk.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While looking for a spot to place a new cache I thought to myself:
&quot;Right now, on 6/2/2011 at 7:05:37pm, up there, there's a satellite
that knows exactly what my geolocation is.&quot; So I grabbed my iPhone,
which I also use for geocaching, stood firm and took 28 shots
aiming at different points in the sky. I hid my 37th cache and went
home. When I got home I transferred all 28 images to Adobe
Photoshop Lightroom 2 and upon inspecting each one of them I
confirmed what I had thought earlier. Here's one of the shots. If
you look hard enough, I believe you can see USA 66 / GPS
2-10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Image can be downloaded &lt;a href=&quot;http://brick.carlosguerrera.com/geolocation-cache-resized.jpg&quot;&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series of caches I'm putting out to celebrate
the local SCV geocachers and to thank them for their contribution
to the game/obsession/hobby/job/sport that geocaching is. Some I
have met and run into many times on an FTF run, some put out some
of the most creative caches I've seen and others I've never met but
hope to meet one day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First time I met Trevor was on an FTF run. We both DNF it. We run
into each other on early FTF runs every so often. Since he's really
good with puzzle/mysteries caches I usually bug him when I'm stuck
trying to solve one.&lt;/p&gt;

This is part of a series of caches I'm putting out to celebrate the
local SCV geocachers and to thank them for their contribution to
the game/obsession/hobby/job/sport that geocaching is. Some I have
met and run into many times on an FTF run, some put out some of the
most creative caches I've seen and others I've never met but hope
to meet one day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I only met Yosemite John and Debbie once, on the &quot;10 Years! Los
Angeles, CA&quot; event cache. They have FTFs on a couple of my Glendale
caches and I have found a few of their 200+ caches. As a matter of
fact my 1000th find is an Earthcache of theirs. If you have never
met or heard of Yosemite John and Debbie, you are not geocaching
right. Thanks for all the caches!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A plastic backup tape container. Big enough for a few trade items.
There's only a log right now. BYOP. Put it back where you found
it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations to indiandunes for being FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

I've never met Plannerman72. Although I have only found a few of
his caches, I enjoyed each one of them. Would he put a cache here?
Around this area? Probably. At this specific location? Probably
not. But I'm sure he'll let me know.&lt;br /&gt;

This is part of a series of caches I'm putting out to celebrate the
local SCV geocachers and to thank them for their contribution to
the game/obsession/hobby/job/sport that geocaching is. Some I have
met and run into many times on an FTF run, some put out some of the
most creative caches I've seen and others I've never met but hope
to meet one day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I've never met VanIchiro51 &amp; VerMagnus, but hats off to the
dynamic duo. If their goal is to have caches on every trail in the
US, they should be done by month's end. Right now because my kids
are too young I can't hit the trails to find their caches, but when
they are old enough, their caches will be the first ones will try
and find. Thanks for your active participation in geocaching, both
finding and hiding caches.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Container has room for TBs, Geocoins and tradeable items. You can
park at N 34.44376 W 118.39150 and then walk to the cache. If you
rely on AT&amp;T for cell service you are out of luck. This area is
a black hole. GPS signal bounces a lot around these parts. See hint
if you can't get a fix. If you come after dark bring a flashlight.
Be careful where you step. Lots of residents walk their dogs here
and don't pick up after them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&quot;Caching, caching, and more caching oh and sports also.&quot; This is

the caches and contribution to geocaching.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Spices container painted black. You can park at N 34.44376 W
118.39150 and then walk to the cache. If you rely on AT&amp;T for
cell service you are out of luck. This area is a black hole. GPS
signal bounces a lot around these parts. See hint if you can't get
a fix. If you come after dark bring a flashlight. Be careful where
you step. Lots of residents walk their dogs here and don't pick up
after them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations to Thudpucker for being FTF!&lt;br /&gt;

This is part of a series of caches I'm putting out to celebrate the
local SCV geocachers and to thank them for their contribution to
the game/obsession/hobby/job/sport that geocaching is. Some I have
met and run into many times on an FTF run, some put out some of the
most creative caches I've seen and others I've never met but hope
to meet one day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My first contact with Greg was via e-mail. We were both trying to
FTF Orange In The Sky. We both made several trips to GZ, at
different times, and shared our knowledge in order to see if any of
us would find it. It turned out the cache was never found and it
was archived later on. Greg started putting out very creative
caches that always had me scratching my head for a good while. He
recently visited one of my most popular cache in LA and I had the
pleasure to finally meet him and family. Thanks for all the
creative caches, Greg! Keep them coming.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
My first contact with Karen was via e-mail. We were both trying to
have one of the local caches archived for too many DNFs and lack of
care by the CO. Both Karen and I, as she puts it, like to have a
nice, clean map. I've never met Karen, but have enjoyed her GUIS
(Growing Up In Saugus) series of caches for the little history
behind each one. Thanks for keeping our maps clean and for the
caches! Keep them coming!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The terrain difficulty is a 2 because some of you may need a bit of
a lift to reach the cache. Put it back exactly where you found it.
BYOP.&lt;br /&gt;

Not much left of it now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I found this canyon while caching last Spring and I thought it warranted a better look. Pretty nice little mini-hike if you go to the end. I tried to make the caches challenging despite the short distances. This here's the easiest one. I hope y'all enjoy.</groundspeak:long_description>

There will be three or four more if I ever get back up here.&lt;br/&gt;Take the Templin Hwy exit off Interstate 5, Templin Hwy ends at a gate in a couple of miles. Park there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because I started late, I brought a bike so I could get back faster, but it was so hot after only a mile into the trip that I decided to come back to this area and sit under a tree until the sun got low enough to provide some shade going up Fish Canyon. I had never been here before and didn’t know what lay ahead. On my way in I passed a couple of hikers sitting in the shade. The looked like they’d been hit by a truck. It was easily 100 degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I went back and sat out the Sun. Well I sat for a while, got bored and decided to hide a cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one’s a small metal lunchbox up in a tree. You have to climb on top of the boulder to reach it but you should be able to spot it from the ground. I’ll rate this one a 3.5 because you have to climb, but it’s not that hard. </groundspeak:long_description>

Park there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I got to this area I was glad I had my bike. Really pretty area, where the stream runs right down an old road bed. “This will be fun on the way back,” I though, and pressed on, forgetting to place a cache, perhaps thinking there would be a better spot further upstream. I didn’t get that much farther this trip, so I stopped here on my way down and hid this one. It’s a short scramble to the cache from the trail. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to Knapp Ranch, for this easy two stage mystery&lt;br/&gt;cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The history of the Knapp ranch goes all the way back to the late&lt;br/&gt;1800's. It was built by a Mr. Kelly who ran a gas station and&lt;br/&gt;restaurant on the Old Ridge Route, which was the main drag north&lt;br/&gt;out of the Santa Clarita valley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 60's the place was taken over by Frank Knapp, who used&lt;br/&gt;it as a horse ranch and hunting lodge. When Knapp died the Forest&lt;br/&gt;Service took it over.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coords will only get you to the door.&lt;br/&gt; Both the clue &amp; the cache are out&lt;br/&gt;of sight, you might have to get on your tippy-toes or stretch your neck to make the grab&lt;br/&gt;but thats about it. Please return the hides as you found them. Final cache is a small box with a log and pencil &amp; a&lt;br/&gt;compass for the first to find. Everything is within 15 of each other, so making it a mystery or a multi just confuses the issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a fascinating place if you're into SoCal history, but&lt;br/&gt;its remote! Bring water &amp; food &amp; other basic survival needs&lt;br/&gt;in the event of an emergency. I had no phone service and saw no one&lt;br/&gt;on the way down. It's a five mile dirt road down to the ranch gate&lt;br/&gt;then a short walk to the cache. High clearance vehicles only.&lt;br/&gt;Four wheel drive certainly would have made me feel a little more secure,&lt;br/&gt;but I made it back with an old 2 wheel drive pickup truck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please note: There's not a lot (almost none) of vandalism/litter here. Please,&lt;br/&gt;if you visit, leave it as you find it. Please post a picture or two&lt;br/&gt;if you go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One last thing: The ranch still has one resident, a wild horse,&lt;br/&gt;probably left by Knapp, still wanders the yard. I didn't see him,&lt;br/&gt;but I know he's still there, so watch your step.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Be aware that this is an unpaved road and in the winter you may encounter snow. 4WD is recommended. Cache is easy to find, but may require some ingenuity to access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's a micro cache with a log and $1 for the first to find. When closing it, please roll the log tightly into the small portion of the container and then put the large portion over it, to ensure it seals tightly.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A motherload of trade items, but an even better location to
play! It's a difficult hike off the beaten path, nice and
secluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations to m/jwolfe for FTF!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is a large orange bucket filled up to the brim with
stuff to trade and play with. Here's the deal... I'm not telling
you what's in it. If you choose to trade (up or even, please), feel
free to tell us what you received, but don't tell us what you
swapped for it. More fun that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest find, of course, is the location. It is a secluded
area on Bull Run Creek that is difficult to get to and features
natural waterfalls, pools, slide, small water cave, and plenty of
warm flatrock to sunbathe on. The area is often used as a great
place to skinny dip, get an even tan, or more. You can bring
children, but they might whine a bit during the 1 1/2 mile hike;
and don't be offended if someone is already there &lt;i&gt;ruining it&lt;/i&gt;
for the kids. I suggest parents find it FIRST before attempting to
take your children there. There is a good chance you will not find
it the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT NOTES: There is little, if any, cellular phone service
in the area. Also, if you visit the &quot;Bull Run Creek&quot; cache (GC21AD)
first, do NOT attempt to go directly to &quot;Freshet Grotto&quot; or
&lt;strong&gt;you risk falling to your death&lt;/strong&gt;. However, you can
get a great view of &quot;Freshet Grotto&quot; from way up there. So, I
recommend going to GC21AD second. There is a fork in the trail at N
35° 46.593, W 118° 27.944... To the left is the &quot;Bull Run Creek&quot;
cache (GC21AD), to the right/straight is &quot;Freshet Grotto&quot;; well,
after a bit of off-trail maneuvering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finding the fork mentioned above, the easiest way to get
to the cache itself requires you to stick to a trail that
disappears and reappears many times amongst flatrock and bolders.
When you are almost to &quot;Freshet Grotto&quot;, you will have to cross
over Bull Run Creek on a couple well-placed logs, but then you'll
have to wade back across further up past the water cave in order to
reach the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the cache is at the EXACT GPS coordinates
posted. Just don't drop your GPS device in the creek!&lt;/p&gt;
</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Following the directions on GC21AD might help.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I have taken this trip many times and the long and desolate desert road is pretty boring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a spread of about 10 feet between the Nevada and California signposts. I call it a void space in time, hence the name of the cache. I filled it with a lot of actually good, goodies, including some cash. It is amongs a small group of trees with a rock on top.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Well we have made a new Leg of this run and it will also be easy to hard to hardest in finds. . This Leg will take you close to the new mine that is going in around Yerington. I hear it is a everything and anything they can get Mine. There is to be Mine Shafts and open pit. From Gold to Silver to Copper to any other mineral they can mine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yerington Mine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yerington portion of the complex is comprised of 108 unpatented lode claims, 85 patented lode claims, fee lands totaling 1,547 acres and 21 mill site claims, cumulatively totaling approximately 4,500 acres as depicted in Figure 1. (available on request) There are no outstanding royalty interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper oxide ore is processed at the Yerington mine site by crushing and acid curing followed by heap leaching. Approximately 21 million square feet of leach pad area is fully permitted. Leach solutions are processed at the on-site SX-EW plant (built in 1991) that is capable of producing up to 63,000 pounds of high-grade electrolytic cathode copper per day. Warehouses, a carpentry shop, metal shop, repair shop, garages, main office, mine office, assay lab, and chemical lab are on site. The mine/plant facility is located near the town of Yerington, Nevada, approximately 80-road miles southeast of the city of Reno, Nevada. Paved highway Alternate 95 passes just east of the existing Yerington open pit. Electrical power is currently available at the site by Sierra Pacific. Arimetco has one main water well and 5 make up wells that are more than sufficient for projected operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History - The first production of copper in the Yerington district was recorded in the early 1900's. Initial exploration on the present Yerington Mine was carried out by a subsidiary of the Anaconda Company in the early 1940's. This work delineated a reserve of 60 million tons at 0.90% to 0.95% Cu comprised of 40 million tons of oxide ore below which were 20 million tons of sulfide ore. Development of the Yerington ore body was postponed for a number of years because of anticipated high production costs. A positive production decision was made in 1951 and the Yerington deposit went into official production in late 1953.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between November 1953 and June 1978, the Yerington operation produced 162 million tons of 0.55% Cu from a single pit which is now approximately 6,400 feet long by 2,800 feet wide by up to 500 feet deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anaconda shut the mine down in 1978 due to a combination of low copper prices and low profit margins on the sulfide ores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1982, Don and Joy Tibbals purchased the property from Atlantic Richfield Company, successor to Anaconda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid 1989, Arimetco International Inc. purchased the property and a SX-EW plant was commissioned by Arimetco in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vat leach tails and oxide stockpile material is currently being processed on-site at a rate of approximately 40,000 tons per day.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                                                                                                         Lyon County History&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The First Territorial Legislature created&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lyon County&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on November 24, 1861. It was one of nine original counties. As to the origin of the County name, two stories exist. One believes the honor belongs to General Nathaniel Lyon, a Union commander. General Lyon was killed in a Civil War battle at Wilson Creek on August 9, 1861. The second supports Captain Lyon, one of Nevada early pioneers, who was a member of the Sierra Guards during the Pyramid Indian Wars of 1860. Contemporary reference works include both name origins. At the same time the First Territorial Legislature designated Dayton as the County Seat.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dayton,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;was the first County seat and the County center of commerce for many years, was named after John Day, the surveyor who laid out the town. The original spelling of the town name was Daytown. Popular usage brought it to Dayton in 1861. Also previously known as,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chinatown, Mineral Rapids and Nevada City&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The original courthouse in Dayton, a classic structure typically Nevada burned in 1907.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 1911 the Nevada State Legislature designated&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; as the County seat, named after Henry Marvin Yerington of railroad and mining wealth. The original name was &lt;i&gt;Pizen Switch&lt;/i&gt; the name derived from poor whiskey which was sold in saloons built of willows and mud. Culture arrived and the name was changed to &lt;i&gt;Greenfield&lt;/i&gt; and later to Yerington. Yerington is one of Nevadas incorporated municipalities.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Several changes were made to the boundaries of the County over the years; however, one of the most important occurred in 1883 when a portion of Esmeralda County was annexed. This annexation to Lyon County included part of what is know as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mason Valley.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the early years of the County, mining was acknowledged as the economic mainstay. Numerous communities were born as mining camps or as centers of transportation or provision supply. Of particular note in the development of numerous communities was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gold Canyon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, a site in western Lyon County. In 1849 gold was discovered in this canyon. During the 1850 miners worked up the canyon, and subsequently the Comstock Lode was discovered.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silver City&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, an existing community, was an important part of The Comstock. Mining continued playing a vital role in Lyon County well into the 20th Century.  During this decade several heap leach operations have occurred, primarily in the County western area.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anaconda extensive operation created a community, known as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Weed Heights&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;near&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and was a major positive economic factor for both the County and the state.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Referring to contemporary production, Nevada Statistical Abstract, 1988, &quot;Minerals Produced in Nevada by County in order of Monetary Value, 1985&quot;, reports that minerals extracted in Lyon County were cement, diatomite, stone (crushed and broken), gold, gypsum, and silver.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another key site vital to the development of not just Lyon County, but to western Nevada, was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The fort was Nevada first, largest, and most important military post. The warring Paiutes’ raids on emigrant route stations, together with their causing trouble for travelers and interrupting mail service, caused the Federal Government to order the fort construction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;By the end of 1861 some 600 men were stationed at Fort Churchill. When regular troops were sent to the Civil War, volunteers from California manned the fort. The settling of the Indian troubles and the completion of the Central Pacific which decreased travel on the central Overland Trail demonstrated the fort was no longer needed. In September, 1869, Fort Churchill was abandoned.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is now a State Park and is one of Nevada National Historic Landmarks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The importance of early buildings and sites in Lyon County can be found through Nevada Historical Marker program. Fifteen sites or buildings within Lyon County have been marked.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This will be the ongoing CAS run done by Hans415 only this series will be a little harder yet I promise a lot of fun. Team Sagebrushers has team with several members to bring this Fantastic Series.Hence the TS name. Most of the route can be done in a two wheel car but a few spots are a bit bumpier than others, so enter at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;
There will be two BLM gates if closed please reclose. All are close to roadway. You will find 1.5x1.5's &amp; 1.5x4.5 difficulty. There will be different containers types and sizes. Thanks to Two Left Knees and&lt;br /&gt;
Poohntigger for there help and xtra containers. As always this will be a ongoing project so more and more will pop up over the weeks and months etc.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                         Lyon County History&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The First Territorial Legislature created&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lyon County&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on November 24, 1861. It was one of nine original counties. As to the origin of the County name, two stories exist. One believes the honor belongs to General Nathaniel Lyon, a Union commander. General Lyon was killed in a Civil War battle at Wilson Creek on August 9, 1861. The second supports Captain Lyon, one of Nevada early pioneers, who was a member of the Sierra Guards during the Pyramid Indian Wars of 1860. Contemporary reference works include both name origins. At the same time the First Territorial Legislature designated Dayton as the County Seat.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dayton,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;was the first County seat and the County center of commerce for many years, was named after John Day, the surveyor who laid out the town. The original spelling of the town name was Daytown. Popular usage brought it to Dayton in 1861. Also previously known as,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chinatown, Mineral Rapids and Nevada City&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The original courthouse in Dayton, a classic structure typically Nevada burned in 1907.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 1911 the Nevada State Legislature designated&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; as the County seat, named after Henry Marvin Yerington of railroad and mining wealth. The original name was &lt;i&gt;Pizen Switch&lt;/i&gt; the name derived from poor whiskey which was sold in saloons built of willows and mud. Culture arrived and the name was changed to &lt;i&gt;Greenfield&lt;/i&gt; and later to Yerington. Yerington is one of Nevadas incorporated municipalities.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Several changes were made to the boundaries of the County over the years; however, one of the most important occurred in 1883 when a portion of Esmeralda County was annexed. This annexation to Lyon County included part of what is know as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mason Valley.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the early years of the County, mining was acknowledged as the economic mainstay. Numerous communities were born as mining camps or as centers of transportation or provision supply. Of particular note in the development of numerous communities was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gold Canyon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, a site in western Lyon County. In 1849 gold was discovered in this canyon. During the 1850 miners worked up the canyon, and subsequently the Comstock Lode was discovered.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silver City&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, an existing community, was an important part of The Comstock. Mining continued playing a vital role in Lyon County well into the 20th Century.  During this decade several heap leach operations have occurred, primarily in the County western area.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anaconda extensive operation created a community, known as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Weed Heights&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;near&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and was a major positive economic factor for both the County and the state.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Referring to contemporary production, Nevada Statistical Abstract, 1988, &quot;Minerals Produced in Nevada by County in order of Monetary Value, 1985&quot;, reports that minerals extracted in Lyon County were cement, diatomite, stone (crushed and broken), gold, gypsum, and silver.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another key site vital to the development of not just Lyon County, but to western Nevada, was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The fort was Nevada first, largest, and most important military post. The warring Paiutes’ raids on emigrant route stations, together with their causing trouble for travelers and interrupting mail service, caused the Federal Government to order the fort construction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;By the end of 1861 some 600 men were stationed at Fort Churchill. When regular troops were sent to the Civil War, volunteers from California manned the fort. The settling of the Indian troubles and the completion of the Central Pacific which decreased travel on the central Overland Trail demonstrated the fort was no longer needed. In September, 1869, Fort Churchill was abandoned.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is now a State Park and is one of Nevada National Historic Landmarks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The importance of early buildings and sites in Lyon County can be found through Nevada Historical Marker program. Fifteen sites or buildings within Lyon County have been marked.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The original name was &lt;i&gt;Pizen Switch&lt;/i&gt; the name derived from poor whiskey which was sold in saloons built of willows and mud. Culture arrived and the name was changed to &lt;i&gt;Greenfield&lt;/i&gt; and later to Yerington. Yerington is one of Nevadas incorporated municipalities.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Several changes were made to the boundaries of the County over the years; however, one of the most important occurred in 1883 when a portion of Esmeralda County was annexed. This annexation to Lyon County included part of what is know as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mason Valley.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the early years of the County, mining was acknowledged as the economic mainstay. Numerous communities were born as mining camps or as centers of transportation or provision supply. Of particular note in the development of numerous communities was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gold Canyon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, a site in western Lyon County. In 1849 gold was discovered in this canyon. During the 1850 miners worked up the canyon, and subsequently the Comstock Lode was discovered.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silver City&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, an existing community, was an important part of The Comstock. Mining continued playing a vital role in Lyon County well into the 20th Century.  During this decade several heap leach operations have occurred, primarily in the County western area.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anaconda extensive operation created a community, known as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Weed Heights&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;near&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and was a major positive economic factor for both the County and the state.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Referring to contemporary production, Nevada Statistical Abstract, 1988, &quot;Minerals Produced in Nevada by County in order of Monetary Value, 1985&quot;, reports that minerals extracted in Lyon County were cement, diatomite, stone (crushed and broken), gold, gypsum, and silver.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another key site vital to the development of not just Lyon County, but to western Nevada, was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The fort was Nevada first, largest, and most important military post. The warring Paiutes’ raids on emigrant route stations, together with their causing trouble for travelers and interrupting mail service, caused the Federal Government to order the fort construction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;By the end of 1861 some 600 men were stationed at Fort Churchill. When regular troops were sent to the Civil War, volunteers from California manned the fort. The settling of the Indian troubles and the completion of the Central Pacific which decreased travel on the central Overland Trail demonstrated the fort was no longer needed. In September, 1869, Fort Churchill was abandoned.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is now a State Park and is one of Nevada National Historic Landmarks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The importance of early buildings and sites in Lyon County can be found through Nevada Historical Marker program. Fifteen sites or buildings within Lyon County have been marked.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                                                                                                         Lyon County History&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The First Territorial Legislature created&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lyon County&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on November 24, 1861. It was one of nine original counties. As to the origin of the County name, two stories exist. One believes the honor belongs to General Nathaniel Lyon, a Union commander. General Lyon was killed in a Civil War battle at Wilson Creek on August 9, 1861. The second supports Captain Lyon, one of Nevada early pioneers, who was a member of the Sierra Guards during the Pyramid Indian Wars of 1860. Contemporary reference works include both name origins. At the same time the First Territorial Legislature designated Dayton as the County Seat.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dayton,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;was the first County seat and the County center of commerce for many years, was named after John Day, the surveyor who laid out the town. The original spelling of the town name was Daytown. Popular usage brought it to Dayton in 1861. Also previously known as,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chinatown, Mineral Rapids and Nevada City&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The original courthouse in Dayton, a classic structure typically Nevada burned in 1907.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 1911 the Nevada State Legislature designated&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; as the County seat, named after Henry Marvin Yerington of railroad and mining wealth. The original name was &lt;i&gt;Pizen Switch&lt;/i&gt; the name derived from poor whiskey which was sold in saloons built of willows and mud. Culture arrived and the name was changed to &lt;i&gt;Greenfield&lt;/i&gt; and later to Yerington. Yerington is one of Nevadas incorporated municipalities.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

On this Leg of the TS cache run we will take you to new heights and scenery. You will see The Mason Valley and the Walker river running through it. We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                         Lyon County History&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The First Territorial Legislature created&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lyon County&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on November 24, 1861. It was one of nine original counties. As to the origin of the County name, two stories exist. One believes the honor belongs to General Nathaniel Lyon, a Union commander. General Lyon was killed in a Civil War battle at Wilson Creek on August 9, 1861. The second supports Captain Lyon, one of Nevada early pioneers, who was a member of the Sierra Guards during the Pyramid Indian Wars of 1860. Contemporary reference works include both name origins. At the same time the First Territorial Legislature designated Dayton as the County Seat.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dayton,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;was the first County seat and the County center of commerce for many years, was named after John Day, the surveyor who laid out the town. The original spelling of the town name was Daytown. Popular usage brought it to Dayton in 1861. Also previously known as,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chinatown, Mineral Rapids and Nevada City&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The original courthouse in Dayton, a classic structure typically Nevada burned in 1907.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 1911 the Nevada State Legislature designated&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; as the County seat, named after Henry Marvin Yerington of railroad and mining wealth. The original name was &lt;i&gt;Pizen Switch&lt;/i&gt; the name derived from poor whiskey which was sold in saloons built of willows and mud. Culture arrived and the name was changed to &lt;i&gt;Greenfield&lt;/i&gt; and later to Yerington. Yerington is one of Nevadas incorporated municipalities.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Several changes were made to the boundaries of the County over the years; however, one of the most important occurred in 1883 when a portion of Esmeralda County was annexed. This annexation to Lyon County included part of what is know as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mason Valley.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the early years of the County, mining was acknowledged as the economic mainstay. Numerous communities were born as mining camps or as centers of transportation or provision supply. Of particular note in the development of numerous communities was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gold Canyon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, a site in western Lyon County. In 1849 gold was discovered in this canyon. During the 1850 miners worked up the canyon, and subsequently the Comstock Lode was discovered.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silver City&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, an existing community, was an important part of The Comstock. Mining continued playing a vital role in Lyon County well into the 20th Century.  During this decade several heap leach operations have occurred, primarily in the County western area.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anaconda extensive operation created a community, known as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Weed Heights&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;near&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and was a major positive economic factor for both the County and the state.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Referring to contemporary production, Nevada Statistical Abstract, 1988, &quot;Minerals Produced in Nevada by County in order of Monetary Value, 1985&quot;, reports that minerals extracted in Lyon County were cement, diatomite, stone (crushed and broken), gold, gypsum, and silver.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another key site vital to the development of not just Lyon County, but to western Nevada, was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The fort was Nevada first, largest, and most important military post. The warring Paiutes’ raids on emigrant route stations, together with their causing trouble for travelers and interrupting mail service, caused the Federal Government to order the fort construction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;By the end of 1861 some 600 men were stationed at Fort Churchill. When regular troops were sent to the Civil War, volunteers from California manned the fort. The settling of the Indian troubles and the completion of the Central Pacific which decreased travel on the central Overland Trail demonstrated the fort was no longer needed. In September, 1869, Fort Churchill was abandoned.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is now a State Park and is one of Nevada National Historic Landmarks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The importance of early buildings and sites in Lyon County can be found through Nevada Historical Marker program. Fifteen sites or buildings within Lyon County have been marked.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Numerous communities were born as mining camps or as centers of transportation or provision supply. Of particular note in the development of numerous communities was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gold Canyon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, a site in western Lyon County. In 1849 gold was discovered in this canyon. During the 1850 miners worked up the canyon, and subsequently the Comstock Lode was discovered.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silver City&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, an existing community, was an important part of The Comstock. Mining continued playing a vital role in Lyon County well into the 20th Century.  During this decade several heap leach operations have occurred, primarily in the County western area.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anaconda extensive operation created a community, known as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Weed Heights&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;near&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and was a major positive economic factor for both the County and the state.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Referring to contemporary production, Nevada Statistical Abstract, 1988, &quot;Minerals Produced in Nevada by County in order of Monetary Value, 1985&quot;, reports that minerals extracted in Lyon County were cement, diatomite, stone (crushed and broken), gold, gypsum, and silver.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another key site vital to the development of not just Lyon County, but to western Nevada, was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The fort was Nevada first, largest, and most important military post. The warring Paiutes’ raids on emigrant route stations, together with their causing trouble for travelers and interrupting mail service, caused the Federal Government to order the fort construction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;By the end of 1861 some 600 men were stationed at Fort Churchill. When regular troops were sent to the Civil War, volunteers from California manned the fort. The settling of the Indian troubles and the completion of the Central Pacific which decreased travel on the central Overland Trail demonstrated the fort was no longer needed. In September, 1869, Fort Churchill was abandoned.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is now a State Park and is one of Nevada National Historic Landmarks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The importance of early buildings and sites in Lyon County can be found through Nevada Historical Marker program. Fifteen sites or buildings within Lyon County have been marked.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                                                                                                         Lyon County History&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The First Territorial Legislature created&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lyon County&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on November 24, 1861. It was one of nine original counties. As to the origin of the County name, two stories exist. One believes the honor belongs to General Nathaniel Lyon, a Union commander. General Lyon was killed in a Civil War battle at Wilson Creek on August 9, 1861. The second supports Captain Lyon, one of Nevada early pioneers, who was a member of the Sierra Guards during the Pyramid Indian Wars of 1860. Contemporary reference works include both name origins. At the same time the First Territorial Legislature designated Dayton as the County Seat.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dayton,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;was the first County seat and the County center of commerce for many years, was named after John Day, the surveyor who laid out the town. The original spelling of the town name was Daytown. Popular usage brought it to Dayton in 1861. Also previously known as,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chinatown, Mineral Rapids and Nevada City&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The original courthouse in Dayton, a classic structure typically Nevada burned in 1907.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 1911 the Nevada State Legislature designated&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; as the County seat, named after Henry Marvin Yerington of railroad and mining wealth. The original name was &lt;i&gt;Pizen Switch&lt;/i&gt; the name derived from poor whiskey which was sold in saloons built of willows and mud. Culture arrived and the name was changed to &lt;i&gt;Greenfield&lt;/i&gt; and later to Yerington. Yerington is one of Nevadas incorporated municipalities.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Several changes were made to the boundaries of the County over the years; however, one of the most important occurred in 1883 when a portion of Esmeralda County was annexed. This annexation to Lyon County included part of what is know as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mason Valley.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the early years of the County, mining was acknowledged as the economic mainstay.

On this Leg of the TS cache run we will take you to new heights and scenery. You will see The Mason Valley and the Walker river running through it. We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                         Lyon County History&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The First Territorial Legislature created&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lyon County&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on November 24, 1861. It was one of nine original counties. As to the origin of the County name, two stories exist. One believes the honor belongs to General Nathaniel Lyon, a Union commander. General Lyon was killed in a Civil War battle at Wilson Creek on August 9, 1861. The second supports Captain Lyon, one of Nevada early pioneers, who was a member of the Sierra Guards during the Pyramid Indian Wars of 1860. Contemporary reference works include both name origins. At the same time the First Territorial Legislature designated Dayton as the County Seat.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dayton,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;was the first County seat and the County center of commerce for many years, was named after John Day, the surveyor who laid out the town. The original spelling of the town name was Daytown. Popular usage brought it to Dayton in 1861. Also previously known as,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chinatown, Mineral Rapids and Nevada City&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The original courthouse in Dayton, a classic structure typically Nevada burned in 1907.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 1911 the Nevada State Legislature designated&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; as the County seat, named after Henry Marvin Yerington of railroad and mining wealth. The original name was &lt;i&gt;Pizen Switch&lt;/i&gt; the name derived from poor whiskey which was sold in saloons built of willows and mud. Culture arrived and the name was changed to &lt;i&gt;Greenfield&lt;/i&gt; and later to Yerington. Yerington is one of Nevadas incorporated municipalities.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Several changes were made to the boundaries of the County over the years; however, one of the most important occurred in 1883 when a portion of Esmeralda County was annexed. This annexation to Lyon County included part of what is know as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mason Valley.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the early years of the County, mining was acknowledged as the economic mainstay. Numerous communities were born as mining camps or as centers of transportation or provision supply. Of particular note in the development of numerous communities was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gold Canyon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, a site in western Lyon County. In 1849 gold was discovered in this canyon. During the 1850 miners worked up the canyon, and subsequently the Comstock Lode was discovered.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silver City&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, an existing community, was an important part of The Comstock. Mining continued playing a vital role in Lyon County well into the 20th Century.  During this decade several heap leach operations have occurred, primarily in the County western area.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anaconda extensive operation created a community, known as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Weed Heights&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;near&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and was a major positive economic factor for both the County and the state.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Referring to contemporary production, Nevada Statistical Abstract, 1988, &quot;Minerals Produced in Nevada by County in order of Monetary Value, 1985&quot;, reports that minerals extracted in Lyon County were cement, diatomite, stone (crushed and broken), gold, gypsum, and silver.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another key site vital to the development of not just Lyon County, but to western Nevada, was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The fort was Nevada first, largest, and most important military post. The warring Paiutes’ raids on emigrant route stations, together with their causing trouble for travelers and interrupting mail service, caused the Federal Government to order the fort construction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;By the end of 1861 some 600 men were stationed at Fort Churchill. When regular troops were sent to the Civil War, volunteers from California manned the fort. The settling of the Indian troubles and the completion of the Central Pacific which decreased travel on the central Overland Trail demonstrated the fort was no longer needed. In September, 1869, Fort Churchill was abandoned.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is now a State Park and is one of Nevada National Historic Landmarks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The importance of early buildings and sites in Lyon County can be found through Nevada Historical Marker program. Fifteen sites or buildings within Lyon County have been marked.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The original courthouse in Dayton, a classic structure typically Nevada burned in 1907.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 1911 the Nevada State Legislature designated&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; as the County seat, named after Henry Marvin Yerington of railroad and mining wealth. The original name was &lt;i&gt;Pizen Switch&lt;/i&gt; the name derived from poor whiskey which was sold in saloons built of willows and mud. Culture arrived and the name was changed to &lt;i&gt;Greenfield&lt;/i&gt; and later to Yerington. Yerington is one of Nevadas incorporated municipalities.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Several changes were made to the boundaries of the County over the years; however, one of the most important occurred in 1883 when a portion of Esmeralda County was annexed. This annexation to Lyon County included part of what is know as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mason Valley.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the early years of the County, mining was acknowledged as the economic mainstay. Numerous communities were born as mining camps or as centers of transportation or provision supply. Of particular note in the development of numerous communities was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gold Canyon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, a site in western Lyon County. In 1849 gold was discovered in this canyon. During the 1850 miners worked up the canyon, and subsequently the Comstock Lode was discovered.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silver City&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, an existing community, was an important part of The Comstock. Mining continued playing a vital role in Lyon County well into the 20th Century.  During this decade several heap leach operations have occurred, primarily in the County western area.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anaconda extensive operation created a community, known as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Weed Heights&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;near&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and was a major positive economic factor for both the County and the state.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Referring to contemporary production, Nevada Statistical Abstract, 1988, &quot;Minerals Produced in Nevada by County in order of Monetary Value, 1985&quot;, reports that minerals extracted in Lyon County were cement, diatomite, stone (crushed and broken), gold, gypsum, and silver.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another key site vital to the development of not just Lyon County, but to western Nevada, was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The fort was Nevada first, largest, and most important military post. The warring Paiutes’ raids on emigrant route stations, together with their causing trouble for travelers and interrupting mail service, caused the Federal Government to order the fort construction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;By the end of 1861 some 600 men were stationed at Fort Churchill. When regular troops were sent to the Civil War, volunteers from California manned the fort. The settling of the Indian troubles and the completion of the Central Pacific which decreased travel on the central Overland Trail demonstrated the fort was no longer needed. In September, 1869, Fort Churchill was abandoned.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is now a State Park and is one of Nevada National Historic Landmarks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The importance of early buildings and sites in Lyon County can be found through Nevada Historical Marker program. Fifteen sites or buildings within Lyon County have been marked.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
The First Territorial Legislature created&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lyon County&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on November 24, 1861. It was one of nine original counties. As to the origin of the County name, two stories exist. One believes the honor belongs to General Nathaniel Lyon, a Union commander. General Lyon was killed in a Civil War battle at Wilson Creek on August 9, 1861. The second supports Captain Lyon, one of Nevada early pioneers, who was a member of the Sierra Guards during the Pyramid Indian Wars of 1860. Contemporary reference works include both name origins. At the same time the First Territorial Legislature designated Dayton as the County Seat.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dayton,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;was the first County seat and the County center of commerce for many years, was named after John Day, the surveyor who laid out the town. The original spelling of the town name was Daytown. Popular usage brought it to Dayton in 1861.

On this Leg of the TS cache run we will take you to new heights and scenery. You will see The Mason Valley and the Walker river running through it. We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                         Lyon County History&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The First Territorial Legislature created&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lyon County&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on November 24, 1861. It was one of nine original counties. As to the origin of the County name, two stories exist. One believes the honor belongs to General Nathaniel Lyon, a Union commander. General Lyon was killed in a Civil War battle at Wilson Creek on August 9, 1861. The second supports Captain Lyon, one of Nevada early pioneers, who was a member of the Sierra Guards during the Pyramid Indian Wars of 1860. Contemporary reference works include both name origins. At the same time the First Territorial Legislature designated Dayton as the County Seat.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dayton,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;was the first County seat and the County center of commerce for many years, was named after John Day, the surveyor who laid out the town. The original spelling of the town name was Daytown. Popular usage brought it to Dayton in 1861. Also previously known as,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chinatown, Mineral Rapids and Nevada City&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The original courthouse in Dayton, a classic structure typically Nevada burned in 1907.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 1911 the Nevada State Legislature designated&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; as the County seat, named after Henry Marvin Yerington of railroad and mining wealth. The original name was &lt;i&gt;Pizen Switch&lt;/i&gt; the name derived from poor whiskey which was sold in saloons built of willows and mud. Culture arrived and the name was changed to &lt;i&gt;Greenfield&lt;/i&gt; and later to Yerington. Yerington is one of Nevadas incorporated municipalities.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Several changes were made to the boundaries of the County over the years; however, one of the most important occurred in 1883 when a portion of Esmeralda County was annexed. This annexation to Lyon County included part of what is know as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mason Valley.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the early years of the County, mining was acknowledged as the economic mainstay. Numerous communities were born as mining camps or as centers of transportation or provision supply. Of particular note in the development of numerous communities was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gold Canyon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, a site in western Lyon County. In 1849 gold was discovered in this canyon. During the 1850 miners worked up the canyon, and subsequently the Comstock Lode was discovered.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silver City&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, an existing community, was an important part of The Comstock. Mining continued playing a vital role in Lyon County well into the 20th Century.  During this decade several heap leach operations have occurred, primarily in the County western area.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anaconda extensive operation created a community, known as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Weed Heights&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;near&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and was a major positive economic factor for both the County and the state.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Referring to contemporary production, Nevada Statistical Abstract, 1988, &quot;Minerals Produced in Nevada by County in order of Monetary Value, 1985&quot;, reports that minerals extracted in Lyon County were cement, diatomite, stone (crushed and broken), gold, gypsum, and silver.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another key site vital to the development of not just Lyon County, but to western Nevada, was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The fort was Nevada first, largest, and most important military post. The warring Paiutes’ raids on emigrant route stations, together with their causing trouble for travelers and interrupting mail service, caused the Federal Government to order the fort construction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;By the end of 1861 some 600 men were stationed at Fort Churchill. When regular troops were sent to the Civil War, volunteers from California manned the fort. The settling of the Indian troubles and the completion of the Central Pacific which decreased travel on the central Overland Trail demonstrated the fort was no longer needed. In September, 1869, Fort Churchill was abandoned.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is now a State Park and is one of Nevada National Historic Landmarks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The importance of early buildings and sites in Lyon County can be found through Nevada Historical Marker program. Fifteen sites or buildings within Lyon County have been marked.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

On this Leg of the TS cache run we will take you to new heights and scenery. You will see The Mason Valley and the Walker river running through it. We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Lyon County History&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The First Territorial Legislature created&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lyon County&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on November 24, 1861. It was one of nine original counties. As to the origin of the County name, two stories exist. One believes the honor belongs to General Nathaniel Lyon, a Union commander. General Lyon was killed in a Civil War battle at Wilson Creek on August 9, 1861. The second supports Captain Lyon, one of Nevada early pioneers, who was a member of the Sierra Guards during the Pyramid Indian Wars of 1860. Contemporary reference works include both name origins. At the same time the First Territorial Legislature designated Dayton as the County Seat.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dayton,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;was the first County seat and the County center of commerce for many years, was named after John Day, the surveyor who laid out the town. The original spelling of the town name was Daytown. Popular usage brought it to Dayton in 1861. Also previously known as,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chinatown, Mineral Rapids and Nevada City&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The original courthouse in Dayton, a classic structure typically Nevada burned in 1907.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 1911 the Nevada State Legislature designated&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; as the County seat, named after Henry Marvin Yerington of railroad and mining wealth. The original name was &lt;i&gt;Pizen Switch&lt;/i&gt; the name derived from poor whiskey which was sold in saloons built of willows and mud. Culture arrived and the name was changed to &lt;i&gt;Greenfield&lt;/i&gt; and later to Yerington. Yerington is one of Nevadas incorporated municipalities.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Several changes were made to the boundaries of the County over the years; however, one of the most important occurred in 1883 when a portion of Esmeralda County was annexed. This annexation to Lyon County included part of what is know as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mason Valley.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the early years of the County, mining was acknowledged as the economic mainstay. Numerous communities were born as mining camps or as centers of transportation or provision supply. Of particular note in the development of numerous communities was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gold Canyon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, a site in western Lyon County. In 1849 gold was discovered in this canyon. During the 1850 miners worked up the canyon, and subsequently the Comstock Lode was discovered.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silver City&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, an existing community, was an important part of The Comstock. Mining continued playing a vital role in Lyon County well into the 20th Century. During this decade several heap leach operations have occurred, primarily in the County western area.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anaconda extensive operation created a community, known as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Weed Heights&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;near&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and was a major positive economic factor for both the County and the state.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Referring to contemporary production, Nevada Statistical Abstract, 1988, &quot;Minerals Produced in Nevada by County in order of Monetary Value, 1985&quot;, reports that minerals extracted in Lyon County were cement, diatomite, stone (crushed and broken), gold, gypsum, and silver.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another key site vital to the development of not just Lyon County, but to western Nevada, was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The fort was Nevada first, largest, and most important military post. The warring Paiutes’ raids on emigrant route stations, together with their causing trouble for travelers and interrupting mail service, caused the Federal Government to order the fort construction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;By the end of 1861 some 600 men were stationed at Fort Churchill. When regular troops were sent to the Civil War, volunteers from California manned the fort. The settling of the Indian troubles and the completion of the Central Pacific which decreased travel on the central Overland Trail demonstrated the fort was no longer needed. In September, 1869, Fort Churchill was abandoned.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is now a State Park and is one of Nevada National Historic Landmarks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The importance of early buildings and sites in Lyon County can be found through Nevada Historical Marker program. Fifteen sites or buildings within Lyon County have been marked.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

On this Leg of the TS cache run we will take you to new heights and scenery. You will see The Mason Valley and the Walker river running through it. We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

Lyon County History&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The First Territorial Legislature created&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lyon County&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; on November 24, 1861. It was one of nine original counties. As to the origin of the County name, two stories exist. One believes the honor belongs to General Nathaniel Lyon, a Union commander. General Lyon was killed in a Civil War battle at Wilson Creek on August 9, 1861. The second supports Captain Lyon, one of Nevada early pioneers, who was a member of the Sierra Guards during the Pyramid Indian Wars of 1860. Contemporary reference works include both name origins. At the same time the First Territorial Legislature designated Dayton as the County Seat.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dayton,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;was the first County seat and the County center of commerce for many years, was named after John Day, the surveyor who laid out the town. The original spelling of the town name was Daytown. Popular usage brought it to Dayton in 1861. Also previously known as,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chinatown, Mineral Rapids and Nevada City&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The original courthouse in Dayton, a classic structure typically Nevada burned in 1907.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In 1911 the Nevada State Legislature designated&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; as the County seat, named after Henry Marvin Yerington of railroad and mining wealth. The original name was &lt;i&gt;Pizen Switch&lt;/i&gt; the name derived from poor whiskey which was sold in saloons built of willows and mud. Culture arrived and the name was changed to &lt;i&gt;Greenfield&lt;/i&gt; and later to Yerington. Yerington is one of Nevadas incorporated municipalities.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Several changes were made to the boundaries of the County over the years; however, one of the most important occurred in 1883 when a portion of Esmeralda County was annexed. This annexation to Lyon County included part of what is know as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mason Valley.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the early years of the County, mining was acknowledged as the economic mainstay. Numerous communities were born as mining camps or as centers of transportation or provision supply. Of particular note in the development of numerous communities was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gold Canyon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, a site in western Lyon County. In 1849 gold was discovered in this canyon. During the 1850 miners worked up the canyon, and subsequently the Comstock Lode was discovered.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silver City&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, an existing community, was an important part of The Comstock. Mining continued playing a vital role in Lyon County well into the 20th Century. During this decade several heap leach operations have occurred, primarily in the County western area.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anaconda extensive operation created a community, known as&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Weed Heights&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;near&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yerington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and was a major positive economic factor for both the County and the state.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Referring to contemporary production, Nevada Statistical Abstract, 1988, &quot;Minerals Produced in Nevada by County in order of Monetary Value, 1985&quot;, reports that minerals extracted in Lyon County were cement, diatomite, stone (crushed and broken), gold, gypsum, and silver.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another key site vital to the development of not just Lyon County, but to western Nevada, was&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. The fort was Nevada first, largest, and most important military post. The warring Paiutes’ raids on emigrant route stations, together with their causing trouble for travelers and interrupting mail service, caused the Federal Government to order the fort construction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;By the end of 1861 some 600 men were stationed at Fort Churchill. When regular troops were sent to the Civil War, volunteers from California manned the fort. The settling of the Indian troubles and the completion of the Central Pacific which decreased travel on the central Overland Trail demonstrated the fort was no longer needed. In September, 1869, Fort Churchill was abandoned.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fort Churchill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is now a State Park and is one of Nevada National Historic Landmarks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The importance of early buildings and sites in Lyon County can be found through Nevada Historical Marker program. Fifteen sites or buildings within Lyon County have been marked.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

On this Leg of the TS cache run we will take you to new heights and scenery. You will see The Mason Valley and the Walker river running through it. We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

On this Leg of the TS cache run we will take you to new heights and scenery. You will see The Mason Valley and the Walker river running through it. We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store.

Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

On this Leg of the TS cache run we will take you to new heights and scenery. You will see The Mason Valley and the Walker river running through it. We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance.

Poohntigger for there help and xtra containers. As always this will be a ongoing project so more and more will pop up over the weeks and months etc.&lt;br /&gt;

On this Leg of the TS cache run we will take you to new heights and scenery. You will see The Mason Valley and the Walker river running through it. We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

On this Leg of the TS cache run we will take you to new heights and scenery. You will see The Mason Valley and the Walker river running through it. We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

On this Leg of the TS cache run we will take you to new heights and scenery. You will see The Mason Valley and the Walker river running through it. We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;

On this Leg of the TS cache run we will take you to new heights and scenery. You will see The Mason Valley and the Walker river running through it. We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

On this Leg of the TS cache run we will take you to new heights and scenery. You will see The Mason Valley and the Walker river running through it. We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

On this Leg of the TS cache run we will take you to new heights and scenery. You will see The Mason Valley and the Walker river running through it. We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

On this Leg of the TS cache run we will take you to new heights and scenery. You will see The Mason Valley and the Walker river running through it. We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

On this Leg of the TS cache run we will take you to new heights and scenery. You will see The Mason Valley and the Walker river running through it. We will take you to and through several old mines sites. Some very spectacular views await you on this trip. We will run you through the old Regan Mine and you will see how they mined here. It was an open pit mine so no holes to fall in. As always beware this is the desert and bring plenty of Liquid. This road will be for everyone but we will put the terrain as a 2 because in parts will be sandy and some steep but not real steep. Just when you get use to one style of Cache we will change up on you. If you do not see the usual then it will be a change up cache. Put your super caching Glasses and hat on and have fun.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mason Valley History:&lt;/b&gt; During the year 1854, N. H. A. Mason with his brothers, who were driving cattle through to California, observed the value of the land for grazing purposes. Late in 1859, Mr. Mason returned and found that one William Dickson had, in October of that year, located in the Northern part of the valley. Mr. Dickson, no doubt being glad to see a white man, offered Mr. Mason half of his claim to remain with him. Mr. Dickson finally lost his property on account of being absent for some time. Mr. Mason, from whom the valley takes its name, located on what was known as the Mason ranch, now the property of Miller and Lux. In 1860, Mason built the first house here. It was 16x24 feet 8 feet high with sides of mud held in place by willows and roofed with tules. It was burned in 1866. Following Mason were the Wheeler brothers, who settled on what is now a part of the George Wilson ranch. Soon after them came Angus McLeod, Charles Sneider, and a man named Clement, also Charles D. Lane, Johnson, the Alcorn brothers and Jesse Woodcock. David Wilson, with his wife and four small children, came in the summer of 1863. Mrs. Wilson was the first white woman to remain in the valley. Mr. Wilson helped the Alcorn brothers cut hay with a scythe and put up the first of many haystacks built here. Mr. Wilson then bought Tom Wheeler's ranch and settled near his present home. For six months she lived without seeing the face of another white woman, and we may imagine her joy when Mrs. Sprague, with her husband and daughter Alice, moved in from Carson Valley. Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store.

Mrs. Wilson, who was of a retiring nature, said, &quot;When I heard there was a woman in the new tent I did not wait to be introduced, but just put on my bonnet and went to see her, and how we talked.&quot; Usually the Indians were friendly, but at one time, for some cause unknown, they put on their war-paint and executed a war-dance. Seven painted warriors camped opposite Mr. Wilson's house. He armed the six white men who lived with him, and they in turn stood guard several days and nights. All other white people in this valley fled to Fort Churchill, taking with them Mrs. Wilson's daughter, who was visiting the Sprague family. No shots were fired and the Indians peacefully withdrew to their camps. In the year 1864 the first white child, a son, was born to the wife of 952 THE HISTORY OF NEVADA Adam Herboldt, living near the Brady ranch. The weather was stormy and the wind whistled through their abode ; but the boy John grew to manhood. The discovery of gold by William Wilson in Pinegrove during 1866, materially increased the population of this country. As there was no established mail-route, Charles Sneider and Angus McLeod ran a four-horse stage from Pinegrove through Mason Valley to Virginia City, carrying letters by express. Mr. W. R. Lee in 1861 pre-empted 160 acres of land and built the first house in Yerington, which is at present occupied by Mrs. Barton. Soon after Mr. E. W. Bennett bought near and built a store. Mr. James Downey moved from Pinegrove, secured a large amount of land and built a saloon, thus forming a nucleus for the present town of Yerington. Before anyone settled there, the pioneer trading post was a small store located near the Rhymers ranch; but afterward moved to about a mile north of Yerington and called the Gieger store. Mail came from Wadsworth, Nevada, once a week to this place and it was known as the Mason Valley postoffice. About this time the first school was opened by Miss Mattie Wiley, who taught in the home of Alec McLeod, near the present town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

You will have 1.5 x 1.5's to 1.5 x 4.5 dufaculty. Some you will just find downright Funny and some you will scratch your head on. If you do not see the  type of Containers I used on CAS run then it will be something different. From Ammo Cans to  Homemade Bubble Gum machines - the Bubble Gum of course, I have tried to give you a Variety of Caches to make your trip pleasant and joyful.

There will be Two Blm  Gates so if they are closed please reclose them after going through.  All are hidden next to or close by the Roadway. I use the term loosely on Roadway at times . You will have 1.5 x 1.5's to 1.5 x 4.5 dufaculty. Some you will just find downright Funny and some you will scratch your head on. If you do not see the  type of Containers I used on CAS run then it will be something different. From Ammo Cans to  Homemade Bubble Gum machines - the Bubble Gum of course, I have tried to give you a Variety of Caches to make your trip pleasant and joyful. Thanks to Two Left Knees and to Poohntigger for the help in getting these out.  As always this will be a ongoing Project so more and more will pop up over the weeks and months to come. Have fun and Be safe.&lt;br /&gt;
This is the Desert so always bring extra Water and stay well watered.</groundspeak:long_description>

There will be Two Blm  Gates so if they are closed please reclose them after going through.  All are hidden next to or close by the Roadway. I use the term loosely on Roadway at times . You will have 1.5 x 1.5's to 1.5 x 4.5 dufaculty. Some you will just find downright Funny and some you will scratch your head on. If you do not see the  type of Containers I used on CAS run then it will be something different. From Ammo Cans to  Homemade Bubble Gum machines - the Bubble Gum of course, I have tried to give you a Variety of Caches to make your trip pleasant and joyful. Thanks to Two Left Knees and to Poohntigger for the help in getting these out.  As always this will be a ongoing Project so more and more will pop up over the weeks and months to come. Have fun and Be safe.&lt;br /&gt;
This is the Desert so always bring extra Water and stay well watered.</groundspeak:long_description>

Team Sagebrushers has Teamed with several members to bring you this Fantastic Series. Hence the TS in the series name. You will be looking for all different types of caches along this route. Most of the Route can be done with a two wheel car but  a few spots maybe  a bit bumpier then others, so enter at your own Risk. There will be Two Blm  Gates so if they are closed please reclose them after going through.  All are hidden next to or close by the Roadway. I use the term loosely on Roadway at times . You will have 1.5 x 1.5's to 1.5 x 4.5 dufaculty. Some you will just find downright Funny and some you will scratch your head on. If you do not see the  type of Containers I used on CAS run then it will be something different. From Ammo Cans to  Homemade Bubble Gum machines - the Bubble Gum of course, I have tried to give you a Variety of Caches to make your trip pleasant and joyful. Thanks to Two Left Knees and to Poohntigger for the help in getting these out.  As always this will be a ongoing Project so more and more will pop up over the weeks and months to come. Have fun and Be safe.&lt;br /&gt;

So if you find this Cache thanks for stopping by We are also placing two more Caches in Stan's Memory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first cache is a Hill that was dedicated in his name along a trail also bearing his name. The Cache is called Wilde Hills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Second cache is Stan's Favorite place, or close to it. We arrived in Late May to find the road was washed out. So we improvised. This cache is called Wilde Washout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks again for visiting.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE LISTED COORDINATES ARE
      BOGUS&lt;/b&gt;. To find the cache, you've got to turn your

&lt;p&gt; AND  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We're bringing a little of  TEXAS right here to Washington!
This is a two-stage Washington geocache working in tandem with a
two-stage Texas geocache. To find Stage 1, you must learn a few
things about our neighbors to the south. To find Stage 2, you must
partner with them online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;b&gt;STAGE
ONE&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 In order to find this cache, you need to answer the quiz
below about &lt;b&gt;Texas&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;The Quiz&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  What is the state capital?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  What is the state tree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  What is the state bird?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.  What is the state flower?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.  What is the state song?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.  What is the state fish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;The Coordinates&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
OK, now here's how you turn these answers into your Stage 1
coordinates: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;use the key below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Stage 1 latitude is &lt;b&gt;N 46°&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;04.&lt;/b&gt; (#
of letters answer 1)  (# of letters in answer 2+2)  (# of
letters in answer 3-2)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Stage 1 longitude is: &lt;b&gt;W 118°&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;18.&lt;/b&gt;
(# of letters in answer 4-8)  (# of letters in answer
5-9)  (# of letters in answer 6-5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Stage 1 cache is a redirector containing only one piece of
information- the longitude and latitude of Stage 2. Just one
problem: While the longitude is for the Washington second stage,
the latitude is for the second stage in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;b&gt;STAGE
TWO&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All right, Washington- now it's time to team up with your fellow
geocachers in the south. You're going to have to trade latitudes to
find Stage 2. Here's how you do it:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Take a look below for notes anyone in Texas may have posted to
this website requesting a partner to exchange latitudes with. If
you find someone, click on their user name to get to their profile
page, then email them via geocaching.com and arrange the trade
between yourselves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. If you fail to find any such notes, you can post one yourself on
our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OXZV34&quot;&gt;counterpart cache page in Texas&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully,
   someone in Texas who needs a Washington  partner will read
   your note and contact you via geocaching.com. You may have to
   wait a bit for this, of course.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3. If you've waited more than three weeks without finding a
partner, please contact the Texas cache owner, and she will give
you the second-stage latitude. (Of course, we could give you the
number ourselves, but that wouldn't be in keeping with the spirit
of this 'partner' geocache!)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;



&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT
NOTES&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please do not post premature &quot;found it!&quot; notes. If you post a
&quot;found it!&quot; note before completing Stage 2, your note will be
deleted (after fair warning, of course).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, please remove any partner-seeking notes you post on the
Washington cache page after you've found a partner. Otherwise,
you'll keep getting contacted, and folks up there will be
frustrated by the clutter of old notes. Whenever we find outdated
notes on these two cache pages, we will remove them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, please don't post any coordinates on either of these cache
pages. Posts that include coordinates will be deleted as soon as
they are discovered. The cache is a standard ammo can, stocked full
of all kinds of Texas goodies, sent directly from our caching
counterparts. In order to keep the cache fully loaded -- &lt;b&gt;please
try and bring Washington items to trade&lt;/b&gt;, so that we can keep
their cache loaded with just as much cool stuff from The Evergreen
State! There is a ziploc bag for placing your Washington items
into; please do not remove any items from that bag- only take the
(very cool) Texas items in trade.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please also take care to replace it (and its camo) exactly as you
found it, so that we can avoid detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Initial contents of the Washington
cache include:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;key chains, stickers,
postcards, playing cards, magnets, whistles, etc.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Initial contents of the Texas
cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;key chains, stickers,
postcards, magnets, etc.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Please give credit to the
idea behind the creation of this cache to TEXAS GAL, where ever she
may be, we miss you, darlin, and would love to have you back in
Texas soon!]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a very short multistage cache. (only 2 legs)&lt;br /&gt;
Easy to find, but that's not the point.
&lt;p&gt;So now you've found the cache location, how do you retrieve the
container/redirector???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time you don't need to bring any special equipment, you
have everything you need with you. Don't use brute force, or move
the cache container at all! It takes almost no effort once you have
the solution!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck! This cache idea is borrowed with permission from the
one and only Lignumaqua from Austin, TX!~ thanks Mike&lt;/p&gt;
Evangelista Torricelli ( pronunciation (help·info); October 15,
1608 – October 25, 1647) was an Italian physicist and
mathematician, best known for his invention of the barometer. After
Galileo's death on January 8, 1642, Grand Duke Ferdinando II de'
Medici asked him to succeed Galileo as the grand-ducal
mathematician and professor of mathematics in the University of
Pisa. In this role he solved some of the great mathematical
problems of the day, such as finding a cycloid's area and center of
gravity. He also designed and built a number of telescopes and
simple microscopes; several large lenses, engraved with his name,
are still preserved at Florence. In 1644, he famously wrote in a
letter: &quot;We live submerged at the bottom of an ocean of air.&quot;
Torricelli died in Florence a few days after having contracted
typhoid fever, and was buried in San Lorenzo. The asteroid 7437
Torricelli was named in his honor.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a 2 stage puzzle/multi-cache. You don't need any
special&lt;br /&gt;
equipment. DO NOT MOVE the cache in any way! The name is a
big&lt;br /&gt;
hint.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You need the following KEY to solve the coordinates:&lt;br /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A = 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = 8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D = 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E = 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F = 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G = 8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H = 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I = 0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;J = 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K =3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L = 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M = 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N = NORTH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O = 9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P = 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q = 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R = 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;S = 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T = 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U = 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V = 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W = WEST&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X = 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y = 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z - 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;br /&gt;
Our sense of touch profoundly affects how we view the world
and&lt;br /&gt;
other people, influencing thoughts and behavior, new research&lt;br /&gt;
indicates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators at Yale, Harvard, and the Massachusetts
Institute&lt;br /&gt;
of Technology report that textures, shapes, and weights can&lt;br /&gt;
influence judgments and decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, for example, say that:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
People sitting on hard, cushion-less chairs are less likely
to&lt;br /&gt;
compromise in price negotiations than people sitting on
softer&lt;br /&gt;
chairs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Interviewers holding a heavy clipboard are likely to think
job&lt;br /&gt;
applicants take their work more seriously than if the clipboard
is&lt;br /&gt;
less weighty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Note: Say Hi to Ginger and Jasmine while you are at the starting
coords. They are very friendly, but will bark!!&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Please place the pencil along side the cache tube in the hidey

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few photos of the bridge that was originally on this
site. Unfortunately, I have been unable to find any historical
information about it. It was replaced in 2000 with the concrete
span you see today. Although the new bridge is functionally
superior, it lacks the charm of the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a 2-quart Lock-n-Lock containing a variety of fun
items, the photos you see on this page, and the usual log book and
pencil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is not down by the river bed. There are a couple of
fairly obvious locations. Nothing tricky about this hide... It's
just enough so that non-cachers will not see it.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; While out caching, not long ago, as I drove east I happened to
notice a coyote running along the road south of me. He was in fine
shape for winter. I wondered if he wintered at some cafe where the
burgers were out-sized like the ones at Francisco’s many
years ago. At any rate Mr. Coyote looked like he had let his belt
out a notch or two. Odd, for a coyote to be anything but a skinny
rack of bones by midwinter, maybe the economy isn’t so bad
after all.
&lt;p&gt;On my return trip I hoped to get another look at my new friend,
but I wasn’t as lucky. It was getting late in the day and the
winter sun was fading westward quickly. My eyes were getting heavy
and I was glad it wasn’t too far home. Like my buddy Coyote
all I wanted was a cozy den to curl up in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you are out in the neighborhood keep an eye out for one
good looking coyote. Say hi if you see him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to take your scribe, one never knows when you might
need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a rock hard cache ( might not be gold but is still a cache ) found under the power lines overlooking the Goldpanner Campgrounds which is a great place for weekend or longer camping stays.There are trails to hike on and old farm machinery to see. It has a great little restaurant to eat at and a play area for the kids. All this is nestled in the Monashee Creek and Heckman Creek valleys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a small match container with log book only. There is no writing stick in the cache, but there is room for one. If someone has a small pencil with them and would like to leave it feel free. Coordinates were not easy to get because of the power lines. Standing at the cache you can look down on the old tractors and look up the valley that has Monashee creek at is bottom. Please don't stop on the highway, go park at the day park area or the restaurant. N50 11.516 W118 33.186. After this cache or before go check out the other cache in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A bit of history: The campgrounds is on the present site of what was known for over 100 years as the Upper Cherry Creek Placer Camp. From 1863 to 1885 the site probably yielded an ounce of gold per day for each of the 200 men who worked the pay dirt section of Heckman, Cherry and Monashee Creeks. Today, much of the gold is gone but new pay dirt exists with hundreds again searching for it.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK1TE35 - Restaurant parking&lt;br/&gt;N 50° 11.516 W 118° 33.186&lt;br/&gt;Or park in the day use parking lot.</groundspeak:long_description>
