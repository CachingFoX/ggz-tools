This cache was called Cougar Tracking, because of a locked gate, I had to move it.
Because of some kind of mix-up with the approver system, I couldn't get the move approved.
So I killed the Cougar Tracking cache and set this one up.
If you found Cougar Tracking, you can find this one too. The Cougar Tracking cache or this cache will suffice to find the Linkages cache.

This is one of 6 animal tracking caches that are placed (plus one more cache) on tracking.
Bear Tracking, Bobcat Tracking, Wolf Tracking, Jaguar Tracking, &amp; Coati Tracking.

You must sign the log to get credit for the find.

The cache is on State Trust Land.

Cars: Park at N31 43.620 - W111 05.744

High clearance vehicles park at: N31 43.687 – W111 05.560; which is about 210 feet from the cache.

The cache is at the base of a tree. Please hide completely.

Wildlife Linkages Program, run by Sky Island Alliance, looks for
routes Mountain Lions, Bobcats, Bears, Wolves, Jaguars, and Coatis
take when they go from one mountain range to another. The mountain
ranges are linked by the routes these animals take. The routes
(linkages) are found by looking for the animals' tracks in washes
between the mountain ranges. Read more at: Sky Island Alliance
http://www.skyislandalliance.org/wildlife.htm. 
- 
At Sky Island Alliance, we go out and identify animal tracks,
we don’t track the animal.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I came up with the idea for this container while browsing geocaching supplies on a popular consumer website.  A trip to Wally World and six quarts of Gatorade later, and here it is.  It's so easy to see, I had to find a place out in the middle of nowhere so it's not immediately muggled.  For this reason, the terrain could be difficult for some of you, and parking could be a challenge. Closest parking is on Lambert Lane, at West Lambert Park.  

Once you get within a hundred feet or so, I dare you NOT to find it, especially at night!

As always, watch out for critters, stickers, and be kind to the environment.

Congrats to mike9955 for his FTF!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There's just enough room for one more cache in this pretty little park.  Jigsaw is located on the grounds of West Lambert Lane Park, which is administered by the Town of Oro Valley.  Park at coordinates 32 23.772N, 111 00.234W.  The cache is only available during park hours, 6am to 10pm.

This cache is dedicated to the person I stole the idea from, namely Mama Cache, from Euless Texas.  I thought it was a clever concept, so I exported it to Tucson.

I really dislike puzzle caches.  I geocache to see new and beautiful areas or places of historical significance.  If I wanted to do puzzles, I'd stay at home and do crosswords or sudoku.  But I don't like doing those either!  I know there must be many others of you out there who are of the same feeling, so this puzzle cache is for you!

This is a two stage cache.  The first stage has a &quot;puzzle&quot; which you must solve in order to find the second and final stage.  Pretty easy, huh?  Stage one is a small plastic mason jar.  Stage 2 is a cammo'd pill bottle.

I hope you find this one &quot;puzzling!&quot;  FTF gets a 256mb SD memory card.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">No, this multi is not a marathon run, but it would be wise to wear your walking/running shoes, or pull out that dusty old bike and pump up the tires. The course can be as short as half a mile and as long as a mile and a half. It all takes place on streets and sidewalks, so it should be accessible to just about everybody. However, I rate it 3/2.5 because of it's length and the number of stages.

Who are the Hash House Harriers? Variously described as &quot;the lunatic fringe of running&quot; and &quot;the drinking club with a running problem,&quot; the Hash House Harriers are a worldwide group with some 350 chapters in the United States, including a couple right here in the Old Pueblo. The premise is simple -- one harrier (the hare) lays a trail of flour and chalk over a course he or she chooses. The other harriers (the hounds) try to follow that trail to the end where they enjoy munchies and chilled adult beverages UNDER THE SHADE OF A BIG TREE. Along the route there are “checkpoints” where the “true trail” could go in any one of several directions.” Separate trails are marked from each checkpoint, but only one is the “true trail” which continues to the end of the run. The other trails soon lead to a dead end and are marked as an “on back.” In this way, the fastest runners are slowed down looking for the true trail, allowing the slower runners to catch up. The typical hash is 3-5 miles over hill and dale, through suburbs, woods, malls, et al. The hash isn't a race - no prizes to the swift. Following the trail is the challenge, camaraderie and beverages are the rewards. For more information on the Hash House Harriers, visit www.harrier.net, or www.hashingtucson.com.

This hash run won't be nearly as arduous as a real one.  You can bike it or walk it in under an hour, and those who must drive can park and grab each stage except the last.  PLEASE OBEY ALL TRAFFIC SIGNS. Once you get to the first stage or “checkpoint,” you will find two sets of coordinates. One puts you on the “true trail” and is marked with a smiley face and the words &quot;on, on.&quot;  The other set will take you to a dead end, marked with the picture of a frog and the words &quot;on back.&quot; You gotta guess (or use your smarts) to find the true trail coordinates! The succeeding stages (checkpoints) work the same way, listing two sets of coordinates, with one “on back” each. It takes a lot of guessing and a little bit of strategy to find the real set of coordinates. I think after the second or third stage (checkpoint), you will know where you’re going! Once again, if you guess right on every checkpoint, you will walk/ride/crawl/hop a little more than half a mile. If you are wrong with each guess before you find the true trail, you will walk/ride/crawl/hop about a mile and a half.

Stage one container is a micro, stage 2 and 3 are in the “other” category. The final cache is a three inch round, three inch deep tupperware container.  First to find gets a couple of bucks to buy that well-deserved adult chilled beverage.

I just moved back to Tucson from DFW Texas, where I did a similar multi.  Most folks there seemed to enjoy it, but let me know what you think!

It was dusk when we found this.  For no good reason, we ended up racing out of this area.  My daughter ran full speed into the cattle fence.  She was laughing as hard as the rest of us.  She didn't even see it.  What a blast.  I wish the camcorder was running for that one.

Thank you.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the Snedigar Sports Complex, named after slain Chandler Police Officer, James Snedigar. Take a moment to lament his passing while driving through his namesake park. Your destination is the large historic water tower, with ample parking nearby. Most afternoons and evenings are dedicated to Chandler's Premiere Soccer Club, the Santan Legacy. The fields surrounding the &quot;Legacy Tower&quot; are all soccer practice fields. Weekends find these fields covered with soccer kids and their parents, so finding a Muggle-free time-slot might be difficult.

The log-only cache is hidden OUTSIDE the fenced enclosure, and there is no reason at all to try to scale the fence into the decrepit water tower zone. Bring a writing stick to log your find.

Bring your dog and take advantage of the large dog park located 200 feet from the water tower, to the east. No dogs are allowed on the soccer fields.

Here is some more history on the water tower, itself, copied from the Santan Essentials Website:

&quot;The Bogle Water Tower in Chandler dates back to the turn of the century. Jean Reynolds, public historian for the City of Chandler, explains that the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company developed the area just south of Basha Road around 1917 in what is now known as the Ocotillo area of Southern Chandler. They erected the water tower to supply the town's drinking water. Reynolds says that the red Bogle Tower serves as a landmark and brings back childhood memories to those who grew up in the area.

Not all memories are fond ones. In a documentary by the City of Chandler called “Roots of Ocotillo,” Chuck Nickell recalls a childhood tragedy. He grew up near the water tower and recounts how local boys did what boys do: climb. One fateful night around 1940, Nickell’s friend, Edward Scott, climbed up and his hand touched a nearby electrical wire, knocking him to the ground. His head hit the cement footing, killing him instantly.

As to how the tower got its name, Reynolds says that after the Great Depression, the Goodyear Company moved further west to what is now known as Goodyear. Their Chandler property became part of the Bogle family’s ranch, which is why the water tower now bears their name.&quot;

Additionally, fellow cacher AZCachemeister alerted me that the very tower is a BENCHMARK. It is designated as: OCOTILLO GOODYEAR AUX FIELD TK and is an elevated tank. Because its exact coordinates are known, other survey markers could be determined by using the top of the tower, which can be seen for miles, as one point in their triangulation measurements. Benchmark plate resides on one leg of the tower, visible from outside the protective fence.

So, be sure to log your find of the benchmark while visiting the Legacy Tower cache!!

Interested cachers might like to know that the tower has been planned for demolition by the City of Chandler due to its age and condition. The tower has become a hot topic and several &quot;Save the Tower&quot; groups have been formed to try to preserve this historic marker and Chandler landmark. It has been offered to the Santan Soccer Club if we would address the environmental concern of lead paint. Unfortunately, the club does not have that kind of money. While the decision to tear it down has been placed on hold due to field activity, it seems inevitable that this Chandler icon is doomed to fall.

I get to browse the isles of this store looking for new bits and pieces that can be assembled into something that can hide in plain sight. I find that this store, more than any other, has the bits and pieces that are needed to fuel my creativity. 

Plenty of parking. Open all night. The cache, that is, not the store.

Should have enough room for smallish trade items and coins.

Please replace the container with the same care I took in placing it the first time. I'll be able to check on this one frequently.

Also, PLEASE BE MINDFUL OF MUGGLE ACTIVITY. THIS IS A POPULAR PLACE FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO MOPE AND SMOKE. You may have to out-wait the mopes before you can hunt. I advise getting a burger or a pizza while you wait.

Anyway, in commemoration of the World Cup, I'm placing this cache in front of a great place to learn about the World Cup, and anything else related to soccer. If you should choose to go inside, tell them Clint sent you. :)

This is much less creative than my usual hides. Ought to be easy. However, the container is large enough for small trade items/coins.

First to find can have a practical gag gift. Enjoy.

Bring your own writing stick, and GO USA!!!

Locomotive #1673 is one of 105 of its type originally numbered 1615-1719 for the Southern Pacific Railroad. During operation on the Southern Pacific it logged over one million miles, primarily in freight service in the Southern Arizona region. In 1954, the engine was used in the filming of the movie Oklahoma. #1673 played a significant role in 1955 when the 75th anniversary of the arrival of the Southern Pacific Railroad in Arizona was celebrated in Tucson. Steaming into Tucson with a vintage coach, it was welcomed by then-Tucson Mayor Fred Emery and a crowd of 10,000 citizens. Congratulatory messages were read, including one from Archbishop Cicognani, apostolic delegate on behalf of Pope Pius XII. The locomotive was donated to the City of Tucson immediately following this event.</groundspeak:long_description>

Owner's know of the cache and are happy to have it in their building.  Coordinates will put you at the entrance and the cache is located 10-12 feet from the center of the lobby.  If you get stuck you can ask at the desk.  Take a moment to look around the facility, it is a great place where I lift weights 3 days a week and am usually the only one there.</groundspeak:long_description>

What can I say, I bought a bunch of magnets and a bunch of the required parts. So this one is similar to a couple of others I've placed. I'll start working on varying the type of container used. I want to avoid getting into everyone knowing what to look for because it is a Mac Hammer hide... :)

Club soccer in Arizona is simply an excuse to watch our children slow-roast on an open soccer pitch, while paying dearly for the privilege. :)

Should be a park and grab in Tumbleweed Park. Do yourself a favor and visit when it is not 115 stinking degrees out here. I don't sweat, I glow. But right now, I'm glowing like a pig!!!

**ADDENDUM (Added from the air-conditioned comfort of my office)**

I'd been watching this spot for a few nights, thinking that I liked the location. There are lots of signs, benches, shrubs, etc. to make the average cacher wonder just where it might be hiding. So, I'd scoped the location, but lacked a proper theme. If you've done my other caches, you may have noticed that I like to add an element of humor to my listings...(at least _I_ think I'm hilarious). :)  Anyway, trying to think of the theme and a name. All the while, sweat is just rolling off of me as we'd been at practice for about an hour and all I can think is that it is just hotter than hell. Well, there you have it! The site is a &quot;rest area&quot; for humans and dogs. Pit Stop in Hell. :)

I've lived in AZ for nearing 20 years. Yes. I know it is hot. Doesn't mean I have to love it.

I'm changing the dif rating to 1.5 after several experienced cachers have reviewed that it wasn't as easy as they expected.

Also, if you think the coordinates are off, get a Garmin. Magellans will put you 24 feet off the mark.

It is found regularly by members of Geocaching.com and was last found there just a few days ago. High-traffic areas are perfect for hiding caches. They just have to be hidden WELL. That usually involves not placing a &quot;Look Here&quot; sign on top of it. Look harder.</groundspeak:text>

Sounds like a sports bar. It isn't. Currently, its basically a construction site. However, I've found something that will still be on-site after construction is completed and I have officially become the first permanent resident of Park Place. You are welcome to visit my new home...

This is my first hide using this type of container. I've found one other like this in the region and loved it. Had to have one in my collection. Located in the under-development Park Place near Price Road and the 202.

The cache container is very small, so you will need to provide your own writing stick. No room for trade items.

Happy Hunting! And if think the coordinates are off, get a Garmin. Magellan's will put you 24 feet off the mark.

I've seen dragons. I've touched the dragon's stony heart.

Maybe you can too?

My dragon lives in a busy spot, but as the world passed him by, so do all of the cars, belching their own smoke and fire. My dragon does not like cars. He is most generous to those who walk.

Mind the cars. Pet the dragon. Touch his heart.

There is room in his heart for small trade items. Bring a pencil. Terrain rating is higher because there is NO close parking and you must urban hike a 1/2 mile round trip.

I loved this cache it was so much fun! The only bad thing about it is the parking and the lack of a sidewalk from the church to the area just before the cache. My group and I actually saw a vinegaroon! Ugh creepy looking bug! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelyphonida
Thankfully they aren't venomous though!

Either way this was a very cool cache and I will definitely be using this one as initiation for some of my &quot;muggle&quot; friends that are interested in geo-caching!</groundspeak:text>

This failed condominium and retail endeavor has been sitting like a junked '73 Dodge Dart on the front lawn of Chandler's best retail complex for over 4 years. Call it the first casualty of the downturn in the economy. Call it bad management on the part of property owners. Call it whatever you want, but get it off my lawn!!!!!  :)

This would be a perfect Cache In-Trash Out event, if you happen to own a Caterpillar D-10 bulldozer. 

Until someone ponies up the cache to either continue this project, or to tear it down, this will be the biggest eyesore in the City of Chandler.

Please take lots of pictures and post them here so others can appreciate the decrepitude that is left for all of us to enjoy on our daily commute!

And if you can believe it, this bankrupted hulk is still trying to sell you a condo!! Check it out at: http://www.elevationchandler.com/experience

You can experience the airy comforts of &quot;Elevation Chandler,&quot; the biggest eyesore in the City of Chandler. From your condo, you can see &quot;Mac Hammer's At Park Place&quot; and on a good day, you can even see &quot;The Bovine Bog&quot;. :)

You are looking for a standard Altoid tin. The cache is OUTSIDE the protective (and decrepit) fencing. Please do not take the magnet that holds in in place. It is NOT a trade item!!! Thank you.

Room for small trade items and coins. Please replace exactly where you found it. Shorter cachers might require a friend. Sorry, it was the safest place to put it.

Mac Hammer

P.S. - The &quot;no kid&quot; rating is because this cache lies along a busy mall entrance street. I wouldn't let my kids play here. Use your best judgment.

And if you think the coordinates are off, get a Garmin. Magellan's will put you 24 feet off the mark and probably kill you in the street. :)

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is my first hide in Desert Breeze Park. It is a micro with a log sheet. Bring your own writing stick to log your find. This is part of my soccer series, placing caches near the places my kids practice or play on weekends. Good luck and thanks for looking.

Cache container and location modified after the original cache was muggled. I think this location is much more interesting, and you should have lots of fun sorting out the GPS signal bounce!

This is a very muggle-happy environment. Please use appropriate precautions and don't interrupt any events in-progress.

Happy Hunting!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is our second cache, and is dedicated to the memory of my uncle, Dr. Bill Wayne.

When my wife and I were dating we got together with my uncle and he offered to take us to dinner at, &quot;A fancy restaurant near the water, &quot;Na’than’s By The Sea&quot;.&quot; I had to stifle a giggle as I knew exactly what he was referring to. My wife, who grew up in KY, had no clue.

In any event, if you grew up in the NY Metro area, you knew where “Na’than’s” had locales, the most famous of which is, of course, by the sea. Sharon dressed “for the occasion” and off we went. As we approached a barn-like structure, she looked at the two of us as though we had lost our minds. After parking, we entered the building which was filled with picnic tables and benches - not exactly a high quality establishment. We were at the location in Oceanside, NY (near the water, but not quite), and although my wife was taken aback by the trick we played on her, she thoroughly enjoyed the visit, the food, and Bill’s sense of humor.

So, after you find this log-only cache, go visit the nearby “Na’than’s” and enjoy their “Famous” cuisine. Please replace carefully and watch out for muggles.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Our first cache is dedicated to the memory of my father, Alvin Wayne. He would have loved geocaching.

We would often play Scrabble when he came over to our house. One time when he was picking letters, we noticed that he was feeling them in order to determine what he was taking out of the bag. I asked him what he was doing and admonished him not to do it again. He just smiled at me.

From that time forward, whenever anyone mimicked his actions, we would accuse that person of &quot;Alvinizing&quot; the letters. 

This cache is log-only. There is a park nearby, with a nice trail that will lead you in the general direction. Please replace it exactly as you found it.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>You're going to have to &quot;Alvinize&quot; this locale to find the cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I finally got this one placed! This will take you for a nice walk in the Sonoran Desert and give you great views of the amazing area five miles from our home. Stop, stay a while, and enjoy. The hotel is sparsely populated and there isn't anything for a FTF, but the views are worth the trip.

You can drive out to the general area if you have an SUV. The dirt road begins right near the eastern end of Jomax. Of course one can park there and walk. I gave it a 2.5 for terrain, although the hike or drive isn't bad, you just have to watch where you're going. Once in the vicinity, it's an easy find.

As always when in the desert take precautions. Carry water and look out for snakes and scorpions. Wildlife abounds out here, and while it may be hot in the summer, the desert has a special beauty for those willing to look around.</groundspeak:long_description>

144, maps say 149). You can park within 400 ft of the cache. Its
rated as a 2/2.5 since it is off trail, but we had 3 young campers
and two pregnant mums all survive the hike and give the cache a
&quot;test&quot; Find.

This cache is in honor of all the Mums out there. The cache was
hidden near a weekend campout. The campers were 5 families who all
met at a mums groups and have stayed good friends. There were 5
families, two pregnant mums, 8 kids and 3 dogs. The oldest of the
kids was 3. We had a great time and placed this cache at the end of
the trip. The cache contains items that any mum would recognize and
would be glad to leave in a cache...think McDonalds. The pencil
sharpener is not a trading item...its to keep the pencils sharp.

Heading towards Harding Pointthis is the last turn off before Harding point.  Once headed down the trail take the right at the first Y in the trail.

The view from the point at the end of this trail are unparalelled and it's secluded from most campers.

This cache was placed by Mitchell, Robbie and Jordan ages 10 on a recent camping trip. Enjoy.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>As you approach the trails end vista point - walk back along the left (east) edge. until you see the shelter rock and trail. The little shelter has an initial rock pile to climb over with a vertical rock at the back.  Cache underneth the smaller rocks at the base. </groundspeak:encoded_hints>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My first Opencache find!! and an FTF to boot.  The road in was closed, so I drove down to the vista overview, parked and hiked out to the cache.  My dog was wore out, lucky for me we diverted ourselves to Harding tank for some cool water. Its not were it was supposed to be.  My rechargeable batteries were shot when I got my GPSr today, so I stopped at a gas station to buy some regular batteries.  Turns out after only 30 min into my hike and 2 miles from the car my GPS was going to die on me.  I started to shut it down and conserve bat. power; this is too far to go and lose power just 500 ft from cache.  

Didn't get to play with the chip, since bat. power was insufficient.  Found the shelter and the cache in great shape.  Packed full of gooddies.  Best cache container and goodies i've found all year.  A great Opencaching experience.  Glad too, I left my pen at a near by cache since it had none.  I figured this one would have a writing tool, I figured right. 


Also saw two Black Bears on my way home. My first bear sighting while geocaching. Thats why I give this a 5.0 Awesomeness rating.
Thanks for the great cache!</groundspeak:text>

Vidal was a survey ship of the Royal Navy. An oceanographic&lt;br/&gt;survey vessel. Launched on 31 July 1951 and commissioned into&lt;br/&gt;service in 1954 to 1976. In common with most of the survey ships of&lt;br/&gt;the period, she was named after an influential surveyor or explorer&lt;br/&gt;of the Royal Navy, Alexander Thomas Emeric Vidal, who had surveyed&lt;br/&gt;much of the coast of Africa, and ranged into the Atlantic to survey&lt;br/&gt;the tiny islet of Rockall. So far she has been the only ship of the&lt;br/&gt;Navy to bear the name.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>I've all ready given too much info in my description on this. He was a Surveyor, its a survey ship.  Think like a surveyor!</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

So far the success of this project has gotten the city already thinking about a complex of water number 2. This city encourages outdoor recreation, and is slowly working on embracing this new sport/hobby/game called Geocaching. If caching, take the time to peak inside Flagstaff's newest investments in our town's health and fitness.

Maybe if you ask nicely they may offer you a free tour or mention you were caching in the area and thought you would stop by.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">On March 5, 2011, Several NAGs gathered in attempt to grow local Geocachers from seedlings. This is that story.

Several caches were hid around the CCC and Library build, mostly met as quick temporary examples for the newbies. Although this one remains and could possible be the first cache for some Flagstaff geocachers. 

Roughly twenty people attended the class ranging from the Elementary school age school children to the recently retired.  Some families and some older couples.  It was a great time, although my lecture did go a tad-bit over scheduled time-line.  Will refine and do again, soon.  Thanks to the East-side Flagstaff  Public Library for hosting. </groundspeak:long_description>

To find the cache park off the highway and walk towards the creek, staying east of it. If the gate is closed please don't block it. It appears that this spot sees the occasional angler so be mindful of them. The camp land manager has approved of the cache since it near the highway and is a good distance away from the camp.</groundspeak:long_description>

We were coming from the Secret Waterfall cache ( which we didn't find ) and placed this one on our way down to the grotto trail.

I lost my SPOT somewhere along the water path. Most likely in between here and Drenched. If you find it, it is yours. I have been putting off upgrading to a new unit for the past year.

On my honor, I will do my best
To do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law;
To help other people at all times;
To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight.

This is made as a home for travel bugs and coins that can be watched over a little. If there gets to be too many, I can pick them up and move them along easily, so if people try and grab them I will not loose many.
but I am not too worried about it vanishing.

This is a scout themed cache. I will put many patches and scout themed items inside, along with some other small trinkets now and then.

You do not have to leave the cement.

A couple of weeks ago, my daughter participated in a mini reenactment of the pioneer trek from Missouri to Utah. I was volunteered to help move equipment on their last day back into town. I thought it was pretty cool to see the hand carts when I drove up into the little valley that they were camped in. I hid a geocache nearby for all to enjoy.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Please be respectful of the environment and don't make new roads. I drove my truck and was able to park within 1/10th of a mile.</groundspeak:long_description>

We drove up here to watch the fireworks. From this location, we could see the stadium of fire, pleasant grove, thanksgiving point and all the cities in salt lake county. The view was great. We enjoyed just sitting and enjoyed the view with friends. </groundspeak:long_description>

I was on my way to find my 500th find when I placed this. It was a
great place to place a cache. I had never been up here before and
thought that the view was great. The coordinates will take you
right on top of the cache. &lt;br/&gt;

the cache is placed overlooking Utah Lake and the cities of Lehi,

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
There is the main cave, but then there is a smaller cave on
top where the cache is actually hidden. Maybe it would be considered a hole in the side of a rock, not really a cave. The hike going up sucked for an old man like me. Coming down wasn't bad, but my legs felt like jelly. Overall, it was fun. We saw a couple of lizards and one tarantula on our way up. TJ thought it was the coolest thing. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A cache placed during an ATV Rescue!
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
On August 31, 2006 a local teenager took his mother's new ATV for a ride. We're still not clear on the details, but something went wrong. Twelve stitches later the teenager is doing okay. The ATV - we'll that is another story.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
On Labor Day, September 4, 2006, six neighbors mounted a rescue attempt for the ATV. We drove our cars as close as we could. We then hiked and drove ATV's as close as they would could get. The last 100 feet or so was all on foot. The cache is placed where we found the ATV. With one missing front wheel and two flat rear wheels we dragged the ATV to where we parked the ATV's. We then attached a tow rope and dragged the broken ATV back to the waiting trucks.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In memory of this most noble event we placed a cache at the very spot where the ATV was found. When you find the cache try to imagine how someone got their ATV in this spot and imagine what it took to get a broken ATV with one front wheel and two flat back wheels down to the dirt road below.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
You can park about 1000 feet away from the cache. From the road there is about a 285 foot gain in elevation. Cache should be an easy find once you get to the spot. Enjoy the view and if you find any more pieces of a red ATV - go ahead and pick it up for us.</groundspeak:long_description>

the upper parking lot of Big Springs Hollow Park. The hike to this
cache is just over 1/2 a mile and is fairly easy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
**Update** This cache was meant to be
hiked from the trailhead, not the access road. The trailhead starts
at the far end of the parking lot. If you take the access road, you
may have to cross the stream to get the cache.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This cache is hidden near what looks like an old beaver dam. There
is a small trail that leads off from the main trail over to it. You
should not have to go bushwhacking or in the water to find this.
Because we placed this cache in October we made the container out
of a craft pumpkin of course. Please re-hide it well, as a bright
orange pumpkin does not hide in plain sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;N 40° 19.950 W 111° 31.488&lt;br/&gt;Parking and trailhead starts here.   </groundspeak:long_description>

I had fun with this one. I have recently bought a 4x4 vehicle and wanted to go somewhere my Honda Civic or Dodge Caravan couldn't go. It is an easy road if you have high clearance. I was to chicken to take the other road. You will see what I mean when you get there. If I had somebody with me in a separate vehicle, I probably would have taken it.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
All I can say, is have fun and drive safely.

I would say a high clearance vehicle is needed to make it to this one. I don't know why the road was actually created, because there isn't anything up here except for a really cool view.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
If no high clearance vehicle is available, I think the hike is well worth it.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In the plowed field below this cache is a place ripe with history. Outlaws have been killed here. Many are said to be buried at the bottom of the dry well. Some in the past have avoided the area because of evil spirits. Read on and get a little history lesson and bag a traditional cache at the same time.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The area that is about 700 feet North-North East of this cache was the location of Joe's Dugout. Sometimes called Dorton's Dogout Station.&lt;p&gt;

Around 1858 &lt;b&gt;Joseph Dorton&lt;/b&gt; asked Bishop Evans advice on establishing a station half-way between Camp Floyd and Lehi.  The advice he got was negative, but Dorton wanted out of being cooped up in the Lehi Fort and signed a contract for a station to be known as Seven Mile Station.  He began construction of a rock home, a large barn and corral, and a dugout for lodging travelers.  At the station Dorton also operated a small store.  He traded eggs, butter, pastries, beer, and liquor to Camp Floyd soldiers who daily travelled the Overland Road on military business.  The troopers exchanged clothing for food and liquid refreshments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Water for the station was hauled from the Jordan River and the murky, foul smelling stuff was sold for 25 cents per bucket.  Dorton contracted for a well to be dug. After digging a dry well over 250 feet, the idea was abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Dorton's dugout is &lt;b&gt;shrouded in mystery&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;superstition&lt;/b&gt;. One time &lt;b&gt;Porter Rockwell&lt;/b&gt; was driving a herd of wild mustangs through the area.  At &lt;b&gt;Dorton's Dugout&lt;/b&gt;, the horses all became sick and laid down.  Rockwell told his help to slit the end of the tail of every horse, soak a straw in the blood, and then combine the straws and burn them.  In so doing, all the animals completely and immediately recovered and they were on their way to market in Lehi and Salt Lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

At another time, &lt;b&gt;Porter Rockwell&lt;/b&gt; pursued an outlaw. He was told in Cedar Fort that the outlaw was headed towards Joe's Dugout.  Arriving, Porter knocked at the door and the door was opened by the outlaw who immediately pulled his six-shooter and fired directly at Rockwell, emptying the gun.  An observer said that he could see the fire from the exploding gun powder enter Rockwell's chest from one side and exit the other.  With an empty pistol and Rockwell still standing, the outlaw threw down his gun and started running up the hill to get away.  Porter Rockwell sauntered to his buckboard, took his rifle and fired one shot at the fleeing outlaw.  He dropped dead. Did the outlaw run up the hill where the cache is? Who knows! Maybe!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Many of Rockwell's dead outlaws are said to be at the bottom of Dorton's dry well.  Rockwell felt the area was inhabited by evil influences and witches' spirits.  He avoided coming this way if at all possible. Perhaps if you are lucky you'll get to see a ghost or two while doing this cache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

As for Dorton, he later abandoned his operation after the Pony Express and Stage Coaches quit running.  He returned to Lehi where he became well known as Butcher Dorton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The cache is located on the hill above the field. Please don't walk across the farmer's fields to get to the cache. You can park a short distance off the road and hike to the cache without disturbing the field. Or who knows...perhaps there is an outlaw ghost that doesn't want to be disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

My daughter recently used this bit of history as the base for a ghost story that she wrote for school. If you would like to read it, Click Here!!!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Be respectful to the property of others. This is right by a pathway to the Lehi Junior High. It might be a good idea to not hunt this cache in the morning or mid afternoon to avoid the school traffic.

I HATE MICROS!

In my attempt to help Lehi become a better place to geocache, I have placed another regular geocache for you to find. This should be an easy find. The name says it all.

For those of you who want to know where you can find ammo cans so that you can also place decent caches in Lehi, I got mine at Smith and Edwards on my way to Bear Lake. We need more regular sized caches in Lehi.

Cache On!</groundspeak:long_description>

I HATE MICROS!
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
For those of you who are like me, you will appreciate a regular ammo can in the middle of town. It's about time! I was thinking to myself that when it comes to geocaching, Lehi is boring. So, here is my effort to spice things up a bit.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
And, for those of you who are wondering where they can get their hands on a good sized ammo can, I got mine from Smith and Edwards on a family outing to Bear Lake. Take a hint guys and start placing some cool caches in Lehi! No Micros Please!

Timpanogos trail head, in the Timpooneke campground.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We placed this cache here for Jesse, my little 2 year old nephew,
whom we lovingly refer to as &quot;Jesse Bear.&quot; He even (unknowingly)
donated some of his favorite toys for the cache!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is placed in a large plastic bear shaped container that
we painted brown. To reach it, head up a small trail at the east
end of the parking lot. GPS signal is not the greatest here but
shouldn't take too long to find. Check the hint if you need help.
Please cover it back up so the cache stays hidden.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Look for a fallen tree with black burn marks on it. Cache is hidden inside the stump of the fallen burned tree. Cache will be loosely covered with bark to conceal it.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

This is a trail head that can lead to Forest Lake and can be used to find the geocache Forest Lake Overlook if you were adventurous. From here to Forest Lake is 6.5 miles give or take. Personally, I would start at forest lake and work my way towards here. It was a fun hike when we made it. It took us 4 hours to hike from Forest Lake to here. </groundspeak:long_description>

Trail is well traveled, however, It is Rocky at points with a fairly good elevation change at times. Should be hiked from trail head to cache within 1-2 hrs round trip. Scenery is beautiful. Hike further up trail past cache for an extra scenic reward.

I figured that I should get a good, hard puzzle out there for you to try and solve. This one is fairly easy if you have the right knowledge, and some tools. Good luck.

RkU2oRUBITAhITAhLSExMiHS9BghNDUhY0fWWotY8DG+i2Yt3jgggV+Qe05NGr143v4rPy397nLg 8406fpJyvSE0NSEFxDt2LeJnzT4B16Jo4qMhMTMhffvXoq0t81mqHi/WS30aXOGpFQ==

After MANY requests for hints, and a few frustrated cachers at an event, I'm giving out hints, BUT... You must do these things to get the hint. I want to make sure that you've actually tried the puzzle:
1. Try it. Use the hints. Use your brain.
2. Brainstorm with other cachers. See if there's something you missed. Have lunch, have fun with it.
3. E-mail me with all the ways that you have tried to solve it. (Be specific when you e-mail me!)
4. If it looks like you've actually spent time on the cache, I'll give you a hint or two to point you in the right direction.
5. If you STILL can't figure it out, we can meet for lunch or something.

I meant for it to be hard, but it seems like I've got a real stumper here! I DO want you to be able to solve it, but I want to make you think, too. Enjoy!

need to bring something to write with. Tweezers may be
needed.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I get so worked up looking for these tiny micro caches I decided to
place one of my own. I want to share the excitement of finding a
cache this small.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This area is busy during day time hours. The best time to look for
this cache is during &quot;non-business&quot; hours, or on the weekend. You
will be able to get to the cache at ground level. Please be as
stealthy as you can.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Satellite reception is weak near the cache, but this should just
add to the challenge. I took the reading three different times with
two different receivers, and I was not able to get closer than 50
feet accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When you are finished with the cache, please place it back exactly
where you found it. Good Luck.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Let's see how good your GPS really is. I had a hard time with my 60CSx getting accurate coordinates because the building was blocking my satellites. Should be good enough to get you here though.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is hidden right outside our office window, so feel free to wave. Don't worry, we all look like idiots looking for these things.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
UPDATED--January 25, 2010
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
While sitting in our office today, we saw a guy in a red coat run up to the cache, take the cache and run away. We were unable to see where he went. By the time we got out to the parking structure, he was gone. I wonder what he would find in there anyway. Who knows? So, until I get a new geocache placed, this will be disabled. I have to much fun watching people come and find it, so I will definitely have a new one placed soon.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
UPDATED: March 1, 2010
The cache has now been replaced. It is tethered to make it more difficult to walk away with. Please be nice to the vegetation when looking for this cache.

Excellent placment &amp; glad to see it was cabled in place.
I liked the fact that it had the big GEOCACHE sticker on the side.
Wow filled with all kinds of stuff (nice)
I could not find a pen or pencil to log my visit - guess I should carry one. 
It was Fun! I look forward to more of these.
All inside was clean and dry
I took nothing &amp; left nothing again 1st time did not know what to exspect.

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The container is a large magnetic key holder. This should give you
something to do instead of walking around window shopping. I did
have a little trouble with signal bounce, but, I think I got the
coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please use stealth when getting the cache. You may have to use some
techniques like tying your shoe, or my favorite &quot;Ooops I dropped
something&quot; to grab the cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Caching while shopping, it doesn't get any better than that. </groundspeak:long_description>

Then while the wife and daughter went off shopping I decided it was a good time to find a couple of caches.  I finally figured out a good place to start looking and as I was looking up from below, I see a group that looked as if they were looking for the same thing from above, that included Beans n bears &amp; loookin4u.  It was just a little to dark to find from below.  So I made my way up to the cache level.  Sure enough, they were also looking for the cache.  I love meeting other cachers.  Found cache about  8:55 PM.----------------Team GoldfinchMason, MI</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I work real close to where the cache is hid, so I checked it 8/27 early AM after getting an email from the Desert_Trailblazers. I did reply to email the Desert_Trailblazers sent giving them an additional hint, I guess they didn't get the email before they had to leave.

The Mauled cache is not a real sneaky hide just well cammo'd.

Good Luck and may the Geo-Sense be with you.</groundspeak:text>

Smith and deeded to Davis County on April 6, 1934 by David F. and Effie P. Smith. The remaining 1.14 acres were purchased on March 17, 1954 by Centerville City... ...May this park always mirror the efforts of the early founders and those who developed it, to them this park stands as a monument to our appreciation.

Rushing water eroded the earth beneath the street and the road sank far enough in some places to make driving vehicles out of the sink holes an impossibility. 


The cache is placed in a drainage basin designed to mitigate high water flow.  Barnard Street is now concrete and is designed to act (if necessary) as an above grade river with a large drainage grate placed at the bottom of the street to channel water flow under Main Street and prevent traffic problems and the spread of flooding.  The grounds at Jennie P. Stewart Elementary are designed to be an enormous catch basin. </groundspeak:long_description>

I made them mad after I kicked the large rock that was in front of the nest. They began to swarm, so I got the heck outta there. I will be back to look again, hopefully the wasps will be in a better mood [;)]

hundred feet of the hike are on a less packed and traveled path and
therefore is a more difficult hike than the previous 95%.

within 20 feet of the cache.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
I found this area while driving up to East Canyon and I was
surprised it didn't have a cache.&lt;br/&gt;
There is a monument that gives details about three pioneer trails
that came through the Henefer area.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Mormon Pioneer Trail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Pony Express Trail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The California Trail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Take some time and read about each trail, there is pretty
interesting information about each trail.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This is a log only cache so bring something to write with. I left a
small pencil in the cache but I'm not sure how long that will
last.&lt;br/&gt;
As always please watch for muggles while getting the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

FYI: To get here from the west get off the freeway at Echo. From the east you can exit the freeway right on to the bridge.

I was working with the Maintenance of Way section boys, dumping ballast on the Evanston Subdivision the other day. We stopped for a minute here at the bridge at MP941 (941 rail miles to Omaha) and I hoofed it up to the road to drop a micro. Echo Canyon is really a cool canyon so enjoy the scenery. It should be easy enough to find, but the coordinates may be off because I didn't get a waypoint marked in my GPS and had to use Google earth and bombsite the spot. Good luck and in your log please include how many trains you saw while driving out there.</groundspeak:long_description>

&quot;Numismatist&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
Park at the mouth of Hobbs canyon and take the firebrake road
heading South. You will have to cross a small stream at the
beginning of the walk. Please be careful, the stream will be
running fast during the spring runoff.&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Besides Geocaching I also collect U.S. Coins. Over the years I have
collected quite a few of the &quot;Wheat Back&quot; (Wheaties) pennies and
now I want to share them.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 This cache is a great place to come and trade your un-needed
&quot;Wheaties&quot; for those that you need.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Just a couple of rules - trade only &quot;Wheat Back&quot; pennies and if you
take a penny then leave a penny, if you take two pennies, then
leave two pennies, and so on. I plan to check back from time to
time and update the pennies as needed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There will also be other trade items available if you do not have
any &quot;Wheaties&quot; with you when you find the cache.&lt;br/&gt;
I have placed the pennies in a Decon container to keep them
separated from the other items. When You are finished with your
trade please place the Decon container back in the ammo box. &lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;
 The cache started off with 25 copper &quot;Wheaties&quot; and 3 WW II
&quot;Steel&quot; pennies. The condition, dates and mints of the pennies are
mixed.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please be aware of folks coming and going along the firebrake road
and please hide the cache as good as, or better than you found it.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache is not at posted coordinates, but they are very useful in finding this cache. This is the 3rd part of a series of puzzle caches I have placed. This Puzzle is a multi cache also. The others in this series are 350M2X, 450M2X, and 105M2X.

No special tools other than your GPSR and your Geo-senses are required to find this geocache. But Google Earth and GSAK will help you a lot.

Instructions: Go for a walk on the Kays Creek Parkway, a public walking path owned by Layton City. Look for the &quot;Clue&quot; (stage 1). If you know how to do this series then you will save yourself a lot of time searching. When you find the clue, you will have some idea where to start looking for the cache (stage 2). Simple enough, right?

No special tools other than your GPSR and your Geo-senses are required to find this geocache. But Google Earth and GSAK will help you a lot. This cache page gives you everything that you need.

This geocache is a camouflaged coffee container.

If you start from the bottom of the Parkway, the trail heads east from Hidden Hollow Dr. The first fork in the trail is just a split that takes you on a lower trail or an upper trail for about 250 meters and then joins back into one. After another 500 or so meters you come to a parking lot where you might want to park your car. Continue eastward about 450 meters and you come to a fork in the path. The right fork in the trail takes you up along the south side of the Dam and up to 2750 North St, The left fork is very steep and takes you around the north side of the Hobbs Reservoir Dam and splits again with another trailhead up and to the left (Canyon View Dr.). If you continue eastward (stay right) along the north shore of Hobbs Reservoir, you will find a picnic table and a small bridge that crosses over Kays Creek, which feeds into the reservoir. If you keep going, the path winds around to the south and eventually dead ends.

This is Cougar Country! Please be safe and aware. Please read posted signs at the trail heads.


NOTE: This one could be the hardest to find in this series that I have placed yet. The terrain during your search for the clue, while paved, is steep in many areas and is about a 2 or 2.5. The cache is hidden in terrain 3 or 3.5. Plus the cougars make it a 4 for sure. Finding the other caches in this series will get your mind in the right place to look for this one. No other hints until after 1st and 2nd to find or 60 days with out a find.

&lt;br/&gt;
Park at the mouth of Hobbs canyon and take the firebrake road&lt;br/&gt;
heading South. You will have to cross a small stream at the&lt;br/&gt;
beginning of the walk. Please be careful, the stream will be&lt;br/&gt;
running fast during the spring runoff.&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The theme of this cache is key chains. I have loaded a small ammo
can with all sorts of key chains. This is a continuation of the
&quot;Key Chain Madness&quot; cache I had years ago. For this cache I
increased the size of the cache and added a bunch more key chains.
The cache is just off the firebrake road. Please be aware of folks
coming and going along the firebrake road and please hide the cache
as good as, or better than you found it.&lt;br/&gt;

Do not try this unless you are a good climber!
Many loose rocks.
Wear your play clothes and good shoes.
We did not use ropes to get it placed (but maybe we should have).
That being said this one is totally doable.

Trophy for FTF and geocoin and swag to trade.
Trade items for something somebody else would like to find.
Lets keep this one worth the trip up there. Replace exactly as you find it.
Post a note for me if cache needs maintenance.
Not a good idea in snow or at night.

Remember my payment for placing this cache is your log entry so please write something more than TFTCSL.

not recommended at night 
hike between 1km- 5km

The cache had been slightly compromised due to wind so we could only see it from above (we fixed it before leaving) but I thought it was great! Took turns climbing and descending so we wouldn't be pummeled by falling rocks. Wear good shoes!! Thanks for the fun cache!

While hiking up we had to keep dodging rocks that Mocha was knocking down. We finally got Mocha to stay down by us so we didn't have to dodge so much. About 1/2 way up I spotted the cache and thought WTF!!! I did mean FISH  We finally made it to GZ and signed the log and took the FTF trophy and coin. What a View of the river running high from up here. We did go back down the way we came up except I think I was on my feet a lot less on the way down!!  Thanks for the hike and the cache

Yes I did read the cache page &quot;Before&quot; we started out on this adventure and let me say right off the bat this is not for the Acrophobia. 90% of the time this doesn't not bother me, but between me slipping and sliding and trying to hang on to loose boulders all the while dodging the rocks that Mocha was knocking down just about scared me to death. Finally Del2u went one way with Mocha and I went the other way. I found it easier to climb in and over brush and trees and the larger boulders. Oh but I had to be careful on which limb to grab because some of them were not attached to a tree. Finally got within 45 feet and I glanced up and I remember saying WTF??? and the word fish was not one of the words I stood right below the cache and held onto the only small tree around. I couldn't see Del2u but all of a sudden Mocha poked her head above the cache. Dang I wish I had the camera that would of been a good picture, but I was still hanging on to the tree. Finally I seen Del2u at the cache site and I decided to stay put and carefully take my camera out of my backpack to take some pictures. Oh my gosh we were so high up and it was starting to bother me. I'm not sure why this height bothered me because I have on a few hikes that was worse than this. Got my composure and started to think how the ???? are we going to get back down. Humm on my butt of course. . It was a long hike back down to the road because you have to be very careful which rock/boulder to step on because they are not stabled. Halfway down I'm asking myself WTF??? was railrader921 doing up here and then I'm cussing myself WTF??? am I doing up here! OH YEA TO GET A FTF AND DO A LITTLE FISHING Thanks for exciting hike, Mocha loved it because she thinks she is part mountain goat.

This is the second in a series of puzzle caches. The first is called 350M2X. This one will be solved in the same manner as the first one. 

You are eventually looking for a camouflage coffee container.

Instructions: Go to the posted coordinates and look for a clue. The clue IS visible at this location. When you find the clue, the cache will be within about twenty feet of the clue. Simple enough, right?

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>No special tools are required to find this cache but a certain tool will come in very very handy. If you log a DNF contact me and I will let you know what that tool is. Here is a puzzle you can solve that will give you a hint as to where to start looking.

You are eventually looking for a decon container.

It's a silver bison tube close to the trail. Because of the terrain the accuracy on my GPS only got down to +/- 40 ft. Heading uphill, the cache GZ is on the left as the trail does a little curve. The terrain rating is due to the hike or it would be a 1.5/1.5.</groundspeak:long_description>

Remember: My payment for hiding this cache is your log entry so please write more than TFTCSL. I love the stories! If you solved the hint to help you find the cache let me know, as well.

Hey guys, here is my first puzzle cache and I hope you enjoy
figuring it out. At the request of friends I have made it a
railroad theme. All the answers can be found by researching the
internet, but if you have a friend that works for the UPRR they
will know all the answers for sure. Put the answers in alphabetical
order and use the corresponding numbers for the decimal degrees for
the hide, first north then west. Here we go! 
1. A rock slide in the canyon has caused four eastbound trains to be yarded and tied down at Ogden. Once the rock slide has been cleared which train symbol
will be called out to depart first? 

A. KOAMN (2) B. ZLTG2 (7) C.GSLFOX (3) D. MRVNP (6) 

2. What is the freight train speed associated with a passing a flashing yellow signal?  

A. THIRTY MPH(4) B. FORTY FIVE MPH (0) C. SIXTY MPH (2) D. FORTY MPH (6) 3. 

A freight rail car with an open top and side walls that is used for
hauling bulk materials such as scrap steel, rebar, steel plates or
coils, or bulky items such as rail panels is called a: 

A. GONDOLA(3) B. WELL (1) C. HOPPER (5) D. FLAT (8) 
4. If a trainman lays off sick for work his position for that day will be protected
by someone on the: 

A. RELIEF CREW (4) B. SENIORITY POOL (1) C.EXTRA BOARD (0) D. TURN ROSTER (8) 

5. A &quot;foamer&quot; is another name for what? 

A. STEAM LOCOMOTIVE (6) B. RAILROAD POLICEMAN (2) C.
LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEER (7) D. RAILFAN (8) 

6. In &quot;CTC&quot; territory, the “T” stands for what? 

A. TRAIN (3) B.TRAFFIC (5) C. TOTAL (1) D. TERMINAL (9) 

Because of work done and muggling in the area the cache is now a 35mm size container. Watch for non-believers. This is in downtown Ogden so best not to go alone at night. You can park within feet of this cache. When you find the cache, notice the beautiful houses in the area where it is located.

This street has some has some historical significance relating to Ogden railroad history, as well. I picked this location because of the old trolley rails running down the street. If you are interested, you can find more info on this area at the following links:

I knew that I wanted to go back-country caching this morning. So when I called MarshallOD and asked him if he and My Dal Leo wanted to go, he offered this trail as an option. I agreed and we set off on a grand adventure that started at the trail-head near the Pineview Dam and ended seven and a half hours and seven and a half miles later in Liberty, at my friend Bob's house, next to Wolf Creek Ski Resort. 

I placed my cache at the spot I thought we would turn around, but we kept going. Then he dropped a decon off and I thought for sure we would turn back.

But, I had this idea in my head. 

&quot;My good friend Bob lives just over the next hill down by the Wolf Mountain Ski resort and we should pay him a visit&quot; I said.

&quot;Is there a trail heading down that way?&quot; said Joe.

&quot;I think so and it can't be that far can it?&quot; I said.

&quot;It looks kind of rough,&quot; said Joe

&quot;The GPS will show us the way, right?&quot; said Leo.

&quot;Right, but I don't know about this&quot; said Joe

&quot;I can make it!&quot; said Leo.

&quot;Well Bob has a beer waiting for us&quot; I said.

&quot;Well OK then&quot; said Joe.

Well, There was no trail that way and two hours of bushwhacking our way down the mountainside through the most dense Bush I have been through since the George Jr. [8)] we found the road and got over to my buddy Bob's house.

And he did have Beer, so this story has a happy ending! 

NOTE; Terrain is due to the long dry hike to get there. Plan accordingly.</groundspeak:long_description>

Our good friends, Bob and Tonya Patschull, live across the street and we were up here on a beautiful Saturday afternoon for Tonya and Kelley's birthday party. Kelley turned 8 yrs old. Happy Birthday! Wave if you see them.
Anyway, last time we were up here the kids and I found a geocache over by Eats of Eden and so this time they wanted to go find some more and place one for each of them. If you have something to drop off or trade for an 8 yr old girl please leave it in here and she will go crazy over it, I am sure! Thanks for looking and keep on caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

While Kelley was having her birthday party, I took her older brother Wesley and a friend of his on a caching expedition over at the nearby Wolf Mountain. They had a blast! On our way back we hid this cache in the old golf course. If you have items to leave or trade for a 10 yr old boy it would be great! Thanks for looking and keep on caching!

You might consider bringing a friend with you to help you get to this one.

Also there is what I believe to to be someone's pet's grave here so please don't mess with it. The small white cross has nothing to do with this cache.

and then follow your GPS. There is no trail so you will be hiking through and around some sage brush, quakies and other small brush. This is only about a 1/8 mile of a hike from the road. It is hid pretty well, but is above ground. The container is a decon container. Not much room so swap small. The only thing in it now is the log book, a NASCAR matchbox car and some small trinkets. The road up Avon Pass is a dirt road and rough in places. A truck or SUV is recommend but not required.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This piggy bank wants to go heaven. It needs some change so it can
buy a ticket to get there. It is also a good omen to give him
change, and because of his location, you are going to need all the
good luck you can get. There is a few ways to get to the bank, but
in the end it will be a little tricky. Not suitable for kids or for
the not sure footed. The rock used in the construction of early
homes and the Logan LDS Temple and Tabernacle was taken from the
Green Canyon Quarry.

The cache is a tupperware with the piggy inside.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congratulations for FTF GeolDoc who also gave us some great
insight into the area.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The slab is the surface of an approximately 500 million year
old sea floor. If you look a the surface, you can see many small
ripple marks, exactly the same kind of marks you can see at the
shore at low tide. This is a neat spot for a cache, geologically as
well as historically. The slab is steep, and can be very slippery
when wet, so be careful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

One of Helena's &quot;best-kept secrets.&quot; The story behind this location is right out of a Western dime-novel; but sometimes, fact is stranger that fiction. 

Thousands of people drive by this tree everyday, but very few are aware that it bore witness to dozens of hangings in the late 1800's. Upon close inspection, you can still see where the ropes wore marks into the branches. 

During the later half of the 1800's, Helena's economy was greatly dependent upon the wealth that was mined from the earth - gold, silver, copper and lead. Miners who worked claims in the nearby Elkhorn mountains had to make trips into Helena regularly in order to resupply their camps and cash in their holdings.

The route, which followed Prickly Pear Creek, was a rough-cut road which made its way through a narrow stretch of canyon, just outside of Helena's city limits. This choke-point was often overwatched by road-agents and other troublesome folks who held travelers at gun-point and took their money and possessions.

Eventually, tired of being robbed and beaten, citizen groups of vigilantees and possees were formed and began taking matters into their own hands. They would catch the bandits and hang them in a large pine tree near the canyon as a means of putting on display examples of what would happen to anyone caught attempting to rob trail riders. Many times, local authorities turned a blind-eye towards this lawlessness; out-of-sight, out-of-mind was the unofficial policy.

This large ponderosa pine tree that still stands between the town of Clancy and city of Helena became known locally as &quot;The Hanging Tree&quot;, which remains today as testiment to days gone by when justice was often swift and merciless; the way things could often be done back in the days of the Wild West.

&lt;b&gt;The Terrain --&lt;/b&gt;
DO NOT approach this geocache from Interstate 90 - use the frontage road to the west (exits at Montana City and Clancy), and park at the volunteer fire deptartment station just west of the listed coordinates.

&lt;b&gt;The Container --&lt;/b&gt;
A bison-tube painted olive drab green; accessible during the winter.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is one of many in series of caches that have you first find a Benchmark in order to find a very well hidden cache near the benchmark. This benchmark and cache is a short walk from the &quot;Two Camps Vista&quot; Lewis and Clark Interpretive area Parking lot. The benchmark K 463 RESET was monumented in 1974 by the Montana Highway Department. You are looking for a micro cache near the benchmark. Next to the benchmark and cache is the old concrete post which would have held the benchmark K463. The old post is in three pieces, when put back together you can see the round circle the disk sat in and the hole that the rod on the disk sat in.  K 463 is listed by the NGS as destroyed. The location was listed destroyed in 1974 by the Montana Highway Dept. When the current road was built. The old concrete post dates back to 1936. This benchmarks can be logged on Geocaching.com by going to the find a benchmark page http://www.geocaching.com/mark/default.aspx The benchmark found at this cache can be found by entering the Point ID (PID) RW0403 into the Search for local Benchmark. Additional caches that have you finding a benchmark can be found on Geocaching.com, GPSgames.com, Terracaching.com and Opencaching.us </groundspeak:long_description>

The Sieben and Hilger ranches are two of the oldest in Montana. They are co-located along the Missouri River, in a wide valley that looked much as it did when Lewis &amp; Clark passed through in 1804.

Today, on their own and with the added help of the Undaunted Stewardship program, both ranches preserve their historic sites and take actions designed to maintain the landscape.

There are several interpretive signs located at this memorial. They explain the history of the two ranches, other uses of the area through time by settlers and by the Native tribes, as well as how the Undaunted Stewardship program works. 

&lt;b&gt;The Terrain -- &lt;/b&gt;
Gravel trail.

&lt;b&gt;The Container --&lt;/b&gt;
Black, magnetic nano.

&lt;b&gt;Other Information --&lt;/b&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A Cache just before entering Gates of the Mountain Wilderness Area along the Refrigerator Canyon Trail.  

Refrigerator Canyon Trail (259) is a scenic trail leading into the 28,560-acre Gates of the Mountains Wilderness Area. The first quarter-mile is truly spectacular as it enters a narrow canyon with 200-foot high limestone walls. Pines seem to jut at odd angles out from the most unlikely places high up on the walls of the canyon wherever there is a ledge or a crack just big enough to accommodate a tree's roots. The canyon in appropriately named; cool breezes blow over the stream and between the rock walls, creating a &quot;refrigerator&quot; effect. Even on the hottest summer day, the breezes will cool you off, so it's a good idea to take a jacket on this hike. At the quarter-mile point the walls nearly meet as the trail passes a 10-foot wide slit in the canyon that was carved through limestone rock by a small mountain stream. You have to walk through the middle of the small, shallow stream at this point and cross over it at several other points along the trail. For about the first half-mile the trail is rocky, but soon after it becomes a very nice, well-maintained hiking/horseback trail, no longer teeming with large, jutting rocks that an unsuspecting hiker could trip over or slip on.  A little farther up the trail there are a series of gradual switchbacks through a green, shady wooded area. Squirrels and butterflies are easy to spot in this area, and birdsong and buzzing bees are never out of earshot. The trail leads up to some great viewpoints, one of them at wooden railing near the top of the switchbacks. Sheep Mountain and Candle Mountain, each over 7,000 feet, are visible from the high points along the trail. All of the area's large mammals are known to live in this region. Try taking along a pair of binoculars and scan the rocky outcroppings and peaks for mountain goats, deer, and other wildlife from the viewpoints.  After a mile and a half you will reach the Forest Service Sign announcing the border of the Gates of the Mountains Wilderness Area.  

Directions to the Trail Head: Take county road 280, otherwise known as York Road. At the York Bar, turn left onto a gravel road and head north about 8 miles to Nelson. At Nelson, turn right heading east toward Hogback Mountain approximately 5 miles. The trailhead sign is large and easily seen from the road.</groundspeak:long_description>
