&lt;p&gt;Salsman Provincial Park is located on a small peninsula on the
east side of Country Harbour, Guysborough County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land on which the Park has been developed was given to the
Province of Nova Scotia by Senator Frank C. and Lois E. (Salsman)
Welch. The donation was made in memory of Reverend A. Wellington
(1861-1939) and F. Ellen (Mason) (1870-1939) Salsman on the
condition that it be developed as a Provincial Park. A cairn is
located in the Park to acknowledge this generous donation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This geocache is part of the 2010 NS Provincial Parks Geocaching
challenge. For more information about the geocaching challenge,
click the following LINK for more information.  To participate
in the challenge, you will need to download the associated
PASSPORT. At each geocache, there is a punch that you can mark the
corresponding box on your passport. Collect all 5 and you can send
in your passport to receive a free trackable geocoin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to solve this geocache, you will need to brush up on your
knowledge of trees.  Refer to the following links to help
you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Softwood&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How to Solve This
Multi&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. At the starting coordinates; identify the species of tree that
you see. (Hint: you will see a yellow trail marker 5 feet up the
tree)&lt;br /&gt;
Answer: 5 letters, another name for Tamarack. Place each letter in
the following slots.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
   (a) ___&lt;br /&gt;
   (b) ___&lt;br /&gt;
   (c) ___&lt;br /&gt;
   (d) ___&lt;br /&gt;
   (e) ___&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. Refer to this cipher key to get the corresponding digits 
from step 1. (eg. the letter I = 2 + 4 = 6)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;



0 1 2 3 4 5&lt;br /&gt;
1 A B C D E&lt;br /&gt;
2 F G H I J&lt;br /&gt;
3 K L M N O&lt;br /&gt;
4 P Q R S T&lt;br /&gt;
5 U V W X Y&lt;br /&gt;



 &lt;br /&gt;
3. Use your answers in step 2 to discover the final geocache
location:&lt;br /&gt;
   Nde 1d.096 W61 d6.06b&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. Verify your answers...&lt;br /&gt;
   i. The checksum from step 2 is a + b + c + d + e =
23&lt;br /&gt;
   ii. The geocache is located within the park along
trails or access road, &lt;b&gt;No bush wacking required&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The longest running Highland Games in North America have been run on Columbus field, combining a public park and walking track. There is parking close by, and cycling is an option while a walk or hike from the town is quite possible. The &quot;Glen&quot; is shaded. It is a beautiful spot to take pictures. The pipes and drums are tuned and practiced in the &quot;Glen&quot; during the games. Salmon fishing is a favourite activity in the river bordering the field. The river is hard to see in the evening; do not look for &quot;Piper in The Glen&quot; after dusk. Look near the confluence of the West River and Brierly Brook behind Columbus Field.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Colin H. Chisholm, Antigonish Mayor 1970 – 1994, was recognized for his long public service when the west Main Street park was named in his honour. The Antigonish park is tucked away between the William Henry Federal Building and Whidden's Bridge. It plays host to outdoor concerts, highland dancing exhibitions, and is a great spot to hunt for the “The Mayor's” geocache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chisholm served with the Cape Breton Highlanders in North West Europe during World War II. After the war he was employed by the Canadian Department of Agriculture and taught in Truro, Nova Scotia at the College of Agriculture. He was elected to Nova Scotia's legislature in 1949 and served until 1956. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He received the Nova Scotia Environmental award in recognition of his leadership establishing the Brierly Brook flood control dam and for his efforts to manage and treat waste water in Antigonish. St. Francis Xavier University, Antigonish presented an Honorary Doctorate of Laws to “The Mayor” in 1989.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After locating (1) The Landing, Hierlily, and Estuary and (2) Piper in The Glen make your way to the Colin H. Chisholm Park west end Main Street to hunt for (3) &quot;The Mayor&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I entered the coordinates using a Garmin Dakota 10.   </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Antigonish Harbour was first settled in 1784 by Irish soldiers loyal to the British side in the American Revolution. When disbanded these Irish soldiers, led by Captain Timothy Hierlihy received a large land grant. The grant was originally along Route 337 bordering Antigonish Harbour. A section of the Harbour is called Antigonish Landing which includes a 2 square km wildlife sanctuary on Antigonish's east end. In 1967 the Antigonish Fish and Game Association spearheaded a drive to create the sanctuary and trail. Antigonish Landing borders an estuary, where three rivers, the West, South and Wrights, feed into Antigonish Harbour. The harbour is a large saltwater tidal estuary emptying into St George's Bay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, Antigonish &quot;Landing” is home to a walking trail. The walking trail offers a 4 km return hike along Antigonish Harbour in a designated Wild Life Management Area. Start your walk at either end of the trail. Turn right on Adam Street just cross the train tracks or continue along Route 337, past the hospital and turn right at Tony’s Meats. Improvements to the trail include two elevated platforms providing an unobstructed seasonal view of great blue heron, sandpipers, gulls, osprey, eagles and six varieties of duck in the wildlife sanctuary.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Landing, Hierlihy, and Estuary is located along the trail. Use the pictures, and other information found here to locate the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nova Scotia Parks Help Mitigate The Affects Of Climate Change&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parks and protected areas are increasingly being recognized for the important role they play as a resource for mitigating and adapting to climate change. There is a growing body of evidence indicating the world’s climate is changing and adaptation will be necessary if societal and natural conditions are to exist as they do today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parks protect ecosystems and the services they provide for people; they store vast quantities of carbon, preventing its conversion to greenhouse gases and they provide safe havens for wildlife. Parks are managed to encourage forest to develop naturally. Forests and forest soils play a vital part in the carbon cycle, and can act as either a carbon source or a carbon sink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A forest is a carbon sink when it absorbs more carbon than it releases. The thickness of the dead organic forest floor (duff layer), is directly related to the amount of carbon stored. Assuming forest floor material contains or stores on average about 40% carbon and has an average density of 0.15 milligrams per metre3, each cm in depth of forest floor equates to about 6 tonnes per hectare of stored carbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For example&lt;/strong&gt;, if the forest floor is 10 cm thick, it contains about &lt;em&gt;10 x 6 = 60 tonnes per hectares of carbon&lt;/em&gt;. There is also lots of carbon stored deeper in the soil, in deadwood on the ground, and in living plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measure the thickness of the organic forest floor (duff); do not include large pieces of dead wood or living plants. Record the thickness of the duff layer on the space provided, use the punch found in each cache to punch your passport.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each geocache will have a ruler to make your measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also estimate the mass of carbon in tonnes per hectare stored in the forest floor at each location by using the formula provided above. Compare the measurements taken under various forest and site conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This geocache is part of the 2012 NS Provincial Parks Geocaching challenge. For more information about the geocaching challenge, click the following &lt;a href=&quot;http://atlanticgeocaching.com/index.php/2012-03-05-22-43-59/news-a-events/238-nova-scotia-parks-geocaching-challenge-event&quot;&gt;LINK&lt;/a&gt; for more information.  To participate in the challenge, you will need to download the associated &lt;a href=&quot;http://atlanticgeocaching.com/index.php/downloads-2/category/2-nova-scotia-parks-downloads&quot;&gt;PASSPORT&lt;/a&gt;. At each geocache, there is a punch that you can mark the corresponding box on your passport. Collect all 5 and you can send in your passport to receive a free trackable geocoin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Passport&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the passport from &lt;a href=&quot;http://atlanticgeocaching.com/index.php/downloads-2/category/2-nova-scotia-parks-downloads&quot;&gt;ACGA&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://novascotiaparks.ca/misc/geocaching.asp&quot;&gt;NS Parks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Whycocomagh is a Mi’kmaq word which means 'Head of the Waters' referring to the geographic location within the Bras d’Or Lake. Indian Island, which is visable from Whycocomagh Park, plays a significant role in the culture and heritage of the local First Nations' people. As a place detached from the main encampment lands, it has always been regarded as a spiritual place. Local stories indicate the island was never used for long term habitation, although within the past century it had been used as burial grounds. Indian Island has had active Bald Eagle nests in the past, usually in the majestic Eastern White Pine trees that are found scattered on the islands' interior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Legend of the first Pine Tree: There were three brothers dwelling together, when they heard that Glooskap had promised to fufil the wish of warrior who reached his magic lodge, they decided to make the trip. The first brother was very tall, far above all his fellows, and vain of his height, but he wished to be taller, so that all the females would admire him. The second brother wished that he might remain forever in the forest, beholding its beauty, and that he need never work again. The third brother wished to live to a very old age, and always to be in perfect health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the three brothers started on their way along the dangerous trail that led to Glooskap's lodge. They came to a high mountain in a dark and lonely land. The side of the mountain was as smooth as iron, and the other side was worse, for there the trail led between the heads of two huge serpents, who darted out their tongues. The trail passed under the Wall of Death which hung over it like a cloud, rising, and falling, and rising again. And if it happened that any man passed beneath the cloud as it fell, he was crushed to death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the three brothers escaped all these perils of the trail, and came to the island where Glooskap dwelt. The mighty Magician welcomed them, and bade his younger brother, Martin the Fairy, place food before them. After they had eaten and were refreshed, they told their wishes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In another lodge near by lived Cuhkw the Earthquake, he could pass along the face of the land, and make all things shake with terror. Glooskap called Cuhkw, and made him take the three brothers, and plant them with their feet in the ground. Immediately Cuhkw came rushing from his lodge, and, seizing the three, planted them in the forest. And they became three straight Pine Trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first brother, who wished to be exceedingly tall, was the highest Pine Tree on earth. His head rose above the forest and the wind whistled through his boughs. The second brother, who wished to remain in the forest, and admire its beauty without working, could never leave it again; because his roots were fastened deep in the ground. The third brother, who wished to live to a very old age, in perfect health, gained his desire. Today he stands hale and hearty in the forest, unless men have cut him down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This geocache is part of the 2011 NS Provincial Parks Geocaching challenge.
