&lt;p&gt;Salsman Provincial Park is located on a small peninsula on the
east side of Country Harbour, Guysborough County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land on which the Park has been developed was given to the
Province of Nova Scotia by Senator Frank C. and Lois E. (Salsman)
Welch. The donation was made in memory of Reverend A. Wellington
(1861-1939) and F. Ellen (Mason) (1870-1939) Salsman on the
condition that it be developed as a Provincial Park. A cairn is
located in the Park to acknowledge this generous donation.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This geocache is part of the 2010 NS Provincial Parks Geocaching
challenge. For more information about the geocaching challenge,
click the following LINK for more information.  To participate
in the challenge, you will need to download the associated
PASSPORT. At each geocache, there is a punch that you can mark the
corresponding box on your passport. Collect all 5 and you can send
in your passport to receive a free trackable geocoin.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In order to solve this geocache, you will need to brush up on your
knowledge of trees.  Refer to the following links to help
you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
How to Solve This
Multi&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
1. At the starting coordinates; identify the species of tree that
you see. (Hint: you will see a yellow trail marker 5 feet up the
tree)&lt;br/&gt;
Answer: 5 letters, another name for Tamarack. Place each letter in
the following slots.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
   (a) ___&lt;br/&gt;
   (b) ___&lt;br/&gt;
   (c) ___&lt;br/&gt;
   (d) ___&lt;br/&gt;
   (e) ___&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
2. Refer to this cipher key to get the corresponding digits 
from step 1. (eg. the letter I = 2 + 4 = 6)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;



0 1 2 3 4 5&lt;br/&gt;
1 A B C D E&lt;br/&gt;
2 F G H I J&lt;br/&gt;
3 K L M N O&lt;br/&gt;
4 P Q R S T&lt;br/&gt;
5 U V W X Y&lt;br/&gt;



 &lt;br/&gt;
3. Use your answers in step 2 to discover the final geocache
location:&lt;br/&gt;
   Nde 1d.096 W61 d6.06b&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
4. Verify your answers...&lt;br/&gt;
   i. The checksum from step 2 is a + b + c + d + e =
23&lt;br/&gt;
   ii. The geocache is located within the park along
trails or access road, &lt;b&gt;No bush wacking required&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Whycocomagh is a Mi’kmaq word which means 'Head of the Waters' referring to the geographic location within the Bras d’Or Lake. Indian Island, which is visable from Whycocomagh Park, plays a significant role in the culture and heritage of the local First Nations' people. As a place detached from the main encampment lands, it has always been regarded as a spiritual place. Local stories indicate the island was never used for long term habitation, although within the past century it had been used as burial grounds. Indian Island has had active Bald Eagle nests in the past, usually in the majestic Eastern White Pine trees that are found scattered on the islands' interior.

Legend of the first Pine Tree: There were three brothers dwelling together, when they heard that Glooskap had promised to fufil the wish of warrior who reached his magic lodge, they decided to make the trip. The first brother was very tall, far above all his fellows, and vain of his height, but he wished to be taller, so that all the females would admire him. The second brother wished that he might remain forever in the forest, beholding its beauty, and that he need never work again. The third brother wished to live to a very old age, and always to be in perfect health.

So the three brothers started on their way along the dangerous trail that led to Glooskap's lodge. They came to a high mountain in a dark and lonely land. The side of the mountain was as smooth as iron, and the other side was worse, for there the trail led between the heads of two huge serpents, who darted out their tongues. The trail passed under the Wall of Death which hung over it like a cloud, rising, and falling, and rising again. And if it happened that any man passed beneath the cloud as it fell, he was crushed to death.

But the three brothers escaped all these perils of the trail, and came to the island where Glooskap dwelt. The mighty Magician welcomed them, and bade his younger brother, Martin the Fairy, place food before them. After they had eaten and were refreshed, they told their wishes.

In another lodge near by lived Cuhkw the Earthquake, he could pass along the face of the land, and make all things shake with terror. Glooskap called Cuhkw, and made him take the three brothers, and plant them with their feet in the ground. Immediately Cuhkw came rushing from his lodge, and, seizing the three, planted them in the forest. And they became three straight Pine Trees.

The first brother, who wished to be exceedingly tall, was the highest Pine Tree on earth. His head rose above the forest and the wind whistled through his boughs. The second brother, who wished to remain in the forest, and admire its beauty without working, could never leave it again; because his roots were fastened deep in the ground. The third brother, who wished to live to a very old age, in perfect health, gained his desire. Today he stands hale and hearty in the forest, unless men have cut him down.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">During my university years, I would return to Cheticamp in the spring and fish as a means to pay off my education. After long days of fishing in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, this spot would always be the one to first welcome us home. 

This will be a quick park n grab but you can take all the time in the world and enjoy the ocean and mountain scene.Please keep an eye out for livestock as this is a community pasture site. Please also respect the regulations posted on the large sign as you enter the community pasture. 

The cache is a small camo'd lock n' lock container containing a log book, pencil, a tattoo, a Canadian cacher 
zipper pull, an outdoor mirror and for the FTF - Canada 2007 Geocoin and a Canadian cacher pin.
