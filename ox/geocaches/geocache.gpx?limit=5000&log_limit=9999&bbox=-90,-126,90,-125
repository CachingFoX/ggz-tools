            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This Cache is placed on an interesting hiking trail in Strathcona&lt;br/&gt;Park. This park is home to amazing waterfalls, vast lakes, and many&lt;br/&gt;climbing and hiking trails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While walking along the trail leading up to the cache you will&lt;br/&gt;reach a fork where both trails meet. The cache in the photo is no&lt;br/&gt;longer on top of this stump, but this stump holds it's secret&lt;br/&gt;treasures. A 2 liter box wrapped in a black garbage bag is what you&lt;br/&gt;are searching for. The contents of this box hold fun for the whole&lt;br/&gt;family. On a hot day you will want to travel up the trail to enjoy&lt;br/&gt;the temperature change at the top. The shorter trail is a little&lt;br/&gt;steap, but I do suggest that you explore the longer trail one way&lt;br/&gt;to enjoy the full value of this amazing site. Happy Hunting!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;This cache is at the above coordinated. It should
be easy to find. Signing the log book however is a completely
different matter.&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best approached from the south
bound lane. There is plenty of room to park just of the highway if
you have a vehicle with some clearance. There is no need to drive
over the little hill. The trail is just on the other side. I
followed the trail to where it passed under the highway at the
bridge, so I do believe this can be approached from Railway Road if
you know the trails in this area.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is my twist on the monkey
puzzle cache. The log book is in a film canister which is locked
inside the puzzle. The key to the lock is also inside the puzzle.
Your job is to figure out how to get the key out so you can sign
the log book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please do not hold the cache by what look like handles to shake the
key out. Also please be careful not to lose the key. It is quite
small. Holding one hand over the outlet is a good way to prevent
the key from winding up on the ground. After opening the cache and
signing the logbook please put the key in the top portion of cache
and lock it up ready for the next cacher.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is an unactivated geocoin for the FTF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;T22CTQZ - Trail&lt;br /&gt;N 49° 47.155 W 125° 08.569&lt;br /&gt;This is where you have to bear left if approaching from the trails under the bridge.&lt;br /&gt;TR2CTQZ - Trail&lt;br /&gt;N 49° 47.309 W 125° 08.692&lt;br /&gt;Start of Trail.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Found this spot while out exploring today. Just had to place a cache here. The road in has a bit of a hump in it where I left the highway, so a vehicle with clearance will be required (unless you like a long hike) There are also a few large potholes full of water along the way. At one point you will have to go left and leave the service road. This will be a narrow road that ends in a washed out spot with a makeshift quad bridge. May be tricky turning around if you have a long truck, should be possible though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I walked from here and it's not too far at this point. If you walk from the service road, it's about 500m. Walk past the bridge and shortly you should see an old overgrown rail bed in front of you. The Trestle is at the end of this, and there is boundary flagging on the left that will lead you to a trail (tricky to find at first)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The roads near the cache are in pretty good shape, so I suspect you may be able to access the area from Duncan Bay Main&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rest is up to you.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Petroglyphs
(Greek: petra, rock; glyph, carving) are signs and symbols of
spiritual significance, pitted and grooved into rock. They are
found in widely separated areas on nearly all of the continents of
the world, a record left by hunting and gathering societies that
stretches back from this century into
antiquity.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Enriched in history,
Quadra Island is home to numerous petro glyphs. I have been
informed by a local anthropologist that the best time to view them
is early in the morning or late in the day when the sun casts long
shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Petroglyphs (rock
carvings) are cultural landmarks and are protected by law. Do not
take rubbings of petroglyphs. You may take
photographs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


There are several access points to the beach. Please
respect private property. After finding the cache take the time to
walk the beach and discover the many petro
glyphs&lt;br /&gt; 


Included
in the cache is a local map to petro glyphs available on this beach
and other sites on Quadra Island. Please leave the laminated copy
it in the cache.
.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cache cover(s) use
recycled material collected from the beach. Please replace exactly
as found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kay Dubois Trail
extends from Smiths Road to Sutil Road, and the beach may also be
accessed from Petroglyph Road. which provides beach access for the
petroglyphs at Francisco Pt. There is another cache on the Kay
Dubois Trail and if accessing the trail from Sutil Road please note
that there is an elevation change that involves several switchbacks
on a narrow and sometimes slippery
slope.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Decided to place a cache on the way out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get here follow either the Menzies Main or the Grey lake road to Brewster lake. Cross the lake and follow the Salmon Main which is the left branch right after crossing the lake. Stay on the mainline all the way to Grilse Creek where the Salmon is the left branch. Stay on the Salmon Main and this road will take you to the head of the Gold Lake trail. If your going to go all the way to the trailhead, you will need a 4X4 to cross a creek some rough road, and an area where the road is a little washed out. You should be able to get in as far as the cache without four wheel drive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coords may not be dead accurate, but since you drove so far I'll give you a good clue.</groundspeak:long_description>

This walk is set in a reclaimed area of the estuary that provides
spawning areas as well as a delightful walk and a good eagle
watching area. Take some time to appreciate the reclaimation
efforts that are ongoing. This is a popular spot to run your dog
but please do not allow your dog to swim in the spawning channel as
it disturbs the salmon eggs and fry…...................

a number from 1 – 26:&lt;/b&gt;

-It is always wise to take a friend night caching.&lt;br /&gt;
-It is also possible to encounter bears along the river, especially
in the fall when the salmon are running. Please be Prepared.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The cache page coordinates will take you to a place to park. From
there there are two possible trails. Find the first reflector and
start your walk. The trail is wide in most places and even. There
is some down hill at the start with a steep bank on one side, but
it is easily traversed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not all reflectors are at the same height and the next reflector
may not be immediately visible when standing at the current one.
Just continue slowly along the trail and you should find what your
looking for. Eventually you should come across an orange reflector.
At this point you will have to make a choice to follow the white
trail or continue on the amber trail. If you come to an
intersection with no orange reflector just follow the same color
reflectors that you have been following. The final location will be
indicated by two reflectors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you find the cache, it should be apparent where you need to go
to return to your car.

He is the son of Zeus and Hera, the King and Queen of the Gods or else (according to some accounts) of Hera alone. He was the god of technology, blacksmiths, craftsmen, artisans, sculptors, metals, metallurgy, fire and volcanoes. Like other mythic smiths but unlike most other gods, Hephaestus was lame, which gave him a grotesque appearance in Greek eyes. He served as the blacksmith of the gods, and he was worshipped in the manufacturing and industrial centers of Greece, particularly in Athens. Hephaestus's symbols are a smith's hammer, an anvil and a pair of tongs, although sometimes he is portrayed holding an axe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is Hephaestus' Workshop. Here, Hephaestus built Pandora's Box,&lt;br/&gt;and here Hephaestus holds The key to Pandora's Box.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

really, really expensive GPSr. Please do not move the stages and

grandchildren
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache will lead through Woodlot Licence 25 using the
&lt;b&gt;Haskin Farm Trail&lt;/b&gt;: A short, easy walking trail exploring
meadows and orchards following a 1.5 km trail that takes you
through forests and down a slope onto a beach. The Haskin Farm
Trail is accessed at the corner of Smiths Road and Heriot Bay Road.
&lt;b&gt;The last 100m of this trail will take you down a steep narrow
switchback that may be slippery during wet weather&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a 1.5l L n’ L with various swag as well as
FTF &amp; STF Cards and a FTF prize…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could only get a 6m accuracy so use the hint or approach from
the beach and it is above the high tide mark in line with the large
black boulder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woodlot Licence 25 was awarded in 1987: 2007 marks the 20th
anniversary of operations. During those 20 years over 50,000 cubic
metres of timber has been harvested through a variety of harvest
techniques: selection cutting, intermediate cuts, group selections,
clear cuts, patch cuts, and salvage. Well over 100,000 seedlings
have been planted with species appropriate for the site. Employment
of local workers has been continuous and is a significant
contribution to the local economy. Wildlife, wildlife tree
retention, and protection and recruitment of old-growth trees are
accommodated throughout the licence area by the use of reserves and
wildlife tree patches. Recreation features such as hiking trails
are an important part of the woodlot and are managed in conjunction
with the Quadra Trails Committee. Quadra Islanders and others from
all over the world have used the woodlot area for hiking and as
green space. Knowing that it will always remain forest is a
reassurance to many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Areas where timber harvesting will be avoided. Haskin Farm
Meadow Reserve Block 2 - Historic Haskin Farm Site 1.4 ha Haskin
Farm Shoreline Reserve Block 2 - Haskin ocean shoreline and steep
slopes. 8.0ha.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Came across this spot while walking the Lost lake/Mudhoney loop
looking for some other caches. It was a beautiful crisp winter day.
The dogs were glad to be on the trail as much as we were. The ice
and frost made the forest look like something from a fairy tale. We
saw this spot and just had to check it out.&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is just off the trail, but you have to go around the water to
get at it.&lt;br /&gt;

bein' green; Having to spend each day the color of the leaves. When
I think it could be nicer being red, or yellow or gold- or
something much more colorful like that.
It's not easy bein'
green. It seems you blend in with so many other ordinary things.
And people tend to pass you over 'cause you're not standing out
like flashy sparkles in the water- or stars in the
sky
But green's the color
of Spring. And green can be cool and friendly-like. And green can
be big like an ocean, or important like a mountain, or tall like a
tree..
When green is all there
is to be It could make you wonder why, but why wonder why? Wonder,
I am green and it'll do fine, it's beautiful! And I think it's what
I want to be.

Service Roads and Campsites available to the public.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache is available to those who are doing the Sayward
Forest Canoe Route as well as by road. If accessing by road please
keep your eyes out for logging trucks and other vehicles. There are
several different access routes so take your pick which one you
use. Remember that these roads are not always well maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These roads, now used for logging &amp; recreational traffic,
were once the basis of a logging railway. Look closely and you can
still see remnants of rail beds and trestles.&lt;/p&gt;

nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

to the length of the drive, and the steep bit at the end. Clearance
is not an issue. but some cars may have trouble going up the hill

There is active logging in the area, so drive defensively, and be
prepared to pull over for logging trucks. May be best to attempt
this cache on the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;The World's Largest Yellow Cedar stood
tall for centuries, a giant among B.C.'s largest trees.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sargeant
RandAlly after Randall Dayton and Ally Gibson, the two forestry
engineers who discovered it in 1993, the world champion tree boasts
impressive statistics;&lt;br /&gt;
Height 61m (200 ft),&lt;br /&gt;
Circumference 13.08m (42ft.11in),&lt;br /&gt;
Diameter 4.16m (13.7ft),&lt;br /&gt;
Crown Spread 16m (52.5ft), and&lt;br /&gt;
Stem Volume 175&lt;br /&gt;
cubic meters (6,200 cu.
ft).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shortly
before the opening of the St. RandAlly recreational site, the
Alaskan yellow cedar, succumbed to old age. The demise of the
2,000-year-old tree shocked supporters, who had worked to keep it
safe and had viewing platforms constructed around it. But they are
looking on the bright side, saying the sights of the massive tree
on its side on the forest floor gives an even better view of its
size.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Champion trees in North
America are determined using a point system that awards 1 point per
inch of circumference at breast height, 1 point per foot in height,
and 1 point for every 4 feet diameter of the live crown. Sgt.
RandAlly's score in British Columbia Big Tree Points is 728. The
number 2 yellow cedar in the record book is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=f55b1590-ae0c-424a-9572-9ef4c812dc16&quot;&gt;
Admiral Broeren&lt;/a&gt; (575 points)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From Big Tree Main, follow the signs for Sgt RandAlly to the East
Memekay Main. There are white signs at all the places you have to
turn with arrows that will lead you to the small park. Once your
here look around. There are quite a few large trees still standing
in this small forest grove.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

sits a cache just waiting to be found!. We Called it Lunch Break
because we thought that it was a great spot to stop, sit, have
lunch, and just admire the view.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache will hopefully encourage more people to hike into
this area now that there are a few incentives - Expect this round
trip hike to take 5 hours!!!&lt;/p&gt;
The trail takes you up over the bluffs so be aware of the kids and
pets as well as watching your step. Going down the other side to
Maud Island you connect with the lower trail. Both sets of trails
are well marked. 
&lt;p&gt;Good footwear, food and water are a must. Expect elevation
changes and awesome views! So don't forget the camera either!!&lt;/p&gt;
Directions to the cache: Take the Walcan Road, past Mud Lake and
turn right at the road that leads to the fish farm…..Turn right at
the road with the 80 on tree…..You can take the muddy road on the
right past the good one to get to the official trailhead or you can
continue down this road 2.6km from the Walcan Road to where the
trail intersects the logging road….…

a series that will take you on a tour of some of the Forest Service
Roads and Campsites available to the public.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is available to those who are doing the Sayward Forest
Canoe Route as well as by road. If accessing by road &lt;b&gt;please keep
your eyes out for logging trucks&lt;/b&gt; and other vehicles. There are
several different access routes so take your pick which one you
use. Remember that these roads are not always well maintained. 
&lt;p&gt;These roads, now used for logging &amp; recreational traffic,
were once the basis of a logging railway. Look closely and you can
still see remnants of rail beds and trestles. This spot is near a
campsite and there is parking nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

the side of the road? Sometimes you see people filling water jugs
and you wonder…ewwwww how can they drink that untreated water? Well
I do it…I find that the water is clean and refreshing and I haven’t
got sick from it yet….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”An artesian well contains groundwater that flows upwards
without the need for pumping. An aquifer provides the water for an
artesian well. An aquifer is a layer of soft rock, like limestone
or sandstone, that absorbs water from an inlet path. Porous stone
is crushed between impermeable rocks or clay. This keeps the
pressure high, so when the water finds a hole, it overcomes gravity
and goes up instead of down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So stop here, fill your, bottle, or cup, and just try it….you
will like it!!! And while you are at it….find a cache too!!! Hard
to get co-ordinates to settle down, so use the hint&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

to cut back some of the foliage higher up for a safer hike in some

have never stopped here…but I will do it again and again now that I
have discovered this place….&lt;/p&gt;

trail you will see Grand Fir (Abies grandis), Douglas Fir
(Pseudotsuga menziesii), Western Hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla),
Western Red Cedar (Thuja plicata), and Red Alder (Alnus rubra) …(Oh

&lt;p&gt;BC Parks is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. The
first BC Park was Strathcona Park on Vancouver Island which was
officially created on March 1, 1911.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the parks system in British Columbia is one of our
greatest resources. Currently 14.26% (13.5 million hectares) of
British Columbia's land base is protected. There are more than 340
campgrounds, 6000 km of hiking trails, 118 boat launches and 263
day-use areas in B.C.'s provincial park system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BC Parks and the BC Geocaching Association are partnered along
with the Year of Science to invite you to explore BC Parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of 100 caches placed in parks throughout BC. Each
cache will have a unique trackable geocoin available for the first
3 finders. There are also BC Parks trade items, BC Geocaching
Association buttons, and Year of Science pins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a maximum of one coin per Geocaching account. Please
trade fairly for all items in the cache. If you have a coin from
another cache, please leave it for another cacher - you would want
them to do the same for you.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;A small, shady site next to a creek. An open forest makes for
easy exploration. Also a maintained trail on the south side of the
access road.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Located just north of the Sayward junction on the left side of the
highway. Cache is hidden on the trail around the reload pond.&lt;/p&gt;

this wonderful anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
