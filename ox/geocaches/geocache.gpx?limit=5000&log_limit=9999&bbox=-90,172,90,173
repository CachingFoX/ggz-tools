Welcome to the Labyrinth, a great place to get lost for a while. Park at the co-ordinates given below and enjoy a wander through some interesting natural rock formations. You could probably get to the cache and back inside 10 minutes but allow at least an hour to enjoy a leisurely wander around the park. If you have young children with you there are plenty of things to see along the track to keep them entertained.

The popular Labyrinth Rocks Park created by the late Dave Whittaker was reopened on the 23rd December 2009 as a council reserve. So what was once private land and subject to an entry fee is now completely free for everyone to enjoy.

The cache has been placed with the knowledge of one of the local volunteer caretakers who we met while visiting the rocks. He told us further restoration work was being done so expect the area to improve even more over time. Please keep to the tracks at all times, there is no need to leave them to find the cache.

Note: If you want to learn more about the geology of the area visit the nearby Earth Cache GC22YF4.</groundspeak:long_description>

Don't worry, we'll take them through again once we're back as a team in GB.  Had a bit of trouble locating the cache, even with clue, but I was probably overthinking it a little.

Take the loop walk or explore the tunnel; both are safe. You can navigate the tunnel without torches if you take it quietly. Bring a torch if you don't like the dark.

This is a popular tourist stopping point so watch for muggles before you leave the track and head up to retrieve the cache. Satellite coverage is patchy here so use the hint if you're not sure where to look. You can see an obvious spot for the cache - yes it's tucked behind that _____.

Thanks to Moneydork for making this spot available for a new cache after his original one near here went missing. GCPG47</groundspeak:long_description>

A berocca tube cache container hidden beside the Murchison Earthquake Memorial and museum.

History of the Site

Seventeen people died in the Murchison earthquake which occurred on the 17th June 1929. It caused many spectacular slips, cut roads and dammed rivers. The quake, of magnitude 7.8, was centred under the White Creek Fault.

Please respect the site, there is no need to step onto the garden to retrieve the cache.

This is a very historical street with some great “Olde World” buildings that are worth having a wander past or a look inside if they are open. Our favourite is Hodgson’s Store, which was severely damaged in the quake as you can see below but is still standing today.</groundspeak:long_description>

Decided to do it without a clue but after 10 minutes I had to give up on that plan.  Who would have guessed it was there?  Didn't think it would safely hide a cache, but whaddayaknow?  Drove to Six Mile to start the day with Now that's Weird and move on to Maruia Saddler.  Those two would be top caches.  If you are looking at this cache, consider the trip through a path less travelled - it's worth it.  Thanks for the cache Aaron.</groundspeak:text>

The container itself came from Moneydork, and was used a few years ago to provide a temporary cache for the Scout's Jamboree caching event that the NZ Recreational GPS Society helped run. It even has quite a few scouting swaps from that event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This cache is submitted in partial requirement of the BGSc (Hons) that I am undertaking. Its working title is 'Irony'.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
