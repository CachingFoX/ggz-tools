            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located on an island popular with both tourists and locals alike, the search will bring you to a little secluded corner away from the bright lights and jostling crowds. To get there, you can either trek onwards on tarred road or feel the sand between your toes while strolling on the beach, the choice is up to you. GZ is on rocky terrain, be careful where you put your feet. Enjoy the serenity and the gorgeous beachfront view when you arrive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need a keen eye to spot the cache hidden among the rocks. The cache is a small cylinder of diameter 9.5cm and height 12cm. It contains a log book and pen, and a TB for the first to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you have found it and enjoyed your stay, please be reminded to replace the cache in the same way so that it does not get dislodged or damaged. As the cache is exposed to the elements, we request that you pay special attention to properly seal all openings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Entry to the island will require an admission fee, so be sure to check out the other caches hidden on the island while you're there!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Steam Crane ... An antique equipment next to a new 'City'. Easy terrain and you just won't miss it ... unless you are in the wrong time zone. Easy access and no special attire needed. However a torchlight might come in handy ... with good sleuthing skills and geosense. Ha ha!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A railroad crane is a type of crane used on a railroad for one of three primary uses: freight handling in goods yards, permanent way maintenance, and accident recovery work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the design differs according to the type of work, the basic configuration is similar in all cases: a rotating crane body is mounted on a sturdy chassis fitted with flanged wheels. The body supports the jib and provides all the lifting and operating mechanisms; on larger cranes, an operator's cabin is usually provided. The chassis is fitted with buffing and coupling gear to allow the crane to be moved by a locomotive, although many are also self-propelled to allow limited movement about a work site.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>* Definitely not at the railway station! 
* Illegal parking next to it. LOL.
* Free parking if you get out fast enough.
* Not high.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

One of the famous eating places in Singapore serving 'roti prata' (aka 'roti canai' across the border) You will find a few eateries along this road serving this famous pancake. If you have not tried it; &quot;roti prata&quot; is prepared by flipping the dough into a large thin layer by hand. If you have the opportunity to witness the making, the chef may perform some stunts with the dough by tossing it in the air and stretching the dough in mid-flight. The stretched dough is then folded inwards to create a multi-layer effect. Once the dough is ready, it is cooked over a hot plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, 'roti prata' is served in either 'kosong' (plain) or 'telur' (with egg) with options of chopped onions. In recent years, flavours and toppings have been introduced. Cheese, chocolate, strawberry, sardines… you name it; they probably have it. These flavorings or toppings, if ordered, can be added either before or after it is flipped, depending on the flavorings or the desired outcome. There is also the 'tissue' and 'paper' variants which are pan-fried with butter, rolled into a cone shape and sprinkled with sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jalan Kayu was built in 1928 when the first Royal Air Force base outside the United Kingdom was established in Singapore, in the northern part of the island. Jalan Kayu means &quot;wooden road&quot; in Malay. One version for the road name's origin is that firewood used to be stacked on the roadside. Another version is that the muddy laterite roads leading to the rubber estates in the area were made passable due to logs of wood that used to cover the muddy roads, hence the term in Malay jalan kayu.&lt;/p&gt;

To give all cachers a possibility for a short rest while driving up and down Malaysian highways ;-) (southbound)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Update December 2009:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am told that since Malaysia is introducing a limit for 20 l. petrol sales to foreign (eg. Singapore) cars within 50km from the borders, the filling station at Machap is getting very popular (being the last one on the highway outside the 50k limit) and thus lengthy queues can develop that may also affect users of the restpoint itself. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I suggest that when stopping here to first get into the queue for the filling station, while other passengers go eat/cache. Note that there is no way to drive back to the restpoint from the filling station though :-(</groundspeak:long_description>
