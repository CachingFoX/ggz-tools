            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;[eng]&lt;/b&gt; At this fascinating location near Sant Josep you'll
find the leftovers of the &quot;Festival Club&quot;, a big concrete
amphitheatre that opened in 1972. The venue closed only 2 years
after the opening because of the fuel crisis and the subsequent
missing tourists. A few decades later, the nature captures its
ground back.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You can park your car at the parking coordinates. Please have a
look at the spoiler photo (&lt;a href=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/8d81a812-347a-4ad8-88cf-8e17cf874cad.jpg&quot;&gt;Spoiler&lt;/a&gt;), because there are
hundreds possible hiding places. &lt;b&gt;We would appreciate it very
much, if you would be so kind as to take a photo of this abandoned
place and upload it to your log.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;[cat]&lt;/b&gt; En aquest lloc fascinant prop de Sant Josep trobareu
les restes de la &quot;Festival Club&quot;, un gran concret amfiteatre, que
va obrir les portes el 1972. El lloc tancat només 2 anys després de
l'obertura, a causa de la crisi del combustible i la posterior
falten turistes. Unes dècades més tard, la naturalesa de la seva
captura terra de nou.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Pot aparcar el seu vehicle en les coordenades d'estacionament. Si
us plau, tenir un cop d'ull a la foto spoiler (&lt;a href=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/8d81a812-347a-4ad8-88cf-8e17cf874cad.jpg&quot;&gt;Spoiler&lt;/a&gt;), perquè hi ha centenars
possibles amagatalls. &lt;b&gt;Li agrairíem molt tant, si vostè fos tan
amable com per fer una foto d'aquest abandonament lloc i el
carregui en el seu registre.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">El Parc de la Ciutat és un dels pulmons de la ciutat de Tarragona. Tot i que no es tracta d'un espai molt gran, doncs només té unes 4,5 hectàrees, és un lloc esplèndid per passejar-hi, i com no, per posar-hi un catxé.

Al parc hi podreu trobar el Quintà de Sant Rafel i el seu antic pou, un edifici modernista dissenyat el 1912 per l'arquitecte Julian María Fossas.

També s'hi troben les restes d'una vil·la romana, amb una petita necròpolis. Disposa també d'una zona de jocs infantils i una glorieta donada a la ciutat.

Hi ha gran varietat d'arbres i plantes, la majoria mediterrànies, com les alzines i els roures, i a la plaça central un gran lledoner. També hi ha zones amb magnòlies i tamarius i al davant de l'edifici de la Quinta de Sant Rafel dues palmeres washingtònia monumentals de més de 20 metres d'alçada.

Al parc s'hi han instal·lat unes tanques d'estil modernista per poder-ne restringir l'us nocturn.

Posem aquest fàcil catxé a disposició del públic aprofitant les festes de Santa Tecla 2010 que comencen ja aquest cap de setmana. Esperem que us agradi el lloc, i també el catxé.

Dintre del catxé en qüestió trobareu (a més d'altres objectes que van deixar abans altres persones) un targetó groc i negre amb una &quot;frase encriptada&quot;.

Seguiu les instruccions i, amb una mica més de sort, a la primera persona que ens faci arribar la frase desencriptada al mur de Facebook de EL TÍPIC PROGRAMA li obsequiarem amb un  detall molt lúdic: un dels jocs de taula que presentem a LA TÍPICA SECCIÓ DE JOCS!

Passem a donar detalls de com trobar el típic catxé: de camí al Castell d'Eramprunyà, sortint des de l'Ermita de Bruguers, trobareu una pedra al bellmig del camí amb una taca de pintura vermella (no continueu pujant!). És moment de desviar-vos a la vostra esquerra, deixant el camí de pujada al castell, i investigar per la zona. Molta sort!!!

Esperem que us agradi el repte, la secció, el programa i la passejada que us hem preparat!   </groundspeak:long_description>

La part més antiga de la Vila s'estén vers al cim d'un turó haven sortejat els diferents nivells que el configuren. Gironella té tres colònies industrials amb quatre fàbriques tèxtils, cada una d'elles amb construccions arquitectòniques singulars que en conjunt formen el patrimoni arquitectònic més important de la Vila.

Trobareu una caixa petita amb espai per objectes petits. Des d'aquest lloc podreu contemplar una de les millors vistes al poble de Gironella.
PD: Aquest geocache forma part de la part pràctica del meu treball de recerca. Gràcies.</groundspeak:long_description>

one of the most impressive fortifications in Britain. They comprise a series of forts, strong points and ditches, designed to protect the country from invasion. They were created to augment the existing defences and protect the key port of Dover from both seaward and landward attack.
First given earthworks in 1779 against the planned invasion that year, the high ground west of Dover, England, now called Dover Western Heights, was properly fortified in 1804 when Lieutenant-Colonel William Twiss was instructed to modernise the existing defenses. This was part of a huge programme of fortification in response to Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom. 
To assist with the movement of troops between Dover Castle and the town defences Twiss made his case for building the Grand Shaft in the cliff:

‘...the new barracks.....are little more than 300 yards horizontally from the beach.....and about 180 feet (55 m) above high-water mark, but in order to communicate with them from the centre of town, on horseback the distance is nearly a mile and a half and to walk it about three-quarters of a mile, and all the roads unavoidably pass over ground more than 100 feet (30 m) above the barracks, besides the footpaths are so steep and chalky that a number of accidents will unavoidably happen during the wet weather and more especially after floods. I am therefore induced to recommend the construction of a shaft, with a triple staircase....the chief objective of which is the convenience and safety of troops....and may eventually be useful in sending reinforcements to troops or in affording them a secure retreat.’

Twiss’ plan was approved and building went ahead. The shaft was to be 26 feet (7.9 m) in diameter, 140 feet (43 m) deep with a 180 feet (55 m) gallery connecting the bottom of the shaft to Snargate Street, and all for under an estimated £4000.

The plan entailed building two bricklined shafts, one inside the other. In the outer would be built a triple staircase, the inner acting as a light well with ‘windows’ cut in its outer wall to illuminate the staircases. Apparently, by March 1805 only 40 feet (12 m) of the connecting gallery was left to dig and it is probable that the project was completed by 1807.

[edit] Drop RedoubtThe Drop Redoubt is one of the two forts on Western Heights, and is linked to the other, the Citadel, by a series of dry moats (the lines). It is, arguably, the most impressive and immediately noticeable feature on Dover’s Western Heights.

The artillery at the Redoubt faced mostly inland; it was intended to attack an invading force attempting to capture Dover from the rear.

The construction of the Redoubt was in two periods: the first being from 1804-1808 during the Napoleonic Wars, and the second from 1859-1864 following the recommendations of the 1859 Royal Commission.

[edit] First PeriodThe original form of the Drop Redoubt was a simple pentagon, formed by cutting trenches into the hillside and revetting (facing) them with brickwork. Thus, the Redoubt was a solid ‘island’ with barracks, magazine, and artillery, on top. Originally, it would have accommodated 200 troops but, by 1893, the numbers had been reduced to just 90.

A striking feature of the first period is the Soldiers’ Quarters – five bomb-proof casemates. These are parabolic in cross section and covered in a thick layer of earth to withstand the effect of mortar-bombs. The windows at the rear of each open into a trench, to protect them against blast.

[edit] Second PeriodThe rise of Napoleon III during the 1850s caused a further invasion scare, and a Royal Commission was set up in 1859 to investigate the defences of Britain. As a result, more work was deemed necessary at the Heights, and the Drop Redoubt had its defences improved. Caponiers were added to four of the corners of the existing fort (each with a stone staircase leading up to the top of the Redoubt), and gunrooms were built alongside two of them to allow fire along the North and South-East Lines. The original magazine was enlarged, and covered with a large earth bank as protection from mortar-fire.

The Officers’ Quarters, Guardroom, and cells also date from this period. They can be distinguished from the earlier work by the semi-circular shape of their arches.

During World War II, the Redoubt housed a squad of commandos that, in the event of invasion, would have been responsible for destroying Dover Harbour. Their presence was secret and the lines around the Redoubt were mined. Evidence of their stay are the sally ports in Caponiers 1 &amp; 2, and the short tunnel leading from the encircling line to Drop Redoubt Road.

The entrance to Drop Redoubt was via a bridge. The inner third of this was pivoted so that the Redoubt could be isolated. The pivot and the recess into which the bridge swung can still be seen, although the bridge has long since gone. In the 1980s, a temporary scaffolding bridge was built by the Army to enable access for guided tours of the Redoubt, but this was removed in the middle 1990s to prevent unauthorised entry and vandalism.

[edit] The ArmamentsOriginally, the Redoubt was to be equipped with 12 smooth bore 24-pounder guns (although only eleven are shown in the diagram overleaf) and two carronades. However, it is unlikely that many were installed since the Napoleonic War was almost over by the time construction was completed. In 1851, only three 24-pounders were in place, with six 12-pounder saluting guns and an 8” mortar.

Following the Second Period, eleven Armstrong 64-pounder Rifled Breech Loaders were installed on traversing carriages. These proved unsatisfactory and a return was made to muzzle loaders.

[edit] The Western PharosOn top of the Redoubt are the remains of a Roman Pharos, or lighthouse, which complemented the one that still exists in the grounds of Dover Castle. Both date from the 2nd Century AD, and would have been similar in design lighting the cliffs either side of the Roman Port of Dubris. The remains were lost during the first period of construction, but were re-discovered during the second period and restored to their original position as a rather shapeless lump of masonry. The foundations, though, can still be seen in the room immediately below.

Local names for the remains of the Pharos are the ‘Bredenstone’ or the ‘Devil’s Drop of Mortar’, and it was here, until 1804, that the Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports had their installation ceremony. It is likely that the name ‘Drop Redoubt’ originates from the local name given to the ruins of the Pharos.

[edit] TodayToday, much of the site is open as a country park. The barracks have been demolished; and the Citadel has been a Young Offenders' Institution - and is now Dover Immigration Removal Centre and so is off limits.

English Heritage own the Redoubt, along with the Grand Shaft spiral staircase owned by the Council, and is annually opened by the Western Heights Preservation Society.

The &quot;Grand Shaft Bowl&quot; located south of Drop Redoubt, is the proposed location for the new National War Memorial, which will commemorate, by name, all of the British Commonwealth casualties of World War I and World War II.

one of the most impressive fortifications in Britain. They comprise a series of forts, strong points and ditches, designed to protect the country from invasion. They were created to augment the existing defences and protect the key port of Dover from both seaward and landward attack.



First given earthworks in 1779 against the planned invasion that year, the high ground west of Dover, England, now called Dover Western Heights, was properly fortified in 1804 when Lieutenant-Colonel William Twiss was instructed to modernise the existing defenses. This was part of a huge programme of fortification in response to Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom. 
To assist with the movement of troops between Dover Castle and the town defences Twiss made his case for building the Grand Shaft in the cliff:

‘...the new barracks.....are little more than 300 yards horizontally from the beach.....and about 180 feet (55 m) above high-water mark, but in order to communicate with them from the centre of town, on horseback the distance is nearly a mile and a half and to walk it about three-quarters of a mile, and all the roads unavoidably pass over ground more than 100 feet (30 m) above the barracks, besides the footpaths are so steep and chalky that a number of accidents will unavoidably happen during the wet weather and more especially after floods. I am therefore induced to recommend the construction of a shaft, with a triple staircase....the chief objective of which is the convenience and safety of troops....and may eventually be useful in sending reinforcements to troops or in affording them a secure retreat.’

Twiss’ plan was approved and building went ahead. The shaft was to be 26 feet (7.9 m) in diameter, 140 feet (43 m) deep with a 180 feet (55 m) gallery connecting the bottom of the shaft to Snargate Street, and all for under an estimated £4000.

The plan entailed building two bricklined shafts, one inside the other. In the outer would be built a triple staircase, the inner acting as a light well with ‘windows’ cut in its outer wall to illuminate the staircases. Apparently, by March 1805 only 40 feet (12 m) of the connecting gallery was left to dig and it is probable that the project was completed by 1807.

[edit] Drop RedoubtThe Drop Redoubt is one of the two forts on Western Heights, and is linked to the other, the Citadel, by a series of dry moats (the lines). It is, arguably, the most impressive and immediately noticeable feature on Dover’s Western Heights.

The artillery at the Redoubt faced mostly inland; it was intended to attack an invading force attempting to capture Dover from the rear.

The construction of the Redoubt was in two periods: the first being from 1804-1808 during the Napoleonic Wars, and the second from 1859-1864 following the recommendations of the 1859 Royal Commission.

[edit] First PeriodThe original form of the Drop Redoubt was a simple pentagon, formed by cutting trenches into the hillside and revetting (facing) them with brickwork. Thus, the Redoubt was a solid ‘island’ with barracks, magazine, and artillery, on top. Originally, it would have accommodated 200 troops but, by 1893, the numbers had been reduced to just 90.

A striking feature of the first period is the Soldiers’ Quarters – five bomb-proof casemates. These are parabolic in cross section and covered in a thick layer of earth to withstand the effect of mortar-bombs. The windows at the rear of each open into a trench, to protect them against blast.

[edit] Second PeriodThe rise of Napoleon III during the 1850s caused a further invasion scare, and a Royal Commission was set up in 1859 to investigate the defences of Britain. As a result, more work was deemed necessary at the Heights, and the Drop Redoubt had its defences improved. Caponiers were added to four of the corners of the existing fort (each with a stone staircase leading up to the top of the Redoubt), and gunrooms were built alongside two of them to allow fire along the North and South-East Lines. The original magazine was enlarged, and covered with a large earth bank as protection from mortar-fire.

The Officers’ Quarters, Guardroom, and cells also date from this period. They can be distinguished from the earlier work by the semi-circular shape of their arches.

During World War II, the Redoubt housed a squad of commandos that, in the event of invasion, would have been responsible for destroying Dover Harbour. Their presence was secret and the lines around the Redoubt were mined. Evidence of their stay are the sally ports in Caponiers 1 &amp; 2, and the short tunnel leading from the encircling line to Drop Redoubt Road.

The entrance to Drop Redoubt was via a bridge. The inner third of this was pivoted so that the Redoubt could be isolated. The pivot and the recess into which the bridge swung can still be seen, although the bridge has long since gone. In the 1980s, a temporary scaffolding bridge was built by the Army to enable access for guided tours of the Redoubt, but this was removed in the middle 1990s to prevent unauthorised entry and vandalism.

[edit] The ArmamentsOriginally, the Redoubt was to be equipped with 12 smooth bore 24-pounder guns (although only eleven are shown in the diagram overleaf) and two carronades. However, it is unlikely that many were installed since the Napoleonic War was almost over by the time construction was completed. In 1851, only three 24-pounders were in place, with six 12-pounder saluting guns and an 8” mortar.

Following the Second Period, eleven Armstrong 64-pounder Rifled Breech Loaders were installed on traversing carriages. These proved unsatisfactory and a return was made to muzzle loaders.

[edit] The Western PharosOn top of the Redoubt are the remains of a Roman Pharos, or lighthouse, which complemented the one that still exists in the grounds of Dover Castle. Both date from the 2nd Century AD, and would have been similar in design lighting the cliffs either side of the Roman Port of Dubris. The remains were lost during the first period of construction, but were re-discovered during the second period and restored to their original position as a rather shapeless lump of masonry. The foundations, though, can still be seen in the room immediately below.

Local names for the remains of the Pharos are the ‘Bredenstone’ or the ‘Devil’s Drop of Mortar’, and it was here, until 1804, that the Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports had their installation ceremony. It is likely that the name ‘Drop Redoubt’ originates from the local name given to the ruins of the Pharos.

it's a Puzzle to what is going on inside the big tent?

Well the big tent has now gone and the castle has been unveiled,
and it is the same as it was 18 months ago, so I have no eider what
they have been doing all this time under the tent, The gardens have
changed totality.

I have ask the head gardener if I will be aloud to put the cache
back in the new gardens and I am sorry to say I'm not (shame) and
they are going to be locked at night when they are re-opened.

Well this is a fort micro using a RPB (red phone box) to get the
numbers. Whitstable, just about has a castle, so that just fits and
is only it's gate house that looks old.

I have moved the final Cache out of
the grounds up the road by about 85m.
I have changed the clue to show this.

So then FM RPB. it's easy get the numbers form the phone box and
put them in the puzzle below, and that's it, easy yes, well no ! !

The Phone box is in the middle of the town you may have passed
it on your way here But please Do Not stop outside the RED BOX as
the TW will give you a ticket for 30 or 60 quid and we dont want to
many of them the Red phone box is at 
N 51° 21.499 E 001° 01.481 

Not unlike a 35mm film pot inside a pot just a bit bigger to
keep the log dry, So please rehide as found, for the next finder.

add 36 to the last 3 of N
add 65 to the last 3 of E 
do hope that clear

This is the Bear's third incarnation and hopefully he will continue in his hiding place for much longer than his predecessors!

A small cache, just off the footpath.

I've left the log book from the last incarnation in the cache for the time being but, as this is a new cache, feel free to claim a FTF.

You can park neatly at the beginning of the footpath, as long as you're not too long.

Good luck and enjoy this lovely spot.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Part of a series of 13 caches on National Trust land at Dunwich Heath, Suffolk.

For a short circular route, follow caches 1 - 4a.  This will take approximately 45 minutes.
For a medium circular route, follow caches 1 - 6, then skip to 12.  This will take approximately 1 hour 15 minutes.
For the long circular route, follow caches 1 - 12 (missing out 4a).  This will take approximately 2 hours 15 minutes. 

This geocache is one of a series set up by the National Trust as a new way for people to explore Dunwich Heath. Focusing on wildlife, countryside habitats and WW2 military history, the geocaches are all located adjacent to public rights of way or permissive routes that are freely accessible at all times.

Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as an interesting factfile about the cache location. For this reason some items in the cache are not swappable. Please do not swap any items marked as ‘National Trust’ or labelled as ‘not a swap’. However, in addition, there may be other items left by fellow geocachers that are intended as a swap – please feel free to swap these.

All geocaches are a short distance from a path; the caches may be camouflaged with sticks, so please replace the camouflage after you have finished with the cache.

Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:
1. Being a heathland habitat the majority of the site is covered in heather. The caches will always be accessible by following the main footpath routes. Please do not walk through the heather as this will disturb the wildlife.
2. Please be aware there might be stinging nettles, brambles and rough or prickly vegetation.
3. If you are going underneath trees or bushes, beware of low branches.
4. Some footpaths might be muddy during the winter or wet weather. Stout footwear or wellies are recommended.

This geocache is one of a series set up by the National Trust as a new way for people to explore Dunwich Heath. Focusing on wildlife, countryside habitats and WW2 military history, the geocaches are all located adjacent to public rights of way or permissive routes that are freely accessible at all times.

Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as an interesting factfile about the cache location. For this reason some items in the cache are not swappable. Please do not swap any items marked as ‘National Trust’ or labelled as ‘not a swap’. However, in addition, there may be other items left by fellow geocachers that are intended as a swap – please feel free to swap these.

All geocaches are a short distance from a path; the caches may be camouflaged with sticks, so please replace the camouflage after you have finished with the cache.

Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:
1. Being a heathland habitat the majority of the site is covered in heather. The caches will always be accessible by following the main footpath routes. Please do not walk through the heather as this will disturb the wildlife.
2. Please be aware there might be stinging nettles, brambles and rough or prickly vegetation.
3. If you are going underneath trees or bushes, beware of low branches.
4. Some footpaths might be muddy during the winter or wet weather. Stout footwear or wellies are recommended.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Part of a series of caches on National Trust land at Dunwich Heath, Suffolk.

This geocache is one of a series set up by the National Trust as a new way for people to explore Dunwich Heath. Focusing on wildlife, countryside habitats and WW2 military history, the geocaches are all located adjacent to public rights of way or permissive routes that are freely accessible at all times.

Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as an interesting factfile about the cache location. For this reason some items in the cache are not swappable. Please do not swap any items marked as ‘National Trust’ or labelled as ‘not a swap’. However, in addition, there may be other items left by fellow geocachers that are intended as a swap – please feel free to swap these.

All geocaches are a short distance from a path; the caches may be camouflaged with sticks, so please replace the camouflage after you have finished with the cache.

Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:
1. Being a heathland habitat the majority of the site is covered in heather. The caches will always be accessible by following the main footpath routes. Please do not walk through the heather as this will disturb the wildlife.
2. Please be aware there might be stinging nettles, brambles and rough or prickly vegetation.
3. If you are going underneath trees or bushes, beware of low branches.
4. Some footpaths might be muddy during the winter or wet weather. Stout footwear or wellies are recommended.

A lovely ride with caches designed to encourage people along the route and keep them going around the approx 25 mile route. A variety of hides of different sizes, with nothing smaller than a bison tube. 

The cycle ride can be started and finished at any point and uses mainly smaller, less busy roads, but occasionally  crosses or runs along larger busier roads, so care should be taken at all times!

The clues are sometimes in the titles.

Continue along the cycle route to find:
GC2QVF9 The one that got away
GC2QVKT To catch a cacher

After these two  follow the cycle route to the edge of Reydon. Here you have the choice of turning left into Cox's Lane to begin the return leg of this caching series or continuing on into Southwold.</groundspeak:long_description>

You are looking for a magnetic 35mm film canister containing a log book. Bring your own pen.

Please take care - traffic can zoom along the road - keep a very close eye on small children.



Halesworth airfield was built as a Class A bomber base in 1942. In the July the airfield saw its first operational unit. However, instead of bombers the 56th Fighter Group (Zemke's Wolfpack) of the United States 8th Army Air Force were stationed there. Using its prime position and size the 56th became one of the leading fighter groups in the 8th and by the end of the war was one of the most successful in aerial combat. They left Halesworth in April 1944. 
A month later the 489th Bomb Group arrived and flew its first mission just before June. Flying B24 Liberators they played a full part in the build up to and during D Day on 6th June 1944. From July they switched to strategic offensive bombing until November, when they ceased operations to return to America.

Between January and June in 1945 the 5th Emergency Rescue Squadron operated from the base flying war weary P47s and B17s. Their mission was to carry dinghies and smoke markers to aid downed crews found at sea. The 5th ERS also flew the OA-I0A Catalina flying boats. During this time 496th Fighter Training group shared the base flying the P51 Mustang.

In June 1945 Royal Air Force Bomber Command gained control of the base, before it was handed over to the Royal Navy in early August to be used as an advanced flying training base, HMS Sparrowhawk.

The airfield closed for flying in February 1946.

Today the airfield is owned by Bernard Matthews and is still closed for flying. The Halesworth Airfield Museum and Memorials on the edge of the airfield keeps the memories of the airmen and crews it hosted alive.

A lovely ride with caches designed to encourage people along the route and keep them going around the approx 25 mile route. A variety of hides of different sizes, with nothing smaller than a bison tube. 

The cycle ride can be started and finished at any point and uses mainly smaller, less busy roads, but occasionally  crosses or runs along larger busier roads, so care should be taken at all times!

The clues are sometimes in the titles.

Continue along the road to find GC2T70J St Lawrence South Cove church micro. After which take the next right to head towards Covehithe and a Bassett cache (GC2Q5E0 A sting in the tail) nearby to try and find which I would recommend.

At Covehithe you will find:
GC13FXQ The End of the Road (Earth Cache)
and
GC2T5F4 St Andrews Covehithe church Micro</groundspeak:long_description>

Absolutley no need to move anything to find this - it can be found by looking and/or feeling. Well hidden, but no need to destroy the foliage which is probably holding it together!

A lovely ride with caches designed to encourage people along the route and keep them going around the approx 25 mile route. A variety of hides of different sizes, with nothing smaller than a bison tube. 

The cycle ride can be started and finished at any point and uses mainly smaller, less busy roads, but occasionally  crosses or runs along larger busier roads, so care should be taken at all times!



The clues are sometimes in the titles.

Continue long the cycle route to find GC2WDWZ Sotterley Chapel church micro.</groundspeak:long_description>

is hidden on Beccles common and involves a walk of about 1.5 miles
in a circular route. Paths are suitable for buggies, wheelchairs
etc but one or two of the markers and the final are off main paths.
The common has a golf course at its centre so please stick to
marked paths and avoid crossing fairways and greens. At NO point do
you have to cross any fences or go near roads.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Warning: the paths and certain areas maybe muddy after rain and
during the winter months!
&lt;p&gt;The coordinates given are for the first of a series of
orienteering markers which are placed around Beccles Common. You
will need to note the number at the bottom right corner of each of
the markers.!&lt;/p&gt;

The caches vary in type and size from a Bison tube upwards. Some have space for small trading items and or coins and travel bugs, but please bring a pencil with you!

Some of the hides are quite sneaky and will require thinking about but the clue is in the name!

All caches are placed along the margins of the river. 

Although most Broads cruisers cannot get under the bridge at Beccles, there is a number of craft up and down the river especially during the summer. Stay safe and remember to wear a lifejacket when on the water!</groundspeak:long_description>

 This is a quick cache and dash with on street parking adjacent the cache. Easy access, suitable for wheel chair users. You are looking for a magnetic nano so please bring a pen/pencil. Please try to keep log entries small so as not to fill the log too quickly!

If you have time it is worth taking a seat here for a while to enjoy the views.

Better still why not take a walk to find some of my other nearby caches including Spike The Bike and the Animal Vegetable Mineral series.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;As the title suggests this is a series of caches that could be
either animal, vegetable or mineral. No clues are given as the fun
is in identifying the caches.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;These caches are placed in and around the Gunton Warren Local
Nature Reserve and will take you along a walk across the cliff tops
and along the North Denes beach near Gunton, Lowestoft. There is
often space to park on the B1385 along the clifftop or if you
prefer you can use the surface carpark at the bottom of Links Road.
Caches are generally accessible although it could be hard going for
wheel chair users along the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the walks and the views!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please&lt;/b&gt; be careful with some of the caches as they could
be fragile, replace exactly as found and don't forget to bring a
pencil/pen to record your finds. Remember that as some of the log
papers are small, try not to fill it all up in one go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular cache is located along the beach. There is no
need to tamper with any equipment near the cache site. Please
replace exactly as found. Watch out for anglers and dog walkers as
you hunt for this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are lovely woodlands with lots of snowdrops and then
bluebells in spring. You'll also see lots of wildbirds and hear
woodpeckers drilling in spring. Muntjac deer, red fox and bats may
also be seen here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great for dogwalkers and families so stealth may be required,
although we did pick a more quiet location.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;Please respect these woodlands and keep to the well maintained
paths.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggest parking at end of Gunton Church Lane (N052°30.030
E001°44.700) and it is a short walk on well maintained woodland
paths from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need to go off the beaten track. Please be mindful
not to disturb the wildlife or trample on any plants near the
paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the tree cover you may expect gps signals to be
affected, but the clue should take you straight to the cache if you
need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is purposely designed as an easy find with the aim of
encouraging geocachers to visit and enjoy the woodlands. It is a
small plastic container about the size of a dessert bowl, large
enough to contain small items and travel bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please replace exactly as found, as you can appreciate this is a
popular place for muggles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benches and picnic tables are available if you want to sit for a
while and enjoy the surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache in Trash Out&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
These woodlands are maintained by a dedicated team of volunteers
who have spent many thousands of hours getting these woods into the
wonderful condition they are in now. It is very unlikely that you
will find any litter here, but if you do, please take the time to
put it in one of the nearby bins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;GW239XV - Gunton Wood Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 52° 30.030 E 001° 44.700&lt;br/&gt;Suggest parking at end of Gunton Church Lane then just a short walk onwell maintained woodland paths.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;As the title suggests this is a series of caches that could be
either animal, vegetable or mineral. No clues are given as the fun
is in identifying the caches.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;These caches are placed in and around the Gunton Warren Local
Nature Reserve and will take you along a walk across the cliff tops
and along the North Denes beach near Gunton, Lowestoft. There is
often space to park on the B1385 along the clifftop or if you
prefer you can use the surface carpark at the bottom of Links Road.
Caches are generally accessible although it could be hard going for
wheel chair users along the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the walks and the views!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please&lt;/b&gt; be careful with some of the caches as they could
be fragile, replace exactly as found and don't forget to bring a
pencil/pen to record your finds. Remember that as some of the log
papers are small, try not to fill it all up in one go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular cache is located near a sports field and a golf
course so may need to use some stealth due to presence of muggles
nearby. The cache has moved from it's original position as it
turned out to be just too exposed, I replaced the cache for a
similar but much better version (home made this time!) and it is
more secluded now. But you may still need to use your hunting
skills here - the GPS signal can be a little variable here due to
cover but this will just add to the fun of the hunt and the
satisfaction of the find! I have checked the co-ordinates numerous
times before relisting the cache.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This particular cache is located near the sea defence with
access via a walkway down from the B1385, although you may prefer

and a more enjoyable ramble. Watch out for anglers and dog walkers
as you hunt for this one.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Site of Hovercraft Column in Somerleyton Village. Parking on street very close by. 

 I’m not normally one to get sentimental over engineering accomplishments, but this quirky local project caught my attention and warrants a visit.

Somerleyton claims to be the home of the hovercraft and celebrates this with a 6m stone column that holds aloft a bronze model of the first hovercraft, invented by Sir Christopher Cockerell and tested on the lawns of Somerleyton Hall in the 1950s.

Planning for the column started in 2004. The project took 2 years in construction and was unveiled on 4th June 2010. More information about the project and the history of the development of the hovercraft can be found at www.hovercraftsomerleyton.org.uk.

This cache is a small tupperware type container, containing log book, pencil and various swaps

The cache was relocated following improvement works at the site prior to the column's official 'unveiling' ceremony as the tree this was hiding in was completely uprooted and shredded to allow better views of the column. Now relocated and in a more discrete area.</groundspeak:long_description>

St Matthias' Church, built by the 11th Century, has a Saxon round tower constructed mainly of flints. The tower has a Norman bell stage containing two bells from the 15th and 17th Centuries. 
The nave is also built of flints, probably in the Saxon period. The heavily-buttressed chancel was rebuilt in red brick in 1838 with gothick windows.

If any body would like to expand to this series please do, I would just ask that you could let Sadexploration know first so he can keep track of the Church numbers and names to avoid duplication.

Parking for a car is available just outside the gate to the churchyard. Be careful where you park so as not to obstruct the road - some big buses come through here!

Thurlton All Saints is a Norman Church that was greatly rebuilt in the 15th Century. 
The tower was built in the 15th Century and probably replaced an earlier round tower. It is constructed of knapped flint and freestone, and has a fine base-course decorated with flush-work panelling. The tower contains a ring of five bells, all cast in 1632, by the Brend bellfoundry in Norwich. The tenor bell weighs approximately 10 cwt. Frame and fittings were installed by Day of Eye and his name can be seen on the blue and gold rope-guides inside the tower.

Most of the windows are from the 15th Century, as is the north porch.

The church is thatched with Norfolk reed.

There are houses and a school opposite the church so stealth will be required at times during the day!

The Church at Norton Subcourse has a Norman round tower with a peal of six bells, and a nave and chancel which were widened, probably in the early 14th Century. It is designated to St Mary and St Margaret. 
Originally the church would have been thatched. The slate roof arrived by barge at a nearby wharf and were transported to the church by wagon. The wagon was pulled by a horse which had suffered the loss of one eye during the Crimean War of 1855!

St Edmund Church in Fritton is a Norman, round towered, thatched church. Unusually for a Norman church it has an apse. The chancel is strangely offcentre of the nave - when the nave (but not the chancel!) was widened, the original north wall was retained and the other wall rebuilt about three metres further south! 
Fabulous wall paintings are throughout the interior. Well worth a visit. The church is open every day.

The cache is a small, clear, clip-lock box containing a log book and pencil and, at the time of placing, a FTF magnet for the lucky FTF'er, a small soap and a TB. Room for small TBs and GCs and a few small swapables. Happy hunting!

The British Gas Beacon at Gorleston was built in 1999 by Seatrax Fabrication in Great Yarmouth. It was floated down the Thames in London on a barge for the Millennium Celebrations. At 9.45pm on the 31st December 1999 the Queen lit the flame. The flame leapt 3 metres above the Beacon (the biggest of a chain of 4,000 nationwide). It returned to Gorleston after the Millennium celebrations and now marks the entrance to Beacon Park. 

The beacon is the height of two double-decker buses, the width of a tennis court and weighs 25 tons.

Please visit the church as it is historically very interesting, having a tower on the south side rather than west as normal.

The church is locked, however the key is easily available by calling in at The Old Rectory nearby.</groundspeak:long_description>
