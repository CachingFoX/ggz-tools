            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;[eng]&lt;/b&gt; At this fascinating location near Sant Josep you'll
find the leftovers of the &quot;Festival Club&quot;, a big concrete
amphitheatre that opened in 1972. The venue closed only 2 years
after the opening because of the fuel crisis and the subsequent
missing tourists. A few decades later, the nature captures its
ground back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can park your car at the parking coordinates. Please have a
look at the spoiler photo (&lt;a href=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/8d81a812-347a-4ad8-88cf-8e17cf874cad.jpg&quot;&gt;Spoiler&lt;/a&gt;), because there are
hundreds possible hiding places. &lt;b&gt;We would appreciate it very
much, if you would be so kind as to take a photo of this abandoned
place and upload it to your log.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;[cat]&lt;/b&gt; En aquest lloc fascinant prop de Sant Josep trobareu
les restes de la &quot;Festival Club&quot;, un gran concret amfiteatre, que
va obrir les portes el 1972. El lloc tancat només 2 anys després de
l'obertura, a causa de la crisi del combustible i la posterior
falten turistes. Unes dècades més tard, la naturalesa de la seva
captura terra de nou.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pot aparcar el seu vehicle en les coordenades d'estacionament. Si
us plau, tenir un cop d'ull a la foto spoiler (&lt;a href=&quot;http://img.geocaching.com/cache/8d81a812-347a-4ad8-88cf-8e17cf874cad.jpg&quot;&gt;Spoiler&lt;/a&gt;), perquè hi ha centenars
possibles amagatalls. &lt;b&gt;Li agrairíem molt tant, si vostè fos tan
amable com per fer una foto d'aquest abandonament lloc i el
carregui en el seu registre.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">El Parc de la Ciutat és un dels pulmons de la ciutat de Tarragona. Tot i que no es tracta d'un espai molt gran, doncs només té unes 4,5 hectàrees, és un lloc esplèndid per passejar-hi, i com no, per posar-hi un catxé.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Al parc hi podreu trobar el Quintà de Sant Rafel i el seu antic pou, un edifici modernista dissenyat el 1912 per l'arquitecte Julian María Fossas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;També s'hi troben les restes d'una vil·la romana, amb una petita necròpolis. Disposa també d'una zona de jocs infantils i una glorieta donada a la ciutat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hi ha gran varietat d'arbres i plantes, la majoria mediterrànies, com les alzines i els roures, i a la plaça central un gran lledoner. També hi ha zones amb magnòlies i tamarius i al davant de l'edifici de la Quinta de Sant Rafel dues palmeres washingtònia monumentals de més de 20 metres d'alçada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Al parc s'hi han instal·lat unes tanques d'estil modernista per poder-ne restringir l'us nocturn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Posem aquest fàcil catxé a disposició del públic aprofitant les festes de Santa Tecla 2010 que comencen ja aquest cap de setmana. Esperem que us agradi el lloc, i també el catxé.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tarragona, 18/09/2010.</groundspeak:long_description>

EL TÍPIC CATXÉ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dintre del catxé en qüestió trobareu (a més d'altres objectes que van deixar abans altres persones) un targetó groc i negre amb una &quot;frase encriptada&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seguiu les instruccions i, amb una mica més de sort, a la primera persona que ens faci arribar la frase desencriptada al mur de Facebook de EL TÍPIC PROGRAMA li obsequiarem amb un  detall molt lúdic: un dels jocs de taula que presentem a LA TÍPICA SECCIÓ DE JOCS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Passem a donar detalls de com trobar el típic catxé: de camí al Castell d'Eramprunyà, sortint des de l'Ermita de Bruguers, trobareu una pedra al bellmig del camí amb una taca de pintura vermella (no continueu pujant!). És moment de desviar-vos a la vostra esquerra, deixant el camí de pujada al castell, i investigar per la zona. Molta sort!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Esperem que us agradi el repte, la secció, el programa i la passejada que us hem preparat!   </groundspeak:long_description>

La part més antiga de la Vila s'estén vers al cim d'un turó haven sortejat els diferents nivells que el configuren. Gironella té tres colònies industrials amb quatre fàbriques tèxtils, cada una d'elles amb construccions arquitectòniques singulars que en conjunt formen el patrimoni arquitectònic més important de la Vila.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trobareu una caixa petita amb espai per objectes petits. Des d'aquest lloc podreu contemplar una de les millors vistes al poble de Gironella.&lt;br/&gt;PD: Aquest geocache forma part de la part pràctica del meu treball de recerca.

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fontaine et lavoir du Théron. Son nom
d'origine celtique veut dire : &quot; Source fontaine &quot; (qui ne tarit
jamais).&lt;br /&gt;
Elle alimente un lavoir et un abreuvoir en pierre, aux dimensions
exceptionnelles.&lt;br /&gt;
Vous pourrez remarquer sur ce site, deux dalles gravées sur le sol
: elles proviennent de l'ancien cimetière !&lt;br /&gt;
et.. un &quot; Travail &quot; en bois (plus récent que le lavoir) servait à
ferrer les bœufs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
 

&amp;gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Le lavoir
du Théron ...Hier&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Le lavoir
du Théron ...Aujourd'hui&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Respectez les lieux, ne détériorez
pas les murs, le cas échéant, refermez bien les clôtures
!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Les caches sont faciles d'accès, et
les indices sont là pour vous aider dans vos
recherches.....Merci &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nous
vous souhaitons beaucoup de &quot;Found it&quot;, et un excellent
séjour.&lt;/strong&gt;

Cette cache est juste une promenade courte de la terrain du Lac d'Uzurat. Les bords du plan d'eau sont très bien aménagés avec un sentier permettant d'en faire le tour lors d'une balade à pied ou à vélo, des tables de pique-nique, des bancs, et des espaces verts pour s'étendre au soleil.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is only a short walk from the lake in a green area of Limoges with leisure activities including walking, cycling, camping and a large play area for children.&lt;br /&gt;
The commercial centre is also not far with it's many shops and services.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;La villa Gallo-Romaine de Brachaud&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(voir photo info)&lt;br /&gt;
The Gallo-Roman site of Brachaud is worth visiting if you have the time. You can park at the listed parking and walk to the site after finding the cache if you wish.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The area is enclosed by a perimeter fence and cannot be accessed but you can still see these interesting archaeological remains from close by.&lt;/p&gt;

Madeleine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ce hameau, commune de la Souterraine, abrite une vieille et
charmante petite église : l'église Sainte Madeleine, qui sert
encore aujourd'hui pour de rares célébrations. Elle est ouverte en
permanence, vous permettant ainsi d'apprécier son atmosphère.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Datant du 16émé siècle, elle fut, dans sa partie haute, démollie
par les Anglais, puis reconstruite. On distingue facilement la
réhausse à l'intérieur.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elle comporte 9 pierres tombales sculptées et armoriées dans
l'allée centrale, dont l'une est attribuée à la famille De la
Barre, comte de Bridiers au cours du 16émé siècle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Une statuette en bois de 50 cm de haut, inscrite aux monuments
historiques, représentant sans doute Sainte Madeleine, ornait
auparavant l'intérieur.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A l'extérieur de multiples visages vous regardent, à la base de la
toiture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cette cache est une nano, consistant en un cylindre métallique
d'environ 1,5cm de haut , de 1 cm de diamètre. Prévoyez votre stylo
pour signer le logbook.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Le hint donne la solution ou presque.&lt;br /&gt;

Il est vraisemblable que cette extension du XVIe siècle a allongé l'édifice et remplacé une abside Romane hémicirculaire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le pignon Est et les façades Sud et Nord sont percées de baies à réseau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le clocher est bâti au nord de la nef Romane dans le prolongement de la façade occidentale. L'absence de liaisonnement des murs Est et Ouest à celui de la nef indique bien qu'il s'agit d'une construction entièrement postérieure à la nef, sans doute à la fin du Moyen-âge (XVe siècle). Son couronnement est cependant beaucoup plus tardif.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;En partie basse de la façade Romane Nord, on remarque des pierres de taille alignées en saillie qui pourraient être les supports d'une charpente en appentis. On note également la présence d'une ancienne porte et d'une niche.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astuce pour le Log: afin de faciliter son extraction du container par les suivants, placez le d'abord dans le bouchon avant de refermer le tube...

Ce moulin est en parfait état de marche.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Les moulins à eau avaient, jadis, une à trois paires de meules entraînées par une roue à aubes disposée selon la hauteur des chutes d'eau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mentionné sous le nom de Courgaing en 1594 et Courgains en 1604.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Il ne se visite plus depuis la disparition du dernier meunier.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;En face, cous apercevrez le chateau d'Ancise.&lt;br/&gt;Château construit au XVe siècle, qui fut remanié au XIXe siècle. On trouve sur les terres la métairie d'Ancises en 1574; la seigneurie d'Ancise avec un château en 1586, M. de Mérinville, évèque de Chartres (1710-1747), permit d'y élever une chapelle, à condition que le seigneur du lieu fasse une rente de huit setiers de blé au grand séminaire de Chartres. Au cours des siècles, Ancise s'est appelé Ensizes en 1396, Anscises en 1403, Ansises en 1568 (charte de la Seigneurie de Courtalain), Ansizes en 1487, Ancises en 1552 (charte du chapitre de Saint-André de Châteaudun), puis Ancizes en 1574 (notaire d'Illiers).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache également en ligne sur Geocaching.com</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ce château dépendait de la seigneurie de la Roche Bernard, bâtie sur une côte nord-est du Loir au-delà des prés (non loin du château).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Celui-ci est mentionné : Toreillum en 1191&lt;br /&gt;
Toriant en 1241&lt;br /&gt;
Toriau en 1247&lt;br /&gt;
Toreau vers 1450&lt;br /&gt;
Taureau en 1526&lt;br /&gt;
Thoreau actuellement&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Il ne reste plus grand-chose des plus anciens bâtiments datant du 13 siècle. Dans la cour, on peut voir : une grange, un pigeonnier, une porte armoriée, une tour (tour Gabrielle d’Estrées, peut-être tour de guet, dominant la Vallée et le Loir). Le site est très agréable.&lt;br /&gt;
Cette cour pouvait être fermée par des portes, des supports sont encore visibles dans la pierre.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Henri IV venait à Thoreau voir sa favorite. Elle eut avec lui plusieurs enfants légitimes dont César, duc de Vendôme. &lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Une fontaine et un lavoir dans un endroit hors du temps...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;La fontaine est connue depuis le 11ème siècle. Son griffon a été récemment restauré. Elle alimente le lavoir, puis le Fonteny, gros ruisseau limpide issu du hameau de la fontaine Doudée, qui se jette un peu plus loin dans le Loir. Son débit, respectable, est estimé à 50l/s. Elle pourrait être une résurgence des eaux issues du plateau de Lanneray.&lt;br/&gt;On découvre ici des toits de chaume et les ruines d’une chapelle (St Pierre, de Vouvray), où aurait été inhumé François de la Noue, dit Bras-de-fer, illustre lieutenant du Prince de Condé. Il était calviniste et, selon la légende, devant cette hérésie, on exhuma ses restes de la chapelle et on les jeta dans le Loir. Histoire digne de cette période troublée, mais peu probable, le dit Bras de fer ayant trouvé la mort en Bretagne en assiégeant Lamballe, et le rapatriement de sa dépouille n'ayant jamais été attesté.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pour voir la chapelle, poursuivre vers le sud. (Possible en voiture)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Astuce pour le log: pour faciliter son extraction par les suivants, le replacer d'abord dans le bouchon avant de refermer le tube.

Spent the day in the Calais region having taken a day trip via the Chunnel. We probably prefer the ferry for the holiday experience but you can't argue with an hour saved each way for a day trip.

This cache was intersting and not what I was expecting so well worthwhile. TFTC

They comprise a series of forts, strong points and ditches, designed to protect the country from invasion. They were created to augment the existing defences and protect the key port of Dover from both seaward and landward attack.&lt;br/&gt;First given earthworks in 1779 against the planned invasion that year, the high ground west of Dover, England, now called Dover Western Heights, was properly fortified in 1804 when Lieutenant-Colonel William Twiss was instructed to modernise the existing defenses. This was part of a huge programme of fortification in response to Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom. &lt;br/&gt;To assist with the movement of troops between Dover Castle and the town defences Twiss made his case for building the Grand Shaft in the cliff:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‘...the new barracks.....are little more than 300 yards horizontally from the beach.....and about 180 feet (55 m) above high-water mark, but in order to communicate with them from the centre of town, on horseback the distance is nearly a mile and a half and to walk it about three-quarters of a mile, and all the roads unavoidably pass over ground more than 100 feet (30 m) above the barracks, besides the footpaths are so steep and chalky that a number of accidents will unavoidably happen during the wet weather and more especially after floods. I am therefore induced to recommend the construction of a shaft, with a triple staircase....the chief objective of which is the convenience and safety of troops....and may eventually be useful in sending reinforcements to troops or in affording them a secure retreat.’&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twiss’ plan was approved and building went ahead. The shaft was to be 26 feet (7.9 m) in diameter, 140 feet (43 m) deep with a 180 feet (55 m) gallery connecting the bottom of the shaft to Snargate Street, and all for under an estimated £4000.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plan entailed building two bricklined shafts, one inside the other. In the outer would be built a triple staircase, the inner acting as a light well with ‘windows’ cut in its outer wall to illuminate the staircases. Apparently, by March 1805 only 40 feet (12 m) of the connecting gallery was left to dig and it is probable that the project was completed by 1807.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[edit] Drop RedoubtThe Drop Redoubt is one of the two forts on Western Heights, and is linked to the other, the Citadel, by a series of dry moats (the lines). It is, arguably, the most impressive and immediately noticeable feature on Dover’s Western Heights.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The artillery at the Redoubt faced mostly inland; it was intended to attack an invading force attempting to capture Dover from the rear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The construction of the Redoubt was in two periods: the first being from 1804-1808 during the Napoleonic Wars, and the second from 1859-1864 following the recommendations of the 1859 Royal Commission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[edit] First PeriodThe original form of the Drop Redoubt was a simple pentagon, formed by cutting trenches into the hillside and revetting (facing) them with brickwork. Thus, the Redoubt was a solid ‘island’ with barracks, magazine, and artillery, on top. Originally, it would have accommodated 200 troops but, by 1893, the numbers had been reduced to just 90.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A striking feature of the first period is the Soldiers’ Quarters – five bomb-proof casemates. These are parabolic in cross section and covered in a thick layer of earth to withstand the effect of mortar-bombs. The windows at the rear of each open into a trench, to protect them against blast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[edit] Second PeriodThe rise of Napoleon III during the 1850s caused a further invasion scare, and a Royal Commission was set up in 1859 to investigate the defences of Britain. As a result, more work was deemed necessary at the Heights, and the Drop Redoubt had its defences improved. Caponiers were added to four of the corners of the existing fort (each with a stone staircase leading up to the top of the Redoubt), and gunrooms were built alongside two of them to allow fire along the North and South-East Lines. The original magazine was enlarged, and covered with a large earth bank as protection from mortar-fire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Officers’ Quarters, Guardroom, and cells also date from this period. They can be distinguished from the earlier work by the semi-circular shape of their arches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During World War II, the Redoubt housed a squad of commandos that, in the event of invasion, would have been responsible for destroying Dover Harbour. Their presence was secret and the lines around the Redoubt were mined. Evidence of their stay are the sally ports in Caponiers 1 &amp; 2, and the short tunnel leading from the encircling line to Drop Redoubt Road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entrance to Drop Redoubt was via a bridge. The inner third of this was pivoted so that the Redoubt could be isolated. The pivot and the recess into which the bridge swung can still be seen, although the bridge has long since gone. In the 1980s, a temporary scaffolding bridge was built by the Army to enable access for guided tours of the Redoubt, but this was removed in the middle 1990s to prevent unauthorised entry and vandalism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[edit] The ArmamentsOriginally, the Redoubt was to be equipped with 12 smooth bore 24-pounder guns (although only eleven are shown in the diagram overleaf) and two carronades. However, it is unlikely that many were installed since the Napoleonic War was almost over by the time construction was completed. In 1851, only three 24-pounders were in place, with six 12-pounder saluting guns and an 8” mortar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the Second Period, eleven Armstrong 64-pounder Rifled Breech Loaders were installed on traversing carriages. These proved unsatisfactory and a return was made to muzzle loaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[edit] The Western PharosOn top of the Redoubt are the remains of a Roman Pharos, or lighthouse, which complemented the one that still exists in the grounds of Dover Castle. Both date from the 2nd Century AD, and would have been similar in design lighting the cliffs either side of the Roman Port of Dubris. The remains were lost during the first period of construction, but were re-discovered during the second period and restored to their original position as a rather shapeless lump of masonry. The foundations, though, can still be seen in the room immediately below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Local names for the remains of the Pharos are the ‘Bredenstone’ or the ‘Devil’s Drop of Mortar’, and it was here, until 1804, that the Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports had their installation ceremony. It is likely that the name ‘Drop Redoubt’ originates from the local name given to the ruins of the Pharos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[edit] TodayToday, much of the site is open as a country park. The barracks have been demolished; and the Citadel has been a Young Offenders' Institution - and is now Dover Immigration Removal Centre and so is off limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;English Heritage own the Redoubt, along with the Grand Shaft spiral staircase owned by the Council, and is annually opened by the Western Heights Preservation Society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &quot;Grand Shaft Bowl&quot; located south of Drop Redoubt, is the proposed location for the new National War Memorial, which will commemorate, by name, all of the British Commonwealth casualties of World War I and World War II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Alternatively you can park at St Margarets Bay where the car park is chargeable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a micro cache and is located at the South Forland Lighthouse. The lighthouse is Victorian and was put to rest in 1988 and is now in the ownership of the National Trust. Parking at Dover is 45 minute walk, but is worth it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not in the NT grounds and is located on a public footpath. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no pen so please bring your own, and please make sure the lid is on tightly before you return it.  </groundspeak:long_description>

Happy I found this spot, but it needs a slightly better hiding place that can be more discreetly dispatched without bringing the game of geocaching into disrepute :-)</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">ELLINGTON PARK This is one of my first caches that i'm hiding. I made five caches which i'm hiding in Ramsgate, Broadstairs, St Peters and Margate. I hope people have fun finding these, and hope for positive feed back.&lt;br/&gt;Ellington Park is formerly the grounds of a long since gone manor house. It makes an ideal location for exploring and is easily accessible. Ellington Park only a couple of minutes walk from Ramsgate train station, and not far from the top of the high street is a gem nestled in the heart of the town. There is a superb childrens play area, activity area (which both children and adults can enjoy) and a variety of spaces, from open grass to tree-lined paths leading to an Edwardian bandstand. There is also a minature railway line which often runs in summer time with small steam powered trains. PLEASE PUT BACK AS FOUND AND BEWARE OF LOTS OF MUGGLES AND DOGS</groundspeak:long_description>

I hope people have fun finding these, and hope for positive feed back.&lt;br/&gt;The Woodland situated on the East Cliff or Ramsgate has recently undergone a tidy up with the help of a team of Graduates from Asda House in Leeds.The newly formed committee for the project are looking for people to help with the ongoing upkeep of the woodland site. They are planning to have many more clear up days to turn this site into a fabulous place for our community to visit PLEASE PLACE IT BACK AS YOU FOUND IT please use the hook and pull HAPPY CACHING </groundspeak:long_description>

The Chancel was built in the early 1100s and the Nave lengthened and probably rebuilt in the early 15th century. In the early 14th century the first recorded priest was John Russell in 1321.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You enter the church through the ancient porch, which is probably 14th century, one source says 1381. During the last decade it has had it’s lean stabilized by lifting the roof and the fitting of new oak beams. The originals could have been rescued from wrecked ships or cut from oak woods then surrounding the village. In the millennium year the present decorative metal out porch and side bars were finally put in place. The decorated Norman Font is of Purbeck marble and dated around 1190. A new stand was made in 1954. There is a legend that it was rescued long ago from someone’s garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 1930s a minstrel’s gallery was demolished to make way for a huge organ, now replaced by the present two-manual Walker one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tower has three bells, the oldest dates from 1437 cast by one Robert Crouch. Only thirteen of these exist and only one in Essex. On it is inscribed “St. Margaret pray for us”.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beside the altar is an unusual ancient double piscina.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original and probably mediaeval pews were taken out and replaced in 1847 with high pine pews, for a century a haven for bored children. They were replaced in 1963 by the present limed oak pews, still with doors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pulpit, choir stalls and altar rail date from the same period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The oldest window is a narrow Norman window to the North of the altar and then the 14th century West window. The magnificent glass in the 14th century East window was put in as a memorial in 1945.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new Parish Room was completed in 1993 after years of strenuous fund raising and is now an essential part of church and community life. Inside the church are memorials to the dead of two world wars; many of the names can be traced far back in village history. High above them hangs the Royal Coat of Arms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An award winning altar kneeler was designed and made by ladies of the congregation for a millennium project and also a new altar frontal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The churchyard has some interesting tombs and besides having a number of ancient yews it was replanted with some forty forest trees by volunteers from the congregation. The latest tiny yew, which was planted at the millennium, was a cutting from a 2000 year old tree which was planted at the millennium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Church Micro Series&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If any body would like to add to this series, please do, but could you please let sadexploration know first, so he can keep track of the Church numbers and names to avoid duplication.</groundspeak:long_description>

The church of St Michael's stands prominent overlooking the village
and has a tower dating from the sixteenth century. The church was
rebuilt in 1876 to the design of architect William White. It is a
large church and graveyard and it is rumoured that Jack the Ripper
(suspect, William Gull, Royal Physician, died 1890) lived in
Thorpe. William Gull was named as a suspect after his death and is
buried in the graveyard, although the mystery has never been
solved.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and
Wales described Tendring like this:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
TENDRING, a village, a parish, a district, and a hundred, in Essex.
The village stands 1½ mile from the Thorpe and Walton railway, and
7 SE of Manningtree; and has a post-office under Colchester, and a
fair on 21 Sept. The parish comprises 2,827 acres. Real property,
£4,801. Pop., 929. Houses, 168. The property is much subdivided.
The manor, with the Manor-house , belongs to J. Cardinall, Esq. The
living is a rectory in the diocese of Rochester. Value, £840.*
Patron, Baliol College, Oxford. ...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The church was recently restored and enlarged. There are a Wesleyan
chapel, a national school, and a workhouse.—The district
contains 32 parishes, and is divided into 5 sub-districts. Acres,
89,803. Poor rates in 1863, £15,211. Pop. in 1851, 27,710; in 1861,
27,105. Houses, 5,745. Marriages in 1863, 165; births, 894,-of
which 48 were illegitimate; deaths, 532, -of which 188 were at ages
under 5 years, and 21 at ages above 85. Marriages in the ten years
1851-60, 1,835; births, 8,507; deaths, 5,579. The places of
worship, in 1851, were 31 of the Church of England , with 9,754
sittings; 2 of Independents, with 660 s.; 3 of Baptists, with 540
s.; 20 of Wesleyans, with 4,384 s.; 5 of Primitive Methodists, with
404 s.; 1 of Wesleyan Reformers, with 110 s.; 1 of the New Church,
with 31 attendants; and 1 undefined, with 420 s. The schools were
19 public day-schools, with 1,317 scholars; 54 private day-schools,
with 1,003 s.; 36 Sunday schools, with 2,840 s.; and 1 evening
school for adults, with 6 s.-The hundred is mainly identical with
the district. Acres, 90,057. Pop. in 1851, 25,111; in 1861, 24,620.
Houses, 5,523.</groundspeak:long_description>

Saturday Superstore was a children's television series, broadcast
on BBC1 from 1982 until 1987. It was shown on Saturday mornings
with presenters including Mike Read, Sarah Greene, Keith Chegwin
and John Craven. The show was very similar to its predecessor
Multi-Coloured Swap Shop.&lt;br /&gt;
Amongst its most memorable moments were the pop group Matt Bianco
being verbally abused by a phone-in caller. A classic moment and
one that I found very funny as I watched it live.</groundspeak:long_description>

I've ever seen a church looking like this before.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

Wales described Great Oakley like this:&lt;br /&gt;

r. station, and 5¾ S W of Harwich; and has a post-office under
Harwich, and a fair on 25 April. The parish comprises 3,049 acres.
Real property, £5, 953. Pop. in 1851, 1, 177; in 1861, 1,038.

Oakley Hall belongs to G. Bull, Esq. Howbridge Hall is the seat of
F. Stanford, Esq.; the Lodge, of J. Salmon, Esq.; and Brooklands,

grounds of Wix church. You are looking for a film canister.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The church, dedicated to Saint Mary, has a detached belfry which
stands in the churchyard and contains one bell. In 1961 the then
owner of Wix Abbey Farm, was ploughing in the church which was
overgrown when he struck a large piece of dressed limestone with
further investigation revealed a large stone coffin with a skeleton
inside. Archaeologists were called in and dated the coffin to circa
1140, due to the decorative cross on the lid having Saxon
influences.The skeleton is very likely that of Alexander de Wix, a
founder of Wix Priory, which occupied the church grounds until the
12th century. This coffin is now on show, or was until recently on
display in Colchester castle. A almost identical but slightly
smaller coffin from the same site can be found in the bellhouse, in
the churchyard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If any body would like to add to this series, please do, but could
you please let &lt;strong&gt;sadexploration&lt;/strong&gt; know first, so he
can keep track of the Church numbers and names to avoid
duplication.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In the heart of the beautiful Dedham Vale lies the charming hamlet of Flatford, the location for some of John Constable's most famous paintings including ‘The Hay Wain’.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first series of Flatford Mill geocaches to guide you around one of the many beautiful walks  through this stunning area. There are some beautiful mature trees around this area. Don't forget to take in the beautiful panoramic view as you leave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This walk takes around 35 minutes at present. If you have a little 3 year old like me it could take a little longer. ;P&lt;br/&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

puzzles before your visit and if attempting the whole &quot;team&quot;, then
you will be taken around Bentley's circular walk. Look for the
yellow disks that mark the route. In total it's about 3
miles.&lt;br /&gt;
You can plan your route &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bentley.suffolk.gov.uk/bent-wlk.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Footpaths can get muddy so please wear suitable shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cricket balls are a
very important part of the game of cricket and there are laws which
govern the size, weight and what you are allowed and not allowed to
do with the ball whilst on the field of play.   The
traditional cricket ball is red in colour, often referred to as a
cherry.  However with the advent of cricket being played under
floodlights different colour balls have been developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are a few
different colour balls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The given co-ordinates are for a location in the village of
Grundisburgh. The cache title will then become apparent.&lt;br /&gt;
Stand outside, work out the clues and wander off in search of a
cache a short stroll away. The coordinates are not of the cache.
You dont have to go inside the pub to answer any of the questions
and you dont have to drink or eat anything if you are on a quick
visit.&lt;br /&gt;
If the churches can have their Church Micros, let the pubs have
their Real Ale Regulars.&lt;br /&gt;
Real Ale Regular pub number 10 in our series is out in the Suffolk
countryside.&lt;br /&gt;
------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;

Please do not attach photos of the pub itself with the name in
evidence or name the pub in your log...&lt;br /&gt;
The Real Ale Regular rules state that all the clues must be
available even when the pub is closed&lt;br /&gt;
------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;

The following questions can be answered by standing in front of the
pub and by walking a few yards around the village.&lt;br /&gt;
Answer these questions:&lt;br /&gt;
1. How many canines are visible? &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2. K6 has 01473 7352&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;1&lt;br /&gt;
3. How many miles away is Tuddenham? &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
4. 'The Parish Rooms' circa 1&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;00&lt;br /&gt;
5. The &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; Baron Cranworth&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache:&lt;br /&gt;
N52° 06.D(A+B)(C+E)&lt;br /&gt;
E01°15.(D-A-E)(B+D)(A+E)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache location is on a footpath in the village of
Grundisburgh.&lt;br /&gt;
A pretty village with an interesting shop and church as well as, of
course, pub.&lt;br /&gt;
------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;

If you would like to add to the Real Ale Regulars series that would
be splendid. Please email &lt;strong&gt;veganfiddler&lt;/strong&gt; for the
guidelines and a series number. Or if you would like to force
&lt;strong&gt;veganfiddler&lt;/strong&gt; to do more research himself, then
email him your suggestions as to which pubs may be worth looking
at...

If right, the footpath is very overgrown (watch out for the hidden barbed wire fence) and would question whether it's &quot;Handicapped Accessible&quot;. The cache location from the coordinates made sense and was on the footpath but nothing could be found. The whole area was flooded earlier in 2012 so really the owner needs to check that the cache is still there.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Part of a series of 13 caches on National Trust land at Dunwich Heath, Suffolk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a short circular route, follow caches 1 - 4a.  This will take approximately 45 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;For a medium circular route, follow caches 1 - 6, then skip to 12.  This will take approximately 1 hour 15 minutes.&lt;br/&gt;For the long circular route, follow caches 1 - 12 (missing out 4a).  This will take approximately 2 hours 15 minutes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This geocache is one of a series set up by the National Trust as a new way for people to explore Dunwich Heath. Focusing on wildlife, countryside habitats and WW2 military history, the geocaches are all located adjacent to public rights of way or permissive routes that are freely accessible at all times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as an interesting factfile about the cache location. For this reason some items in the cache are not swappable. Please do not swap any items marked as ‘National Trust’ or labelled as ‘not a swap’. However, in addition, there may be other items left by fellow geocachers that are intended as a swap – please feel free to swap these.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All geocaches are a short distance from a path; the caches may be camouflaged with sticks, so please replace the camouflage after you have finished with the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:&lt;br/&gt;1. Being a heathland habitat the majority of the site is covered in heather. The caches will always be accessible by following the main footpath routes. Please do not walk through the heather as this will disturb the wildlife.&lt;br/&gt;2. Please be aware there might be stinging nettles, brambles and rough or prickly vegetation.&lt;br/&gt;3. If you are going underneath trees or bushes, beware of low branches.&lt;br/&gt;4. Some footpaths might be muddy during the winter or wet weather. Stout footwear or wellies are recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    </groundspeak:long_description>

Focusing on wildlife, countryside habitats and WW2 military history, the geocaches are all located adjacent to public rights of way or permissive routes that are freely accessible at all times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as an interesting factfile about the cache location. For this reason some items in the cache are not swappable. Please do not swap any items marked as ‘National Trust’ or labelled as ‘not a swap’. However, in addition, there may be other items left by fellow geocachers that are intended as a swap – please feel free to swap these.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All geocaches are a short distance from a path; the caches may be camouflaged with sticks, so please replace the camouflage after you have finished with the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:&lt;br/&gt;1. Being a heathland habitat the majority of the site is covered in heather. The caches will always be accessible by following the main footpath routes. Please do not walk through the heather as this will disturb the wildlife.&lt;br/&gt;2. Please be aware there might be stinging nettles, brambles and rough or prickly vegetation.&lt;br/&gt;3. If you are going underneath trees or bushes, beware of low branches.&lt;br/&gt;4. Some footpaths might be muddy during the winter or wet weather. Stout footwear or wellies are recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Focusing on wildlife, countryside habitats and WW2 military history, the geocaches are all located adjacent to public rights of way or permissive routes that are freely accessible at all times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as an interesting factfile about the cache location. For this reason some items in the cache are not swappable. Please do not swap any items marked as ‘National Trust’ or labelled as ‘not a swap’. However, in addition, there may be other items left by fellow geocachers that are intended as a swap – please feel free to swap these.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All geocaches are a short distance from a path; the caches may be camouflaged with sticks, so please replace the camouflage after you have finished with the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:&lt;br/&gt;1. Being a heathland habitat the majority of the site is covered in heather. The caches will always be accessible by following the main footpath routes. Please do not walk through the heather as this will disturb the wildlife.&lt;br/&gt;2. Please be aware there might be stinging nettles, brambles and rough or prickly vegetation.&lt;br/&gt;3. If you are going underneath trees or bushes, beware of low branches.&lt;br/&gt;4. Some footpaths might be muddy during the winter or wet weather. Stout footwear or wellies are recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Focusing on wildlife, countryside habitats and WW2 military history, the geocaches are all located adjacent to public rights of way or permissive routes that are freely accessible at all times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each geocache contains a log book for you to leave your name and comments, as well as an interesting factfile about the cache location. For this reason some items in the cache are not swappable. Please do not swap any items marked as ‘National Trust’ or labelled as ‘not a swap’. However, in addition, there may be other items left by fellow geocachers that are intended as a swap – please feel free to swap these.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All geocaches are a short distance from a path; the caches may be camouflaged with sticks, so please replace the camouflage after you have finished with the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Things to be aware of when setting out to find our geocaches:&lt;br/&gt;1. Being a heathland habitat the majority of the site is covered in heather. The caches will always be accessible by following the main footpath routes. Please do not walk through the heather as this will disturb the wildlife.&lt;br/&gt;2. Please be aware there might be stinging nettles, brambles and rough or prickly vegetation.&lt;br/&gt;3.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A straightforward cache near the Halesworth Airfield Museum and Memorials. &lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a magnetic 35mm film canister containing a log book. Bring your own pen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please take care - traffic can zoom along the road - keep a very close eye on small children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Halesworth airfield was built as a Class A bomber base in 1942. In the July the airfield saw its first operational unit. However, instead of bombers the 56th Fighter Group (Zemke's Wolfpack) of the United States 8th Army Air Force were stationed there. Using its prime position and size the 56th became one of the leading fighter groups in the 8th and by the end of the war was one of the most successful in aerial combat. They left Halesworth in April 1944. &lt;br/&gt;A month later the 489th Bomb Group arrived and flew its first mission just before June. Flying B24 Liberators they played a full part in the build up to and during D Day on 6th June 1944. From July they switched to strategic offensive bombing until November, when they ceased operations to return to America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Between January and June in 1945 the 5th Emergency Rescue Squadron operated from the base flying war weary P47s and B17s. Their mission was to carry dinghies and smoke markers to aid downed crews found at sea. The 5th ERS also flew the OA-I0A Catalina flying boats. During this time 496th Fighter Training group shared the base flying the P51 Mustang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In June 1945 Royal Air Force Bomber Command gained control of the base, before it was handed over to the Royal Navy in early August to be used as an advanced flying training base, HMS Sparrowhawk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The airfield closed for flying in February 1946.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today the airfield is owned by Bernard Matthews and is still closed for flying. The Halesworth Airfield Museum and Memorials on the edge of the airfield keeps the memories of the airmen and crews it hosted alive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A variety of hides of different sizes, with nothing smaller than a bison tube. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cycle ride can be started and finished at any point and uses mainly smaller, less busy roads, but occasionally  crosses or runs along larger busier roads, so care should be taken at all times!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The clues are sometimes in the titles.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is our first hide and hopefully the first of many. The cache
is hidden on Beccles common and involves a walk of about 1.5 miles
in a circular route. Paths are suitable for buggies, wheelchairs
etc but one or two of the markers and the final are off main paths.
The common has a golf course at its centre so please stick to
marked paths and avoid crossing fairways and greens. At NO point do
you have to cross any fences or go near roads.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Warning: the paths and certain areas maybe muddy after rain and
during the winter months!
&lt;p&gt;The coordinates given are for the first of a series of
orienteering markers which are placed around Beccles Common. You
will need to note the number at the bottom right corner of each of
the markers.!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final can be found at: N52 2A.BCC E0013B.(D-3)EF .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waypoint 1: N52 27.508 E001 34.795 = C&lt;br /&gt;
Waypoint 2: N52 27.643 E001 34.545 = D&lt;br /&gt;

Waypoint 6: N52 27.691 E001 35.031 = E&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a small tupperware container with the usual
goodies! While on the common you may like to find 'Elliedaagon's
common cache' and 'Sidetracked Beccles.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking can be found at: N52 27.524 E001 34.675&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the title suggests this is a series of caches that could be
either animal, vegetable or mineral. No clues are given as the fun
is in identifying the caches.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;These caches are placed in and around the Gunton Warren Local
Nature Reserve and will take you along a walk across the cliff tops
and along the North Denes beach near Gunton, Lowestoft. There is
often space to park on the B1385 along the clifftop or if you
prefer you can use the surface carpark at the bottom of Links Road.
Caches are generally accessible although it could be hard going for
wheel chair users along the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the walks and the views!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please&lt;/b&gt; be careful with some of the caches as they could
be fragile, replace exactly as found and don't forget to bring a
pencil/pen to record your finds. Remember that as some of the log
papers are small, try not to fill it all up in one go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular cache is located along the beach. There is no
need to tamper with any equipment near the cache site. Please
replace exactly as found. Watch out for anglers and dog walkers as
you hunt for this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Waveney District Council and NPS Property Consultants
for kindly granting me permission to place three caches in Gunton
Warren Local Nature Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;These are lovely woodlands with lots of snowdrops and then
bluebells in spring. You'll also see lots of wildbirds and hear
woodpeckers drilling in spring. Muntjac deer, red fox and bats may
also be seen here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great for dogwalkers and families so stealth may be required,
although we did pick a more quiet location.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;Please respect these woodlands and keep to the well maintained
paths.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggest parking at end of Gunton Church Lane (N052°30.030
E001°44.700) and it is a short walk on well maintained woodland
paths from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need to go off the beaten track. Please be mindful
not to disturb the wildlife or trample on any plants near the
paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the tree cover you may expect gps signals to be
affected, but the clue should take you straight to the cache if you
need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is purposely designed as an easy find with the aim of
encouraging geocachers to visit and enjoy the woodlands. It is a
small plastic container about the size of a dessert bowl, large
enough to contain small items and travel bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please replace exactly as found, as you can appreciate this is a
popular place for muggles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benches and picnic tables are available if you want to sit for a
while and enjoy the surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache in Trash Out&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These woodlands are maintained by a dedicated team of volunteers
who have spent many thousands of hours getting these woods into the
wonderful condition they are in now. It is very unlikely that you
will find any litter here, but if you do, please take the time to
put it in one of the nearby bins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;GW239XV - Gunton Wood Parking&lt;br /&gt;N 52° 30.030 E 001° 44.700&lt;br /&gt;Suggest parking at end of Gunton Church Lane then just a short walk onwell maintained woodland paths.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;As the title suggests this is a series of caches that could be
either animal, vegetable or mineral. No clues are given as the fun
is in identifying the caches.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;These caches are placed in and around the Gunton Warren Local
Nature Reserve and will take you along a walk across the cliff tops
and along the North Denes beach near Gunton, Lowestoft. There is
often space to park on the B1385 along the clifftop or if you
prefer you can use the surface carpark at the bottom of Links Road.
Caches are generally accessible although it could be hard going for
wheel chair users along the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the walks and the views!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please&lt;/b&gt; be careful with some of the caches as they could
be fragile, replace exactly as found and don't forget to bring a
pencil/pen to record your finds. Remember that as some of the log
papers are small, try not to fill it all up in one go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular cache is located near a sports field and a golf
course so may need to use some stealth due to presence of muggles
nearby. The cache has moved from it's original position as it
turned out to be just too exposed, I replaced the cache for a
similar but much better version (home made this time!) and it is
more secluded now. But you may still need to use your hunting
skills here - the GPS signal can be a little variable here due to
cover but this will just add to the fun of the hunt and the
satisfaction of the find! I have checked the co-ordinates numerous
times before relisting the cache.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This particular cache is located near the sea defence with

as you hunt for this one.&lt;/p&gt;

Parking on street very close by. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I’m not normally one to get sentimental over engineering accomplishments, but this quirky local project caught my attention and warrants a visit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somerleyton claims to be the home of the hovercraft and celebrates this with a 6m stone column that holds aloft a bronze model of the first hovercraft, invented by Sir Christopher Cockerell and tested on the lawns of Somerleyton Hall in the 1950s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planning for the column started in 2004. The project took 2 years in construction and was unveiled on 4th June 2010. More information about the project and the history of the development of the hovercraft can be found at www.hovercraftsomerleyton.org.uk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a small tupperware type container, containing log book, pencil and various swaps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache was relocated following improvement works at the site prior to the column's official 'unveiling' ceremony as the tree this was hiding in was completely uprooted and shredded to allow better views of the column. Now relocated and in a more discrete area.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is constructed of knapped flint and freestone, and has a fine base-course decorated with flush-work panelling. The tower contains a ring of five bells, all cast in 1632, by the Brend bellfoundry in Norwich. The tenor bell weighs approximately 10 cwt. Frame and fittings were installed by Day of Eye and his name can be seen on the blue and gold rope-guides inside the tower.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the windows are from the 15th Century, as is the north porch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The church is thatched with Norfolk reed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of the Church Micro series.

It is designated to St Mary and St Margaret. &lt;br/&gt;Originally the church would have been thatched. The slate roof arrived by barge at a nearby wharf and were transported to the church by wagon. The wagon was pulled by a horse which had suffered the loss of one eye during the Crimean War of 1855!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of the Church Micro series. If any body would like to expand to this series please do, I would just ask that you could let Sadexploration know first so he can keep track of the Church numbers and names to avoid duplication. There is also a Church Micro Stats page found via the Bookmark list&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking for a couple of cars is available just outside the gate to the churchyard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Unusually for a Norman church it has an apse. The chancel is strangely offcentre of the nave - when the nave (but not the chancel!) was widened, the original north wall was retained and the other wall rebuilt about three metres further south! &lt;br/&gt;Fabulous wall paintings are throughout the interior. Well worth a visit. The church is open every day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a small, clear, clip-lock box containing a log book and pencil and, at the time of placing, a FTF magnet for the lucky FTF'er, a small soap and a TB. Room for small TBs and GCs and a few small swapables. Happy hunting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of the Church Micro series. If any body would like to expand to this series please do, I would just ask that you could let Sadexploration know first so he can keep track of the Church numbers and names to avoid duplication.

It was floated down the Thames in London on a barge for the Millennium Celebrations. At 9.45pm on the 31st December 1999 the Queen lit the flame. The flame leapt 3 metres above the Beacon (the biggest of a chain of 4,000 nationwide). It returned to Gorleston after the Millennium celebrations and now marks the entrance to Beacon Park. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The beacon is the height of two double-decker buses, the width of a tennis court and weighs 25 tons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
