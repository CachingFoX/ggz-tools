Kigali.&lt;/p&gt; 

 &lt;p&gt;Richard Kandt was born in Posen in 1867. He was a doctor, a
soldier, an explorer, a scholar, a poet as well as an avid
naturalist. He died in Nuremberg at the end of World War 1, in
1918.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He embarked on the first exploration journey to Rwanda in 1897,
searching for the sources of the Nile. He later related his
discoveries in the book &quot;Caput Nilli. A sensitive journey to the
sources of the River Nile&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon his return in 1907, Kandt was appointed first Resident
Governor of Rwanda, establishing his residence in Kigali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His research as a naturalist led him to explore the many natural
wonders of Rwanda, such as the Nyungwe forest. He discovered new
species and was the first to encourage the protection of this rich
environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great panoramic views over Kigali valley looking on Mt Kigali
and the prison. Notice genocide prisoners in pink uniforms. There
is an added bonus that opencaching.de have a cache in close
proximity. See Wolfgang's cache too if you'd like.&lt;/p&gt;

Muggle interference is low and the area should be relatively safe for cachers. Please note that there is a probability that this cache could form part of the “Tonteldoos” Series. If the listing is modified any logs will be verified by the owner and the clue will be forwarded to the finders of this cache. 

The owner of this cache is responsible for placing and maintaining the cache. The research and details were provided by Carbon Hunter. He deservers full credits for a truly amazing and interesting piece of Anglo Boer War History. Please do not disturb or remove anything at this site. No open flames and no garbage at site.

What, may you ask, do the creator of Sherlock Holmes; Mahatma Ghandi and Lord Kitchener have in common with Sappi’s plantations? Unlike the great sleuth, the answer is not quite so “elementary” as one may think. It involves a number aristocratic hedonists, a cover up of national proportions that would have even the most reluctant conspiracy theorists contemplating a Masonic linkage and a hero of seemingly Herculean proportions.

Helvetia is one of Sappi’s tree farms just outside Machadodorp in Mpumalanaga and forms part of the Camelot estate. It was also the site of one of the last set piece battles of the second Anglo-Boer war. The battle took place on 29 December 1900, just as the war entered its scorched earth phase with the deplorable concentration camps and mobile guerrilla tactics of the Boers. A cemetery with the remains of a number of fallen British soldiers is still maintained on the plantation and many tourists pay the site a visit each year.

The brief overview of the battle plan was that the Boers under General Ben Viljoen, launched an early morning sortie against a British garrison on the strategic cross roads at Helvetia. The British were complacent in their defences having all but assumed that the war was over and that they would soon be redeployed to India after some much needed leave. Most officers on site were so nonchalant about their task that they blatantly ignored dispatches from their Head Quarters and did not prepared adequate defence structures or instil any level of discipline amongst their troops. Manning any static position is a rather boring task for the majority of the time. The officer’s felt this boredom and attempted to spice their life up by entertaining each other with evening dinner parties using the garrison’s ample liquor ration and food for the Christmas and New Year celebrations. The officer’s had served together for a reasonable spell and were known to enjoy the good life from documented accounts of their conduct while stationed in Pretoria in the preceding months, which included tennis parties, dancing and socialising with the colonial gentry of the day.

The consequence of all of this is that the British positions (including the artillery piece – the Lady Roberts named after Lord Robert’s wife) were easily overcome and surrendered with very little fight at all. Of the various emplacements, it was only the King’s Koppie where a Colour Sergeant Johnson took charge of his position in the “absence” of his officer in command. He and his men staged a valiant defence with prevented a total rout of the British position. Johnson won the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) for leading this brave stand. Johnson opted to keep silent about the ineptness of his officer’s according to the unwritten warrior code. He was not even called as a witness to the resultant court martial in case his evidence was contrary to what Kitchener required. After the war, the Regiment sent a simple telegram with the words, “We are mighty proud of you!” to Johnson. All in all this was certainly not the mighty King’s Liverpool Regiment’s finest hour. By first light the Boers had retreated with almost the entire battalion in tow as prisoners of war. Once again the festive rations were imbibed and Gen Viljoen wrote later in his memoirs that about 30 members of the garrison had to be left behind near Dullstroom as they were too drunk to walk. He also recounted how three of the officers had to be woken from their beds to be taken captive.

So now that the actual battle had finished, the political intrigue and cover up began. This is the part that had remained “under the carpet” for so many years and Peter Goodship’s research has recently brought to light. Kitchener was devastated at a third consecutive loss a demanded that a plausible explanation was established. The British government were furious as they had been assured that the war was all but over, “Home by Christmas” was the saying of the day, and these defeats were a major embarrassment (especially in the light of a looming election).

The garrison’s commander, Major Cotton, was summonsed before a court martial for surrendering to the Boers. Evidence in his defence regarding the fact that he was recovering from a serious bout of malaria that saw him carried to Machadodorp on a doolie by Indian bearers. This is the Ghandi connection as Mahatma Ghandi organised the bearers for the Regiment. He was also shot in the head by a glancing bullet early in the fracas and spent most of the battle wandering around in a serious state of concussion. The court ignored this crucial evidence and Cotton found himself the sacrificial lamb that shouldered the full blame for the incident.

Although Cotton bore the full brunt of the political hostilities, Kitchener revoked his court martial a few months later with little fanfare or restitution (he remained a civilian for the rest of his days). His name was also removed from all official War Office records of hostilities and to this day does not appear in any official government records of the Boer War. It is here that Goodship surmises that the Arthur Conan Doyle link fits in. Conan Doyle was vociferous in his comment on the war in South Africa. He publicly questioned the verdict of the court martial, but to no public acknowledgement. Conan Doyle and Kitchener no doubt continued their communication off the record. Both were members of the Masonic lodge and were known to frequent similar social gatherings. It appears that some form of amicable agreement was reached between them that lead to Cotton’s pardon. Conan Doyle received a knighthood soon afterwards and Kitchener was given his promotion to commander in Chief of the Indian Army. And so ends an intriguing part of history that appears to have been brushed aside to further the bigger picture.</groundspeak:long_description>

I have always enjoyed this spot, this battle and the story that surrounds it - all the information, misinformation and myths that have been associated with it.

I thank the late Stewart Meikle for intorducing me to this spot, and all his efforts on the Sappi Forests plantations to conserve not just the natural environment, but also the man made environment that preserves sites of historical significance. you were an Offiocer and a Gentleman.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">By now – only I – Sir Owain Chandler – remained. In my stupor and fever induced incoherence, the mighty ebony warrior would not stop – but continued to his city – an imposing stone edifice that reminded me so much of a rough hewn Camelot. By now I had recovered from the fevers and was strengthened by the small black victuals provided by my companion. My countenance too had decayed in the journey. Apart from becoming lean and firm like the trees along the journey, I had discoloured and was a darkish shade and appeared in many ways like a number of the paler savages that we passed. In the city, the Great Zeembabwi, I was surprised to see that the clerics and controllers were not the large warrior class of my companion and dare I say friend. But there were of paler countenance and had straighter pitchblende hair. They were a peaceful, quiet nation who asked me about gold. This seemed to be their primary aim – and they showed me magnificent golden artefacts from oliphants, camelpards, leopards, leos and sea cows. Also an array of masks used for their pagan ceremonial observances. I quested regarding the ark or a chalice – but to no avail. One of the Dravidian monks seemed to understand more than the others. He and I built a rapport and after many months, he sensed my agitation and frustration. We had formed a common language along with my ebony friend which we called Guni. They struggled with the pronunciation of my name and reffed to me a Chaka. The monk, sWazi, my warrior brother, Zuloo and I discussed many topics and sWazi mentioned the observatories in the south, and the land where the gold (komati) was found. He spoke of a treasure hidden – more valuable and more powerful than any other and of a spot where God left his toeprint after walking on the earth. This was the final part of Issa’s prophecy. So many years had passed, so many friends had passed, so many memories and feeling of inadequacy had passed in my head. Now it was close. I knew it.

We left at the end of the rains – when the food and water was plentiful and the plains were peaceful. Upon reaching a low laying land we set up towards the astronomical observatories. There were a myriad of these structures in every valley and mountain top. Sage observers manned their posts and could report on movement of bodies unknown to me or any from my land. They foretold droughts, rains, the changing of the seasons and could divine prophecies from the stellar bodies. Using the information I provided on the Grail and Ark, we were guided to a grass covered hilltop to wait. We were instructed to build a house like my own and wait for the battle. Then we were to wait more than 100 passings of the solstice and we would find what we sought under a tree that grows nearby. 



Here where you now stand – we have decided to build Camelot – but Zuloo insists we include it to be like Zeembabwi. We will construct our bastion and await the sign of a nearby tree that the treasure will lie beneath .

Another of those caches that has been on my To do list since the day it was published. So glad to get here today. Thought that I may have to give it a skip as they were burning firebreaks and the entire place looked a little apocolyptic with smoke billowing over the entire scene. Reminded me a bit of a battle field aftermath.

Anyone interested in these ruins should look up Dr Cyrl Hromnik - a cape Town based academic who has done a lot of research on this. There is a site in waterval Boven that is a little more documented.

This find is also dedicated to the late Stewart Meikle who did so  much to preserve these sites on Sappi land during the 1980's and 1990's.</groundspeak:text>

I've done a lot of reading up on these structures and decided to log a factual report on one of the theories thereof.

Great hide and cache which I enjoyed.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">1.0 Machadodorp – Gold, battles, Paul Kruger

This is the story of Machadodorp during the Anglo Boer War (1899 – 1902). In chronological sequence the following events were important in the history of Machadodorp and the events that took place near Machadodorp.

Paul Kruger and his men took a decision on 7 May 1900 that Pretoria will not be defended. This was the last meeting of the Volksraad in Pretoria. 
The battle of Bergendal that took place close to Machadodorp was probably the most severe of all the battles and it was also the last conventional battle. 
Paul Kruger and his entourage left for Machadodorp on 29 May 1900 from Pretoria. 
On 30 May 1900 the British forces encircled Johannesburg. 
Pretoria was captured on 5 June 1900. The British expected the surrender of Paul Kruger and his Boers with the fall of Pretoria being the capital. This was the “honorable” thing to do – if your capital was seized then it is the end of the war and you surrender. They were not prepared for the toughness and the determination of the Boers. The dream of capturing Paul Kruger and his men with all of the Kruger millions never materialized. Lord Roberts never experienced this honor. 
Paul Kruger moved to Machadodorp and announced this village as the capital of Transvaal. This happened on 5 June. He and his men operated from the rail coaches and even some minting was done. Today the coins minted in this town are called the “Machado coins” and it is quite distinct. 
It is also worth noting that the area called Machadodorp was surveyed in 1862 and was registered as the farm Geluk 29. A small railway station was established and the station was called Geluk. In 1890 the name of the station were changed to Machadodorp in recognition of JJ Machado who surveyed the railway line. Only during September 1904 was Machadodorp declared a municipality and furthermore declared a town the same year. In other words the village became a capital, then a municipality and then a town. 
Buller was appointed in control of all British forces in Natal. Under Buller the divisional troops, cavalry, naval and infantry brigades were combined in a group named Buller’s Natal Field army. 
Buller started his advance from Natal and on 2 June he occupied Volksrust. 
Buller marched to Standerton and with not much resistance the town was seized. The 1 st brigade King’s Royal Rifle Corps occupied Amersfoort with very little resistance on 7 August. 
Ermelo was occupied on 11 August. 
On 14 August a squadron of Strathcona’s Horse entered Carolina. Buller was now on his way to Machadodorp. 
On 15 August Buller was told to halt his advance and to wait for Lord Roberts to reach Belfast. At this stage the Natal forces were about 11000 men strong. 
As the British forces under control of Lord Roberts and Buller advanced the Boers retreated along the Delogoa bay railway line toward Machadodorp. 
On 26 July Middelburg was occupied by the British advancing from Pretoria. 
The Boers were gathering to the west of Machadodorp at this stage. 
By 26 July the 11 th division (British) was spread out all along the line from Middelburg to Balmoral. (British) 
Buller ordered his troops forward on 21 August to a location south east of Belfast. 
On 24 August the British forces moved into Belfast. On 25th August Lord Roberts arrived in Belfast from Pretoria to take overall command of the British forces. 
At this stage Lord Roberts was satisfied that more than enough British soldiers were available for a standoff with the Boers. The British count as a combined force was now totaling about 20000 soldiers. 
During the restart of the Buller’s advance on 21 August 1900 the mounted troops secured the hilly terrain to ensure that the Natal Field army could move through these areas as fast as possible. 
Early morning on 26 August General French’s cavalry received the instruction to occupy the mountainous terrain north of Belfast and Machadodorp. They were halted due to heavy shelling and accurate firing from the Boers while moving forward on the Lydenburg road. 
General Botha established a defence line stretching from Bothasberg (North West of Belfast) to the Komati poort area. This was done during the beginning of August 1900. Their objective was to protect the railway line. Strategically this was their communication line to the world. This protection line was more than 80 km long and about 5000 burgers were used to form this line. 
At Bothasberg commandant Dereksen and his Boksburg commando took up position to protect the road from Middelburg to Lydenburg. Lydenburg was the escape route for the Boers and it was needed to secure this area. The Lydenburg commando took position at Steenkampsberg protecting the road from Belfast to Dullstroom. The Middelburg and Johannesburg commando were positioned to the north east of Belfast and they were protecting the Belfast Lydenburg road. The ZARP contingent which consisted of about 70 men took position on the farm Bergendal in some hills. The ZARP were supported by about 1000 burghers on either side but were not directly connected to them. This was a problem and it placed the ZARP in isolation. 
For the first time during this war the four state artillery Creusot guns were under the command of General Botha. The problem was that Botha had limited experience in conventional warfare deplouying soldiers and artillery with reference to the British. The other problem they faced was a shortage of ammunition. 
The four long toms were place initially to protect the retreat roads and for any advance of the British towards Belfast. 
During 26 August the guns were placed on Elandskop, Driekop, Suikerboschkop and near Elandsfontein. 
On 26 August Buller received information that the extreme left flank of General Botha was positioned on Bergendal. Buller changed direction and advanced directly north across Bergendal. 
To ensure advancement of the Natal Field regiment the 2nd brigade, “A” battery and the 4th division mountain infantry were sent forward to clear a path. 
Commandant Oosthuizen, the commander of the ZARP’s received ammunition just in time. He was told to stay put at all cost and to defend and to keep control of this kopje. 
At 11h00 a three hour bombardment started on the kopje where Oosthuizen was located. The bombardment was a combined effort from the howitzers, a field battery and a 4.7 inch naval gun. The burghers received the full force of the British artillery. 
This was a serious problem for General Botha – his guns were too far back to have any effect. The four long toms were now not a factor. 
After 3 hours of British bombardment the Boers were still occupying the kopje. 
Buller then ordered the infantry to move closer under artillery fire. The attacks came from the west, south and east side of the kopje. 
At the foot of the kopje the British fixed bayonets and began their charge. 
Eventually the surviving ZARP’s had to withdraw but accurate firing from the Boers hampered the British progress. They only left the kopje when the British soldiers were among them. Some left on horse back and others on foot. This is an example of the toughness and determination of the burghers. Less than 70 burghers against well trained soldiers totaling more than 1500. This is a ratio of more than 21 British soldiers to 1 Burgher. 
After the 3 hour bombardment with all artillery pieces and an advance of more than 1500 British soldiers Lieutenant Pohlman and nineteen other burghers were killed. Commandant Oosthuizen as well as 18 others were taken as prisoners. 
The line of defence of the burghers was breached. The rest of the men escaped and rejoined other commandos. 
The commandos then separated and they went to Lydenburg and Barberton and this was the start of the guerrilla warfare. This phase of warfare lasted longer than the first phase. It was only ended at the end of May 1902. 
Paul Kruger was at Waterval Onder on 27 August, which was the first railway station in the lowveld. Paul Kruger left for Nelspruit on 28 August. 
On 28 August Buller's troops marched into Machadodorp. On 1 September Lord Roberts issued the proclamation declaring the entire Transvaal British territory. 
The Kruger millions were lost between Machadodorp and Waterfall Onder. There are many rumors – some said it went to Europe. Some said it was hidden somewhere close to Machadodorp. There are also rumors that 3 ox wagons were sent from Machadodorp in three directions. One of these wagons was captured near Ermelo. They say this wagon was a decoy and other say that they already buried the treasure and that this is why the wagons were empty. 
While looking for this cache keep your eye open for any Kruger pounds, if found please inform me – I will gladly share the loot. 
There were no winners in this war. General Buller returns to the United Kingdom and he retired during October 1901. He died on 2 June 1908 of cancer. He was blamed for the death of 22000 British soldiers that was killed in action by farmers armed with German Mausers and a piece of biltong in their pockets. Paul Kruger died on 14 July 1904 in Switzerland. More than 22074 children lost their lives in South Africa. Many woman and old folks died a horrible death in the camps. During this period an unknown number of black children also paid the highest price as well as other black adults. They were buried in unmarked mass graves. The total death toll will never be known. Towns and farms were burnt to ashes as well as live stock. 
On one of the documentary videos about this period they described how one specific woman returned from one of the concentration camps, her husband was killed in action and she lost her children in the concentration camp. She arrived on her farm which was burnt to the ground and when she stopped crying she walked to the nearest building and with her finger she started to scratch around in the dust and she found a couple of seeds. With the seeds in the one hand she walked to the field and she planted them. This woman is showing character and is a symbol of the Boer nation and the guts they can show. It is not what happens to you, what counts is how you deal with it, which make us human.

2.2 Backup plan if cache is muggled.

We are aware that people from all over the country will visit this cache. If the cache is muggled it will be unfair to expect cachers to travel an enormous distance just to find that it is not there and to miss the vital keyword. At the final waypoint is a monument – please send me an e-mail of the inscription on this monument.</groundspeak:long_description>

I must say that the final clue made this one easier to find.

I have driven past this cemetary so many times - and not even given it a second thought - thanks for the cache - and the TD series - bringing a great part of SA history alive to us.

BTW: the cache prevented a nice speeding ticket for me too - by slowing down for the turn off from the highway - I avoided speeding by the cops in attendance at the turn off and joining the long line of &quot;oortreders&quot;.

Left some swag in the form of a bunch of horses for the soldiers to come.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a road side cache. The cache is a large one liter plastic container. Cache contains a stash note, pen, logbook and the normal goodies. There are 232 mountain passes in South Africa and Skurweberg pass is number 20 on the list from the northern side of South Africa.

Cache is situated near the top of a hill. Do not cross the barbed wire fence, the cache is on public grounds. If you approach the pass from Badplaas you will notice a rock painted with the words “Old Mac” and a rock painting that resembles a face. The rock is situated above the road on the left hand side against the hill.

It is painted in the same style as “Old Joe” [S25¿ 25.201 E30¿ 29.320 (WGS84).] We are busy hunting for more history on “Old Mac”, is there anyone that knows more about this person? We believe that Old Mac is the engineer that has constructed the pass and road; but this must be confirmed.

Do not make me cry by falling down from this hill. Please look at the included photo to determine the gradient. It is difficult terrain; rocks are at an angle facing downward, sliding and skidding is possible especially during rainy seasons. Grass is high and it does hide some holes. However, it is a beautiful view from the top and is one of our favorite areas. There are established footpaths in this area, probably from people visiting “Old Mac”, please make use of them.

Cache is between two rocks inside a crack. An aloe is watching from directly above the cache. Yes we know many aloes and many rocks.

Also, please give me feedback on the rating. Is the rating too hard or too soft? For me it was an easy climb. For others it could be scary.</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is unfortunately not close or at the bridge but you can view the bridge from a distance. It is a sand stone bridge dating back to 1897 that crosses the Komati River and it is a national monument but access is a huge problem. It is now situated on private property. You can truly call this bridge a bridge to nowhere. This bridge shares the history with the cache called “Hamlet of Bonnefoi”. Many moons ago this was the access road to Nelspruit and Mozambique. This road also passes Bonnefoi. Both the bridge and Bonnefoi was lost in time when new towns were built with new access roads.

Also be aware of the fence next to the cache. This fence was electrified at a stage but it is non functional at present, however treat it as if it is alive. Do not touch the fence. The cache is on public grounds. Yes, as normal be careful when you move stones.</groundspeak:long_description>

The focus of this cache is to bring cachers to a location not widely known. This listing forms part of a group of 4 unique and protected locations that was made available to cachers with the kindness and permission of the Ermelo Tourism Agency. Visitors do not have open and free access to this location. It is a sensitive heritage site and situated on private property. Private rights weigh more than your right to visit a heritage site. The owners of this private location, Sagrys and Anlie van der Merwe, will only allow visits to the site via a tour guide or historical specialist.

You will have to arrange for a visit to Bonnefoi via Info Junction at Ermelo. This is needed to protect the historical site and to protect the cacher and his family. If you are accompanied by the tour guide you can not be held responsible for damages that someone has caused to the site prior to your visit. The tour guide will escort you and will inform you about the history, importance and the role Bonnefoi played about 150 years ago. Without the tour guide the site will have no importance to you and will only resemble old buildings with no significance whatsoever.

However, you can access the site via a gravel road, if you do please park in the public road and you can view Bonnefoi from a distance but you are not allowed to enter the property unless escorted as stated above. We live in a society where idiots get a high and kicks when he causes destruction to historical sites. Many of these sites are now isolated from the public and are behind fences, chains, locks and are now controlled and managed - which we pay for. The owners are about 10 minutes away from the site and they do have black guards at the site.

Cache details:
The waypoint given in this listing is pointing to the cache. The cache is a regular Tupperware container and well sealed. It is hidden between rocks and covered by rocks and leaves. It is situated about 1 km away from Bonnefoi and it is a road side cache inside a public area. It will give you a view of where Bonnefoi is situated and it will provide a view over the valley. The cacher does have the option to visit Bonnefoi or he has the choice to drive pass the site and to have a glimpse of Bonnefoi. There is thus no obligation to make use of the tourism agency in order to find the cache. If you find the site interesting please use the contact telephone numbers and e-mail to arrange for a visit.

Bonnefoi, the location itself:
This is a place where you could even meet fairies if you wait long enough. This is a magic place; it also contains an element of sadness. This little trading village existed before the town of Carolina was established. Bonnefoi was established during 1872. During these years Chrissiesmeer consisted of two houses and a trading post. This is not an ordinary cache/site but a unique site that will give you great joy and pleasure. This is stepping back into time to a place different from today. This was the time when post was still conveyed via the ZAR post riders.

But you need to discover the answers to the questions behind it, such as why was it lost, what happened to the people, what role it fulfilled in the Anglo Boer Wars, etc. Who were the Everard painters and their relationship with this lost village? However, this little village was caught in the ever cycle of change. This village was lost and forgotten for a long time. It is rare but it is true. Today it is situated in the middle of a dense forest and forgotten. Many years ago it was rediscovered by accident with all the furniture still inside the buildings. The furniture is now stored at a safe location. Luckily for us, the buildings are available for viewing and you can share in this interesting historical site.

This village also played a role in the ANC when Joe Slovo and Braam Fischer was hiding close to this place waiting for the right time to enter Swaziland. This little hamlet played a vital role in the history of this country.

I don’t want to spoil your fun. This is your journey and challenge for learning something new so I will only guide you to do the research and for you to discover. Please feel free to share your experience with me via e-mail.

There are various options available to visit Bonnefoi all depending on your circumstances.
1. You can hire a tourism representative which will be able to inform you about the history of this place. This must be arranged by you personally. The cost of such at the time of publishing this listing was R250 for 2.5 hours. This does add a lot of value and this is highly recommended. This is personal and the most enjoyable and adds the most value. This option is the most suitable and comes highly recommended. It is worth the money and effort. Arrange with other cachers to form a team to visit the site, which will reduce the cost. The cache owner did use this option and it was worth every cent.

2. You can also join in for free on certain Sunday afternoons, please contact the Tourism Bureau at the contact telephone numbers published below. This is also very informative and is also recommended.

This is the first cache planted by my wife. This is a neglected cemetery but it is part of the Anglo Boer wars that took place at Chrissiesmeer.

Both Boer, British and joiners (hensoppers) lay side by side. The only difference is that the Boers are facing the correct direction while the Englishman and joiners/traitors are facing the opposite direction. You will also find a grave marked as “Unknown British soldier”. There is also a monument for the Boers at this site; some of them were originally from Ermelo.

Here you will also see the grave of a British Hero, Lieutenant Arthur William Swanson, who saved a fellow wounded man paying the highest price in the process. His fiancée send flowers to his grave every year via the post office mistress until 1961. This lady then stated that she is too frail and this was possible the last box of flowers. She never married and stayed true to her beloved without having the chance to visit her beloved’s grave. The people at this town is now carrying on with this tradition by placing flowers every year on his grave site while singing “My bonny lays over the ocean, my bonny lays over the sea….”.

First to find honors goes to CrystalFairy – Happy caching!!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache itself is a mystery and you will need to visit this church. Here you need to find the answer to the question in order to calculate the final point. The cache was moved a considerable distance from the original location and the cache type has changed. I do consider this as a cache open for a FTF and the first cacher at this location can log a FTF.

The cornerstone of this classical sand stone church is laid in 1913. At this location you will need to count the number of windows facing the main road. 

Number of windows facing tar road = X.

Final waypoint is at S26 18.(X+1)(X+1)4 E30 13.(X+1)(X+1)9.

To verify your answer you need to ensure that the calulated waypoint is 3.6 km away as you turn off the tar road towards this waypoint. This is as the car will drive. Enjoy the lake and please drive slowly. Good Luck.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cache container is a large white tablet canister. The cache is situated near Ermelo coal train depot; here you can see 4 to 6 diesel locomotives pulling more than 200 coal wagons, sometimes up to 2.5 kilometer long.

This is my daughter's first cache hide. Do not make use of any roads with a restricted no entry sign. Cache is not close to any railway line or any serious muggle risks. Original cache content were small cocktail umbrella, yellow ball, whistle, South African (new) cocktail flag, game boy, log book, pencil, sharpener, stash note.

Each haul from places like Grootegeluk, Thabazimbi, Eikeboom, Delmas and Broodesnyersplaas consist of about 100 wagons. From places like Machadorp only 50 wagons at a time are dispatch. At Ermelo they are combined in one huge haul and their destination is Richard Bay - a distance of 580 km. It does cross the N2 highway via a train tunnel of more than 4 km long. If you travel to Piet Retief you will notice the metal exhaust ducts for the tunnel next to the road near a communication tower pass Camden power station.

Please use waypoint S26 33.421 E29 59.505 to find the correct entry route to the cache. There are many roads to the cache, but only one is correct. GPS auto routing could send you in circles. Best approach is from N11 then to cache location via the given access road waypoint. Please use the Google Map link on this listing for more detail. You could also visit Google Earth to see the Arial photo for this depot. It is quite huge. You can enter the depot but it is not recommended because of the many road trucks going in and out. The road to the cache is not in use by these trucks. The only time you will cross the railway line is via a bridge that goes underneath the railway line.</groundspeak:long_description>

The original content is a smallish compass which has the habit of pointing everywhere, nice angel key ring from Cape Town, a homemade shell ornament from George, logbook and stash note.

This is a nice peaceful view over a valley with very little muggle interference. It is a road side cache that can be attempted during normal conditions; please take it slow if you are driving in a normal sedan. If the road is wet it is better to approach and to return via Sheepmore.

This is also the crash site of one of my colleagues. Specific details are withheld to protect him from any embarrassment. Excessive speed on gravel roads was the root cause.

Pre-cautions
1. Do not attempt to visit the cache during lighting storms. This area has one of the highest lighting strikes per square kilometer in the world.
2. Muggle interference is low but be cautious all the time.
3. You can literally drive right up to the cache. Your vehicle is with you all the time.
4. It is not recommended to do visit the cache site during the night.
5. Please replace the cache as found.</groundspeak:long_description>

Muggles could be a problem but that is part of the challenge. A camera and a relaxed attitude will help you to find it. Weekends will not be good - too many muggles. Late afternoon or early morning is maybe the best time. Use your vehicle as a shield.

Piet Retief is a very interesting town and the following is worth noticing. If you pass the town on your way down to the coast you have the impression that this is a layback town where nothing of interest is occurring which is not true. My intention is not to create a commercial cache but to highlight some of the features of this town without focusing on specifics or on entities. If you need detail and exact locations you can contact the Info Centre at Piet Retief on 017 826 5477.

Geography:

This town is situated in the Assegai Valley. Nearest border post for entry to Swaziland is Bothashoop at a distance of less than 20 km from Piet Retief. Mahamba border post is open until 22h00 and is approximately 30 km from Piet Retief. Rainfall is about 1000 mm per year and frost is not a problem. Between the years 1900 and 1911 large scale of wattle was planted in the surrounding areas. Piet Retief is surrounded with about 150 000 hectares of plantations and today pine, gum and some wattle can be found. The estimated number of residents in this region is about 147 000 people. The municipality area covers roughly 4 868 square kilometer. The town Piet Retief have about 53 919 inhabitants.

History:

Piet Retief is named after the Voortekker Piet Retief who was killed by Dingaan, the Zulu King, in 1838. The town was established by his descendants in 1883 on the farms called Osloop and Geluk. This town was nearly completely destroyed during the Anglo Boer wars. During 1886 an independent state was formed nearby and was called the Republic of Little Free State. It even had his own president and this lasted for more than 5 years until 1891. Today this area forms part of the Mkhondo Municipality which was established in 2000. Mkhondo means “animal or foot trail on natural terrain”. Mkhondo municipality forms part of the Gert Sibande district - one of the three district municipalities.

Arts, culture and monuments:

There are eight indigenous and numerous other cultures presented in this town. The Germans forms the main core of the other cultures and it is still spoken as a first language. Several small villages and farms still bear German names. There is even a German school and church nearby. There are several monuments in this area. There is a war memorial and a gravesite of the British soldiers that died during the Intombe Wars. You will also find the Heinrich Filter monument – he was killed by Swazi fighters with spears after his son shot and killed a Swazi which was related to the Royal family. The Dutch reformed church is declared as a national monument and is the work of Gerhard Moerdijk.

Science and nature:

There are several game farms in this area. Various 4x4 tracks and an active 4x4 community and club can be found in this area. Forestry forms a main part of the activities in this area. Close by you will also find the Oribi conservatory – the only sanctuary in South Africa for this antelope.

Sport &amp; Entertainment:

Cycling is a favorite sport and several routes exist. Bird watching is also high on this list. A nice golf course is available and fishing is available in well stock dams and rivers. Geocaching is also an active sport in this area and a number of cachers can be found in this area. The cache concentration is acceptable with new ones added at regular intervals. Several hiking trails are available in this area in some of the most beautiful locations and endemic aloe specicies can be found in this area. There are several farms that offer horse riding to the wetlands and to the surrounding mountains.</groundspeak:long_description>

The area between Luneburg and Piet Retief is one of our favourite places. When we reallocated to Ermelo this was one of the first areas we visited. The area reminded my wife of Germany and the place she was born.

Today while driving the back roads my wife said “Let us hide a cache, we found a nice one from Geo_J, let us return the favour”. I wanted to hide the cache higher up but there is not enough safe parking available.

I love the area. We planted the cache at sunset and it was nice to sit down and to hear absolute nothing</groundspeak:long_description>

Found with HovelJ.

Was relaxing on a rainy Sunday afternoon watching documentaries and updating the Oracle. On viewing the eventual updates, noticed that there was a new Opencaching listing close to home. Although not a popular caching platform in this area, I decided to claim the FTF before the cache hounds sniffed this one out.

So off in the rain I dashed and met up with HovelJ who had just done the Sundial cache. So I let him know that there was a new 'different' cache up for grabs and we quickly headed down the trail to claim this one.

Did this have anything to do with Time and Relative Dimension In Space? Unless you crack the Chameleon Circuit, you'll never know.

Unfortunately time ran out and we had to go back home. Luckily the eastern bunny bought a new cache for KZN cachers this time around and I hope you enjoy it.

It is a traditional cache in a LnL container with the normal goodies. The actual size is between a small and a regular. No plastic bag is fitted around the cache and it is covered with rocks, branches and leaves. Cache is between the path and the river and you should find it easy. Please enjoy the walk and the little Gorge on your way. Take time to look at how some of those trees are hanging on right above the cliff edge. While you walk down to this cache listen to the sound of the water and smell the freshness of the air. The area should be safe but as always do not go alone and keep your eyes open. There is no need to do any bundu bashing; the pathway is need and tidy.

You will need a high clearance vehicle to get to the way point given below. If you have a BMW then you are in for quite a stroll. A second way point is given for cachers that do want to risks their vehicles. Ok, the above do not apply to Wazat. (Lol)</groundspeak:long_description>

Arose in the wee dark hours of a cool African Autumn Morning to hunt an FTF. Opted for a 50/50 Parking spot between the LC and HC point... amazingly almost any vehicle that has Toyota in it's name is a 4x4....

Took a very nice stroll along the babbling brook enjoying the awakening of the forest in the half light of the rising sun, and heard the last call of an African Wood Owl before it settled in for its roost and then was treated to a most amazing song of an early morning rise for all the other feathered inhabitants. This is one of my most favourite green areas to visit as it is still so untouched by outside influences. At GZ played along with the GPSr compass and went bushwacking... not bad at this time of day, but soon resorted to reading the topo map more carefully and then went looking without technical assistance. Shortly thereafter the cache was located. FTF log signed... this one did not get away from me.

A quick and easy cache with two objectives. The one is for you to find a cache where you shouldn't even have to get out of the car (OK, for this one you will have to) and the second to remind you of a time where correspondence took days and not mere seconds. Please be aware of muggles – they are all around…..

Please bring your own pen to sign log.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Описание окружающей местности&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Криница находится в Восточной Беларуси (Могилевская область) Чаусский район, деревня Шеперево. Она является одной из важных точек зеленого туристического маршрута &quot;Дорогами радимичей&quot;. Маршрут проходит по местам, где когда-то жили наши предки - люди из племени радимичей, потомки великого славянского вождя Радима, который привел свой народ издалека и основал на этих землях несколько первых поселений. Радимичи жили между Днепром и Десной по течению Сожа и его притоков.
 &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Так как дороги этого туристического маршрута не всегда проходимы для личного автомобиля, а общественный транспорт не позволяет насладиться всеми прелестями путешествия, двигаться по маршруту лучше на велосипеде.
 &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;Добираться до деревни Шеперево можно двумя путями. Самый разумный - от железнодорожной станции Чаусы надо ехать в сторону славного и древнего города Пропойска до первого поворота на деревню Голочево. Проехав Голочево, вы вскоре увидите деревню Шеперево, которая вытянулась вдоль одной центральной улицы. Как найти криницу, может подсказать любой местный житель.
 &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;Проезжая по деревням стоит обратить внимание на то, что в них встречаются не очень адекватные собаки, которые спокойно реагируют на пешехода (даже если у него в руках велосипед), но стараются облаять велосипедиста. 
 &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;В деревне вы можете найти несколько родников, каждый из которых хорош по-своему. Но вам нужен именно самый известный из них. Родник находится на правом берегу безымянного извилистого звонкого ручья. От самой дороги к роднику ведет тропинка 30 - 40 м. Место около криницы спокойное, умиротворенное. Неподалеку есть столик и скамеечка, однако это место не для пикников. Скорее оно для путника, который устал и, попив ключевой водички, присел отдохнуть. 
 &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;Вода этой кринички прозрачная и вкусная. Местные жители очень дорожат этим источником и ухаживают за ним. Сюда приезжают за водичкой люди даже из Чаус и из Могилева. 
 &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;Чужаков здесь видят издали, и если вы на долго задержитесь у кринички, то кто-нибудь из местных жителей обязательно подойдет полюбопытствовать, а может быть и расскажет таинственную историю родника. &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Описание тайника&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Тайник - стеклянная банка (не люблю пластик), в которой спрятаны предметы. Она спрятана между корнями старого дерева и прикрыта опавшими листьями.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Традиционная часть тайника&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Когда вы найдете родник, отыскать тайник будет не сложно. От источника примерно 15 метров на Запад до лежащей на земле старой деревянной балки. Затем от нее примерно 8 метров на Юг (вверх по склону почти до самого верха). Тайник спрятан между корнями растущих вместе нескольких деревьев.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Виртуальная часть тайника на зимний период&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;Через ручей можно перейти или переехать по бревенчатому мосту. Для того, чтобы узнать число А надо лишь посчитать количество бревен, из которых состоит мост.&lt;br/&gt;Криница &quot;одета&quot; в бетонные кольца. Для того, чтобы узнать число B надо лишь посчитать сколько бетонных колец можно увидеть, заглянув в родник.
&lt;br/&gt;Она защищена от дождя оголовком, который обит жестью и имеет дощатую дрерцу. Количество досточек соединенных брусками (бруски не в счет) даст вам число С.&lt;br/&gt;
И так вопрос: Каково значение имеет число D, если оно равно сумме чисел А, В и С (D=A+B+C).        </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Описание тайника&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Тайник (развалины амбара графской усадьбы) можно найти на северной окраине города Чаусы около школы-интернат. Издали можно ориентироваться на старую водонапорную башню.

Это место хранит память о старой усадьбе, когда-то принадлежавшей графу Дмитрию Александровичу Толстому - Могилевскому губернатору. Род графов Толстых поселился здесь в конце 18 века.Усадьба была расположена на высоком холме над рекой Басей. Говорят, что когда-то одной из зимних забав графов было катание с этой заснеженной горы прямо к пологим берегам покрытой льдом реки. 

Сейчас от большой когда-то усадьбы осталось, к сожалению, немного: липовая посадка, старый амбар, который по своей архитектуре на первый взгляд напоминает усадьбу. Однако, не смотря на красиво декорированный фасад, здесь все же хранили зерно. По рассказам жителей, здесь настигла смерть последнего арендатора усадьбы - пана Кальмеера, призрак которого и по сей день иногда встречается запоздалым путникам.

От амбара открывается живописный пейзаж - холмы, река Бася, мирно петляющая у их подножья, березовые рощи на другом берегу.

Так описывается это место в статье Евгения Зубовича &quot;Неизвестные Чаусы&quot;. Статья расположена по адресу: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;http://chausy.info/nevyadomyya_chausy/ &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Описание тайника&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

 
Сейчас это только виртуальный тайник. В последствии здесь будет заложен и традиционный тайник.

Содержимое тайника

Для взятия тайника вам необходимо указать инвентарный номер, написанный на углу южной стороны амбара.   </groundspeak:long_description>
