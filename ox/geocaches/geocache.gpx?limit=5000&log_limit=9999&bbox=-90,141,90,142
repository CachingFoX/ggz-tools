Wattle Glen Picnic Ground

Take a short drive off the Casterton-Penola Road and you'll find the Wattle Glen Picnic Ground.

geoD remembers coming here as a young 'un for family picnics, not much has changed in the last twenty odd years. You'll only find basic facilities, but you will find a surprising amount of serenity!

Bring the family and have a BBQ or just stop to stretch the legs. The road in, is passable to a 2WD but would require a bit of thought in wet weather.

The cache is located a short walk in to the scrub from the picnic ground and contains &quot;Army&quot; styled swaps to start with.

Them Old Schools

There are numerous remnants of old schools dotted throughout country Australia. Some still have building remains, whereas others are long gone with only a fading memory of what once remained.

Hilgay State School 4281

Established as full time school due to an increase in population from a sub-division of Hilgay Estate for Soldier Settlement. Hilgay opened on 22nd of November 1925 and closed on 30th of July 1951. The building was removed in 1955 to be used at Chetwynd as a replacement for that school's building.

However, it proved unsatisfactory, and in 1957 the building was sold for demolition. Nothing remains of Hilgay now other than memories and the tree lined fringe of the school grounds.

There is no need to enter the property and you're looking for an Eclipse Mint Tin</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A nice spot to take a walk. Depending on where you park you might walk up to approx 3kms in total back to your vehicle. The walk is mostly easy terrain on a ready made path in the park. I think if you make the trip you'll think the views at GZ worth it. The container is large enough to take bigger swaps you might not get in some caches. Enjoy

There is an information board and tables if you wish to have a picnic and toilet facility (near parking area NOT near cache.) There's a number of different walks around the area plus another good cache GCMJ43 at a cool location. Please enjoy the hunt and don't forget to wave! Please post a photo if you wish.
