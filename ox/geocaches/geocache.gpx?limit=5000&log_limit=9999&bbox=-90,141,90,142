            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Possum 1901-1982. 'The Possum’ was Australia’s first cacher (1928). He lived as a recluse on the riverbanks mostly between Wentworth and Renmark. He had a large number of caches (plants) where he stored essential supplies for life in the bush, usually one day’s walk from one other. You are looking for my interpretation of a possum cache. The log is loose diary pages (as the possum kept his notes). Feel free to add  but please don't take.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;David James Jones came to Australia from New Zealand at the age of 27. He arrived as a shearer during the great depression, denied work (because be didn’t have a union ticket) he turned his back on society and took to life on the river bank until his death 54 years later. He walked everywhere, refused charity, lived off the land, swam the river regularly and was very rarely sighted. He loved the freedom of life in the bush. He had a special relationship with animals, he rode horses bareback, fed birds and let dogs off chains because he didn’t like to see them tied-up. He was nicknamed ‘The Possum’ because he was often up trees getting honey and hiding from anyone who might be around. He avoided human contact at all costs, very few people ever saw him. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Possum kept essentials hidden in hollow logs, trees, under bridges, in hollows, under overhangs and beneath old metal drums (sound familiar?). He kept diaries detailing the contents of each store (logs). His plants contained various items including Fish hooks, gill nets, soap, rabbit traps, salt, matches, billycans, needles and thread, glasses, jars of honey and shear blades.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PS30AMJ - Possum Statue&lt;br/&gt;S 34° 06.408 E 141° 55.367</groundspeak:long_description>

Some still have building remains, whereas others are long gone with only a fading memory of what once remained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hilgay State School 4281&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Established as full time school due to an increase in population from a sub-division of Hilgay Estate for Soldier Settlement. Hilgay opened on 22nd of November 1925 and closed on 30th of July 1951. The building was removed in 1955 to be used at Chetwynd as a replacement for that school's building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, it proved unsatisfactory, and in 1957 the building was sold for demolition. Nothing remains of Hilgay now other than memories and the tree lined fringe of the school grounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no need to enter the property and you're looking for an Eclipse Mint Tin</groundspeak:long_description>

The walk is mostly easy terrain on a ready made path in the park. I think if you make the trip you'll think the views at GZ worth it. The container is large enough to take bigger swaps you might not get in some caches. Enjoy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an information board and tables if you wish to have a picnic and toilet facility (near parking area NOT near cache.)

Easy parking and a monument nearby which you will understand the name after viewing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The views from here may be a thing of the past as a new estate is being built nearby. Enjoy them while you can. Also take time to read the nearby monument. It is a 400ml sistema suitable for small swaps. Information board in the car park may be helpful for people not living in the area. Thank you and Enjoy.</groundspeak:long_description>
