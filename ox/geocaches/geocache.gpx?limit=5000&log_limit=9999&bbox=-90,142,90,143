When I saw the train there and knew I was looking for a micro/nano I almost turned tail and ran :(

As soon as I realised I was actually heading for a different object though, I breathed a sigh of relief which turned into a groan as a man and his daughter walked up to where I was heading. 
After steeling myself to do this cache, the last thing I wanted was to be muggled out, and after dark too! 

Turned out they were fellow cachers and so, between the three of us and my u beaut torch, we soon had the cache in hand. :) Love that it took about 5 minutes to find a difficulty 3 after over an hour for a difficulty 2.  LOL 

Very nice to meet you, Regentparrot98, and I hope you get much more pleasure from your caching now that you can have a GPSr to assist you :)

Park at the Car Park, Follow the walking track to the start coordinates. GPS Required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The smooth-finned Bunyip in this area are most active at night, so a night trail has been set out that will take you to some of the best places for viewing them.  Be very aware that the trail takes you close to water at times – watch the young ones closely as Bunyips do eat small mammals. The trail is set out with stealth Firetacks, which reflect straight back at the light source – Hold your torch at eye level and they will show up best. When you reach a double tack you will need to look for a tag with Coordinates. The second tag will send you to the final. When you have seen enough Bunyips the road will take you back to the track and the track will take you back to the carpark. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Warning : Please be aware that a territorial female Bunyip is nesting in this area at present. Bunyips are very dangerous when expecting or raising young. They rarely travel far from the water however please be very careful to follow the trail and not stray into the nesting area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reeds provide good natural cover when hunting Bunyips but be aware that they both sleep and nest in flattened reed beds, usually on or near islands. Scan the water and you may be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of one of Australia’s rarest and most secretive animals.  Dr. B. Mitchell is an expert on this species, he suggests that you walk as quietly as possible. Bunyips can be alarmed by sudden sounds, so avoid breaking sticks or talking loudly. Silence will also allow you to listen out for bunyip calls. These calls vary from low rumbles that sound a little like distant trucks to high pitched skwarks.&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;BC306D7 - Carpk&lt;br/&gt;S 34° 15.266 E 142° 13.821&lt;br/&gt;This is where the carpark is and the walking path starts.&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN306D7 - Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;The Location of the Final.

Follow the gypsum trail to the Native Birds
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hopetoun is a small town of about 800 people in the southern
Mallee. Surrounded by rolling sand hills and grassy plains, it is
situated on the Henty Highway, 404 km north-west of Melbourne and
62 km north of Warracknabeal.
&lt;p&gt;The town stands on Yarriambiac Creek, near Lake Corrong.
'Yarriambiac' is said to mean 'creek tribes' while 'corrong' is a
bark canoe. Both words presumably derive from the language of the
Yarrikaluk people who inhabited the area prior to European
settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Things to see in the area:&lt;br /&gt;
Corrong Station Homestead&lt;br /&gt;
Hopetoun House&lt;br /&gt;
Lake Lascelles&lt;br /&gt;
Lake Coorong&lt;br /&gt;
and Wyperfeld National Park&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stealth is required as Muggles appear very quickly from all
directions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Given that this was in plain site, I can't help thinking that half of the attachment mechanism is missing and that maybe the attachment mechanism(s) should be on the inside rather than the outside!

Out with local cacher today (Honeysucker) to clear up some of these country caches.
A quick search in the most likely spot turned up the cache.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We found this one at 15:05 after today's bushwalk around this wonderful area.  We were actually meant to start the walk here [:I] but short-circuited it a bit and started in the camping area instead.  What a beautiful spot for a cache and it was great to see some water in the river [:D].

As Alsume pulled the cache from its hidey-hole, that gave LinearZZ and us a high DRC rating for this one [8)] [B)].  Oh well, tough [;)].  

TNLNSL.  Thanks honeysucker.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Great views and an easy cache to get to. Car park close. If you are able to do this cache around May - Oct you may see whales out to sea. Amazing views. Nearby parking. Disabled access to viewing platform. If you wish you can also access the beach via steps from viewing platform ( not required to get cache ). This area can get very busy so please be aware you might need to wait to retrieve cache especially during whale season. It can easily be retrieved at night with a torch. You do NOT need to leave the viewing platform. Please place cache back so not to be seen easily. Please bring pen to log your find. Thank you. Enjoy.</groundspeak:long_description>
