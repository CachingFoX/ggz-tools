            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I assure that you will enjoy this hunt; do not forget to bring a hat, water and sunblock. Tennis shoes or boots are recommended. Enjoy!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Parguera village in Lajas is famous for the beauty of its coral reefs, mangrove islands and channels and the bioluminescent bay. It lies in one of the PR natural protected areas designated as multiuse. In addition there is a small beach of artificial origin in La Parguera, known as Pinky Beach (Playita Rosada), it was built in the 60’s, and open for public use in 1976. This place is one of the many tourist attractions in La Parguera, and is visited in particular by families with small children. The sand of this beach was brought from the north-west coast of Puerto Rico; the red mangrove community that covered this area was removed to build this beach. The name of the beach has its origin in the sand coloration by those days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This place is under the jurisdiction of The Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER or DRNA in spanish). This beach has gazebos; barbecue area and fresh water facilities. Also has a kind of sea water swimming pool, with a wooden deck surrounding it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this area you will be able to observe Red, Black, White, and Button wood mangrove trees, Emajaguillas, Casuarinas pines and Beach Grapes trees, among others. Also you will see seagrass beds and a lot of marine invertebrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO GET THERE: If you come from Ponce / Mayaguez by route #2, you must take exit 194 towards road 116. Keep on that route all the way until you reach 304 at the left. This will drive you to La Parguera. On 304 take the third entrance to the left (Calle 7) this will drive you directly to Playita Rosada. On the way you must pass the Parguera Nautical Club and continue until the end of the road; there you will find a fence, and a DRNA sign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you come later than 5:00 pm you can leave your car in the area and continue on foot, the area could be solitary but is safe. If the gate is closed you can access by an entrance at the right side of the fence. If you come between 8:30 am and 5:00 pm the DRNA personnel will let you enter your car without any fee. During the evening this area is commonly used by people jogging or walking. Don't forget to bring water!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you want to see Playita Rosada pictures you can access the following link: http://www.ceducapr.com/playitarosada.htm</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a micro-cache (small chromed bison container), for a fast and easy hunt. This container has a wire that helps to retrieve it, please leave it in the same way and bring your own pen/pencil. Come and visit San Germán, the second oldest city of Puerto Rico, after San Juan. Enjoy its history and beautiful architecture!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built in 1606 the Porta Coeli (&quot;Gateway to Heaven&quot;) cathedral is one of the oldest church structures in the western hemisphere. Located in San German, Puerto Rico, it was restored by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture and now serves as a museum of religious paintings and wooden carvings dating back from the 18th and 19th centuries. There are also some interesting examples of architecture and architectural details in and near the city's plaza (Source: Wikipedia).&lt;br/&gt;San Germán, founded in 1573, is one of the oldest towns on the island and is one of only two that are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Its isolation has helped preserve its unique character, readily evident on its plazas and quaint streets. Today it is a university town, with Puerto Rico's Inter American University located on a beautiful campus. You'll want to see the many well-preserved historic homes near Porta Coeli, the coffee plantation, and the impressive San Germán de Auxerre Church (Source: http://www.gotopuertorico.com/puerto-rico-porta-coeli.php).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Porta Coeli Museum is open Wednesday through Sunday from 8:00 AM -12:00 M and 1:00 PM to 4:20 PM. There is a $ 3.00 fee for the entrance. The Convento de Porta Coeli is located in the Plaza Porta Coeli at Ramas and Dr. Veve streets in the San Germán Historic District. It contains many of its original furnishings as well as a collection of religious art that includes colonial paintings and wooden statues dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries. Among its treasures is an altarpiece by José Campeche, the first-and by many considered to be the greatest-artist born in Puerto Rico (Source: http://www.gotopuertorico.com/puerto-rico-porta-coeli.php).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO GET THERE: Take road 2 from Mayaguez or from San Juan. From Road 2 exit on Road 122. The church is located in the center of the town. You can park on the streets in front of Porta Coeli church or go to the parking area at the NE side of the church located at N18 04.934 W67 02.430&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Use your better tourist/photographic stealth mode; there is a guardian in the area, lots of muggles visiting, and muggles looking from their houses. Put only your initials in the logsheet. Enjoy!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Seriously, it is only a stones throw away from Machias, I tried it myself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This GeoCache is located on the Down East Sunrise Trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built in the late 1800s, the 127-mile Calais Branch Railroad once brought tourists, mail and freight from central Maine to towns in Washington and Hancock counties. It turned around in Calais and brought wood products, fish and other freight back to markets farther south, serving as a vital economic artery for this isolated area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, like other railroads, the Calais Branch faltered as cars and trucks became the preferred means for moving people and freight. The last train traversed the route in 1984, much to the chagrin of residents. When the trains stopped running, everyone felt the same way, that it would start again soon. But as the railroad's financial problems became known, it became clear that it wasn't going to come back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The state bought the rail right-of-way in 1987 and then announced plans to rip up the rails and ties and sell them. That spurred locals into action, and they began lobbying state officials to turn the corridor into a rail-trail. After more than two decades of work, their dream became a reality last fall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On September 21, 2010, the 85 mile Down East Sunrise Trail was officially opened for public use. The western end of the trail is at Washington Junction, just east of Ellsworth off of US Route 1.The eastern trailhead is in Ayers Junction which is in Pembroke on Maine Route 214, four miles northwest of the Route 214 intersection with US Route 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenic rail corridor runs along the entire Down East coastal area, connects multiple scenic conservation areas, intersects Down East salmon rivers, and is very near two state designated scenic highways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Down East Sunrise Trail was constructed as an interagency project of the Maine Department of Transportation and the Maine Department of Conservation. The project has rehabilitated and preserved 85 miles of the Calais Branch railroad corridor for future rail use while at the same time providing a wide, compact gravel-based trail. The Down East Sunrise Trail will be managed for the use of snowmobiles, ATVs, pedestrians, bicyclists, cross-country skiers and equestrians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may or may not have seen a cache like this before, that is if you even find it. It's not hanging in a bush or a tree but I assure you that it's there. If you attended the A Walk Through Calais GC30KPF event cache you may have glimpsed a view of this container and got yourself a hint. Needless to say, I don't think that it's going to be easy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can park accross from Dunkin Donuts on the east side of the dike in Machias and walk the trail .89 mile to this GeoCache. And as always, have a great time and Happy GeoCaching.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Come on, you don't want a hint, it's part of the GeoCaching adventure and you'll be happier when you find it if you find it without a hint. If you do have issues and insist on finding this cache and really want a hint, then e-mail me through my profile.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

After more than two decades of work, their dream became a reality last fall.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On September 21, 2010, the 85 mile Down East Sunrise Trail was officially opened for public use. The western end of the trail is at Washington Junction, just east of Ellsworth off of US Route 1. The eastern trailhead is in Ayers Junction which is in Pembroke on Maine Route 214, four miles northwest of the Route 214 intersection with US Route 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenic rail corridor runs along the entire Down East coastal area, connects multiple scenic conservation areas, intersects Down East salmon rivers, and is very near two state designated scenic highways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Down East Sunrise Trail was constructed as an interagency project of the Maine Department of Transportation and the Maine Department of Conservation. The project has rehabilitated and preserved 85 miles of the Calais Branch railroad corridor for future rail use while at the same time providing a wide, compact gravel-based trail. The Down East Sunrise Trail will be managed for the use of snowmobiles, ATVs, pedestrians, bicyclists, cross-country skiers and equestrians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This micro cache is located where the Sunrise Trail crosses the Harmon Stream. We had come up here before the trail was put in, and this was sort of our private spot for a while.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can park at parking location A and have an approx 2.2 mile round trip just to this GeoCache and approx 4 miles if you include The &quot;Sunrise Trails: Croaking&quot; GeoCache. If you do park here, then please do not go any further with a &quot;Powered Vehicle&quot; as they are tearing up the hill and this is private property. Also, if you're not too early in the morning, or late at night, fell free to stop in for a cup of coffee, I'm sure that you can figure out where, it's the only place along your trip.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also park at parking location B and have an approx 5 mile round trip to this GeoCache, and also get &quot;Sunrise Trails: Croaking&quot; as it's on the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PA32H01 - Parking Area A&lt;br/&gt;N 44° 51.951 W 067° 22.278&lt;br/&gt;You can park at parking location A and have an approx 2.2 mile round trip just to this GeoCache and approx 4 miles if you include The &quot;Sunrise Trails: Croaking&quot; GeoCache.

It turned around in Calais and brought wood products, fish and other freight back to markets farther south, serving as a vital economic artery for this isolated area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But, like other railroads, the Calais Branch faltered as cars and trucks became the preferred means for moving people and freight. The last train traversed the route in 1984, much to the chagrin of residents. When the trains stopped running, everyone felt the same way, that it would start again soon.

I put one of these out like this some years ago and it took many people to finally find it. If your tired of just finding caches hanging from a branch in a tree, than this is a hide for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can park at parking location A and have an approx 1.25 mile round trip just to this GeoCache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located on Dodge Road just off Route 86 in Dennysville Maine at a small Oasis on the Cathance Stream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Head west on Route 86 out of Dennysville and at N 44 53.454 , W067 16.336 you will come across a dirt road called Dodge Road on your left.  The dirt road is sign posted.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Head down Dodge Road, pass the rail road tracks and keep going a short way until you reach a small wooden bridge over the stream.  This stream is Cathance stream.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park your vehicle in the small pull-in area on the right just before the bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cross over the bridge and just after it, on the left, you will see an overgrown trail at: N 44 53.218 W067 16.022 this is where your search begins.  Head down the trail about 100 yards and start your search.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a medium size Lock n Lock clear container.  It is well hidden because muggles sometimes drink in this area at night.  I make no appolgies for the flies as I too almost needed a blood transfusion placing the cache so it is some else's turn!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be careful crossing the rocks close to the waters edge but no serious hiking or climbing of anything is required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take the time to enjoy this quiet little spot and it is good for a picnic or hiking along the stream.  Towards the evenings at the right time of year Moose can normally be seen here as with several places on the Dodge Rd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I could only get 15ft of accuracy on the coordinates due to tree cover so allow yourself some time for this search.  Please cover it well after finding it so as to hide it from muggles.  Cache started out with all sorts of small items including a Police Department Patch from one of the departments I work for.  There is also a Jeep Travelbug be sure to enter the competition to win a real Jeep when you find it.  Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>In the trees close to the waters edge you will see a small rock gorge.  Look in a hole under roots and move the rocks.  Just infront of a single pine that has grown into two and just after the rock ledge.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This GeoCache is located on the Down East Sunrise Trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Built in the late 1800s, the 127-mile Calais Branch Railroad once brought tourists, mail and freight from central Maine to towns in Washington and Hancock counties. It turned around in Calais and brought wood products, fish and other freight back to markets farther south, serving as a vital economic artery for this isolated area.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;But, like other railroads, the Calais Branch faltered as cars and trucks became the preferred means for moving people and freight. The last train traversed the route in 1984, much to the chagrin of residents. &quot;When the trains stopped running, everyone felt the same way, that it would start again soon. But as the railroad's financial problems became known, it became clear that it wasn't going to come back.&quot;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The state bought the rail right-of-way in 1987 and then announced plans to rip up the rails and ties and sell them. That spurred locals into action, and they began lobbying state officials to turn the corridor into a rail-trail. After more than two decades of work, their dream became a reality last fall.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On September 21, 2010, the 85 mile Down East Sunrise Trail was officially opened for public use. The western end of the trail is at Washington Junction, just east of Ellsworth off of US Route 1. The eastern trailhead is in Ayers Junction which is in Pembroke on Maine Route 214, four miles northwest of the Route 214 intersection with US Route 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenic rail corridor runs along the entire Down East coastal area, connects multiple scenic conservation areas, intersects Down East salmon rivers, and is very near two state designated scenic highways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Down East Sunrise Trail was constructed as an interagency project of the Maine Department of Transportation and the Maine Department of Conservation. The project has rehabilitated and preserved 85 miles of the Calais Branch railroad corridor for future rail use while at the same time providing a wide, compact gravel-based trail. The Down East Sunrise Trail will be managed for the use of snowmobiles, ATVs, pedestrians, bicyclists, cross-country skiers and equestrians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard nano GeoCache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a trail head just to the west of Robinson Cottages on Route 86 and it will be .39 mile to the GeoCache, or you can also park on Dodge Road and walk about .7 mile to the GeoCache.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a beautiful coastal hike located in Eastport ME in the Shackford Head Hiking area.  Your hike, which takes up to one and a half hours for the full circular hike, starts out at the Shackhead Head Parking Lot near to the Washington County Community College Boat School.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the parking lot you will see a series of informational plaques describing everything from the areas ship wrecks to its wildlife and bald eagle population.  The start of the trail is obvious and close to the start of the trail you will see an alternate trail known as the Schooner Trail which is indicated along the route with blue markings.  Take the Schooner trail and you're on your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trail can be fairly strenous hike with several ups and downs and can be slippery in places and pretty boggy in wet weather.  In the afternoon be sure to take a flashlight as it can be easy to lose the trail in poor light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a clearing with some rocky outcrops and a great view of Cobscook Bay.  Once you have found the cache if you continue on the trail it will eventually take you up onto the summit of Shackford Head with stunning views of north Lubec and all the way to Grand Manan on a clear day.  Bald Eagles can often be seen watching you from the trees and if you have binoculars you will often catch a seal or two swimming below you near the Salmon pens.  The walk back down from the summit is a straight forward trail and much less strenous than the Schooner Trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Original contents of the cache were: log book, three mind teazer puzzle set, pedometer, little pouch, wooden ornament box, ty beanie toy, and Snoopin Around TB.  You're looking for a small ammo can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck, enjoy your hike and the views.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>In a clearing overlooking the bay with Pembroke to the right and lubec to the left there is a sturdy lone spruce tree behind you.  The tree is the key.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Medium sized lock and lock container. Terrain rating is due to the dirt roads to get to the cache area, then 65 foot hike with slight incline from the road to the cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While driving the back roads between the Stud Mill Road and Little River Road, I came across this site. Please look at the pictures I enclosed. I was so impressed with this finding that I left a cache there and came home to research what I had found.&lt;br/&gt;Find this cache from the SMR or Little River Road, to 60-00-8 road.&lt;br/&gt;Apparently there is a 1 mile trail from the road up to Wabassus Mountain. Park safely off the side of the road at the nearest pull off if you intend to hide the mountain, not just grab the cache.&lt;br/&gt;The story of Reggie's Way is that Reggie and Ted live in a small trailer in the summer, near here.  They sell food, drinks and gas to those out enjoying the trail systems. Currently, at the bottom of this trail, they have rigged up a pvc pipe to a natural spring and placed a cup, a sign, a tub of soda and a collection can. See the picture below. I am also told, by the locals, that at times there is an old canoe with a skeleton at the site.&lt;br/&gt;The cache is 65 feet up the trail, from the dirt road. Have a nice cool spring drink for a cent, or pay $1.00 and have a nice cool soda. Please leave your can in the trash bag provided, or better yet, CITO!&lt;br/&gt;I am hopeful to place a cache at the top of the mountain some day, but will have to see if my disability allows it. </groundspeak:long_description>

Since construction completed and this area is no longer used for access, the satellite dish base has been dug up and is now being used as a traffic stop. Despite its cracked and crooked placement, be on the lookout for Uncle Fred’s flowers, in season, they are known to still bloom.</groundspeak:long_description>

After awhile, I realized I couldn't keep collecting them.   A lot of signature items have been replaced by path tags now.  &lt;br/&gt;Please feel free to add your signature item or path tag, but please do not trade items.  This cache is for others to enjoy signature items past and present.  All items are in baggies if not weather resistant.  Please enjoy them and comment on them in your logs.&lt;br/&gt;I decided that living in Princeton doesn't provide me with an area well traveled by geocachers.  Then realized that the Stud Mill Road is the perfect place to add this cache plus is easy for me to maintain.  Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Once leading over to Mayfield and the other ridges, this was a very popular street until it’s closure when the &quot;Truck Route&quot; went through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Still called five corners, you have to look at a map view to see where the five used to meet, before Route 1 came through.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Over and Under (and Not so Much)&quot; … The Caches! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The face of many areas has been changed by modern transportation.

We are team &quot;bth7&quot;, who, in real life, are Carrie Handrahan and Lori Gray.&lt;br/&gt;Until April 2009, neither of us had even heard of Geocaching.  Once we signed up, found our very first cache and signed that log book, we almost instantly became hooked!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We started caching in May 2009, and we are loving every minute of it!  We live just outside of Fredericton in Tracy, New Brunswick.  We both love the outdoors and enjoy activities such as camping, fishing, hiking, snow shoeing, 4-wheeling and of course, geocaching.  We love animals and on occasion, two of our dogs even join us on a nice hike!  Geocaching has taken us to so many new places, near and far.  We have met so many great people and have made lots of new friends.&lt;br/&gt;Hope to see you on the trails.&lt;br/&gt;Happy Caching!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hayman Avenue structure gives the best access to the ridges, and as such is now a heavily used access for locals. The view from the structure is a good one -  there is a nice old barn for viewing.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Over and Under (and Not so Much)&quot; … The Caches! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The face of many areas has been changed by modern transportation.

Changes to the traffic patterns in this area still confuse people even five years later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Old Route 1 traffic (now Route 170 traffic) originally had the right of way coming into town, and Route 3 traffic had to yield. Now that the local circle traffic has the right of way, most of us are still pretty tentative driving around there – of course WE know what to do, but the next guy might forget! When the Ferry Point Bridge was the main border access to the US, cars and transport vehicles would start here and line the main streets of St. Stephen, keeping traffic at a standstill, but doing a fine job of maintaining the business at the take-out on Milltown Boulevard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Over and Under (and Not so Much)&quot; … The Caches! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The face of many areas has been changed by modern transportation.

He became Maine's child on 5/14/11 when he was found dead, wrapped in a blanket and left on the side of the road, in the town of South Berwick.  The full details are still unknown, but his mother has confessed to killing him.&lt;br/&gt;I can't comprehend what has happened to this little boy at the hand of his mother, and why???  And mostly, I just can't get him off my mind.  &lt;br/&gt;I am placing this cache here in the Princeton cemetary, for Camden.  This hopefully will be a place of peace where others can come and say a prayer for him, bow your head, or just remember this little boys' short life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Marocma bio:&lt;br/&gt;In April 2010 I was recovering from a car accident. I noticed a friend on facebook posting about checking on their geocaches after the winter months. Another friend (SamTimChan) also a cacher, had spoken to me about caching. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, I had to find out what it was about, so I googled it and found the videos on geocaching.com. I thought this would be a fantastic hobby to do with the family. I posted thoughts on facebook about how I thought geocaching sounded fun. Another friend offered to loan us his GPS. I took the family and off we went. We found a couple of local caches and soon Snoik and I were hooked on caching. The kids, being teenagers, thought it was boring and soon gave it up.&lt;br/&gt;Little did Snoik and I know when we started this that it was such a social sport. We really thought it was an individual thing that we could do in our spare time. We had no idea that fun was in store for us and what fantastic friends we would make along the way. That year I asked for a GPS for my birthday. For Mothers Day I was surprised with a premium membership.&lt;br/&gt;I try to introduce others to the sport whenever I can. I will spend my lunch hour dressed up and wearing heels (I work in an office) and I will tramp through the woods to get a cache if I can get there and back in 1 hour. Sometimes I take co-workers with me.&lt;br/&gt;I have locked my keys in the trunk, lost them in uptown Saint John and had the police call in the K9 unit to locate them, found a stash of drugs outside a police station when I was joking with the officer about how there was a cache in the tree outside the detachment, and have taken too many falls to count. I have been taken to some of the most breathtakingly beautiful places our province can offer. I have made memories to last a lifetime and have met some of the most amazing people, each of whom I am honoured to know. I get to spend quality time with my husband sharing a hobby we both enjoy. And it has not even been 2 years yet since we started caching. I can't wait to see what awaits us in the next 2 years!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If Route 170 is the Old Route 1, then this stately and stoic concrete structure is the Old Old Route 1! Areas like this, gorgeous in the fall especially, remind us why the slower path might be a better alternative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Over and Under (and Not so Much)&quot; … The Caches! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The face of many areas has been changed by modern transportation. In our quest to get there faster and more efficiently, we often take the high road and high speed – and we miss a lot along the way. This Series celebrates both where we are and where we have been, and the way things used to be…along Route 1 in southern NB. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each cache in the series is named after a cacher who successfully solved the original puzzle at placement – or, after the 10th of March, 2012 (the VI Ides of March Event), any cacher who has completed all of the caches in the Series may request that a remaining unnamed cache in the series be named for them.</groundspeak:long_description>

Sierra is our “secret weapon” - she is by far the best of the three  of us at spotting those tricky caches!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;We live in Mazerolle Settlement, NB.  We were first introduced to geocaching by my sister, Carrie,  and Lori (of Bth7) in May 2011.  After hearing of all fun and exciting adventures they had experienced - we just had to try it!  Our first geocaching experience was to the Event in Fundy National Park.  We hiked some grueling trails that day and, despite Sierra twisting her ankle very badly, we were all hooked - especially Sierra! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geocaching keeps us all active and is a great family activity!  We have enjoyed the opportunity to visit so many beautiful spots, attend so many fantastic events meet so many great people through caching...we’re hooked!  Of course, Sierra especially loves a day of caching with her favorite Aunt Carrie!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope to see you on the trails!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No longer even plowed in the winter, this area has said goodbye to the traffic it once knew. Since 2008 when the former Route 1 was decommissioned and named Route 170, through traffic has bypassed this scenic and hilly roadway and the weigh scales that protected her! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Over and Under (and Not so Much)&quot; … The Caches! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The face of many areas has been changed by modern transportation. In our quest to get there faster and more efficiently, we often take the high road and high speed – and we miss a lot along the way. This Series celebrates both where we are and where we have been, and the way things used to be…along Route 1 in southern NB. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each cache in the series is named after a cacher who successfully solved the original puzzle at placement – or, after the 10th of March, 2012 (the VI Ides of March Event), any cacher who has completed all of the caches in the Series may request that a remaining unnamed cache in the series be named for them.</groundspeak:long_description>

You can safely park in the access road to the field. Route 144 now is the road less traveled since the new 4-lane highway was put in place. The extra wide shoulders can provide safe parking. The cache container is a large coffee tin. You shouldn't need to enter the farming property to access it. During May-August watch for farming vehicules that cross the road to the nearby farm. Looking south, you can see older farming buildings in nearby Van Buren Maine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Le geocache is situe au bord du terrain familial, vous pouvez stationner sur l'épaule facilement et aller direct du chemin. Prenez garde durant les mois de moissons car les véhicules de la ferme circule. Le sud, vous pouvez voir l'état du Maine. </groundspeak:long_description>

The second half of the road is used mainly by ATV's. Prior to the access road, there were three building dating from the early 1900's which belonged to my family, including a large barn. Due to the condition, the structures were demolished and the aged wood was collected for other projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This road (and surrounding land) is used by my family to access the many plots of land we have. Cache is a regular coffee tin. Parking is easy. But be aware of farming vehicules during may-august. You don't need to enter the property to access the cache. You can enter the property for turning around your vehicule, but try not to trample the crops. </groundspeak:long_description>

La Grotte is not a cave in this context but rather a small grotto, well you'll see what I mean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cyr family rock was placed in august 1990 during the family celebrations. The cache is located behind it. </groundspeak:long_description>
