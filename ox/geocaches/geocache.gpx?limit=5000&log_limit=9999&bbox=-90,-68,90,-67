The Parguera village in Lajas is famous for the beauty of its coral reefs, mangrove islands and channels and the bioluminescent bay. It lies in one of the PR natural protected areas designated as multiuse. In addition there is a small beach of artificial origin in La Parguera, known as Pinky Beach (Playita Rosada), it was built in the 60’s, and open for public use in 1976. This place is one of the many tourist attractions in La Parguera, and is visited in particular by families with small children. The sand of this beach was brought from the north-west coast of Puerto Rico; the red mangrove community that covered this area was removed to build this beach. The name of the beach has its origin in the sand coloration by those days.

This place is under the jurisdiction of The Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER or DRNA in spanish). This beach has gazebos; barbecue area and fresh water facilities. Also has a kind of sea water swimming pool, with a wooden deck surrounding it.

In this area you will be able to observe Red, Black, White, and Button wood mangrove trees, Emajaguillas, Casuarinas pines and Beach Grapes trees, among others. Also you will see seagrass beds and a lot of marine invertebrates.

HOW TO GET THERE: If you come from Ponce / Mayaguez by route #2, you must take exit 194 towards road 116. Keep on that route all the way until you reach 304 at the left. This will drive you to La Parguera. On 304 take the third entrance to the left (Calle 7) this will drive you directly to Playita Rosada. On the way you must pass the Parguera Nautical Club and continue until the end of the road; there you will find a fence, and a DRNA sign.

If you come later than 5:00 pm you can leave your car in the area and continue on foot, the area could be solitary but is safe. If the gate is closed you can access by an entrance at the right side of the fence. If you come between 8:30 am and 5:00 pm the DRNA personnel will let you enter your car without any fee. During the evening this area is commonly used by people jogging or walking. Don't forget to bring water!

This container has a wire that helps to retrieve it, please leave it in the same way and bring your own pen/pencil. Come and visit San Germán, the second oldest city of Puerto Rico, after San Juan. Enjoy its history and beautiful architecture!

Built in 1606 the Porta Coeli (&quot;Gateway to Heaven&quot;) cathedral is one of the oldest church structures in the western hemisphere. Located in San German, Puerto Rico, it was restored by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture and now serves as a museum of religious paintings and wooden carvings dating back from the 18th and 19th centuries. There are also some interesting examples of architecture and architectural details in and near the city's plaza (Source: Wikipedia).
San Germán, founded in 1573, is one of the oldest towns on the island and is one of only two that are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Its isolation has helped preserve its unique character, readily evident on its plazas and quaint streets. Today it is a university town, with Puerto Rico's Inter American University located on a beautiful campus. You'll want to see the many well-preserved historic homes near Porta Coeli, the coffee plantation, and the impressive San Germán de Auxerre Church (Source: http://www.gotopuertorico.com/puerto-rico-porta-coeli.php).

Porta Coeli Museum is open Wednesday through Sunday from 8:00 AM -12:00 M and 1:00 PM to 4:20 PM. There is a $ 3.00 fee for the entrance. The Convento de Porta Coeli is located in the Plaza Porta Coeli at Ramas and Dr. Veve streets in the San Germán Historic District. It contains many of its original furnishings as well as a collection of religious art that includes colonial paintings and wooden statues dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries. Among its treasures is an altarpiece by José Campeche, the first-and by many considered to be the greatest-artist born in Puerto Rico (Source: http://www.gotopuertorico.com/puerto-rico-porta-coeli.php).

HOW TO GET THERE: Take road 2 from Mayaguez or from San Juan. From Road 2 exit on Road 122. The church is located in the center of the town. You can park on the streets in front of Porta Coeli church or go to the parking area at the NE side of the church located at N18 04.934 W67 02.430

Use your better tourist/photographic stealth mode; there is a guardian in the area, lots of muggles visiting, and muggles looking from their houses. Put only your initials in the logsheet. Enjoy!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

This GeoCache is located on the Down East Sunrise Trail.

Built in the late 1800s, the 127-mile Calais Branch Railroad once brought tourists, mail and freight from central Maine to towns in Washington and Hancock counties. It turned around in Calais and brought wood products, fish and other freight back to markets farther south, serving as a vital economic artery for this isolated area.

But, like other railroads, the Calais Branch faltered as cars and trucks became the preferred means for moving people and freight. The last train traversed the route in 1984, much to the chagrin of residents. When the trains stopped running, everyone felt the same way, that it would start again soon. But as the railroad's financial problems became known, it became clear that it wasn't going to come back.

The state bought the rail right-of-way in 1987 and then announced plans to rip up the rails and ties and sell them. That spurred locals into action, and they began lobbying state officials to turn the corridor into a rail-trail. After more than two decades of work, their dream became a reality last fall.

On September 21, 2010, the 85 mile Down East Sunrise Trail was officially opened for public use. The western end of the trail is at Washington Junction, just east of Ellsworth off of US Route 1.The eastern trailhead is in Ayers Junction which is in Pembroke on Maine Route 214, four miles northwest of the Route 214 intersection with US Route 1.

The scenic rail corridor runs along the entire Down East coastal area, connects multiple scenic conservation areas, intersects Down East salmon rivers, and is very near two state designated scenic highways.

The Down East Sunrise Trail was constructed as an interagency project of the Maine Department of Transportation and the Maine Department of Conservation. The project has rehabilitated and preserved 85 miles of the Calais Branch railroad corridor for future rail use while at the same time providing a wide, compact gravel-based trail. The Down East Sunrise Trail will be managed for the use of snowmobiles, ATVs, pedestrians, bicyclists, cross-country skiers and equestrians.

You may or may not have seen a cache like this before, that is if you even find it. It's not hanging in a bush or a tree but I assure you that it's there. If you attended the A Walk Through Calais GC30KPF event cache you may have glimpsed a view of this container and got yourself a hint. Needless to say, I don't think that it's going to be easy.

You can park accross from Dunkin Donuts on the east side of the dike in Machias and walk the trail .89 mile to this GeoCache. And as always, have a great time and Happy GeoCaching.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Come on, you don't want a hint, it's part of the GeoCaching adventure and you'll be happier when you find it if you find it without a hint. If you do have issues and insist on finding this cache and really want a hint, then e-mail me through my profile.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This GeoCache is located just off the Down East Sunrise Trail.

Built in the late 1800s, the 127-mile Calais Branch Railroad once brought tourists, mail and freight from central Maine to towns in Washington and Hancock counties. It turned around in Calais and brought wood products, fish and other freight back to markets farther south, serving as a vital economic artery for this isolated area.

But, like other railroads, the Calais Branch faltered as cars and trucks became the preferred means for moving people and freight. The last train traversed the route in 1984, much to the chagrin of residents. &quot;When the trains stopped running, everyone felt the same way, that it would start again soon. But as the railroad's financial problems became known, it became clear that it wasn't going to come back.&quot;

The state bought the rail right-of-way in 1987 and then announced plans to rip up the rails and ties and sell them. That spurred locals into action, and they began lobbying state officials to turn the corridor into a rail-trail. After more than two decades of work, their dream became a reality last fall.

On September 21, 2010, the 85 mile Down East Sunrise Trail was officially opened for public use. The western end of the trail is at Washington Junction, just east of Ellsworth off of US Route 1.The eastern trailhead is in Ayers Junction which is in Pembroke on Maine Route 214, four miles northwest of the Route 214 intersection with US Route 1.

The scenic rail corridor runs along the entire Down East coastal area, connects multiple scenic conservation areas, intersects Down East salmon rivers, and is very near two state designated scenic highways.

The Down East Sunrise Trail was constructed as an interagency project of the Maine Department of Transportation and the Maine Department of Conservation. The project has rehabilitated and preserved 85 miles of the Calais Branch railroad corridor for future rail use while at the same time providing a wide, compact gravel-based trail. The Down East Sunrise Trail will be managed for the use of snowmobiles, ATVs, pedestrians, bicyclists, cross-country skiers and equestrians.

This is a standard sized military ammo box with all kinds of toy cars in it. It's just off the main Sunrise Trail on a side cutoff. You can get to it from 191 and Berry Meadow Road and it will be .55 mile to the GeoCache, or you can just come in from the Sunrise Trail itself. And as always, have fun and happy GeoCaching.</groundspeak:long_description>

There used to be a &quot;Note&quot; here not long ago that stated: &quot;You are so very beautiful, I fell in love with you at first sight. Would you do me the honor of accompanying me to the dance Saturday night. I will count the hours. Your most passionate admirer&quot;.

This is a military 40mm flare ammo box larger than most and has lots of swag that the kids will like. It's also starting out with two Travel Bugs with one being a Jeep.

You can park at parking location A and have an approx 4 mile round trip just to this GeoCache and to The &quot;Sunrise Trails: Harmon Stream&quot; GeoCache. If you do park here, then please do not go any further with a &quot;Powered Vehicle&quot; as they are tearing up the hill and this is private property. Also, if you're not too early in the morning, or late at night, fell free to stop in for a cup of coffee, I'm sure that you can figure out where, it's the only place along your trip.

You can also park at parking location B and have an approx 3 mile round trip just to this GeoCache, or a little over 5 mile round trip if you include the &quot;Sunrise Trails: Harmon Stream&quot; GeoCache.

This micro cache is located where the Sunrise Trail crosses the Harmon Stream. We had come up here before the trail was put in, and this was sort of our private spot for a while.

You can park at parking location A and have an approx 2.2 mile round trip just to this GeoCache and approx 4 miles if you include The &quot;Sunrise Trails: Croaking&quot; GeoCache.

You can also park at parking location B and have an approx 5 mile round trip to this GeoCache, and also get &quot;Sunrise Trails: Croaking&quot; as it's on the way.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This GeoCache is located on the Down East Sunrise Trail.

Built in the late 1800s, the 127-mile Calais Branch Railroad once brought tourists, mail and freight from central Maine to towns in Washington and Hancock counties. It turned around in Calais and brought wood products, fish and other freight back to markets farther south, serving as a vital economic artery for this isolated area.

But, like other railroads, the Calais Branch faltered as cars and trucks became the preferred means for moving people and freight. The last train traversed the route in 1984, much to the chagrin of residents. When the trains stopped running, everyone felt the same way, that it would start again soon. But as the railroad's financial problems became known, it became clear that it wasn't going to come back.

The state bought the rail right-of-way in 1987 and then announced plans to rip up the rails and ties and sell them. That spurred locals into action, and they began lobbying state officials to turn the corridor into a rail-trail. After more than two decades of work, their dream became a reality last fall.

On September 21, 2010, the 85 mile Down East Sunrise Trail was officially opened for public use. The western end of the trail is at Washington Junction, just east of Ellsworth off of US Route 1.The eastern trailhead is in Ayers Junction which is in Pembroke on Maine Route 214, four miles northwest of the Route 214 intersection with US Route 1.

The scenic rail corridor runs along the entire Down East coastal area, connects multiple scenic conservation areas, intersects Down East salmon rivers, and is very near two state designated scenic highways.

The Down East Sunrise Trail was constructed as an interagency project of the Maine Department of Transportation and the Maine Department of Conservation. The project has rehabilitated and preserved 85 miles of the Calais Branch railroad corridor for future rail use while at the same time providing a wide, compact gravel-based trail. The Down East Sunrise Trail will be managed for the use of snowmobiles, ATVs, pedestrians, bicyclists, cross-country skiers and equestrians.

All I can say is that this cache is a micro cache, but not a nano cache. I put one of these out like this some years ago and it took many people to finally find it. If your tired of just finding caches hanging from a branch in a tree, than this is a hide for you.

You can park at parking location A and have an approx 1.25 mile round trip just to this GeoCache. You can also decide to do Sunrise Trails: Harmon Stream, and Sunrise Trails: Croaking GeoCaches and that will be an approx 4 mile round trip journey for all 3 GeoCaches. If you do park here, then please do not go any further with a Powered Vehicle as they are tearing up the hill and this is private property. Also, if you're not too early in the morning, or late at night, fell free to stop in for a cup of coffee, I'm sure that you can figure out where, it's the only place along your trip.

This is a two stage multi-cache with the first stage bringing you the co-ordinates to the second stage which will bring you to a very large ammo can filled with all types of toys for the kids. This one will definately drive anyone looking for it nuts on the first stage, but once you find it, the second stage is a snap. The ammo can is so large that it doesn't even have a single handle on the top, but two handles, one on each side. 

You can park at parking location A and have an approx .85 mile round trip just to this GeoCache. You can also decide to do Sunrise Trails: Harmon Stream, Sunrise Trails Communication and Sunrise Trails: Croaking GeoCaches and that will be an approx 4.25 mile round trip journey for all 4 GeoCaches. If you do park here, then please do not go any further with a Powered Vehicle as they are tearing up the hill and this is private property. Also, if you're not too early in the morning, or late at night, fell free to stop in for a cup of coffee, I'm sure that you can figure out where, it's the only place along your trip.

This GeoCache was specifically designed to be a bit harder in difficulty, but we don't think that we're the only people that like a challenge and if any GeoCache is a challenge, this one is.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Located on Dodge Road just off Route 86 in Dennysville Maine at a small Oasis on the Cathance Stream.

Head west on Route 86 out of Dennysville and at N 44 53.454 , W067 16.336 you will come across a dirt road called Dodge Road on your left.  The dirt road is sign posted.  

Head down Dodge Road, pass the rail road tracks and keep going a short way until you reach a small wooden bridge over the stream.  This stream is Cathance stream.  

Park your vehicle in the small pull-in area on the right just before the bridge.

Cross over the bridge and just after it, on the left, you will see an overgrown trail at: N 44 53.218 W067 16.022 this is where your search begins.  Head down the trail about 100 yards and start your search.  

You are looking for a medium size Lock n Lock clear container.  It is well hidden because muggles sometimes drink in this area at night.  I make no appolgies for the flies as I too almost needed a blood transfusion placing the cache so it is some else's turn!

Be careful crossing the rocks close to the waters edge but no serious hiking or climbing of anything is required.

Take the time to enjoy this quiet little spot and it is good for a picnic or hiking along the stream.  Towards the evenings at the right time of year Moose can normally be seen here as with several places on the Dodge Rd.

I could only get 15ft of accuracy on the coordinates due to tree cover so allow yourself some time for this search.  Please cover it well after finding it so as to hide it from muggles.  Cache started out with all sorts of small items including a Police Department Patch from one of the departments I work for.  There is also a Jeep Travelbug be sure to enter the competition to win a real Jeep when you find it.  Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>In the trees close to the waters edge you will see a small rock gorge.  Look in a hole under roots and move the rocks.  Just infront of a single pine that has grown into two and just after the rock ledge.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Built in the late 1800s, the 127-mile Calais Branch Railroad once brought tourists, mail and freight from central Maine to towns in Washington and Hancock counties. It turned around in Calais and brought wood products, fish and other freight back to markets farther south, serving as a vital economic artery for this isolated area.
 
But, like other railroads, the Calais Branch faltered as cars and trucks became the preferred means for moving people and freight. The last train traversed the route in 1984, much to the chagrin of residents. &quot;When the trains stopped running, everyone felt the same way, that it would start again soon. But as the railroad's financial problems became known, it became clear that it wasn't going to come back.&quot;
 
The state bought the rail right-of-way in 1987 and then announced plans to rip up the rails and ties and sell them. That spurred locals into action, and they began lobbying state officials to turn the corridor into a rail-trail. After more than two decades of work, their dream became a reality last fall.   

On September 21, 2010, the 85 mile Down East Sunrise Trail was officially opened for public use. The western end of the trail is at Washington Junction, just east of Ellsworth off of US Route 1. The eastern trailhead is in Ayers Junction which is in Pembroke on Maine Route 214, four miles northwest of the Route 214 intersection with US Route 1.

The scenic rail corridor runs along the entire Down East coastal area, connects multiple scenic conservation areas, intersects Down East salmon rivers, and is very near two state designated scenic highways. 

The Down East Sunrise Trail was constructed as an interagency project of the Maine Department of Transportation and the Maine Department of Conservation. The project has rehabilitated and preserved 85 miles of the Calais Branch railroad corridor for future rail use while at the same time providing a wide, compact gravel-based trail. The Down East Sunrise Trail will be managed for the use of snowmobiles, ATVs, pedestrians, bicyclists, cross-country skiers and equestrians.

This is a standard nano GeoCache.

There is a trail head just to the west of Robinson Cottages on Route 86 and it will be .39 mile to the GeoCache, or you can also park on Dodge Road and walk about .7 mile to the GeoCache.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This GeoCache is located on the Down East Sunrise Trail.

Built in the late 1800s, the 127-mile Calais Branch Railroad once brought tourists, mail and freight from central Maine to towns in Washington and Hancock counties. It turned around in Calais and brought wood products, fish and other freight back to markets farther south, serving as a vital economic artery for this isolated area.
 
But, like other railroads, the Calais Branch faltered as cars and trucks became the preferred means for moving people and freight. The last train traversed the route in 1984, much to the chagrin of residents. &quot;When the trains stopped running, everyone felt the same way, that it would start again soon. But as the railroad's financial problems became known, it became clear that it wasn't going to come back.&quot;
 
The state bought the rail right-of-way in 1987 and then announced plans to rip up the rails and ties and sell them. That spurred locals into action, and they began lobbying state officials to turn the corridor into a rail-trail. After more than two decades of work, their dream became a reality last fall.   

On September 21, 2010, the 85 mile Down East Sunrise Trail was officially opened for public use. The western end of the trail is at Washington Junction, just east of Ellsworth off of US Route 1. The eastern trailhead is in Ayers Junction which is in Pembroke on Maine Route 214, four miles northwest of the Route 214 intersection with US Route 1.

The scenic rail corridor runs along the entire Down East coastal area, connects multiple scenic conservation areas, intersects Down East salmon rivers, and is very near two state designated scenic highways. 

The Down East Sunrise Trail was constructed as an interagency project of the Maine Department of Transportation and the Maine Department of Conservation. The project has rehabilitated and preserved 85 miles of the Calais Branch railroad corridor for future rail use while at the same time providing a wide, compact gravel-based trail. The Down East Sunrise Trail will be managed for the use of snowmobiles, ATVs, pedestrians, bicyclists, cross-country skiers and equestrians.

The GeoCache has a difficulty rating of 3.0 due to the fact that the GeoCache may be found and numerous elevations around this area.

And please don't park on Route 86 if you're going to look for this GeoCache, instead go in from the other side on Milwaukee Avenue as there's almost no vehicle traffic at all on this road.

One last thing, if you want to log a NGS Benchmark, there is one on the south side of the bridge at it's base.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a beautiful coastal hike located in Eastport ME in the Shackford Head Hiking area.  Your hike, which takes up to one and a half hours for the full circular hike, starts out at the Shackhead Head Parking Lot near to the Washington County Community College Boat School.

In the parking lot you will see a series of informational plaques describing everything from the areas ship wrecks to its wildlife and bald eagle population.  The start of the trail is obvious and close to the start of the trail you will see an alternate trail known as the Schooner Trail which is indicated along the route with blue markings.  Take the Schooner trail and you're on your way.

The trail can be fairly strenous hike with several ups and downs and can be slippery in places and pretty boggy in wet weather.  In the afternoon be sure to take a flashlight as it can be easy to lose the trail in poor light.

You are looking for a clearing with some rocky outcrops and a great view of Cobscook Bay.  Once you have found the cache if you continue on the trail it will eventually take you up onto the summit of Shackford Head with stunning views of north Lubec and all the way to Grand Manan on a clear day.  Bald Eagles can often be seen watching you from the trees and if you have binoculars you will often catch a seal or two swimming below you near the Salmon pens.  The walk back down from the summit is a straight forward trail and much less strenous than the Schooner Trail.

Original contents of the cache were: log book, three mind teazer puzzle set, pedometer, little pouch, wooden ornament box, ty beanie toy, and Snoopin Around TB.  You're looking for a small ammo can.

Good luck, enjoy your hike and the views.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>In a clearing overlooking the bay with Pembroke to the right and lubec to the left there is a sturdy lone spruce tree behind you.  The tree is the key.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

This GeoCache is at where the Down East Sunrise Trail crosses the Wilson Stream. We saw a bear on our way to Ayers Junction just after placing this GeoCache, so it's always a good idea NOT to be so quiet that you may accidentally sneak up on one.</groundspeak:long_description>

Here we are at the end of the Down East Sunrise Trail, at least if you're going by the mile markers. The mile markers go as high as 87 miles, but most all of the information that you find posted on this trail says that it is 85 miles long. If you're going to park here and take the trail to Ellsworth, than this is just the beginning for you, regardless of what the mile markers say.</groundspeak:long_description>

While driving the back roads between the Stud Mill Road and Little River Road, I came across this site. Please look at the pictures I enclosed. I was so impressed with this finding that I left a cache there and came home to research what I had found.
Find this cache from the SMR or Little River Road, to 60-00-8 road.
Apparently there is a 1 mile trail from the road up to Wabassus Mountain. Park safely off the side of the road at the nearest pull off if you intend to hide the mountain, not just grab the cache.
The story of Reggie's Way is that Reggie and Ted live in a small trailer in the summer, near here.  They sell food, drinks and gas to those out enjoying the trail systems. Currently, at the bottom of this trail, they have rigged up a pvc pipe to a natural spring and placed a cup, a sign, a tub of soda and a collection can. See the picture below. I am also told, by the locals, that at times there is an old canoe with a skeleton at the site.
The cache is 65 feet up the trail, from the dirt road. Have a nice cool spring drink for a cent, or pay $1.00 and have a nice cool soda. Please leave your can in the trash bag provided, or better yet, CITO!
I am hopeful to place a cache at the top of the mountain some day, but will have to see if my disability allows it. </groundspeak:long_description>

Hooper Hill is located on Ryan Road.  Apparently, per The Big Man, this use to be called &quot;The Hump&quot; back in his teenage high school days.  It apparently was the local hot spot for partying and going parking with your best girl.  It was used then and now for storage of logs for the mill.  During the spring when there is a shortage of wood coming in, such as with the woods being too muddy to haul, the logs are taken to the mill.  This keeps the mill active all year.

Living in Princeton, this is the major hub for shopping activity for locals, Canadians and those of us living in the out lying towns.  This is one of 2 major places that our families shop at.  Oh, and the 2 sons-in-law like their coffee brandy, so we can't forget to keep our place stocked for them.  You never know when they might drop in!

This is another public boat landing on Big Lake, at the end of West Road.  If this is plowed in the winter, it will remain winter friendly, except the snow banks.  Another awesome view here and a nice place for Geo Jesse dog to go swimming!

This cache is a nano which hopefully will have a better chance of surviving this kid friendly area.  Thomas Dicenzo (local construction company) donated money for this sports complex. 
This complex has a pool, skate park, soccer, basketball, football and baseball.  There are many activities available to the local youth.

PLEASE do not take any items or leave trades other than Signature Items, Coins, TB's and path tags.  Enjoy looking thru all!

This geocache is not a trade cache.  This is for everyone to veiw, enjoying and perhaps add to the cache.
This Geocache is filled with SIGNATURE items which I collected over the years when I first started caching.  After awhile, I realized I couldn't keep collecting them.   A lot of signature items have been replaced by path tags now.  
Please feel free to add your signature item or path tag, but please do not trade items.  This cache is for others to enjoy signature items past and present.  All items are in baggies if not weather resistant.  Please enjoy them and comment on them in your logs.
I decided that living in Princeton doesn't provide me with an area well traveled by geocachers.  Then realized that the Stud Mill Road is the perfect place to add this cache plus is easy for me to maintain.  Enjoy!

This cache is to honor little Camden Pierce Hughes.  He became Maine's child on 5/14/11 when he was found dead, wrapped in a blanket and left on the side of the road, in the town of South Berwick.  The full details are still unknown, but his mother has confessed to killing him.
I can't comprehend what has happened to this little boy at the hand of his mother, and why???  And mostly, I just can't get him off my mind.  
I am placing this cache here in the Princeton cemetary, for Camden.  This hopefully will be a place of peace where others can come and say a prayer for him, bow your head, or just remember this little boys' short life.

How often do you have to run to this store, if you're a local, for a forgotten item?

Please be stealthy at this high muggle urban cache in tiny Princeton, Maine.

This cache is located on an old wood logging trail.  It is the first right once you cross over the intersection onto the Grand Falls Road.  I used my RAV4 out here, but my geovehicle thinks it's a 4X4 Ranger, or wants to be one.  I would suggest no low 2WD cars try this.  We were out here checking out the old logging trails.  Geo Jesse loves to run out here.  
Look for the large Osprey nest up on the power line to the left.  It isn't there right now, should be back next spring.  It had to be removed a few weeks ago as the repair men capped the lines.
Could use a 4X4, snow shoes, hiking feet!

This cache is on the same old logging trail as &quot;Ranger might be needed here&quot;.  It is further up the trail.  A 4X4 vehicle is probably best out here, but my RAV4 did drive out here.  Not recommended for a low 2WD.  Would be great with a 4X4, snowmobile, ski's, snowshoes or hiking feet!

Le geocache est situé sur l'ancienne ferme de la famille Cyr, maintenant route 144, qui était la trans-canadienne. l'étable a été transporter a l'autre bord du chemin qui était une fois aussi la trans-canadienne.

The cache is located just off route 144 on the edge of one of our farming properties. You can safely park in the access road to the field. Route 144 now is the road less traveled since the new 4-lane highway was put in place. The extra wide shoulders can provide safe parking. The cache container is a large coffee tin. You shouldn't need to enter the farming property to access it. During May-August watch for farming vehicules that cross the road to the nearby farm. Looking south, you can see older farming buildings in nearby Van Buren Maine.

Le geocache is situe au bord du terrain familial, vous pouvez stationner sur l'épaule facilement et aller direct du chemin. Prenez garde durant les mois de moissons car les véhicules de la ferme circule. Le sud, vous pouvez voir l'état du Maine. </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>the cache is behind 3 small trees about 12 feet from the access road. Look for the east path in the ditch and look to the right. don't go looking beyond the old fence. le cache est derrière un arbre 4m du chemin, vous n'avez pas besoin de traverser la cloture. </groundspeak:encoded_hints>

The second half of the road is used mainly by ATV's. Prior to the access road, there were three building dating from the early 1900's which belonged to my family, including a large barn. Due to the condition, the structures were demolished and the aged wood was collected for other projects.

This road (and surrounding land) is used by my family to access the many plots of land we have. Cache is a regular coffee tin. Parking is easy. But be aware of farming vehicules during may-august. You don't need to enter the property to access the cache. You can enter the property for turning around your vehicule, but try not to trample the crops. </groundspeak:long_description>
