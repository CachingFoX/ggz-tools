I spent a few days camping at Wright's beach just after the tsunami that hit Japan. The waves were crashing way up the beach and the sound was indescribable.

While spending my weekend here I took a short stroll along the coast starting at Wright's beach and ending at goat rock. This is the Kutrom trail. Several locations along this trail are made up of long wooden walkways that allow access across wetlands. This was my first trip out this trail and it was lined by wild Iris, daffodils and calla lilies. A great place for a cache.

Don't stop at the cache because this the hike is not over, just around the corner is the best part. Don't forget to bring a pen the container is too small for one.

The ftf Koupin for the first to find goes to TheAngle3. Congratulations.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A yardang is a streamlined hill carved from bedrock or any
consolidated or semiconsolidated material by the dual action
of wind abrasion, dust and sand, water or deflation.

This little out cropping of rock gave a great view of the
ocean along the California coast. I sat here for hours watching the waves crash along the beach and decided I would bring other cacher's here.

The climb up could be difficult for some but i climbed it
barefoot.
The top of the Yardang is flat and has room for 2 or 3 people
but stay away from the edges the are eroding away and you could slip off.

I will make this easy for all so you dont have to do the
cacheing wonder. Sit in the middle of the rock and look around. the camo is common to this area and is the only one on this mound.

The Container is too small for a pen so don't forget to bring your own.

I've always thought that Applegate Lake needed another cache.

In the summertime the ratings will both be 1s.
Elevation is 2004' or 1' above the surface.

In the winter time the ratings will both by 5s for obvious reasons. Elevation is still 2004' but 30' or so above the surface.

Cache container is a small vitamin bottle with a log and a FTF certificate.
Please B.Y.O.W.I.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located on the road to the Waldo Cemetery near the sacred arch. At least that's the first thing that came to mind.

We had been planing to come out here all summer and finally got around to it. There is a TON of history around Josephine County, just waiting for people to find it. I've lived here for over 35 years and had never been out here.
Up this access road is the Waldo Cemetery. DO NOT miss going up there. It is well worth it.

We could not find the Chinese cemetery as the sun was going down so we'll save that one for another time.

Eventually we will find the actual town of Waldo (we have a pretty good idea where it is) and we will put a cache there as well.

You're looking for a camo'd koolaid container.
There are rose bushes, apple trees, and pear trees near the cache location which leads me to believe that there was probably a homestead around here at one time.
At least 100 years ago.
Just think.
These trees and roses have been here for over 100 years...

We forgot our foriegn coins at home so for right now there is just a log. BYOWI. We will get back soon to drop off some more goodies.</groundspeak:long_description>

I am out to place the hardest cache known to man in every city in the Rogue Valley without any &quot;trickery&quot; involved AND it has to be within city limits. This one is Squaw Peak.  I know this isn't in a city, however, I needed a 5 for terrain level, and we were hunting up here, so thar ya be! Try if you dare, but many of you will fail.....or will you? Remeber to replace the cache exactly as you found it, if you actually find it...he he he!
BYOP. Stay on the road.  You will have to hike up about 1200-1300 feet to grab this one.  You can also grab &quot;Left 350&quot; before and &quot;Watchtower&quot; after.  This is right in the middle on the way up to a great view.</groundspeak:long_description>

I am out to place the hardest cache known to man in every city in the Rogue Valley without any &quot;trickery&quot; involved AND it has to be within city limits. This one is in the Applegate Valley.  I know there's no city up here, but hey...a little latitude? Try if you dare, but many of you will fail.....or will you? Remeber to replace the cache exactly as you found it, if you actually find it...he he he!
BYOP.  Watch out you don't hit your head on a Big Yellow Sign.  Also, this is a blind corner, so watch for cars if you cross the street.  Enjoy the pricker bushes....or will you?  Small pulloff area on both sides of the street.</groundspeak:long_description>

Talk about Beautiful...

Park near the Fountain of Youth.
Isn't that the most gorgeous little creek you've ever seen?
And stupid me, I forgot to bring a camera.

Depending on the weather this one might be easier or harder than the current rating.
I'll adjust accordingly when necessary.

This one should be fairly easy. Check out the Thursday, April 29th edition of the Mail Tribune for a little more info.

Here's a link in case you missed it.

We found this site while putting out some earlier caches. Some guys were shooting a very nice gun so we figured what better place to hide a cache.

And to make it worth your while we ONLY put out small or larger containers in the woods.

I've hiked this trail many times while hunting and since I started geocaching I wanted to hide some caches on the trail. This one is near the beginning but I plan to hide more along the trail in the future. You can still hike the trail though as its a really nice, pretty flat walk. </groundspeak:long_description>

Out hiding caches and saw this great pull off spot. Out looking for a good hidey hole and spotted what looked like a small doe laying on all fours. Got a little closer and saw it was just a natural formation in a pretty big tree complete with hidey hole. The geo-gods were smiling(pun intended)down on us!

One of our favorite hunting spots. I can't believe no one has hidden a cache anywhere up Ferris Gulch. This will be the first one of many we have planned for the area. Don't know when the next ones will be placed, but someday.
When we hid the cache we found a dead little spike buck not far from the spot. Another deer that won't grow into a nice big Buck. Hope you all enjoy the area.
Your looking for a green plastic container. Congratulations to Dilligaf70 for FTF. I think I placed it in his backyard! Goodjob!</groundspeak:long_description>

After looking around a little you'll find out why I named this cache what I did.

There was about 2&quot; of snow when I hid the cache a couple weeks ago but that's probably all gone by now so no tracks to follow. Sorry.

You'll looking for a large camo'd vitamin bottle with Log, FTF cert., a special FTF prize, a special STF prize, &amp; a writing stick.

I can't name a better thing to do on a rainy Oregon day then to go Geocaching.

Murphy needed some more caches so I thought that I'd oblige.

This cache is dedicated to the memory of my mom, Marge Potter, whose family moved to Grays Cr. from Wisconsin in the early 30's. I just never found out where exactly. We came up here in the 80's to look for the old homestead before she passed away but things change a little in 50 years.

There will be at least 6 new caches published on 12-6 and at least 5 more on 12-13 that have already been hidden before the snows started falling.

I'm shooting for 20 new caches before the party.

Getting some caches up Cheney Cr. and we thought that there were WAY to many kewl spots to put out some hard to find caches so we thought that we'd give some of you some hard ones to look for.

Coords were bouncing around BIGTIME!
So much so that at one point my GPS said that I was in France at 46 07.977N 001 59.109W at an altitude of 20082'.
Never had that happen before.

Anyway it was a PERFECT day to be out caching.



The terrain is REALLY ruff without a 4X4 but you can make it on a bicycle or you can walk in from the fork. The choice is yours. There is a turn around spot at ground zero.

We had came up here last summer looking for a bottle dump.
My friend (Bewise) used to go 4 wheelin' all over these parts in his younger days and came across the bottle dump many moons ago.

There was also extensive mining that was done up the hill by the Chinese so you can only guess at how old it would be but we didn't climb that far. Us old farts just aren't as active as we used to be.

The cache is NOT near the garbage that morons come up here and dump these days.

You have a choice of parking on the road and walking or you can drive close to the cache IF you have a 4X4.

You are looking for a camo'd Advil container.
Something that most cachers can't live without.

Left a foreign coin. BYOWI!</groundspeak:long_description>

Another End Of The Road cache. Well, kinda. It's not quite at the end but it's close enough to qualify.

We are gonna try to put out at least 1 new cache each week or every couple weeks during the winter so you guys who are bored will have something to do.

Cache is a small camo'd pill bottle that contains the usual.
Log, shorty pencil, &amp; a foreign coin.

Wow! &quot;A new speed caching run&quot; you may think. But before you bolt out the door and fly like a bird from your nest to Old Stage road, you may want to remember who placed these caches! Yup, you're right! So, drop in a stick of gum and slow your roll for these dEVILed eggs. After looking for a while, you may feel as dumb as a rock; just say, &quot;Rats!&quot; and move on the next cache. Be careful when sticking your hands in dark places; spiders and snakes have been known to bite! Lastly, you'll probably need some music, so we'd recommend &quot;Brick House&quot; by the Commodores.

Yep, another EOTR cache.

This location is within a mile of our house so be expecting more caches to follow.

This one should be a breeze.

Best way to find it is on a bicycle or on foot since a vehicle is a little obvious.

This is the second cache that I've placed in this area. I might have to reposition them to make room for more locations

This is within site of Pussy Willow Galore (GC2C7EY) if you haven't gotten that one yet.

Camo'd bottle with FTF cert, foreign coin, pencil, and race car.

It is accessible from either direction.

PLEASE be careful when re-hiding.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is the first of my new Nighttime caches.

Cache is a camo'd micro pouch.
P.B.Y.O.W.I.

I'm going against my NO MICRO rule with these caches but they will be fairly easy IF you cache at night. Otherwise muggle activity will be very high.

No special tools will be required except for a good flashlight which may or may not be needed for some caches.

I have chronic insomnia so I am awake most nights. If you are like me or you work nights or just wanna have something fun to do after the sun goes down then these caches will be right up your alley.

I'll put out at least one new nighttime cache per month but I'm shooting for 1 every week or so.</groundspeak:long_description>

Near an item that is harder to find than you think.  (the item is hard to find, not the cache)  These used to be all over the place, but modern electronics have made them nearly obsolete.

F.T.F trivia:  The blockbuster movie E.T. made in 1982, used Reese's Pieces to lure the extra terrestrial. But the staring roll (of the candy) was first offered to Mars for M&amp;M's.  For what ever reason, they declined, but were soon to be kicking themselves when sales of Reese's Pieces soared with the movie release.

It's rated 4.5 difficulty for a reason so don't come complaining to me if you can't find it.

While out with Bewise doing some cache maintenance we were looking for some possible hiding places.

When we found a nice location we went to take out a container only to discover that we had left them at home so we had to borrow one from Bewise.

Since they only had a film canister that's what you get.

Contains log only so bring a writing stick.</groundspeak:long_description>

out with bewise Today getting some caches and this place cried oUt for a hide so i thought why not?
since i didn't ring a Container with me, they were nice enough to give me one of theirs. no need to Klimb.

the road is accEssable with a high clearance vehicle. we had a jeep but 4 wheel drive was not needed. During the snow 4X4 would obviously be required.

you're looking for a camo'd seasoning container with some small trade items. as always there is a foreign coin.

O.K., while driving up Picket Creek looking for good spots to hide I came across the firing range on the right. I wanted to put a cache up the hill but I figured that it might be to dangerous so I put one a cross the road.

You're looking for a small camo'd pill bottle with a log, FTF cert, and a couple dodads.

-------------WARNING---------------
There is a TON of Poison Oak around the cache location so BE CAREFUL!!!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

I don't know why but I just love EOTR caches.

Another camo'd container with log, FTF cert, and some trade goodies.

If you find ANY of the other caches that I put out today you'll have no problem finding this one.

I'll be putting out more like this in the future.</groundspeak:long_description>

While taking a drive up Picket Creek I came across this place.

Very peaceful.

Cache is a couple hundred yards from the parking area.
You might be able to drive most of the way to the cache with a 4 X 4.

Check out the small pond off to your right as you are walking in.

Not your usual container for this type of hide.
Log, FTF cert, &amp; a writing stick are enclosed.</groundspeak:long_description>

Well, I wonder how many EOTR caches I can put out???

Again had to snag a container from Bewise.

You're looking for a camo'd sandwich container.

Again 4X4 is not required unless there's snow.




I increased the difficulty since so many awesome cachers were having problems.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is the first of a new Gnome series... It is extremely encouraged that field notes are taken as well as a photo of the cache and surroundings. These items will come in handy for a cache in the future! 
Recommendations:
1. Hiking boots- terrain is very steep and there are lots of sharp pokeys around.
2. Long pants/ long sleeved shirt- please refer to #1. You will get dirty on this one...
3. Leave coordinates with a family member- as cache is out in the middle of nowhere, search and rescue would appreciate the assistance...
4. Flashlight- don't even bother attempting this one without at least one flashlight... It is in the dark!
5. Camera- you will kick yourself if you forget it... This is definately photo worthy...
6. Teams of two or more- being out in the middle of nowhere and in case someone gets stuck a buddy is highly recommended!

There are many little holes in the rocks in the area. Some are deeper than others and some blend in with their surroundings better than others.

The cache contains a brand new TB (The Centurion) that I picked up in Israel back in '97. The cache has a bunch of cool swag including a flashlight and some jewelry! A treasure chest with goodies inside! Yay!

Please feel free to contact me for assistance on this one.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A couple of weeks ago Zop and I saw a post on Facebook about squeezing through a rabbit hole to find a cache.  It was a link to a Latitude 47 article. We agreed to go get it someday on the reply posts on Facebook. Well today was the day. Zop and I were planning on visiting the Pacific North West for the July 4th weekend and our 2 year cachaversary and he suggested this cache as my milestone cache. I thought it was the perfect idea. 

I must say I recommend if you find this cache PLAN YOUR ROUTE and do your homework. It took us over 2 hours to find the access point! What an adventure it was just trying to get there. I even tried to email the cache owner for help! I never got a reply and I am glad of it! It was worth the feeling of success we we finally got the drop off point.

Once we were at the access point I was ready to goGoGO! I LOVE underground caches. I learned this when Zop and I found Lair of Smaug in Davenport, CA. What a RUSH! I think it is the Hobbit in me that just has to get an underground cache. 
Find this cache, it will NOT disappoint. This is the best cave cache I have visited to date. I will not go into detail but Zop and I WILL post some pictures of our fun.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Ok.. When we read the Facebook link to Latitude 47’s article, I jokingly taunted Cheryl-MuggleN0More about maybe taking a ride to Oregon. That she would take me up on it with so much enthusiasm was well… Why I like her [:D]… Anyway, the discussion sort of ended there but we actually did decide to take a ride up to Oregon (from the Wine country of CA, or is that whine?) to see if we could make it to Portland in time to grab Dr. Who but we soon realized that we would never make it in time. Unless they are open tomorrow that is. With C-MNM’s big 4K milestone coming up VERY soon, I kind of mentioned this hide once again. That was it! That was the nail in the coffin. We had to immediately stop caching and only get two this morning on the way to Roseburg.  Only two caches from Ashland to Roseburg? I think we can… Well, We did it! We picked up two caches near the area just to the North of where we wanted to be and then tried SEVERAL roads that the GPS told us would take us to GZ only to be stopped at all by gates and ‘No Trespassing’ signs. Finally, we found ourselves not 1.2 miles from GZ where we asked a very nice lady if she knew how we could find our way UP there and I tell ya! We asked the right person! In no time, we were winding our way closer and closer! Then with our lucky Nuvi (remind me to shoot it when I get home) We turned up a very narrow trail that should take us right there. But Wait! Another gate and NO way to turn around. Did I say we were in a two-wheel drive? Fortunately, rolling back down backwards was actually a little easier than heading up. Then back on the main trail we just kept on going and going.. Let’s see. We started this about two hours earlier? Finally!!  We arrive at a spot that looked to be the closest possible spot and begin our hike. A few deer trails and lucky turns later and there it was.. The infamous ‘rabbit hole’… The rest? Well… Pictures to follow [:D]
What an awesome adventure from start to finish! We were certainly winded when we made it back to the cachemobile but it was so worth it.

Since I was at the VA Hospital and this cache was near by, I decided to go for it. This was my first official find and it took some serious hunting to find it.  It was very well hidden.  I lost my glasses looking among the boulders.  

This cache needs serious attention. Its old and and the container is starting to breakdown. ( what happens to that kind of plastic, its also a bit to small for the log book and pen.  I would give it a larger container. The baggie needs replacing with winter on its way. )  I left a four pack of new AA batteries for those in need. That should help two hunters, depending on how hungry your GPS is.

This was well hidden and took serious looking.

While driving up to Eugene I thought that I'd do a little caching on the way back and couldn't believe that Rice Hill didn't have a cache. Well, it does now.
This location has been a staple in the community for many, many years

After ordering and walking around in the rain I finally found a nice place to hide one.

WARNING WARNING WARNING!!!!!
If you are caching in the summer time be VERY careful about muggles.
In summer it's typical to have 25 people or more in line and 15 vehicles in the main parking lot.
Heck it was raining when I stopped and there were 6 cars there counting mine.

Hopefully this cache will last a while.

Camo'd pill bottle with FTF cert., pencil, some little do dads, &amp; a foreign coin as always.

Special thanx to BeWise&amp;SeekHim for replacing the almost full log. [:)]</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">American Buffalo is also a name for the American Bison

Bison are six species of large even-toed ungulates within the subfamily Bovinae. Two of these species still exist: the American plains bison (Bison bison bison), and the American wood bison (Bison bison athabascae) are subspecies found in North America.

The American bison and the European wisent are the largest terrestrial mammals in North America and Europe. Bison are nomadic grazers and travel in herds, except for the non-dominant bulls, which travel alone or in small groups during most of the year. American bison are known for living in the Great Plains. Both species were hunted close to extinction during the 19th and 20th centuries but have since rebounded. The American Plains bison is no longer listed as endangered, but the Wood Bison is on the endangered species list in Canada.

Although superficially similar, there are a number of physical and behavioural differences between the American and European bison. The American species has 15 ribs, while the European bison has 14. The American bison has four lumbar vertebrae, while the European has five.[3] Adult American bison are not as rangy in build, and have shorter legs.[4] American bison tend to graze more, and browse less than their European cousins, due to their necks being set differently. Compared to the American bison, the nose of the European species is set further forward than the forehead when the neck is in a neutral position. The body of the American bison is hairier, though its tail has less hair than that of the European bison. The horns of the European bison point through the plane of their faces, making them more adept at fighting through the interlocking of horns in the same manner as domestic cattle, unlike the American bison which favours charging. American bison are more easily tamed than their European cousins, and breed with domestic cattle more readily.

Bison are born without their trademark hump and horns and live for approximately twenty years. They grow to maturity at two to three years, although males continue to grow until about their seventh year. Adult bulls express a high degree of dominance competitiveness during mating season. Male bison fight for females and these fights often result in injury or death. After the bison mate, the herd splits up into smaller herds. Calves are born nine months after mating. The mothers take care of and nurse their young for a year.

Levi Scott (1797 – 1890) was a politician in the Oregon Territory of the United States in the 1850s. A native of Illinois, he was a captain during the Cayuse War, helped lay the Applegate Trail, served in the Oregon Territorial Legislature, and in 1857 was a member of the Oregon Constitutional Convention. Scott also founded Scottsburg, Oregon, and is the namesake for several natural features in Southern Oregon.
During the Cayuse War Scott was made a captain and was responsible for sending dispatches for the Provisional Government south to California. Following his involvement in the war, he settled in 1848 along Elm Creek in Douglas County, Oregon, with the valley named Scotts Valley in his honor. In 1850, Scott founded Scottsburg along the Umpqua River,  Mount Scott in Crater Lake National Park in Southern Oregon is also named after Levi.

Scott then entered the political field when he was elected to the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1852. He represented three southern counties, Umpqua, Douglas and Jackson as a Whig in the upper chamber Council. Scott won re-election twice, serving through the 1854-55 session. He returned to politics briefly in 1857 as a delegate to the Oregon Constitutional Convention. Scott represented Umpqua County as an Anti-Democrat.
He died in Malheur County, Oregon, in the Southeastern part of the state on April 21, 1890. In addition to the town, valley,  Scott Mountain in Douglas County is also named after Levi. This memorial is in his honor and honors the town of Scottsburg.

The government thought that if the Japanese invaded Oregon they had to have a place to stop them. The structure was a Machine gun nest. The tunnel was loaded with an explosive and was to be exploded if the Japanese got close. If that failed the gun nest was within shooting distance of the western entrance. Fortunately it was never used.
The cache is on the east side of the tunnel near a historic monument for a school in the area from 1890's till the 1913.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This RV park has been our summer home for 5 years now. It is right on the Umpqua river. I have Owners permission to place cache. You do not have to enter the park to find this one. Great fishing and rafting nearby.  I took three readings with my GPS and got three different readings. I averaged them, so you might be off a few feet. It is a plastic camoed bottle about 5 inches high. Log, pen, three back up pencils, small bottle of Anti-bacterial spray and Pewter medallion for the first to find, plastic medal on a ribbon, magnetic book mark from Napa, California and other goodies. Remember if you take something please leave something. 

Congratulations to Honu 4 for the FTF.

Skinner's Butte was named after Eugene Skinner, whom the town of Eugene is named after. The coordinates will take you to a good place to observe a common geological formation known as basalt columns, which form when basalt cools quickly and vertical cracks form in it. Your task is to find out how many basalt columns have been planted in the ground surrounding the plaque (not including the one the plaque is on) just west of the coordinates on the other side of the road; put this number in for the code phrase. For example, if there were five basalt columns, I would type 5 in as the code phrase.</groundspeak:long_description>

EDIT 4/28/10 Okay, I am getting the feeling that I made this too hard with the name of the cache, so I am bumping up the rating to a 3. If you dont find it, please report it. Reporting it as DNF isn't something to be ashamed of. There is a reason for that. :)

Also, I dont really want this area all torn up. So I will give a better hint. :)

The Long Tom River Dam build for a flour mill that is across the river from here. You can see the fish ladder and the turbine house. The old mill is no longer there, however you can still see the concrete remains where the mill used to sit. At one time, Monroe generated their own power here for the street lights. Growing up, I used to play around the mill and on the fish ladder while my dad was working there. I have a lot of fond memories of this site area.

Stealth is required here. This is a popular fishing hole.

There is poison oak in the area so be careful. Have fun and be safe driving up here.

There is a large Madrone tree (dont see too many of them this large) and a few smaller ones just down the hill from here. Watch out for poison oak in that area.

The terrain is rated higher to 2.5 because of finding the right logging roads. Its an easy walk to it once you are at GZ and its rated 1.5.

Warning Poison Oak
Let me say it again this is a poison oak bush




Like any shady situation count your self lucky if all you come out with is a little rash.




My good friend Kill 4 Beer has a saying. I live in Tangent. When I do something makeshift he calls it Tangent style. This cache is hidden where I remember a good cache hidden a while ago by a great cacher. It was removed by road construction. I thought this was a good area for a cache. So I have hidden another one. This is also a strange intersection like a 3 way stop with only one stop sign. I drive by this way every day on my way to or from work so beware I may notice you looking for it, and come say hi. So if Geo Prizm with a Tangent style roof rack sneaks up on you that's me. This is in a small circular container covered with Tangent style camo. Already stuffed with Pickleddreams style SWAG</groundspeak:long_description>

have a cache. This is my first cache in Oregon, but I have family
that lives here so I'm done here all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peanut Park is a small getaway spot for city youth. It features
a small playground and open field in which to play. There is a
picnic table and grill. Dogs are required to be on leash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a nano cache if you have never found one
like this it might be a little more difficult but it shouldn't be
too hard. Please remember to bring a pen and sign small :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area is only open from dawn to dusk so please be respectful
and don't go after this one at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get stuck and need a hint feel free to send me a message
or you can always call
me.&lt;/p&gt;

You might be asking, What the heck is an interrobang
An interrobang is a question mark and an exclamation mark combined. If you ask a question when you are excited you use an interrobang. 

This Cache is in the little strip of lang between HWY 34 and McFarland. Its best to park on the side of McFarland, its not a very busy road. 

This is a park get out and walk 20 feet and grab so have fun

Use to be hidden in a pine apple shaped container. It was lost some time ago. So I replaced it with a cylinder shaped container. 

 to stay with the theme I have placed 4 Pineapple Upside Down Cake recipes in here. If you know of a special one and don’t mind sharing it with other geocachers, you can bring a copy and trade with one already in the cache. I would like to keep up the theme and only trade the recipes as swag for this one. Travel bugs of any sort allowed. A little history if you wanted to know It seems hard to believe that the Pineapple Upside Down cake has not always been with us, however in reality canned pineapples were not available until 1903 when Jim Dole of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company (now Dole Pineapple) perfected a way to tin them. So where did people get the idea of putting fruit at the bottom of a cake pan? Well this technique has been around since the Middle Ages. Traditionally made with apples, cherries and other seasonal fruit upside down cakes were often made in cast-iron skillets on top of the stove. The use of pineapple (and an oven) was just the newest most novel twist, an ode to twentieth century technologies and notions of convenience. Indeed it did not take long for the recipe to work its way into the American housewife’s repertoire. By 1925 the Hawaiian Pineapple Company (1925) was receiving 2500 recipes for Pineapple Upside Down Cake when it asked people to submit creative ways to prepare pineapples. Only 2 decades after the introduction of the canned pineapple the Pineapple Upside Down Cake had become a pop icon! While rooting around in old women’s magazines I found a Gold Medal Flour ad with a full-page, four-color picture of Pineapple Upside-Down Cake–a round cake with six slices of pineapple, candied red cherries, and a brown sugar glaze. The date: November 1925.” —American Century Cookbook: The Most Popular Recipes of the 20th Century, Jean Anderson The next year (1926) the Hawaiian Pineapple company capitalized on the popularity of the Pineapple Upside Down Cake by running a national ad campaign featuring the recipe. Further solidifying its place in culinary history? So are you ready to try your hand at this American classic?

This is a great place to stop on your way to the coast for a picnic lunch or just to let your animals run a little. 

You are looking for a green ammo can that is not on the main path. You may have to bush-whack a little depending on the time of year. Please make sure the can gets placed in same location and is covered by at least some near by foliage. 

Thanks for looking! I will post First to find!

Speeding down the road and spotted a herd of elk. My car always stops when I see something like that. Soooo will try to share herd with you. They were about 100 feet from where I was parked. Real easy to see. Cache is close to where you park. Hope they are there when you are. Need pen. </groundspeak:long_description>

This place is just a humming. Cache is near where you can park. Easy gravel road up to sight. All up hill but just step a little harder on the gas pedal and you can make it. Had the older guys in mind when I hid this, also those who may ride bikes. I used to pick berries here but not this year. They were pretty scarce. Another spot maybe some will visit for the first time. Cache is an ammo can. Beware wild animals in area. Not really just golfers </groundspeak:long_description>

Nice easy walk on blacktop trail. Take the full walk and you may want a sip or two of water. Very easy. Rest and sit down at cache. Take off shoes and cool the dogs. Bring fish pole, swim suit and the dog. Very nice for kids and a picnic. This man made lake helped build the 2 towers you see in the distance. Thats why the area is &quot;minus the rocks&quot;. There are llamas in the area also. Enjoy. </groundspeak:long_description>

Bring along a picnic lunch for this one!  The older kids could definately appreciate the small hike and the nature here.

*** THE PICTURES I ATTACHED ARE OF THE GZ AND VIEW FROM IT TO HELP YOU FIND THIS ***

Park at gate (just after RR tracks on right) off from Lynch Road to walk down, parking Co-ordinates are also posted. The gate is a farm style gate with big cement barrier blocks in front of it. 

 CONGRATULATIONS TO:Pat&amp;JulieTravel For FTF!
This cache is a bit of a hike in to. It is right near the bay grass flats at an area we like. My 6 year old daughter has no issue getting into this cache but I wouldnt recommend for real little tikes. This area does get a fair amount of visitors so i had to hide the cache a bit making this a fairly lengthy find. 

GPS will be a bit bouncy in the woods all the way down, but as long as you follow the path down to the clearing of sorts it should then get you close enough. Watch for the stinging nettle in the lower portions of the old road hike, its there, but not in your way.

Towards the end of the trail i set out sticks on each side to help guide you in. Just follow the creek towards the bay and the sticks will start from the main path following the edge of the creek.


Also thought I might add some about the old hatchery. It was run by the Squaxin tribe and closed down maybe ten years ago. The state then purchased the property and took out the road and the Hatchery. A sign of possible park plans for the future? Who knows... Its a nice &quot;hike&quot; non the less.

DVD MOVIE EXCHANGE. 

Please if you take a movie, replace it with one you don't want anymore. Feel free to come back as often as you wish, but only log a find the first time.

This is filled with DVD movies that we decided we have seen enough of. Instead of sending them to goowill I thought other cachers might enjoy a free &quot;redbox&quot; of sorts.

The container is a large tote that is a smokey green color. </groundspeak:long_description>

 This may be a little hard to reach for the vertically challenged among us. Please use care as to not destroy the thing holding the cache up. The higher placement is the only reason I'm rating the difficulty at a 2. This is small for a small rated container, but should be able to fit a coin or two, or possibly a couple very small trade items.

Someone had been using him for target practice. As we were looking for a cache hiding spot at the time, we decided that he had to have something to do with the cache. 

 UPDATE: I changed out the container. It is now the size a small should be. Also put some trade items into it.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is large for a small size cache. The previous cache is M.I.A. So I contacted the cache owner and she gave me permission to put my own cache here. Nice hike, and a really neat creek. My daughter has made it a few times now and here daisy girl scout troop all made it through from lynch road to arcadia with no problems. We have gotten a pretty good trail in place now with some more new caches to post soon.

Taken from the first cache listing:

This cache is located down a logging road, and then down dirt bike trails. It is a great place to walk a dog, or do some mountain biking. I enjoy finding these little hidden gems in the midst of the clearcuts. My best guess from looking at maps is that the cache is located by Mill Creek - but if someone else has been maps, please let me know. ***You have to cross the creek to get to the cache - when the creek is running high, wading will be required.*** Parking coordinates when the gate is locked: N 47 10.312; W 122 59.500

We now know this is not mill creek. It is a creek that is unnamed from what we can tell. It serves as outflow from a large swamp area and joins with mill creek down stream a short distance away.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the entrance to the old Simpson Dam. Just a little cache to
get you going. As my oldest was finding a home for this cache. My
youngest was in a duel with a DQ Dilly bar as it was melting off
the stick. We will just call the duel a tie. You can walk up the
road from the gate or if you walk past the gas main and down
through the field you will find a trail to your left near the
creek. Enjoy your stay, please practice Cache in Trash out and
Don't Block The Gate.

Goldsborough Creek drains 80 square miles of forestland on the
Olympic Peninsula. The creek had been dammed since 1885 when a
railroad company built a log storage pond on the site. In 1921, the
dam was used to generate power for the growing community of
Shelton. After a flood wiped out the dam, it was rebuilt in 1932 to
provide power and to divert water for a forest products operation.
Simpson Timber Company acquired the dam in the 1950s, but ceased
drawing power from it in 1986. When it was rebuilt in 1932, the dam
was 100 feet long and just 14 feet high. But with water flowing
over it at an average rate of 400 cubic feet per second, the
streambed below the dam was soon scoured out, adding another 20
feet to the dam’s height and rendering the dam’s fish
ladder impassable. The dam became utterly useless to Simpson in
1996 when flooding destroyed the water diversion pipeline.
 Simpson Timber Company, The Squaxin Island Tribe
and the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife teamed up
to Remove the dam. Work began early in the summer of 2001, when
stream flows were low. First the stream was diverted into 2000 feet
of four-foot diameter pipe. Removing the old wooden dam was
relatively easy; the more difficult work lay in creating a gently
sloped streambed to replace the 35-foot drop the dam had created.
The sediment that had collected behind the dam was used to build up
the downstream stretch. Thirty-one concrete weirs were installed
across the streambed, creating a series of low steps that
stabilized the rebuilt slope. Then, numerous boulders and large
tree stumps were scattered between the concrete weirs to improve
fish habitat. Water was returned to the restored streambed in
November of 2001 and chum salmon were spotted above the old dam
site that fall. The next year, the Squaxin Island Tribe counted
more than 15,000 chum migrating down through the newly restored
habitat. There is a lot of potential for coho production in the
creek, which is the species the partnership is hoping to
significantly improve.</groundspeak:long_description>

cache owner will hold the Geocaching BINGO game using this cache. Participating is completely optional and this cache can be logged as found by doing nothing more than signing the log.

1.When you find the cache, take back home one BINGO card.
2.The cache owner will report the actual ball No. on the log.
4.Enjoy BINGO game using the ball No.
5.If you get BINGO, please declare on the &quot;write note&quot; log
6.The BINGO winners can choose prize (the earlier logger has priority); the owner will send email with coords of small gift container When the prize ends the BINGO game ends.
7.If a visitor doesn't join the game (i.e. does not take a card), the owner will still choose one ball.
Please note:
•Please declare BINGO Whena new ball No. appears, the cache owner won't check each card's numbers, but only verifies the declared BINGO is proper or not.
•Donation of gifts are welcome.
•For earlier visitors, it's convenient to add this cache on &quot;watch list&quot; or notified &quot;bookmark&quot; to get the information of other visitors.
•For the latter visitors, you can roll-back the log and get the already &quot;hit&quot; ball No.
Enjoy the game.</groundspeak:long_description>

Its only bad terrain for several feet, and it may be easier to come in from the &quot;back&quot; but i still figure it deserves a 3.5 terrain rating. 

 A few TBs / Coins to get her started! This side road was an excellent fast sled run for us today. Someone had already built the run and it had a jump at the end. GPS was a bit sketchy, but after a few tries we were happy enough. If you get different Coords, let us know. Also thought I would add that this will be a pretty good hike during the snowy season if you don't have some decent ground clearance and good tires. GOOD LUCK AND HAVE A TON O' FUN!</groundspeak:long_description>

So out we get and start hunting. The last 10 meters were a a bit steep but I found it. Its about time for a new container, the contents are just a bit damp.
Left a Teddy Bear Key Chain and took a compass key chain.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;A straight compass line may be the shortest and quickest way
for a seagull (Larus glaucescens) to get from A to B; this is not

-0.5: tie your boots around your neck and wear shorts.&lt;br/&gt;
+0.0: tie your boots around your neck and wear australian stubbies,

We know that we'd have a different reading every day, it's all part of the game with this really cool location. 

We have relocated this cache to an area where you can be partly hidden by vegetation and structures ;-). Please do a 180 degree turn to check for muggles before you even consider retrieving this one. At the height of tourist season you may need to come back later to avoid ruining this hide.

This cache is a small lock n' lock.The accuracy in this area is about 11m or worse, so we will tell you that you should be on the ground floor by a window on the south side of the famous Square. The security guard is aware of it's hiding spot as you'll read in some of logs. Ask the Security Guard for a hint as a last resort please so we don't wear him out! 

YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE TROUBLE RETRIEVING IT AND RE-HIDING IT THAN FINDING IT. DON'T RUIN IT FOR FUTURE FINDERS! IT'S JUST A SMILEY SO BE PATIENT!

I wondered why the one a Bastion Square was at the top of the list, and this one was nowhere to be found. Must have recorded it in the notebook, but not on the GPS. Plugged in the coördinates, finished lunch, and away we went. About 10 minutes later, after a couple of in-and-out trips to get the GPS settled, the cache was in hand. Lots of tempting swag, but we hadn't carried any trade items with us this morning, so Xn.
Not many muggles around this morning, so there wasn't a great delay retrieving or resetting the cache.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It is located in the middle of Portage Park in Victoria BC. &lt;br/&gt;
 If you park at the View Royal Municipal Hall you will see the
Portage Park sign welcoming you. Follow the trail system until you
are on the east side of the park on a trail paralleling the railway
tracks. You'll see 2 fir trees which have been topped at
approximately the same height on your right and a small trail
meanders between them. The cache is about 20 paces due west of
these two trees, and about 10 feet from a small creek which runs
north/south. It is at the base of a huge pair of poplar trees in a
small hole and covered in forest debris. If you're at the tree with
the sticks and bark piled at the base then you need to check the
other large trees 6m south instead. Best of Luck! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Oldest Cache on Vancouver Island is GC84D - hid on April 30,
2001. The second oldest cache is GC95B - hid on May 14, 2001 and
then this cache follows closely - hid on May 21, 2001.

Edit: Suspicion confirmed.  ;-) Looked elsewhere and found 334 previous &quot;Found It&quot; logs.

Nice hide and in good condition after the wet season we've been through. TNLN SL Thanks for the hide (and the hunt)!Thurgood</groundspeak:text>

This cache was hid to share the bounty of Beaver Dude's Loot bag from GeoWoodstock VI. He brought home so much 'great stuff' and didn't know what to do with it! Rather than it cluttering up the dam, he decided to cache it in the woods for you to enjoy. This cache contains some pretty cool stuff - Wingsaber, Huntcliff, Cyberchasers, Gemma, sdkonkle and other junior cachers take note! 

Parents and other clever and wise cachers - here is your mission: At these coordinates you will find a four digit number following a 'W'. Subtract 1846 from the number you find and call this answer metres. This is the distance to the cache. Add 87 to the distance and this is the bearing. Now Go Get It! 

We'd appreciate a note if the area is getting 'torn up' and we will place some flagging discretly nearby.

Random thought - You might want to leave your favourite new socks at home because you'll be picking out spear grass for an eternity! Tieka the Canine Landshark sat still for ages while we picked it all out of her coat - yes, this is an off-leash area.

Totem &lt;strong&gt;T6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Identify the two photos of this totem pole&lt;br/&gt;
Record the totem’s location&lt;br/&gt;
Record the &lt;strong&gt;smaller&lt;/strong&gt; number as radius A&lt;br/&gt;
Record the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;larger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; number as
radius B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw two circles centered at T5, one with radius A, the other
with radius B (don't you love circles... they're so round)&lt;br/&gt;
 Draw two circles centered at T6, one with radius A, the other with
radius B&lt;br/&gt;
 The two “A” circles intersect at two points, call the most
&lt;strong&gt;southerly&lt;/strong&gt; of these &lt;strong&gt;start7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Note, the circles may just kiss each other (or even not quite meet)
if this happens, use the point in the middle of where they are at
their closest.&lt;br/&gt;
 The two “B” circles intersect at two points, call the most
&lt;strong&gt;western&lt;/strong&gt; of these &lt;strong&gt;start8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go to the location “start7”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Within &lt;strong&gt;150m&lt;/strong&gt; you will find a totem pole. Call this
Totem &lt;strong&gt;T7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Identify the two photos of this totem pole&lt;br/&gt;
Record the totem’s location&lt;br/&gt;
Record the &lt;strong&gt;smaller&lt;/strong&gt; number as radius A&lt;br/&gt;
Record the &lt;strong&gt;larger&lt;/strong&gt; number as radius B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go to the location “start8”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 Within &lt;strong&gt;250m&lt;/strong&gt; you will find a totem pole. Call this
Totem &lt;strong&gt;T8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 Identify the two photos of this totem pole&lt;br/&gt;
 Record the totem’s location&lt;br/&gt;
 Record the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;larger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; number as
radius A&lt;br/&gt;
Record the &lt;strong&gt;smaller&lt;/strong&gt; number as radius B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find the final cache you will need to draw some squares...
just kidding... circles!&lt;br/&gt;
 The first is centered on T8 and has the radius A for T7&lt;br/&gt;
 The second is centered on T3 and has the radius A for T8&lt;br/&gt;
 The third is centered on T4 and has the radius B for T7&lt;br/&gt;
 The fourth is centered on T7 and has the radius B for T8&lt;br/&gt;
 The cache can be found at the intersect of these circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the potential for inaccuracies of a few metres while
marking the totems, Tieka would suggest drawing all 4 circles and
using the best intercept to find the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you should have two unused totem pole pictures.
These are of the same totem... call this totem pole T9. The numbers
are not used in this puzzle, they are there to dissuade educated
guessing towards the end. The first person to find this totem and
e-mail Landsharkz with its location will receive a bottle of a fine
beverage and a banner on this cache page.&lt;/p&gt;

its not a pin (with the exception of small TBs). Spend a little
time on the trails here, this area is a bird watchers paradise. The
whole area is environmentally sensitive... please stay on the paths
at all times. There is a really nice pin from Singapore for the FTF

not a big park. By the way, the name of the cache is an anagram for

I couldn't&lt;br/&gt;get readings better than 6 meters, so you may need to use the hints&lt;br/&gt;to help zero in on the right spots. Please take care to re-hide&lt;br/&gt;each stage for the next seeker. Please don't reveal any secrets in&lt;br/&gt;your logs, even if encrypted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The cache container is a medium sized camouflaged lock and lock&lt;br/&gt;container. Along with the logbook and pen, there are various trade&lt;br/&gt;items and a first finder’s prize. Thank you for hunting our latest!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a great dog walking cache! Cache is 1/3 of the way up the
hill (less than 10 mins each way), but be sure to go to the top.
Bring some binoculars for the great view and a camera to record
your journey.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The original hider used an older GPS 2000XL and said &quot;the signal
reception in the area could be better&quot; :-).&lt;br/&gt;
 Today (March 5, 2006) we had 4.5m accuracy by the cache as
satellites were cooperating. The actual cache hidden at base of
semi-thick bush covered in forest debris. &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Have Fun!&lt;/b&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">To give credit where credit is due, we got this idea from an event&lt;br/&gt;coin we designed for a client in New Jersey who we believe got the&lt;br/&gt;idea from yet another cache. This is so unoriginal, but devilishly&lt;br/&gt;fun! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About this cache&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is actually an 18 part multi cache. You'll start at the&lt;br/&gt;given coords, which will take you half way up a giant cliff face.&lt;br/&gt;This position is actually on private property, and you may wish to&lt;br/&gt;wear cammo attire and bring a shot-gun to fend off the pack of wild&lt;br/&gt;rabid guard dogs that protect the entrance. Whitebear found the&lt;br/&gt;dogs to be pretty tame, after fighting off the 'gators while&lt;br/&gt;fording the moat. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next few stages will have you wandering through the Kludahk&lt;br/&gt;area which, as we found when we hid the cache, is still inhabited&lt;br/&gt;by prehistoric beasts. Bear bells will do you no good here. Rifle&lt;br/&gt;blasts will send them into a fit of rage, so you're best defence is&lt;br/&gt;swords and pointed sticks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage 9 is so well hidden, it may take you days to find it. The&lt;br/&gt;safest spot to camp is at the entrance to the cougar den... The&lt;br/&gt;bones you'll see there are from past cachers that lost their minds&lt;br/&gt;during bouts of insanity brought on by the incessant howling of the&lt;br/&gt;starving hyenas. Ickster once went comatose here after a cloud of&lt;br/&gt;sulphurous gas sucked the oxygen from his lungs and left him for&lt;br/&gt;dead... he was prompted back to life as the vultures were gnawing&lt;br/&gt;at his eyes! He's ok now, but suffered an amnesiac bout and doesn't&lt;br/&gt;remember any of it... lucky for him :) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage 10 is one of Spud's nano's hidden 863 meters into a cave...&lt;br/&gt;bring spelunking gear, and watch out for the underwater river that&lt;br/&gt;winds between the lairs of sleeping grizzlies. You may want to read&lt;br/&gt;old Aquaman comics to learn about the super powers you will need in&lt;br/&gt;order to find this stage. X-ray vision would be an asset here too.&lt;br/&gt;You won't need to bring a flashlight as the lava flows will&lt;br/&gt;illuminate your way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The final stages are not as bad as the first few. If you've made&lt;br/&gt;it this far, the swarms of killer bees and malaria ridden 'skitters&lt;br/&gt;will seem like a piece of cake. There is a small band of people&lt;br/&gt;living near stage 13. They have been in this area since 1944 and&lt;br/&gt;think that the war is still on. They are very skittish, and have a&lt;br/&gt;tendency to shoot first and ask questions later. When you find the&lt;br/&gt;cache, you will see that it is locked with a puzzle so complex that&lt;br/&gt;it would take an Unseen Baloney Riot a week to solve. You really&lt;br/&gt;don't have a hope... but if you do manage to break into the giant's&lt;br/&gt;lair, walk the tightrope over the cavern, and scale the outer slope&lt;br/&gt;of the Partridge Glacier, then you will find a broken cache&lt;br/&gt;container that has a bunch of useless trinkets, a wet log book, and&lt;br/&gt;no writing implement. Careful, it has sharp edges... watch-out for&lt;br/&gt;the leg-hold traps hidden under the nearby leaf-litter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Names of cachers used with permission.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache commemorates the event cache &quot;Lunch at the Spit&quot; which
was supposed to be a Saturday cacher's Lunch at Sidney Spit.
Unfortunately, the dock had been pulled up for the winter, so not
having a dingy with us (we expected to tie up at the dock) we were
unable to go ashore to have lunch at the spit. 
&lt;p&gt;We (Landsharkz, Min3D, D-Tour and NightFox) decided to go over
to Fulford Harbour for lunch instead. So, as with our event... this
cache starts at Sidney Spit, and takes you to Saltspring
Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike us, you don't need to go to the Spit to do the
projection, but if you want to, its a great spot to spend a sunny
afternoon (bring a dingy if its not summer)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posted coordinates will take you to a lighthouse on Sidney
Spit. From there, go 8.23437 nautical miles at a bearing of 328.947
degrees around the round world that we live on. Here you will find
the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to check your coords before you go, feel free to
e-mail us for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;





Congratulations... Geoscavenger was

who has a lead role (Mrs Squirrel) in Goldilocks and The Christmas
Bears. This cache was hidden on Opening Day within a short drive of
Charlie White Theatre in Sidney.
&lt;p&gt;The story line includes a few of the other forest creatures
stealing Mrs Squirrel's winter cache of acorns. During the story,
Mrs Squirrel (who once was a City Squirrel) makes acorn fudge from
her nut cache to share. Goldilocks comes back to visit the 3 Bears
to make amends for breaking Baby Bear's chair, eating their oatmeal
and sleeping in their beds the last time she visited. The forest
creatures include a foxy fox, a Wolf, a Blue Jay and the
aforementioned Mrs. Squirrel. It's a really nice 1 hour family play
that works well on the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a camo'd lock n' lock within 1 step of the
trail.&lt;/p&gt;

A beautiful small park known as Boat Nook is a perfect place to sit back, put your feet up for a while and watch the water, the seals on the nearby rocks and the odd Orca passing thru.

The cache is a 1L Nalgene type water bottle, so be aware of the opening size when bringing items to trade.

&lt;h1&gt;Bluesky - Burgoyne Bay&lt;/h1&gt;
        
 


&lt;p&gt;This cache promotes active living and environmentally friendly
geocaching. Come on out to Burgoyne Bay Provincial Park, get some
exercise and enjoy some fresh air. There are two really fun ways to
get to Burgoyne Bay that are super-environmentally friendly. The
first is to leave the car at the Swartz Bay ferry terminal and take
your bike. This will save you money (ferry fare for a car is not
cheap) and you will love the 5km bike ride on quite flat country
roads, with very little elevation gain. The secone way is to take a
sailboat. There is good anchorage in the bay and also a government
wharf. Not everyone has access to a sailboat, but if you do, make a
day of it and go sailing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please share your story about your visit to Burgoyne Bay
Provincial Park and about how you got there in your cache log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden in a BC Park. BC Parks supports geocaching!

Here is a link to the BC Parks geocaching policies, please
familiarize yourself with them. Through cooperation with BC Parks,
we can keep geocaching a fun and supported activity in BC's
Provincial
Parks.          &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these caches, you'll find some ProjectBlueSky geocoins for
the first finders. PLEASE TAKE ONLY ONE... if you have one from
another cache, please leave them for other people. There are also
some pins and other swag from BC Parks, BCGA and Project Blue
Sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British Columbia
Geocaching Association Supports Active Living and
Environmentally Friendly Geocaching...&lt;/p&gt;

Dropped a TB (&quot;Cole the Bear&quot;)
Cole has been on the road for quite a while—he's wearing one of the old style TB tags with the round ends and numbers (with no letters) stamped into the metal. Please take good care of him if you pick him up to continue his journey.

Fergie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and, together, we are the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regal Beagle Babes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. We
come to this off-leash trail several times every week to walk our
human assistants. There are often a lot of other dogs on the trail
and we like to greet them with our &quot;Beagle-bay&quot; and a little circle
dance before the standard canine meet &amp; greet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are
a few side trails along this section of the Shell Road trail and
that's where you'll find this cache. It is an 800ml Lock &amp; Lock
with a funny paint job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best place to park is at the
south foot of Shell Road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our favorite beach. We
     come here a lot to swim, play stick, swim, chase the waves,
     swim, dig holes and, if we're really lucky, roll around in a
     nice juicy dead fish before we go for a swim. We like this
     place 'cause there's usually nobody around and we can have the
     beach all to ourselves. The people that hang out with us like
     to watch the resident hawks and other birds, pick blackberries
     and throw sticks into the water for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beach is nicely hidden away
     on the banks of the mighty Fraser River. There is a very
     short, very narrow and very steep path leading down to the
     beach from the dyke. The tide can come up quite far here, but
     you can usually scramble over a few logs and get to a dry bit
     of sand. We like it best at low tide. You will too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best
place to park your car is at N49°09.268' W123°00.770'. The cache is
a 1.5L Lock &amp; lock container. Please rehide it exactly as you
found it - don't underestimate how high the tide can rise here.

&lt;p&gt;This is Bob and Bogey's most excellent
final resting place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they
weren't romping on the beach at Bob &amp; Bogey's Excellent Beach or at
Bob &amp; Bogey's Other Excellent Beach, this
was their favorite forest walk. Over the years they were coming
here, they spent many joyous hours crashing through the bushes
chasing squirrels or coyotes or just galloping along the
trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the
lads have now passed on to the Happy Hunting Ground. Bogey, a 120
lb. lab/newfoundlander cross, passed over during the summer of
2008. Bob, a 90 lb. shepherd/heeler cross, passed just a few days
after Christmas 2009. Both were unique individuals who made a
big impression on everyone they met. They were very special to us
and will be missed immensely. Their ashes are spread along the
trails of this park, the bulk of them in the immediate vicinity of
the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is
located in a little known, little used gem of a park. The entrance
is off Jacombs Rd, just north of Westminster Hwy and can be easy to
miss. The cache itself is a 3L round, unpainted plastic container
hidden in a small clearing just off the main trail. It is well
camoflaged. Please rehide it exactly as you found it. There is a
pair of binoculars in the cache for the First-To-Find - no trade
required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We all have
them.&lt;br/&gt;
 Lurking in our CD collections.&lt;br/&gt;
 We don't always know how some of them got there.&lt;br/&gt;
 But there they are.&lt;br/&gt;
 Sometimes they're annoying.&lt;br/&gt;
 Sometimes they can even be embarrassing.&lt;br/&gt;
 You know the ones I mean.&lt;br/&gt;
 But there they sit.&lt;br/&gt;
Taking up space.&lt;br/&gt;
Never to be played again.&lt;br/&gt;
But what do you do with them?&lt;br/&gt;
Make them into coasters?&lt;br/&gt;
Some sort of misguided art project?&lt;br/&gt;
We have the solution...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is
a camo-painted ammo can stocked with bad CD's donated by friends
and family. Some of them are really bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final
coordinates will take you to an obvious clue. From that clue, the
cache is located in the bushes a couple of meters to the NNW.
Please be sure the cache is not visible from either direction on
the trail when you re-hide the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can
approach the cache from either direction on the trail. The short
way is usually wet, mucky and a bit overgrown. The longer way is
much drier and less overgrown. You decide.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Music
CD's only.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trade
even and take only as many CD's as you leave.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't
leave homemade or copied CD's.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't
leave any trade items other than bad CD's. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt; Please note that we
cannot be held responsible if your significant other actually likes
one of the CD's.

  &lt;p&gt;The cache was originally planned as a 'memorial cache' to celebrate the completion 
    a GeoTeaming corporate team building event. During the course of the event, 
    one of our team members received a phone call informing him that his youngest 
    brother had suddenly passed away and that his presence, on the other side 
    of the country, was required immediately. During the event debriefing, the 
    team decided that the memorial cache should instead be placed in memory of 
    our friend's brother. Therefore, this cache is dedicated to our friend Michael, 
    and his brother Murray.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The cache is a 1 liter Lock &amp; Lock container. The original contents consist 
    of a single personal item from each of the team members. The cache is located 
    in the Burnaby Foreshore Park less than a meter from the trail.&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;

     favorite beaches. Of course we like to come here to swim, play
     stick, chase the waves, and dig holes but we especially like
     to come here because there are so many other dogs here for us
     to meet and play with. There are also a whole bunch of trails
     in the woods next to the beach for us to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; There is a large parking lot
     with a boat launch ramp that can be pretty busy on sunny
     weekends. Once you leave the parking lot a long, sandy beach
     opens up before you. Be sure to bring your dogs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is
a 700 ml camo Lock &amp; lock container and his hidden well off the
beach. There is a special prize for the First-To-Find.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Hello Opencachers,

Well, I'm still stuck in the Arctic waiting for the Russians, and still no closer to finding out more about my uncle (for background on my story, see my first cache called &quot;Coins and bills...&quot; by clicking my name).  

The good news is, my friend has sent me a description of another cache that he deciphered from my uncle's logs, I hope you can help me by finding it.  It's supposed to be a tennis ball can that contains a clue to my uncle's zodiac sign, I'd like to know what it is.  It also contains an item he played with in university a lot, and an unopened toy.  First to find gets to keep any one of the three items, subsequent finds can trade for one or both of the other two.

This is a three-stage cache in the Wreck beach area of Vancouver.  Wreck beach is probably the city's prettiest beach, but it's also a clothing-optional beach that's closed from sunset to 8AM, and closed to dogs from March 1st to September 30.  Unless you're willing to look for this cache in the buff, I suggest you go on a cold and/or very rainy day.

FIRST STAGE:
Christina Joy Thompson died much too young,
Two decades with us and now she's gone.
Subtract 1878 from the year of her birth to get W,
Subtract 1960 from the year of her death to get X.
Find the second stage at:
49W 15'53.W&quot;
123N 15'51.X&quot;
(DD MM' SS.ss&quot; notation)

SECOND STAGE:
From this spot look South by South-West
And put your eyes to the test.
Count the white buoys in a row
Then to the cache you'll know how to go.
If you know that your eyes are weak
Bring some binoculars to have a peek.
Y is the number of buoys times three
And Z is the number of buoys plus 61.
Find the cache at:
49W 15'47.Y&quot;
123N 15'33.Z&quot;
(DD MM' SS.ss&quot; notation)

Good luck! And let me know what zodiac sign my uncle was born under, it will be a valuable clue to help me solve his disappearance.  And by the way, beaches are always more interesting at low tide: http://www.dairiki.org/tides/daily.php/van

Thanks,

WokeUpDead  </groundspeak:long_description>

Things are not always what they appear to be.

This is a LOG ONLY cache. Please do not leave any trade items. Initial your name and that's it. One square per log. No stickers. Bring your own pen.

There is absolutely no need for any disruption of the native environment on this or any cache hunt. There is no bushwacking, trampling of the undergrowth, disturbing the vegetation, overturning of rocks, etc. required. The cache is out in the open, but well camouflaged. NOTHING has to be moved to find this cache, except the cache itself.</groundspeak:long_description>

Grouse Mountain is one of the first tourist locations we visited when we moved from Ontario last year - and have taken every guest that visits us since then.

This time, when we went to hide our geocache, we took the &quot;Grouse Grind&quot;.  Although we didn't set any records (it took us 2 hours and 31 minutes)it was quite a satisfying accomplishment for a couple of old, out-of-shape folks.  I am surprised at how many people who have lived here years and years have never done it so I challenge all of you to try instead of taking the gondola to the top.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Elevation 3844 ft - no need to do the &quot;Grind&quot; - you can ride to the top and then take the ski lift to the wind turbine.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

It is hidden in a small community park, across from the Municipal Hall and Library and down the street from a great little cafe in Squamish.

With plenty of green grass and shade trees, it is a wonderful place to bring children, pack a picnic too!  The park is aimed towards younger children, but the grassy area is great for older kids to run, play soccer, or just relax!</groundspeak:long_description>

Hard a hard time with the GPS on this one!!  If my co-ords are too far off please let me know!

I have hidden a few caches around Squamish and Hope and most of them are geared towards geokids.  I place them fairly strategically so they are easy to access, not too far of a walk and filled with items that mostly kids would enjoy finding!  This cache is to replace one I had in Brackendale called &quot;Changing Seasons&quot; which I've disabled.  The area is set to be clearcut to allow for a new housing development :(

There is a Loonie for the FTF

Cache contains:
Fishing tool
Thank You cards
Bubble Wands
Iron-On Patches (Feel free to take more than one!)
Geocaching Buttons
Beads (Fit Chamalia bracelets)
Walrus Geocoin (Wants to travel to Ontario!)
Mary Kay Peach Scented Hand Lotion
Deep Woods Bug Repellent
And whatever additional items I can find before I leave the house ;)

We used to walk this trail with our girls when they were just wee and our faithful chocolate lab Murphy before he passed on.  Thought we'd head down here to reminisce and stretch our legs a little.  Watch out for the prickles!

Small cache container with a few small items, pencil and log sheet.  Started with Starbucks gift card for the FTF, flashlight, Harry Potter 'Story Scope' and Christmas decoration

Beware!  The muggles come from all sides!

Congrats to ashgray for the FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

Park on Parkway Road and take a stroll!  This trail is the beginning what could be a very long hike, or just a nice little walk depending on how far you want to go!

A small tupperware container is waiting for you with a few little goodies in it.  Take some time to relax and explore!  High muggle area, please replace carefully!

Arrowhead park was installed in the spring and its on a quiet cul de sac in the middle of the Bracken Heights Co-op.  There are a couple of picnic tables and a lot of shade trees, so come on out and let the kids play while you seek!

Bring a pencil!!  Contains nothing but a log.
