The waves were crashing way up the beach and the sound was indescribable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While spending my weekend here I took a short stroll along the coast starting at Wright's beach and ending at goat rock. This is the Kutrom trail. Several locations along this trail are made up of long wooden walkways that allow access across wetlands. This was my first trip out this trail and it was lined by wild Iris, daffodils and calla lilies. A great place for a cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't stop at the cache because this the hike is not over, just around the corner is the best part. Don't forget to bring a pen the container is too small for one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ftf Koupin for the first to find goes to TheAngle3. Congratulations.</groundspeak:long_description>

I sat here for hours watching the waves crash along the beach and decided I would bring other cacher's here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The climb up could be difficult for some but i climbed it&lt;br/&gt;barefoot.&lt;br/&gt;The top of the Yardang is flat and has room for 2 or 3 people&lt;br/&gt;but stay away from the edges the are eroding away and you could slip off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I will make this easy for all so you dont have to do the&lt;br/&gt;cacheing wonder. Sit in the middle of the rock and look around. the camo is common to this area and is the only one on this mound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Container is too small for a pen so don't forget to bring your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK2Q9FE - GC2Q9FE Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 38° 24.592 W 123° 05.920&lt;br/&gt;Parking for Tail</groundspeak:long_description>

BYOP and I would park on Old River Road.  Please do not pull into the City of Ten Thousand Budda.  It could draw unwanted attention.</groundspeak:long_description>

Luckly Mr. Orville was at work and he rescued it.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now after a couple of months thought it is being replaced as a micro.  Log only.  This one is tougher then I thought.

Turkey hunting will be taking place then.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the eastern side of the lake. Access requires a good hike
from the dam or a boat ride with a shorter hike.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache was placed by my son and I on a scouting trip for the
opening of turkey season. I enjoy hiking in this area at this time
of year. It provides an opportunity to see wildflowers, butterflys,
wildlife (deer, turkey, quail, blue birds, red-tailed hawks were
seen on this day). The area has a number of trails the traverse
meadows and ridges. These offer outstanding views such as the
picture taken near the cache site. The cache was named becaues it
is made up of trinkets found in other caches. The cache is in a 2
qt. plastic storage container, spray painted in a camo color. The
contents when placed include: a log book a pen a pencil a redwood
tree magened a Yaquina Head Lighthouse pin an Olympic souvenir
spoon a die a tape &quot;Analogue Dreaming&quot; a tape &quot; John Madden
Football&quot; a pair of scissors Finally, as with most all caches in
these hills, keep an eye out for the usual, poison oak, rattle
snakes, and even mountain lions.</groundspeak:long_description>

We went from Timber to this one.  And we didn't take a trail.  We made our own.  Straight up the side of a hill!  OK, well I didn't hike up it.  I fell and the leaves were so thick and mud so yucky I crawled on my hands and knees, but what the heck it worked.

I have been wanting to get this one for so long.  But, I can only hike in the weeds from Nov to Feb (due to things that slither) so I have been waiting.  And, now that this side of the lake is being populated with other caches it was worth the trip.  This cache is in good condition and stuff full of SWAG.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I took two troops on a hike at Lake Mendocino today.  It was a two part adventure.  One was a younger troop needed to go on a hike with an older troop to complete bridging requirements to move to the next level. The 2nd part of this adventure was to begin a new badge called Hi-Tech Hide and Seek.  Can you imagine what that was all about?  LOL!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyhow, we went in search of  The Vintage DiVine (GC14GN3) by my friend 007BigD.  After much searching we located it.  On the way back to the parking lot we had to hide a cache of our own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The girls were very hot and tired but I kept reminding them to look for a location.  One of them finally stopped and said how about here.  My daughter (a seasoned cacher) determined that it would be a good location and went into the bush with the container and GPSr in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a coffee can cache I won at an event.  So it is full of SWAG, log book and pen.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coordinates may be slight jumpy due to tree coverage.  Shouldn't be to hard to locate once you get in there.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">While on a trip to Lakeport, I decided that Hwy 20 needed more caches.  As with all my caches, there is a wide dirt shoulder for parking.  This is easily accessed while traveling E/B.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache can be grabbed from the side. You will need to be a little agile so wear your tennis shoes.&lt;br/&gt;No need to travel downward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is micro container with log only. BYOP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please cover this back up to prevent from being spotted by muggles.  They shouldn't be much of a problem as they drive by at 55 mph.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only other muggle might be the local CHP but they are aware of the game.</groundspeak:long_description>

But you wont be speeding, you will be slowing down to grab this cache!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is better grabbed when heading North on 101.  I would not advise catching when heading South, this requires crossing over two lanes ofn on coming traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring a pen. This is a fairly straight forward cache so I will not provide a hint and this point and time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Return the cache from where you found it, cover it up, blah, blah, blah.

At least that's the first thing that came to mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We had been planing to come out here all summer and finally got around to it. There is a TON of history around Josephine County, just waiting for people to find it. I've lived here for over 35 years and had never been out here.&lt;br/&gt;Up this access road is the Waldo Cemetery. DO NOT miss going up there. It is well worth it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We could not find the Chinese cemetery as the sun was going down so we'll save that one for another time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eventually we will find the actual town of Waldo (we have a pretty good idea where it is) and we will put a cache there as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're looking for a camo'd koolaid container.&lt;br/&gt;There are rose bushes, apple trees, and pear trees near the cache location which leads me to believe that there was probably a homestead around here at one time.&lt;br/&gt;At least 100 years ago.&lt;br/&gt;Just think.&lt;br/&gt;These trees and roses have been here for over 100 years...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We forgot our foriegn coins at home so for right now there is just a log. BYOWI. We will get back soon to drop off some more goodies.</groundspeak:long_description>

This one is Squaw Peak.  I know this isn't in a city, however, I needed a 5 for terrain level, and we were hunting up here, so thar ya be! Try if you dare, but many of you will fail.....or will you? Remeber to replace the cache exactly as you found it, if you actually find it...he he he!&lt;br/&gt;BYOP. Stay on the road.  You will have to hike up about 1200-1300 feet to grab this one.  You can also grab &quot;Left 350&quot; before and &quot;Watchtower&quot; after.  This is right in the middle on the way up to a great view.</groundspeak:long_description>

As we have a habit, includes a bit of trivia in the long description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Near an item that is harder to find than you think.  (the item is hard to find, not the cache)  These used to be all over the place, but modern electronics have made them nearly obsolete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;F.T.F trivia:  The blockbuster movie E.T. made in 1982, used Reese's Pieces to lure the extra terrestrial. But the staring roll (of the candy) was first offered to Mars for M&amp;M's.  For what ever reason, they declined, but were soon to be kicking themselves when sales of Reese's Pieces soared with the movie release.  Sure put a smile on Hershey's face!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You will probably want a 4WD for this one. There are a lot of holes in the gravel road leading to the cache. I did make it in my Matrix but would not recommend it! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the first of a new Gnome series... It is extremely encouraged that field notes are taken as well as a photo of the cache and surroundings. These items will come in handy for a cache in the future! &lt;br/&gt;Recommendations:&lt;br/&gt;1. Hiking boots- terrain is very steep and there are lots of sharp pokeys around.&lt;br/&gt;2. Long pants/ long sleeved shirt- please refer to #1. You will get dirty on this one...&lt;br/&gt;3. Leave coordinates with a family member- as cache is out in the middle of nowhere, search and rescue would appreciate the assistance...&lt;br/&gt;4. Flashlight- don't even bother attempting this one without at least one flashlight... It is in the dark!&lt;br/&gt;5. Camera- you will kick yourself if you forget it... This is definately photo worthy...&lt;br/&gt;6. Teams of two or more- being out in the middle of nowhere and in case someone gets stuck a buddy is highly recommended!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many little holes in the rocks in the area. Some are deeper than others and some blend in with their surroundings better than others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache contains a brand new TB (The Centurion) that I picked up in Israel back in '97. The cache has a bunch of cool swag including a flashlight and some jewelry! A treasure chest with goodies inside!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">A couple of weeks ago Zop and I saw a post on Facebook about squeezing through a rabbit hole to find a cache.  It was a link to a Latitude 47 article. We agreed to go get it someday on the reply posts on Facebook. Well today was the day. Zop and I were planning on visiting the Pacific North West for the July 4th weekend and our 2 year cachaversary and he suggested this cache as my milestone cache. I thought it was the perfect idea. 

I must say I recommend if you find this cache PLAN YOUR ROUTE and do your homework. It took us over 2 hours to find the access point! What an adventure it was just trying to get there. I even tried to email the cache owner for help! I never got a reply and I am glad of it! It was worth the feeling of success we we finally got the drop off point.

Once we were at the access point I was ready to goGoGO! I LOVE underground caches. I learned this when Zop and I found Lair of Smaug in Davenport, CA. What a RUSH! I think it is the Hobbit in me that just has to get an underground cache. 
Find this cache, it will NOT disappoint. This is the best cave cache I have visited to date. I will not go into detail but Zop and I WILL post some pictures of our fun.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Ok.. When we read the Facebook link to Latitude 47’s article, I jokingly taunted Cheryl-MuggleN0More about maybe taking a ride to Oregon. That she would take me up on it with so much enthusiasm was well… Why I like her [:D]… Anyway, the discussion sort of ended there but we actually did decide to take a ride up to Oregon (from the Wine country of CA, or is that whine?) to see if we could make it to Portland in time to grab Dr. Who but we soon realized that we would never make it in time. Unless they are open tomorrow that is. With C-MNM’s big 4K milestone coming up VERY soon, I kind of mentioned this hide once again. That was it! That was the nail in the coffin. We had to immediately stop caching and only get two this morning on the way to Roseburg.  Only two caches from Ashland to Roseburg? I think we can… Well, We did it! We picked up two caches near the area just to the North of where we wanted to be and then tried SEVERAL roads that the GPS told us would take us to GZ only to be stopped at all by gates and ‘No Trespassing’ signs. Finally, we found ourselves not 1.2 miles from GZ where we asked a very nice lady if she knew how we could find our way UP there and I tell ya! We asked the right person! In no time, we were winding our way closer and closer! Then with our lucky Nuvi (remind me to shoot it when I get home) We turned up a very narrow trail that should take us right there. But Wait! Another gate and NO way to turn around. Did I say we were in a two-wheel drive? Fortunately, rolling back down backwards was actually a little easier than heading up. Then back on the main trail we just kept on going and going.. Let’s see. We started this about two hours earlier? Finally!!  We arrive at a spot that looked to be the closest possible spot and begin our hike. A few deer trails and lucky turns later and there it was.. The infamous ‘rabbit hole’… The rest? Well… Pictures to follow [:D]
What an awesome adventure from start to finish! We were certainly winded when we made it back to the cachemobile but it was so worth it.

Since I was at the VA Hospital and this cache was near by, I decided to go for it. This was my first official find and it took some serious hunting to find it.  It was very well hidden.  I lost my glasses looking among the boulders.  

This cache needs serious attention. Its old and and the container is starting to breakdown. ( what happens to that kind of plastic, its also a bit to small for the log book and pen.  I would give it a larger container. The baggie needs replacing with winter on its way. )  I left a four pack of new AA batteries for those in need. That should help two hunters, depending on how hungry your GPS is.

This was well hidden and took serious looking.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">American Buffalo is also a name for the American Bison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bison are six species of large even-toed ungulates within the subfamily Bovinae. Two of these species still exist: the American plains bison (Bison bison bison), and the American wood bison (Bison bison athabascae) are subspecies found in North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The American bison and the European wisent are the largest terrestrial mammals in North America and Europe. Bison are nomadic grazers and travel in herds, except for the non-dominant bulls, which travel alone or in small groups during most of the year. American bison are known for living in the Great Plains. Both species were hunted close to extinction during the 19th and 20th centuries but have since rebounded. The American Plains bison is no longer listed as endangered, but the Wood Bison is on the endangered species list in Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although superficially similar, there are a number of physical and behavioural differences between the American and European bison. The American species has 15 ribs, while the European bison has 14. The American bison has four lumbar vertebrae, while the European has five.[3] Adult American bison are not as rangy in build, and have shorter legs.[4] American bison tend to graze more, and browse less than their European cousins, due to their necks being set differently. Compared to the American bison, the nose of the European species is set further forward than the forehead when the neck is in a neutral position. The body of the American bison is hairier, though its tail has less hair than that of the European bison. The horns of the European bison point through the plane of their faces, making them more adept at fighting through the interlocking of horns in the same manner as domestic cattle, unlike the American bison which favours charging. American bison are more easily tamed than their European cousins, and breed with domestic cattle more readily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bison are born without their trademark hump and horns and live for approximately twenty years. They grow to maturity at two to three years, although males continue to grow until about their seventh year. Adult bulls express a high degree of dominance competitiveness during mating season. Male bison fight for females and these fights often result in injury or death. After the bison mate, the herd splits up into smaller herds. Calves are born nine months after mating. The mothers take care of and nurse their young for a year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; a Micro, Log book only, bring your own writing instrument. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A native of Illinois, he was a captain during the Cayuse War, helped lay the Applegate Trail, served in the Oregon Territorial Legislature, and in 1857 was a member of the Oregon Constitutional Convention. Scott also founded Scottsburg, Oregon, and is the namesake for several natural features in Southern Oregon.&lt;br/&gt;During the Cayuse War Scott was made a captain and was responsible for sending dispatches for the Provisional Government south to California. Following his involvement in the war, he settled in 1848 along Elm Creek in Douglas County, Oregon, with the valley named Scotts Valley in his honor. In 1850, Scott founded Scottsburg along the Umpqua River,  Mount Scott in Crater Lake National Park in Southern Oregon is also named after Levi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scott then entered the political field when he was elected to the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1852. He represented three southern counties, Umpqua, Douglas and Jackson as a Whig in the upper chamber Council. Scott won re-election twice, serving through the 1854-55 session. He returned to politics briefly in 1857 as a delegate to the Oregon Constitutional Convention. Scott represented Umpqua County as an Anti-Democrat.&lt;br/&gt;He died in Malheur County, Oregon, in the Southeastern part of the state on April 21, 1890. In addition to the town, valley,  Scott Mountain in Douglas County is also named after Levi. This memorial is in his honor and honors the town of Scottsburg. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The government thought that if the Japanese invaded Oregon they had to have a place to stop them. The structure was a Machine gun nest. The tunnel was loaded with an explosive and was to be exploded if the Japanese got close. If that failed the gun nest was within shooting distance of the western entrance. Fortunately it was never used.&lt;br/&gt;The cache is on the east side of the tunnel near a historic monument for a school in the area from 1890's till the 1913. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

You do not have to enter the park to find this one. Great fishing and rafting nearby.  I took three readings with my GPS and got three different readings. I averaged them, so you might be off a few feet. It is a plastic camoed bottle about 5 inches high. Log, pen, three back up pencils, small bottle of Anti-bacterial spray and Pewter medallion for the first to find, plastic medal on a ribbon, magnetic book mark from Napa, California and other goodies. Remember if you take something please leave something. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to Honu 4 for the FTF. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a remembrance of KEED-AM, a former radio station/studio that once occupied this space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KEED-AM served the Eugene/Springfield Metro area until June 13, 1993 when an arsonist decided to set both the studio and transmitter buildings ablaze.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the incident, the City of Eugene denied the request to build a new transmitter building declaring the conditional use permit invalid since the site was adjacent to Alton Baker Park. Mr. Tilson, the station owner prevailed in court which allowed him to build a new transmitter building to hold the AM transmitter which currently stands at N 44° 03.074’  W123° 03.790’.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, shortly after winning his court battle with the City of Eugene, Mr. Tilson for unknown reasons decided to sell KEED-AM to Albany Radio, while selling the station property to the City of Eugene, which led to the expansion of Alton Baker Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, the only remnants of the former station are two radio towers to the East and the studio parking lot which resides roughly 100 feet to the South of this cache. At this time, Albany Radio utilizes both towers to broadcast its stations, KHPE-107.9 FM/KWIL-790 AM.  </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This virtual cache is located in Skinner's Butte Park. There is no entrance fee. Skinner's Butte was named after Eugene Skinner, whom the town of Eugene is named after. The coordinates will take you to a good place to observe a common geological formation known as basalt columns, which form when basalt cools quickly and vertical cracks form in it. Your task is to find out how many basalt columns have been planted in the ground surrounding the plaque (not including the one the plaque is on) just west of the coordinates on the other side of the road; put this number in for the code phrase. For example, if there were five basalt columns, I would type 5 in as the code phrase.</groundspeak:long_description>

If you dont find it, please report it. Reporting it as DNF isn't something to be ashamed of. There is a reason for that. :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, I dont really want this area all torn up.

I live in Tangent. When I do something makeshift he calls it Tangent style. This cache is hidden where I remember a good cache hidden a while ago by a great cacher. It was removed by road construction. I thought this was a good area for a cache. So I have hidden another one. This is also a strange intersection like a 3 way stop with only one stop sign. I drive by this way every day on my way to or from work so beware I may notice you looking for it, and come say hi. So if Geo Prizm with a Tangent style roof rack sneaks up on you that's me. This is in a small circular container covered with Tangent style camo. Already stuffed with Pickleddreams style SWAG</groundspeak:long_description>

have a cache. This is my first cache in Oregon, but I have family
that lives here so I'm done here all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peanut Park is a small getaway spot for city youth. It features
a small playground and open field in which to play. There is a
picnic table and grill. Dogs are required to be on leash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a nano cache if you have never found one
like this it might be a little more difficult but it shouldn't be
too hard. Please remember to bring a pen and sign small :-)&lt;/p&gt;

and don't go after this one at night.&lt;/p&gt;

So I replaced it with a cylinder shaped container. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; to stay with the theme I have placed 4 Pineapple Upside Down Cake recipes in here. If you know of a special one and don’t mind sharing it with other geocachers, you can bring a copy and trade with one already in the cache. I would like to keep up the theme and only trade the recipes as swag for this one. Travel bugs of any sort allowed. A little history if you wanted to know It seems hard to believe that the Pineapple Upside Down cake has not always been with us, however in reality canned pineapples were not available until 1903 when Jim Dole of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company (now Dole Pineapple) perfected a way to tin them. So where did people get the idea of putting fruit at the bottom of a cake pan? Well this technique has been around since the Middle Ages. Traditionally made with apples, cherries and other seasonal fruit upside down cakes were often made in cast-iron skillets on top of the stove. The use of pineapple (and an oven) was just the newest most novel twist, an ode to twentieth century technologies and notions of convenience. Indeed it did not take long for the recipe to work its way into the American housewife’s repertoire. By 1925 the Hawaiian Pineapple Company (1925) was receiving 2500 recipes for Pineapple Upside Down Cake when it asked people to submit creative ways to prepare pineapples. Only 2 decades after the introduction of the canned pineapple the Pineapple Upside Down Cake had become a pop icon! While rooting around in old women’s magazines I found a Gold Medal Flour ad with a full-page, four-color picture of Pineapple Upside-Down Cake–a round cake with six slices of pineapple, candied red cherries, and a brown sugar glaze. The date: November 1925.” —American Century Cookbook: The Most Popular Recipes of the 20th Century, Jean Anderson The next year (1926) the Hawaiian Pineapple company capitalized on the popularity of the Pineapple Upside Down Cake by running a national ad campaign featuring the recipe. Further solidifying its place in culinary history? So are you ready to try your hand at this American classic?

The area is gated off to MOTORIZED traffic.  Most of the gates have pedestrian access points.  The area is open during daylight hours only 365 a year.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As Valsetz Alumni we decided to plant a cache on the old school grounds. So you will have to leave the gravel road and travel on foot through what is now a young forest and find your way to where the football field use to be.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today was a family geocaching outting. We decided to visit our old home in Valsetz and plant a couple of new caches while there.(Valsetzpegleg, DragunRyder, Papaskunk64, LarryLarch and Akiy Vampris). It was a cold wet day for caching, but we had fun and memories anyways. We found where our old house use to be and took some photos and shared some memories with our childern. Then using our GPS's with the street overlays we were able to locate where the school grounds use to be then weaved in and out of trees to where we estimated footbal field use to be. We found a small clearing on what we concluded must have been our old grid iron. So look around and see if you can bring up some of your own memories Valsetz and enjoy. It was a cold and cloudy days when we set this up so the coordinates may be off slightly. This is a peanut butter jar sized cache with a log and a couple of toy of the kids to trade out. The jar is wrapped in camoflaged tape.</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Look for a &quot;V&quot; as in &quot;V&quot;alsetz with a skull over looking the cache. The cache is approximately 4' off the ground. The cache is in plain view from the small clearing.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

It is nestled behind a fir tree along the Salmon River at the Van Duzer Corridor rest stop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a great place to stop on your way to the coast for a picnic lunch or just to let your animals run a little. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a green ammo can that is not on the main path. You may have to bush-whack a little depending on the time of year. Please make sure the can gets placed in same location and is covered by at least some near by foliage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks for looking! I will post First to find!        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Updated the GPS coordinates as of 09/04/2011  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to DragunRyder for being FTF! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I will be placing a Chirp in this cache very soon!</groundspeak:long_description>

Since I live in Scappoose (the Chinook word for gravelly plain), I thought it would be fun to name my caches in Chinook. I've mostly been using Chinook Jargon which is easier to manage, but there doesn't seem to be a word in Chinook jargon for porcupine. This is my thirteenth hide, celebrating my 130th find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crown Zellerbach trail was once a logging road and before that, a logging railroad. Today it is a linear county park. It is a rails to trails project that is progressing very slowly in my opinion, but it is a very welcome project. The park runs along a lot of private property, so be respectful, and stay on the trail. This is especially important when choosing your parking space. I've given parking coordinates which should keep you out of trouble. There are no trespassing signs everywhere, but Rain Garden Lane is a public road, so you can park along the side of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is my third letterbox cache. I only just became interested letter boxing earlier this year, and there are so few in this area that I decided right away that I wanted to start hiding a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking: N 45° 49.607 W 122° 59.480 </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Another great cache along the Crown Zellerbach Trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The name of this cache, ipsoot, is the Chinook word for hide. Since I live in Scappoose (the Chinook word for gravelly plain), I thought it would be fun to name my caches in Chinook. This is my 23st hide, celebrating my 230th find. The cache is hidden about 1.4 miles from the parking coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Crown Zellerbach trail was once a logging road and before that, a logging railroad. Today it is a linear county park. It is a rails-to-trails project that is progressing very slowly in my opinion, but it is a very welcome project. The park runs along a lot of private property, so be respectful, and stay on the trail. This is especially important when choosing your parking space. I've given parking coordinates along Rain Garden Lane. This is a public road, so the no trespassing signs are a little confusing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is my 13th letterbox cache. I only just became interested in letter boxing earlier this year (2012), and there are so few in this area that I decided right away that I wanted to start hiding a few. Remember: letterboxes include stamps, which are not trade items. I placed the stamp in a labeled bag. I placed the SWAG in another labeled bag, so you shouldn't get them mixed up.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

In fact, Kah mowitch? (Where are the deer?) was a common greeting in ages past. I didn't actually see an deer while placing this cache, but it seems a likely place to spot one, and I thought it would be fun to give my fellow cachers a cache with an animal in the title.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first mile of the hike is easy, along a well-marked, hard-packed trail with very little overgrowth. The last 20 feet is up a steep incline. My six-year-old son did it with me, but he shouldn't have.  </groundspeak:long_description>

BYOP - Bring Your Own Pen(cil).  **Muggles are occasional, but will look as driving by**&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, you know a town is small when you can't find information on the WiKi sites.  I was trying to make this one informational, but as it is... it is just a park and grab cache.  Post info if you got it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I found this blip on the map while drive to the WSGA Campout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The parking for this cache is obvious and is only about 100 feet from the cache itself.  Please observe the parking signs - you will understand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you find the &quot;14&quot; park there.  When you see the &quot;25&quot; head that way.  Not recommended for small kids due to the road nearby and the uncertain terrain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***Gratz to Tolmaus, Nokaoi, Lizzy, and tessa1 for the FTF***&lt;br/&gt;***Also, I increased the difficulty on this one due to the veterans who have struggled with this find***</groundspeak:long_description>

Use gravel road that starts at maple and 2nd street. Not the private road off main highway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This place is just a humming. Cache is near where you can park. Easy gravel road up to sight. All up hill but just step a little harder on the gas pedal and you can make it. Had the older guys in mind when I hid this, also those who may ride bikes. I used to pick berries here but not this year. They were pretty scarce. Another spot maybe some will visit for the first time. Cache is an ammo can. Beware wild animals in area. Not really just golfers </groundspeak:long_description>

It was overcast and a little drizzley, so I'm using that as my excuse for why I couldn't find this one.  The GPS said i was right on top of it, and I'm sure I was, but I just couldn't track that thing down.

Cache - Join Us Today! Search NAGS on Facebook!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, I was out exploring today with the geokids and had to make a &quot;stop,&quot; if you know what I mean.  There I was, not wanting to create a &quot;mess&quot; for other, wishing I had a shovel for obvious reasons.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trying to find a quick place to hid, I saw the most unusual thing... a shovel!  What luck!  So, now I was able to finished my &quot;business&quot; here.  After a GPS reading to make sure I left my &quot;package&quot; in a track-able location, I was &quot;relieved&quot; and ready to continue our day of geocaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While here, see if you can find the shovel!  Please do not take it or move it.  Funny what you can find caching!  With all the cut-backs today, the DOT is hiding shovels now??  LOL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BTW... There was nothing &quot;left&quot; at this location other than a cache, in case you were grossing out!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***Gratz to iTooth for yet another FTF with my caches!***</groundspeak:long_description>

Stop by, drop in a fishing line, and attempt to catch a cache with a elevated view.  (BYOP - Bring Your Own Pen(cil)&lt;br/&gt;(a N.A.G.S. Cache - North America Geocaching Society)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is my second cache hide.  This has an elevated terrain level due to the area in which you will have to go to reach the cache and a different view of the area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little kids should not try this one, however, it is not extremely difficult, rating is mostly for the end while looking for the cache.  Minimal bushwacking is necessary (at certain times of the year), otherwise there is a small trail already blazed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a small container which is big enough to hold a log and a small TB or two and some Geocoins.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To begin this cache off I placed our first TB - Michelangelo.  Please check out this TB's mission and help it along its way! Consider sending updated pics of his travels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As this is a popular area at times, beware of Muggles!  I hope you enjoy it!  Send a picture or two from your hike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to iTooth FTF.</groundspeak:long_description>

Bring your Fishing Poles when the season is right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is little need for bushwacking.  If you choose this path, your on your own and it is a daunting task.  Park on the East Bound side of the road (kind of obvious where), walk down the old path/road until it dead-ends, and hang a left to the beach.  Your on your own from there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you need extra help, check out the pictures and the hint. Lastly, because of the uncertainty of the tide levels, PLEASE make sure that the cache is replaced the same and the small line is secured!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and enjoy the sunset!   3 Cachekinz to start this one out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;** Congrats to GotGas? and TwoPeasInAPod for a joint FTF **</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a park and hike cache.  Muggles will be rare and should not be able to see you near the cache.  This is a small cache that holds a TB and coins.  In fact, it was placed with 2 coins (real) and 1 TB.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I saw this place from the GZ of my son's cache &quot;BountyHunter01's First Cache&quot; # GC1Y8M6.  When placing this cache, I wanted to trek much further back, but realized that the fence was a barrier that might indicate private property so I refrained.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once I left the road, I found a nice little view, a ton of horsetails and 3 varieties of blackberries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache terrain rating is high due to the uneven ground, varying terrain, and sticker bushes. Sturdy shoes/boots and long pants are highly suggested. Is it worth the hike?  I liked the view, but you will have to decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**Gratz to Nokaoi for 2nd FTF in as many days***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PL1YBYC - BountyHunter01 First Cache Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 46° 59.260 W 123° 55.392&lt;br/&gt;Use this BountyHunter's First Cache Parking or park directly across the street for a closer approach.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is just slightly bigger than a micro film container.  It will hold the log and a few small coins or a small TB.  ***Muggles are scarce here, but will occasionally perform a drive-by.  B.Y.O.P. - Bring Your Own Pen(cil).  My son, who is 8, wanted to place his first cache.  We finally found a place that he wanted to do it. Let us know what you think... He is excited to get feedback!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have never understood why the road to this location is here, as there is rarely any traffic on it.  Logging or a quick bypass from N. Hoquiam to Oceans Shores we figure...  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, the GZ provides a view with the Little Hoquiam River in view depending on the time of year and other less significant sites.  As you take the short walk from the suggested parking (N46*59.260 - W123*55.392), you may notice wild strawberries, red huckleberries, blackberries, and sagebrush.  The real question is, which path?  The high road or the low road??&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We thought that this was a nice quiet place to look over the land, listen to the sounds of nature, and relax before heading out to the next cache.  Enjoy a short refreshing hike and a little exercise for this find.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrain is not difficult, but requires a hike with moderate slopes to the side.  Monitor the geokids if they are small.  Since there is already a blazed trail and people visit here, please ensure the cache is hid the same or better than found.  No bushwacking is necessary for the find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**Gratz Nokaoi for yet another FTF**&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PL1Y8M6 - BountyHunter01 First Cache Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 46° 59.260 W 123° 55.392&lt;br/&gt;Parking for the beginning of BountHunter01's First Cache</groundspeak:long_description>

Please be careful when making the grab so as not to loose it.  Wheelchair accessible with a bit of a reach.  Muggles are thin, but possible, be aware.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to the Bonneville Power Administration and the edge of town.  If you listen closely, you will hear the sound of money/power flying by.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no need to leave the road for this one. Also, just a short stint from the GZ is a great harbor view if you drive through the housing area off south of the new road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***Congrats to ... Surprise, surprise...

Take the full walk and you may want a sip or two of water. Very easy. Rest and sit down at cache. Take off shoes and cool the dogs. Bring fish pole, swim suit and the dog. Very nice for kids and a picnic. This man made lake helped build the 2 towers you see in the distance. Thats why the area is &quot;minus the rocks&quot;. There are llamas in the area also.

The older kids could definately appreciate the small hike and the nature here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*** THE PICTURES I ATTACHED ARE OF THE GZ AND VIEW FROM IT TO HELP YOU FIND THIS ***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Park at gate (just after RR tracks on right) off from Lynch Road to walk down, parking Co-ordinates are also posted. The gate is a farm style gate with big cement barrier blocks in front of it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; CONGRATULATIONS TO:Pat&amp;JulieTravel For FTF!&lt;br/&gt;This cache is a bit of a hike in to. It is right near the bay grass flats at an area we like. My 6 year old daughter has no issue getting into this cache but I wouldnt recommend for real little tikes. This area does get a fair amount of visitors so i had to hide the cache a bit making this a fairly lengthy find. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GPS will be a bit bouncy in the woods all the way down, but as long as you follow the path down to the clearing of sorts it should then get you close enough. Watch for the stinging nettle in the lower portions of the old road hike, its there, but not in your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towards the end of the trail i set out sticks on each side to help guide you in. Just follow the creek towards the bay and the sticks will start from the main path following the edge of the creek.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also thought I might add some about the old hatchery. It was run by the Squaxin tribe and closed down maybe ten years ago. The state then purchased the property and took out the road and the Hatchery. A sign of possible park plans for the future? Who knows... Its a nice &quot;hike&quot; non the less.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;PK2DTPK - GC2DTPK Parking&lt;br/&gt;N 47° 08.801 W 123° 04.805&lt;br/&gt;Park here and start your hike! :O)</groundspeak:long_description>

So I contacted the cache owner and she gave me permission to put my own cache here. Nice hike, and a really neat creek. My daughter has made it a few times now and here daisy girl scout troop all made it through from lynch road to arcadia with no problems. We have gotten a pretty good trail in place now with some more new caches to post soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taken from the first cache listing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is located down a logging road, and then down dirt bike trails. It is a great place to walk a dog, or do some mountain biking. I enjoy finding these little hidden gems in the midst of the clearcuts. My best guess from looking at maps is that the cache is located by Mill Creek - but if someone else has been maps, please let me know. ***You have to cross the creek to get to the cache - when the creek is running high, wading will be required.*** Parking coordinates when the gate is locked: N 47 10.312; W 122 59.500&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We now know this is not mill creek. It is a creek that is unnamed from what we can tell. It serves as outflow from a large swamp area and joins with mill creek down stream a short distance away.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the entrance to the old Simpson Dam. Just a little cache to&lt;br/&gt;get you going. As my oldest was finding a home for this cache. My&lt;br/&gt;youngest was in a duel with a DQ Dilly bar as it was melting off&lt;br/&gt;the stick. We will just call the duel a tie. You can walk up the&lt;br/&gt;road from the gate or if you walk past the gas main and down&lt;br/&gt;through the field you will find a trail to your left near the&lt;br/&gt;creek. Enjoy your stay, please practice Cache in Trash out and&lt;br/&gt;Don't Block The Gate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goldsborough Creek drains 80 square miles of forestland on the&lt;br/&gt;Olympic Peninsula. The creek had been dammed since 1885 when a&lt;br/&gt;railroad company built a log storage pond on the site. In 1921, the&lt;br/&gt;dam was used to generate power for the growing community of&lt;br/&gt;Shelton. After a flood wiped out the dam, it was rebuilt in 1932 to&lt;br/&gt;provide power and to divert water for a forest products operation.&lt;br/&gt;Simpson Timber Company acquired the dam in the 1950s, but ceased&lt;br/&gt;drawing power from it in 1986. When it was rebuilt in 1932, the dam&lt;br/&gt;was 100 feet long and just 14 feet high. But with water flowing&lt;br/&gt;over it at an average rate of 400 cubic feet per second, the&lt;br/&gt;streambed below the dam was soon scoured out, adding another 20&lt;br/&gt;feet to the dam’s height and rendering the dam’s fish&lt;br/&gt;ladder impassable. The dam became utterly useless to Simpson in&lt;br/&gt;1996 when flooding destroyed the water diversion pipeline.&lt;br/&gt; Simpson Timber Company, The Squaxin Island Tribe&lt;br/&gt;and the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife teamed up&lt;br/&gt;to Remove the dam. Work began early in the summer of 2001, when&lt;br/&gt;stream flows were low. First the stream was diverted into 2000 feet&lt;br/&gt;of four-foot diameter pipe. Removing the old wooden dam was&lt;br/&gt;relatively easy; the more difficult work lay in creating a gently&lt;br/&gt;sloped streambed to replace the 35-foot drop the dam had created.&lt;br/&gt;The sediment that had collected behind the dam was used to build up&lt;br/&gt;the downstream stretch. Thirty-one concrete weirs were installed&lt;br/&gt;across the streambed, creating a series of low steps that&lt;br/&gt;stabilized the rebuilt slope. Then, numerous boulders and large&lt;br/&gt;tree stumps were scattered between the concrete weirs to improve&lt;br/&gt;fish habitat. Water was returned to the restored streambed in&lt;br/&gt;November of 2001 and chum salmon were spotted above the old dam&lt;br/&gt;site that fall. The next year, the Squaxin Island Tribe counted&lt;br/&gt;more than 15,000 chum migrating down through the newly restored&lt;br/&gt;habitat. There is a lot of potential for coho production in the&lt;br/&gt;creek, which is the species the partnership is hoping to&lt;br/&gt;significantly improve.</groundspeak:long_description>

Participating is completely optional and this cache can be logged as found by doing nothing more than signing the log.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.When you find the cache, take back home one BINGO card.&lt;br/&gt;2.The cache owner will report the actual ball No. on the log.&lt;br/&gt;4.Enjoy BINGO game using the ball No.&lt;br/&gt;5.If you get BINGO, please declare on the &quot;write note&quot; log&lt;br/&gt;6.The BINGO winners can choose prize (the earlier logger has priority); the owner will send email with coords of small gift container When the prize ends the BINGO game ends.&lt;br/&gt;7.If a visitor doesn't join the game (i.e. does not take a card), the owner will still choose one ball.&lt;br/&gt;Please note:&lt;br/&gt;•Please declare BINGO Whena new ball No. appears, the cache owner won't check each card's numbers, but only verifies the declared BINGO is proper or not.&lt;br/&gt;•Donation of gifts are welcome.&lt;br/&gt;•For earlier visitors, it's convenient to add this cache on &quot;watch list&quot; or notified &quot;bookmark&quot; to get the information of other visitors.&lt;br/&gt;•For the latter visitors, you can roll-back the log and get the already &quot;hit&quot; ball No.&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the game.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We went up for a day of snow fun and some caching. So it was only fitting that we put a cache up here. Its only bad terrain for several feet, and it may be easier to come in from the &quot;back&quot; but i still figure it deserves a 3.5 terrain rating. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A few TBs / Coins to get her started! This side road was an excellent fast sled run for us today. Someone had already built the run and it had a jump at the end. GPS was a bit sketchy, but after a few tries we were happy enough. If you get different Coords, let us know. Also thought I would add that this will be a pretty good hike during the snowy season if you don't have some decent ground clearance and good tires.

If there is snow on the ground, I do not recommend the hunting of this Letterbox. In any case, please be watchful on all the corners for falling rocks onto the roadway. Furthermore, there are very step cliffs on both sides of this road, so please drive slowly and carefully.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drive South past &quot;Mile Marker 26&quot; until you see a Large Telephone Box with the number 738-16(above)070920 on it. From here, begin counting the Small Telephone Boxes on both sides of the road until you reach your destination at the 20th Small Box.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along the way, you may notice that some of the Small Boxes have numbers on them, while other do not. When you come to the 6th Small Box, you should see the number E5G6C on it. Keep driving!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the 11th Small Box, you should see the &quot;Mile Marker 24&quot; sign. From here, continue counting the boxes until you see the number W6E12 on one of them. Keep driving, you are past the halfway point!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After another 5 more Small Boxes, you should come to a very sharp curve to the left and another to the right. On the sharp right curve is the 20th Small Box. If you look up the hillside on your left, you should see a stream coming down the hill and passing under the road through a large metal culvert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walk over to the top of this culvert and look up the hillside. About 100 feet uphill and on the right side of the stream, you should see a land creature known as the Deadly Quintapus, which is a distant cousin to the Octopus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the grasp of this creature's tentacles is a large rock. Quietly approach it from behind and carefully remove from it's grasp the treasure you seek! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IF YOU FIND A LETTERBOX STAMP IN THIS CACHE, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE IT!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;CACHE HIDDEN AT BASE OF LARGE STUMP. This cache is part of the &lt;i&gt;Birds of Victoria&lt;/i&gt; series. Be sure to record the number on the underside of the lid, it will help you find the final Birds of Victoria cache. This cache is hidden at Beechey Head in East Sooke Park. There's a large parking lot at Aylard Farm. There are pit toilets in the park, but no running water. To get to the cache, you have 2 choices. You can take the Coast Trail which is longer and the terrain more challenging, but you get beautiful views of the ocean. To get to the Coast Trail, head towards the beach through the old orchard from the parking lot. Or you can take a more direct route through the forest by starting at the waypoint given and following the signposts to Beechey Head. The most direct route takes about 45 minutes; the terrain for this route starts off easier, but it gets really rocky closer to the cache.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We spent many happy hours swimming and boating at Langford Lake this summer. We visited both the main beach on the other side of the lake and the little beach next to the boat launch numerous times. We decided to place this cache as a tribute to a very enjoyable summer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Ed Nixon trail which the cache is on is open from sunrise to sunset. The cache cannot be reached via the nearby railroad tracks. You must use the Ed Nixon trail to get to the cache; see the trailhead provided.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I won this bison tube at an event a few months ago and although I hate micros, I decided to hide it. Since it's an uninteresting cache container, I thought I'd make an interesting cache page.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have taken a great interest in Victoria's history in the last couple of years and I have noticed many dumb things that we are doing today that people 100 years ago were actually doing right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Victoria's Streetcars&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where you are standing in Midland Circle is the original terminus for one of the branches of Victoria's electric streetcar system. Constructed in 1890 by the BC Electric Co., Victoria was the third city in Canada to have a transit system made entirely of electric streetcars. The system was gradually added to with a line going to the Royal Jubilee Hospital and CFB Esquimalt. Despite occasional derailments and a few collisions with automobiles, the BCER ran a safe and efficient urban transit system. By 1904, it was operating twenty-four streetcars at fifteen minute intervals. In 1912, it carried approximately eleven million passengers from all points in Victoria. Unfortunately in 1948, the tracks were torn up and the system was lost forever in favour of gasoline powered buses. Green, clean and efficient streetcars sure would be nice today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Go to the south edge of the circle and look at the outer edge of the road. You can actually see the old tracks in the grass and buried by pavement!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Past  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Future?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;  &lt;/i&gt;         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;BR1V813 - Streetcar &quot;Barn&quot;&lt;br /&gt;N 48° 25.913 W 123° 22.161&lt;br /&gt;Now Rehab Nightclub (formerly Evolution Nightclub), this was where the streetcars would go to sleep at night or if they were sick :P&lt;br /&gt;S11V813 - Camosun Streetcar Shelter&lt;br /&gt;N 48° 26.850 W 123° 19.586&lt;br /&gt;An preserved streetcar shelter.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cache is located next to a sidetrail off the main trail. Reception was poor at the time of hiding so I've placed pink flagging at the start of the sidetrail and also on a tree near the cache. The trail is open from sunrise to sunset. Please be gentle with the cache container. Have fun!</groundspeak:long_description>

Room [i]without[/i] a view?  Heck, I thought the view here was pretty nice! [:D] I have to say, though, many of the TEAM KFWB caches have names that, at least to a non-local like me, don't seem to have much to do with the location at which they are placed.  I must not know the inside joke on some of these.

I think we must have looked like Keystone Kops on this one - down the stairs, then up the stairs, then down the stairs!  I think we finally located the cache on our third attempt in that location!

Thanks for a fun hunt in a great location.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This is a multi-cache which takes cachers on a 15 minute walk in a quiet neighborhood, passing several gardens. This cache was inspired by the 1902 children's story &lt;i&gt;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&lt;/i&gt; by Beatrix Potter. Both physical stages are very well camoflaged. Bring a pen/pencil.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Peter Rabbit is a naughty little bunny, who likes to steal vegetables from Mr McGregor's garden. He's hidden a stash of vegetables somewhere in this neighborhood and it's your job to discover it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first stage starts you off right outside Mr McGregor's garden. Mr McGregor is known around this neighborhood for his rows and rows of juicy ripe tomatoes and fresh green beans. When the weather's fair, take a quick peek to admire his luscious vegetables, but do not disturb Mr McGregor as he is really quite busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter loves to squeeze under Mr McGregor's fence and nibble his crisp lettuce, tender French beans, and crunchy radishes. He simply can't help himself, although his mother has reminded him time and time again how his father ended up in one of Mrs McGregor's pies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter knows better than to go near a busy road, so from Mr McGregor's garden, please take 107 hops down the street in the opposite direction, starting at the little circle. It may help you to know that as much as Peter has a love of vegetables, he has a terrible fear of breaks in the sidewalk and always takes a giant bunny hop over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter is always a little nervous after sneaking into McGregor's garden so he enjoys going for a hop along this little street as a nice way to unwind. In the summer, the aroma coming from the fruit trees is simply intoxicating (well, at least to a bunny's nose). If it's the right time of the year and you look carefully, you can see some fruit which is a little more exciting than your standard apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter has a habit of squeezing under gates. After you've done your 107 hops, you should be able to see one of the gates Peter has squeezed under, in the search for free vegetables. Take a minute to picture a fat little bunny trying to squeeze out from under this gate without losing his jacket and shoes, but don't let that distraction make you lose track of your goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, after Peter was wriggling out from under this gate, he saw a sign from above (some very clever rabbits can read, you know), and thought perhaps there might be something tasty up-ahead. Well, without so much as looking left or right, Peter hopped across the street and kept on hopping until he found himself going around in circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little perplexed (and a little dizzy), Peter suddenly smelled something simply divine off in the distance. He remembered he had passed a little walking path on his way down this street, so he went back to investigate and soon was on his way. In his excitement, he dropped something very teeny-tiny half-way along this little path. Find what he dropped and you will be able to find his secret stash of vegetables. His stash is somewhat more than a hop, skip, and a jump away from this point and near another vegetable garden which Peter loves to steal from. &lt;i&gt;Please admire, but do not sample any of Peter Rabbit's vegetables, he would be most upset.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 7 packs of Peter Rabbit's favorite carrot seeds for the first 7 people to find the cache. Please be careful when replacing contents. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please note: There will never be a need to enter private property, climb trees or bushwack. Please no spoilers in the logs. Thanks.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Stage 2: If you've done your hops right, you should end up on Applewood street. Peter dropped his itsy-bitsy at the base of a fence post. Be sure to flip it over.
Final: Peter's mother told him to always wear a hat when it's raining.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Niece wanted to place a cache but seeing that the parks are already loaded with caches we decided to do a CACHE &amp; GRAB. Easy one star find. :) The tricky part is being stealthy. It is in very HIGH traffic area with very little parking.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;PLEASE KEEP IT HIDDEN. THANKS. :D :D :D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

PLEASE TUCK CACHE BACK IN OUT OF SIGHT. Please see below for an OPTIONAL activity which will give you a chance to exercise your imagination and impress your fellow cachers:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about being a cache owner is getting to read all the interesting stories people write in their logs. This cache gives you a chance to practise your logging skills and entertain your fellow cachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;As an OPTIONAL activity, we invite you to:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write an online log full of drama, deceit, and romance. Impress your fellow cachers with a log that is nothing short of spell-binding, electrifying, the most-memorable-log-you've-ever-written! Your log may contain elements from your previous caching experiences or it can be pure fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us how finding this cache changed your life. How it was the most exciting, most terrifying, most gruelling thing you've ever done. And we want details, baby, details!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;...Amaze us as you rescue a muggle-in-distress from certain death...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;...Have us on the edge of our seats as you battle your arch enemy for FTF...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;...Shock us you survive a black widow attack and crawl on yours hands and knees to GZ...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you get the idea...looking forward to your stories!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a large size cache perfect for girls that believe in fairies. It is hidden in a place that fairies would pick to live if there were even a lot of choices. Inside Tinkerbell's treasure-chest you will find a lot of pixie dust scattered everywhere. This is the fairies that have been flying around arranging and setting things up for you. Please give a thank-you to my mom for helping me with the technical stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tinkerbell has prepared a special prize for the first fairy-loving kid to find her treasure-chest. It's 3 gold nuggets and magical purple pixie dust. Look for the little purple pouch. Please be gentle to the tree which is the fairies' home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to read my Fairy FAQ below and answer the questions below to find Tinkerbell's treasure-chest. Count the number of letters in your answer. (for example, yes=3, up=2, down=4 etc) To answer 4 of the questions, you will need to go to the playground at the listed coordinates. You will want to bring a pen and paper (and maybe a calculator) to do the calcuations. Tinkerbell and her friends are not hiding at the listed coordinates, but are within walking distance. This is a very busy kiddies playground, so if you don't have a kid with you, you may feel more comfortable coming in the early morning or evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A= Do fairies have babies? (yes/no)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B= What color is the egg that Mother Dove laid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C= Where does Tinkerbell live? (2 words)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D= Is spider-web untangling a fairy talent? (yes/no)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E= Count the number of mushroom-like things on the grey, rocky wall that fairies can hide behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F=Find the year under the big slide. The year has 4 numbers in it. What's the biggest number?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G= What animal does a fairy fly like if they don't have any pixie dust?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H= If a fairy glows pink, how is she feeling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I= What is Tinkerbell's talent? (1 word)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J= Count the number of picnic tables. Don't forget the one near the washroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K= Count the number of green toadstools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tinkerbell and her friends are at:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 48 A x B x C x D x E x F minus 6784, W 123 G x H x I x J x K plus 16837&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Hint : 28893 -&amp;gt; 28.893)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Tinkerbell:&lt;/b&gt; Tinkerbell is a tinker fairy, the best one in Pixie Hollow. Tinker fairies are fairies that fix stuff. She enjoys adventures with Peter Pan. She arrived in Pixie Hollow and when she walked by, her talent symbol glowed the brightest glow ever. Once she had almost got caught by a hawk and now she hates hawks. Anything that circles the sky she fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a &lt;b&gt;Neverland Fairy FAQ.&lt;/b&gt; If you want to know more about fairies, good books to read are the Hidden World of Fairies and the Disney Fairy Books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did you know?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time that a human baby laughs, a fairy is born!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What do fairies eat?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: They eat the same stuff that humans do, just smaller portions. Instead of flour made from wheat, they use flour made from flowers. Alot of fairies like sweets, especially chocolates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Do fairies have babies?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What different fairy talents are there?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: There are many talents. These include: water, light, garden, sewing, grass-weaving, caterpillar-herder, dust-talent, message fairies, mining, singing, music, mouse-milking, story-telling, tree-tending, spider-web untangling, rice-growing, problem-solving, pretzel-twisting, pea-shelling, olive-pressing, leaf-curling, lace-making, knot-tying, baking, hole-in-cheese, fast-flying, healing, hole-digging, fruit-stomping, fern-spotting, far-listening, cricket-whistling, caterpillar-shearing, mainland-visiting clapping, painting, animal-talent and tinker fairies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Do fairies die?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: They cannot die from old age. They can, however, die from drowning, getting eaten by a hawk, and many other accidents that may happen. They can also fade away if a child stops believing in fairies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What are different fairy emotions?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Lemon-yellow-edged with gold glow=Normal mood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink-edged glow=Proud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange-glow=Embarassed or angry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glow flares=Excited&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glow winks out=Startled or frightened&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Does each fairy have their own house?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: They usually live in the branches of the home tree or inside the home tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Who is Mother Dove?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: She's a special dove. When Torth Mountain erupted, Neverland woke up and gave Mother Dove wisdom and magic. She burned along with the tree, but wasn't harmed. She molted and laid an egg which would keep the Never fairies young as long as it stayed whole. The egg is blue and twice as big as normal dove eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Tell me about Pixie Dust&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: There's very little pixie dust left. Fairies used to get pixie dust from the pixie dust tree and it would help them fly, but unfortunately, the tree was destroyed. If they did not have any pixie dust on their wings, they would fly like a chicken. Now they use fairy dust to fly instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Where do fairies get fairy dust then?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: From Mother Dove. Every year she molts and the magical molted feathers get ground into fairy dust. The dust talent fairies sprinkle a little bit of fairy dust on everybody every day.&lt;/p&gt;

Be sure to record the number on the underside of the lid, it will help you find the final Birds of Victoria cache. You are looking for a large camouflaged lock n lock. It’s easy to lose your way in this area so I would suggest marking waypoints and turning tracking on. Expect rocky trails, some rock scrambling and some bum-sliding. PLEASE RE-HIDE CACHE WELL WITH BARK. THANKS! &lt;/p&gt;

Rithet’s Bog is a Conservation Area and it contains the last remaining peat bog on the Saanich Peninsula. As the Bog is home to several rare plant and butterfly species, it is important to stay on the trails. PLEASE PUT LARGE PIECE OF WOOD ON TOP OF CACHE TO RE-HIDE IT. The container is not waterproof so please be careful what you leave in it. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

Hiding caches sure is keeping us &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;usy while we wait for spring. THERE IS A LOCK N LOCK OF TOYS TO THE RIGHT OF THE CACHE, UNDER BARK. PLEASE REHIDE CACHE UNDER DRIFTWOOD, THANKS!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You are looking for a small camo'd container. You do not have to walk around in the ivy or clim&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; on anything to get it. The most you will need to do to find the cache is to step over a log or two. There's a steep staircase down (and &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;ack up!) to the &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;each which is why we rated the terrain a little higher. There is parking near&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;y, see additional waypoint. As parents, we always try to include space for trading whenever possible to keep the kids happy, we have tucked a little lock n lock of toys (with lots of &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;alloons!) next to the cache. &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;YOP. Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;

I couldn't&lt;br /&gt;get readings better than 6 meters, so you may need to use the hints&lt;br /&gt;to help zero in on the right spots. Please take care to re-hide&lt;br /&gt;each stage for the next seeker. Please don't reveal any secrets in&lt;br /&gt;your logs, even if encrypted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The cache container is a medium sized camouflaged lock and lock&lt;br /&gt;container. Along with the logbook and pen, there are various trade&lt;br /&gt;items and a first finder’s prize. Thank you for hunting our latest!</groundspeak:long_description>

Be sure to record the number on the underside of the lid, it will help you find the final Birds of Victoria cache. The cache is hidden in Mount Douglas Park and can be reached via existing trails. There a few diffent ways to get there. I have included waypoints for the nearest public parking lot and trailhead. The cache is about 2km roundtrip from the parking waypoint. Do not park in the private parking closer to the cache. GPS is jumpy at GZ. *Pink flagging above cache* Be sure to check out the woodpecker tree at GZ! Please rehide the cache well. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

Fergie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and, together, we are the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regal Beagle Babes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. We
come to this off-leash trail several times every week to walk our
human assistants. There are often a lot of other dogs on the trail
and we like to greet them with our &quot;Beagle-bay&quot; and a little circle
dance before the standard canine meet &amp; greet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are
a few side trails along this section of the Shell Road trail and
that's where you'll find this cache. It is an 800ml Lock &amp; Lock
with a funny paint job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best place to park is at the
south foot of Shell Road.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is our favorite beach. We
     come here a lot to swim, play stick, swim, chase the waves,
     swim, dig holes and, if we're really lucky, roll around in a
     nice juicy dead fish before we go for a swim. We like this
     place 'cause there's usually nobody around and we can have the
     beach all to ourselves. The people that hang out with us like
     to watch the resident hawks and other birds, pick blackberries
     and throw sticks into the water for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our beach is nicely hidden away
     on the banks of the mighty Fraser River. There is a very
     short, very narrow and very steep path leading down to the
     beach from the dyke. The tide can come up quite far here, but
     you can usually scramble over a few logs and get to a dry bit
     of sand. We like it best at low tide. You will too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best
place to park your car is at N49°09.268' W123°00.770'. The cache is
a 1.5L Lock &amp; lock container. Please rehide it exactly as you
found it - don't underestimate how high the tide can rise here.

&lt;p&gt;This is Bob and Bogey's most excellent
final resting place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they
weren't romping on the beach at Bob &amp; Bogey's Excellent Beach or at
Bob &amp; Bogey's Other Excellent Beach, this
was their favorite forest walk. Over the years they were coming
here, they spent many joyous hours crashing through the bushes
chasing squirrels or coyotes or just galloping along the
trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the
lads have now passed on to the Happy Hunting Ground. Bogey, a 120
lb. lab/newfoundlander cross, passed over during the summer of
2008. Bob, a 90 lb. shepherd/heeler cross, passed just a few days
after Christmas 2009. Both were unique individuals who made a
big impression on everyone they met. They were very special to us
and will be missed immensely. Their ashes are spread along the
trails of this park, the bulk of them in the immediate vicinity of
the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is
located in a little known, little used gem of a park. The entrance
is off Jacombs Rd, just north of Westminster Hwy and can be easy to
miss. The cache itself is a 3L round, unpainted plastic container
hidden in a small clearing just off the main trail. It is well
camoflaged. Please rehide it exactly as you found it. There is a
pair of binoculars in the cache for the First-To-Find - no trade
required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We all have
them.&lt;br /&gt;
 Lurking in our CD collections.&lt;br /&gt;
 We don't always know how some of them got there.&lt;br /&gt;
 But there they are.&lt;br /&gt;
 Sometimes they're annoying.&lt;br /&gt;
 Sometimes they can even be embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;
 You know the ones I mean.&lt;br /&gt;
 But there they sit.&lt;br /&gt;
Taking up space.&lt;br /&gt;
Never to be played again.&lt;br /&gt;
But what do you do with them?&lt;br /&gt;
Make them into coasters?&lt;br /&gt;
Some sort of misguided art project?&lt;br /&gt;
We have the solution...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is
a camo-painted ammo can stocked with bad CD's donated by friends
and family. Some of them are really bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final
coordinates will take you to an obvious clue. From that clue, the
cache is located in the bushes a couple of meters to the NNW.
Please be sure the cache is not visible from either direction on
the trail when you re-hide the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can
approach the cache from either direction on the trail. The short
way is usually wet, mucky and a bit overgrown. The longer way is
much drier and less overgrown. You decide.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Music
CD's only.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trade
even and take only as many CD's as you leave.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't
leave homemade or copied CD's.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't
leave any trade items other than bad CD's. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/b&gt; Please note that we
cannot be held responsible if your significant other actually likes
one of the CD's.

  &lt;p&gt;The cache was originally planned as a 'memorial cache' to celebrate the completion 
    a GeoTeaming corporate team building event. During the course of the event, 
    one of our team members received a phone call informing him that his youngest 
    brother had suddenly passed away and that his presence, on the other side 
    of the country, was required immediately. During the event debriefing, the 
    team decided that the memorial cache should instead be placed in memory of 
    our friend's brother. Therefore, this cache is dedicated to our friend Michael, 
    and his brother Murray.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The cache is a 1 liter Lock &amp; Lock container. The original contents consist 
    of a single personal item from each of the team members. The cache is located 
    in the Burnaby Foreshore Park less than a meter from the trail.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another one of our
     favorite beaches. Of course we like to come here to swim, play
     stick, chase the waves, and dig holes but we especially like
     to come here because there are so many other dogs here for us
     to meet and play with. There are also a whole bunch of trails
     in the woods next to the beach for us to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; There is a large parking lot
     with a boat launch ramp that can be pretty busy on sunny
     weekends. Once you leave the parking lot a long, sandy beach
     opens up before you. Be sure to bring your dogs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is
a 700 ml camo Lock &amp; lock container and his hidden well off the
beach. There is a special prize for the First-To-Find.&lt;/p&gt;

Cache is in good shape.  Wouldn't worry about snakes.  Vancouver doesn't have any poisonous ones.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">(corrected on January 21st, 2012)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hello Opencachers,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, I'm still stuck in the Arctic waiting for the Russians, and still no closer to finding out more about my uncle (for background on my story, see my first cache called &quot;Coins and bills...&quot; by clicking my name).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The good news is, my friend has sent me a description of another cache that he deciphered from my uncle's logs, I hope you can help me by finding it.  It's supposed to be a tennis ball can that contains a clue to my uncle's zodiac sign, I'd like to know what it is.  It also contains an item he played with in university a lot, and an unopened toy.  First to find gets to keep any one of the three items, subsequent finds can trade for one or both of the other two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a three-stage cache in the Wreck beach area of Vancouver.  Wreck beach is probably the city's prettiest beach, but it's also a clothing-optional beach that's closed from sunset to 8AM, and closed to dogs from March 1st to September 30.  Unless you're willing to look for this cache in the buff, I suggest you go on a cold and/or very rainy day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FIRST STAGE:&lt;br/&gt;Christina Joy Thompson died much too young,&lt;br/&gt;Two decades with us and now she's gone.&lt;br/&gt;Subtract 1878 from the year of her birth to get W,&lt;br/&gt;Subtract 1960 from the year of her death to get X.&lt;br/&gt;Find the second stage at:&lt;br/&gt;49N 15'53.W&quot;&lt;br/&gt;123W 15'51.X&quot;&lt;br/&gt;(DD MM' SS.ss&quot; notation)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SECOND STAGE:&lt;br/&gt;From this spot look South by South-West&lt;br/&gt;And put your eyes to the test.&lt;br/&gt;Count the white buoys in a row&lt;br/&gt;Then to the cache you'll know how to go.&lt;br/&gt;If you know that your eyes are weak&lt;br/&gt;Bring some binoculars to have a peek.&lt;br/&gt;Y is the number of buoys plus 45&lt;br/&gt;And Z is the number of buoys minus 5.&lt;br/&gt;Find the cache at:&lt;br/&gt;49N 16'05.Y&quot;&lt;br/&gt;123W 15'47.Z&quot;&lt;br/&gt;(DD MM' SS.ss&quot; notation)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck! And let me know what zodiac sign my uncle was born under, it will be a valuable clue to help me solve his disappearance.  And by the way, beaches are always more interesting at low tide: http://www.dairiki.org/tides/daily.php/van&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WokeUpDead    </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Awesome, I'm glad my corrected instructions worked.  Don't worry about the trade items, just try to find some small &quot;junk&quot; (tools, souvenirs, toys, trinkets) around your house that other people might find interesting or useful; a lanyard is a good idea.  A lot of cachers do this just for the find and don't take or leave anything anyway.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So sorry Garminbiy, instructions corrected now.  Looks like you found the first stage, that should have been easy.  Maybe you found the second stage too, I simply labeled the coordinates with the incorrect letters: I had W49 N123 instead of N49 W123, you probably spotted that.  But the third stage was too messed up, I think it actually led back to the first coordinates.  I had the coordinates correct in my notes, but made mess of transcribing them to this site.  Should be all good now, I hope you enjoyed Wreck beach anyway.</groundspeak:text>

Went about again on this one, still no luck - can you verify if the cache is still there?
Heavy muggle/homeless activity in the vicinity leads me to suspect it may no longer be there.

In the early 1900's with the coming of the railway, the inlet was dammed at Main st. and the flats were drained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the great depression, a hobo shack town existed in this location. The shack town was eventually taken down by the city and thus began the birth of the area as a park. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During WWII, the park was used as a military training field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The community gardens have developed from this rich history!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

The container lid is already broken (wasn't me!) and the cache was full of water.  I placed the box upside down in the hope that it will stay dryer.

Although we didn't set any records (it took us 2 hours and 31 minutes)it was quite a satisfying accomplishment for a couple of old, out-of-shape folks.  I am surprised at how many people who have lived here years and years have never done it so I challenge all of you to try instead of taking the gondola to the top.</groundspeak:long_description>

If my co-ords are too far off please let me know!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have hidden a few caches around Squamish and Hope and most of them are geared towards geokids.  I place them fairly strategically so they are easy to access, not too far of a walk and filled with items that mostly kids would enjoy finding!  This cache is to replace one I had in Brackendale called &quot;Changing Seasons&quot; which I've disabled.  The area is set to be clearcut to allow for a new housing development :(&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a Loonie for the FTF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache contains:&lt;br/&gt;Fishing tool&lt;br/&gt;Thank You cards&lt;br/&gt;Bubble Wands&lt;br/&gt;Iron-On Patches (Feel free to take more than one!)&lt;br/&gt;Geocaching Buttons&lt;br/&gt;Beads (Fit Chamalia bracelets)&lt;br/&gt;Walrus Geocoin (Wants to travel to Ontario!)&lt;br/&gt;Mary Kay Peach Scented Hand Lotion&lt;br/&gt;Deep Woods Bug Repellent&lt;br/&gt;And whatever additional items I can find before I leave the house ;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CONGRATS TO HURLEYBIRD!!

greatest resources. Currently 14.26% (13.5 million hectares) of
British Columbia's land base is protected. There are more than 340
campgrounds, 6000 km of hiking trails, 118 boat launches and 263
day-use areas in B.C.'s provincial park system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BC Parks and the BC Geocaching Association are partnered along
with the Year of Science to invite you to explore BC Parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of 100 caches placed in parks throughout BC. Each
cache will have a unique trackable geocoin available for the first
3 finders. There are also BC Parks trade items, BC Geocaching
Association buttons, and Year of Science pins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a maximum of one coin per Geocaching account. Please
trade fairly for all items in the cache. If you have a coin from
another cache, please leave it for another cacher - you would want
them to do the same for you.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/eskers/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ESKERS
PARK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eskers Provincial Park is a day-use park located 40 km northwest
of Prince George. Encompassing 3,979 hectares of gently rolling
terrain and many small lakes, the park conserves a portion of the
40 km long Stuart River Eskers Complex. These unique land forms,
for which the park is named, are long sinuous gravel ridges. They
were created when sand and gravel were deposited in the meltwater
channels of ancient glaciers that once blanketed this northern
region. Visitors can enjoy walking and hiking, canoeing, fishing,
nature study and wildlife viewing. In the winter the summer hiking
trails are turned into an excellent network for snow-shoeing and
cross-country skiing enthusiasts. A 3 km beginners loop is located
just off the Pine Marsh parking area. For an additional challenge
and exercise, skiers can enjoy the 6 km trail to Kathie Lake.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;There are activities going on in BC Parks all year to celebrate
this wonderful anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2011 is also the Year of Science in BC.&lt;br /&gt;
There are events and a collection of interesting stories about
people who chose Science.&lt;/p&gt;
Here is the list of all the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/bookmarks/view.aspx?guid=ed6ac827-f22b-401a-8f87-e65ef1560a9e&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 


&lt;p&gt;This cache promotes active living and environmentally friendly
geocaching. In order&lt;br /&gt;
 to place this cache, we walked through the extensive trails of
this park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is hidden in a BC Park. BC Parks supports&lt;br /&gt;
 geocaching!
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcgeocaching.com/pdf/BC_Parks_Geocaching_Policy.pdf&quot;&gt;
Here&lt;/a&gt; is a link to the BC Parks geocaching policies,&lt;br /&gt;
 please familiarize yourself with them. Through cooperation
with&lt;br /&gt;
 BC Parks, we can keep geocaching a fun and supported activity
in&lt;br /&gt;
 BC's Provincial Parks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these caches, you'll find some ProjectBlueSky geocoins
for&lt;br /&gt;
 the first finders. Please only take one... if you have one
from&lt;br /&gt;
 another cache, please leave them for other people. There are
also&lt;br /&gt;
 some other pins and swag from BC Parks, BCGA and Project Blue
Sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Park Info&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eskers Provincial Park
is a day-use park located 40 km northwest of Prince George.
Encompassing over 1600 hectares of gently rolling terrain and many
small lakes, the park conserves a portion of the 40 km long Stuart
River Eskers Complex. These unique land forms, for which the park
is named, are long sinuous gravel ridges. They were created when
sand and gravel were deposited in the meltwater channels of ancient
glaciers that once blanketed this northern region. Visitors can
enjoy walking and hiking, canoeing, fishing, nature study and
wildlife viewing. In the winter the summer hiking trails are turned
into an excellent network for snow-shoeing and cross-country skiing
enthusiasts. A 3 km beginners loop is located just off the Pine
Marsh parking area. For an additional challenge and exercise,
skiers can enjoy the 6 km trail to Kathie Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Conservation&lt;/strong&gt; - The
thick layer of soil left in the wake of the glaciers supports a
mixed forest of aspen, lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir with some
spruce in the southern reaches of the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wildlife&lt;/strong&gt; - Eskers Park
is an ideal &quot;outdoor classroom&quot; for those wishing to study the
array of birds and mammals who make their home in the wetlands
among the eskers. One of the most prominent residents is the
beaver, whose industry is obvious along most of the lakeside
trails. The park's diverse forest and numerous lakes provide
excellent habitat for a wide variety of wildlife such as moose,
deer, black bear, squirrels, grouse and abundant
waterfowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Park
Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 3979 hectares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://bcgeocaching.com&quot;&gt;British Columbia
