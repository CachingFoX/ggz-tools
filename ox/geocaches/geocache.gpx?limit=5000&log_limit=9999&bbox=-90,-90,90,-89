I take a picnic lunch break here from time to time on mild sunny days. It is such a short hop from where I work sometimes I just can't resist getting away from the office.

Bring the kids and a picnic to enjoy this hunt even more. You may want to take the Stennis Sphere Tour while you are here. You can also checkout the nearby construction of the new Infinity Science Center.

Please ensure that cap is securely in place and return exactly as found. Thank you and good luck!</groundspeak:long_description>

The prize was donated by Ronbo (thanks Ronbo!). Originally not intended to be a cache; I made a few modifications to it and now it's a neat little hide. This should be a quick p-n-g for those that like that sort of thing. Still, ThingOne hopes it is just sneaky enough for you to enjoy the hunt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located along the public sidewalk outside the Live Oak Cemetery in Pass Christian, MS. The cemetery is the final resting place of at least 12 former town mayors. You will also recognize several of the family names here, such as Calvart, Heirn, Henderson, and Shipman; all founders of Pass Christian. Many of the main streets in the area bear their name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cemetery was ravaged by Camille &amp; Katrina. Some photos of the aftermath of Katrina can be found at http://katrinapics.passchristian.net/live_oak_cemetery.htm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please use stealth and care when hunting this cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;We would not want to disturb ANY inhabitants in the area&lt;/i&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the new and improved Bay Saint Louis Bridge!

The original Bay Bridge was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. During the months after Katrina, a ferry service carried automobiles back and forth from the Bay St. Louis side to the Pass Christian side of the Bay.

The debris from the original bridge was used to form a fishing reef just outside the mouth of the Bay. The locals call it &quot;Gene Taylor Reef&quot; after a local US congressman at the time.

With the construction of the new bridge, artists were commissioned to create artwork that reflects coastal MS life. These works of art are placed along a walking track that runs the entire two miles of the bridge.

To log this cache, you must find the bronze relief art that depicts the mermaid. &lt;b&gt;The code phrase for this cache is the name of the object in her right hand.&lt;/b&gt;

Parking is available on either side of the Bridge, but there is a nice playground for the kids at the Pass Christian side. Enjoy the walk, the art, and the view!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">ThingTwo wanted to be mean and chose this spot for a cache. When we hid this cache (a couple of years after Katrina) the park was the temporary housing (trailers) for many local business and government offices. The park is finally returning to normal.

An interesting bit of history on this hide:
Originally, this was a really mean hide that required a well prepared cacher to retrieve. Some of these cachers took pity on the next guy and made it a little easier to spot. Well, that also helped the muggles spot it so the container disappeared a couple of times. I decided to rethink the hide.

As I probed around the area looking for an alternative, I spotted another cache container. I opened it and discovered it was a pre-Katrina hide (although some new people had been logging it as ThingOne's hide). It was just two feet away from ThingOne's placement. The original hider, a local legend, had assumed that the container was lost during Katrina since the whole area got covered by storm surge. It survived and the log was still sign-able!

As a tribute to the ruggedness of both the container and the people of the Gulf Coast, I've kept this hide just as it was before &quot;The Storm&quot;.</groundspeak:long_description>

The &lt;b&gt;title&lt;/b&gt; refers to one of three petrified monuments in the cemetery. I had never seen this type of marker before and thought it was kinda cool. I looked them up on the web and got a little history about the organization that placed them. The organization is still around today. You may want to check it out online--that is &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; you visit the cache and know what the heck I'm talking about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located: &lt;b&gt;367 feet&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;112m&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;b&gt;East&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;87°&lt;/i&gt;) of the monument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I give this an elevated difficulty because waypoint projection or a compass is required.

 There are two places in Madison County where the ground elevation
is over 490 FT. This is one of them. The other is in the south part
of the county where the Natchez Trace has their radio tower (and it
is not on the actual parkway). This cache is named after the
geological survey marker located near this cache, which in turn is
named after the family that owned the land when the marker was
established and was one of the original families to settle in the
area. This cache is located on the ground and no climbing of any of
the structures nearby should be attempted. Be careful if you drive
up on the hill. One of the turnaround locations has a concrete
benchmark that you don't want to hit with your vehicle (N32 49.244
W90 46.231).</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well I found it, but it took a little work. The 1st stage seemed to point at the pavillion, so I went to the displays there but didn't find the answers. So I took the date from the only marker close by that had one. Next discovered I hadn't a clue what a &quot;sequential ordinal value&quot; was. Nothing a tried gave an answer I could subtract 29 from. Finally reached a lifeline and as I was talking to him a little light bulb finally glowed dimmly in my mind about what number I actually needed. After confirming that this was probably right I struck out for the final with my trusty umbrella in the pouring rain. Arrived at the general area the hard way and immediately realized there was an easier way. Began the search in an area that offered few obvious hiding spots. Finally expanded my search about 35 feet and hit a likely spot, but had a new problem. Poison ivy. Lots of it. Well balancing my umbrella on my shoulder with my chin and probing with two sticks finally revealed the cache, but it still took almost 10 minutes to work it out of its hiding spot under the evil plants using the sticks and umbrella.

Boo Boo had just returned from vacation, and he seemed&lt;br/&gt;to have a lot on his little mind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yogi Bear:&lt;/b&gt;  Hey, Boo&lt;br/&gt;Boo!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boo Boo:&lt;/b&gt; Hey,&lt;br/&gt;Yogi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; Hey, little buddy, you don't&lt;br/&gt;seem very happy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB&lt;/b&gt;:  I'm not, Yogi.  I&lt;br/&gt;spent several hours stuck in Memphis on a layover flight, and I had&lt;br/&gt;to watch TV the whole time.  Mostly what was on was reruns of&lt;br/&gt;the TV show &quot; Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&quot;.  It got me to&lt;br/&gt;thinking...  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; About what, little&lt;br/&gt;buddy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt; Oh, I don't know.  Those&lt;br/&gt;people win a lot of money, and they do it in only an hour.  I&lt;br/&gt;knew a lot of the answers, and I think I could do it.   I&lt;br/&gt;think I could be a contender. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; Now, now, little&lt;br/&gt;buddy...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt; No, Yogi, don't try to talk me&lt;br/&gt;out of this.  All I need to do is study a little bit. &lt;br/&gt;With enough money, I could buy the entire &lt;i&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;series of movies, maybe even meet my hero, Mr. George Lucas. &lt;br/&gt;I've always thought &lt;i&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/i&gt; was the first Lucas prime&lt;br/&gt;movie.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; Now, Boo Boo, don't get your&lt;br/&gt;head all filled up with nonsense...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB: &lt;/b&gt; It's not nonsense,&lt;br/&gt;Yogi.  I started watching the news, and learned all kinds of&lt;br/&gt;neat stuff abut the U.S. Supreme Court, and science stuff. &lt;br/&gt;Did you know there's a move underway to get Pluto kicked out of the&lt;br/&gt;planetary lineup?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt;  Yeah, sure, Boo Boo,&lt;br/&gt;but...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt; No, Yogi, my mind is made&lt;br/&gt;up.  I'm going on that show.  I've got to improve my math&lt;br/&gt;knowledge some, you know, junk like the number of Stern primes, and&lt;br/&gt;the divisors of sphenic numbers, and such, but I can do this. &lt;br/&gt;I &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; I can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; Little buddy, you're setting&lt;br/&gt;yourself up for a big disappointment....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt; No, I'm not.  I'm not&lt;br/&gt;some dumb bunny like that goofus in Beatle Bailey.  No, I can&lt;br/&gt;do this.  I can take that TV show like the apocalyptic&lt;br/&gt;horsemen, and I'll make lots and lots of money, and never have to&lt;br/&gt;steal a picnic basket again!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; Pic-a-nic baskets?  You&lt;br/&gt;don't like pic-a-nic baskets any more, BooBoo?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt; I still love them, Yogi. &lt;br/&gt;I just can't take the day in and day out struggle of trying to&lt;br/&gt;dodge Mr. Ranger, and getting rid of the used up baskets is a&lt;br/&gt;chore.  Besides, you always get the good stuff, and I end up&lt;br/&gt;with the crumbs.  I'm tired of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; But Boo&lt;br/&gt;Boo...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt; I'm firm on this, Yogi. &lt;br/&gt;Living in this park gives me the dickens.  After I win the TV&lt;br/&gt;show, I'm moving to one of the cities and get me a high-rise&lt;br/&gt;apartment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; But you won't make it in the&lt;br/&gt;big city, little buddy.  You won't get past the second square,&lt;br/&gt;I mean, the second city block without being so homesick you'll want&lt;br/&gt;to move back home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt;  Yogi, you got to have&lt;br/&gt;faith.  Besides, if I win, I'll take you to see Stone&lt;br/&gt;Mountain, or maybe even that big amusement park near&lt;br/&gt;there.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt;  Park?  They have a&lt;br/&gt;park in Georgia?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt; Oh, yes, Yogi!  It's&lt;br/&gt;huge, and they have.......&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; PIC-A-NIC BASKETS?  Do&lt;br/&gt;they have pic-a-nic baskets, little buddy?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt; You bet they do,&lt;br/&gt;Yogi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; Um......  Can I help you&lt;br/&gt;study?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;cache INFORMATION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No hints will be given the first five&lt;br/&gt;days of publication.  &quot;Fluff&quot; notes on the cache listing are&lt;br/&gt;subject to deletion.  Working on the puzzle as a team is&lt;br/&gt;fine.  If you solve  the puzzle, please keep the answer&lt;br/&gt;and the solution method to yourself.  No climbing is necessary&lt;br/&gt;at any point.  The cache is not at the posted coordinates, you&lt;br/&gt;must derive the correct coordinates by some other method. The trick&lt;br/&gt;is to figure out the method. No safecracking skills are&lt;br/&gt;needed.  A hike is involved, but it should not be an obstacle&lt;br/&gt;for a person with average mobility.  No cleats are needed.&lt;br/&gt;Once at the cache location, the time between leaving your vehicle&lt;br/&gt;and returning to your vehicle should not exceed 20 minutes. &lt;br/&gt;Permission to place this cache has been obtained. No fences need to&lt;br/&gt;be crossed. Dogs are permitted.  There may be benchmarks in&lt;br/&gt;the area.   Flying pests such as mosquitoes or wasps may&lt;br/&gt;be present in the warmer months. This paragraph contains no&lt;br/&gt;information pertinent to the puzzle solution. Who's on first. &lt;br/&gt;What's on second. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check your&lt;br/&gt;answers for this puzzle on&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geochecker.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Click To Rate This Cache&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: BB1EZPN - Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;This spot is at one leg of an abandoned fire tower.</groundspeak:long_description>

We came upon one of my favorite spots along this&lt;br/&gt;stretch of lonely county road, and I realized it needed a&lt;br/&gt;geocache.  This area is rich in history.  Not far from&lt;br/&gt;this spot is the old town of Chestnut Log, now long gone. &lt;br/&gt;Even the remnants of the last church disappeared some years&lt;br/&gt;ago.  Also nearby is the site of an intense battle between the&lt;br/&gt;Oktibbeha Plowboys and Union forces in the War Between The&lt;br/&gt;States.  This stretch of road is prominent on an 1860 map of&lt;br/&gt;the area, and except for the pavement, is pretty much as it was&lt;br/&gt;140+ years ago.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Near the cache&lt;br/&gt;location&lt;/b&gt; is a spot Ole Miss fans will really&lt;br/&gt;appreciate.  It is the final resting place of a Mr.&lt;br/&gt;Sanford.  His plot is adorned with the likeness of Ole Miss's&lt;br/&gt;Col. Reb, as well as a small Col. Reb figurine.  Apparently he&lt;br/&gt;was quite an Oxford fan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache container&lt;br/&gt;contains&lt;/b&gt; a log book and a pen. There's room for small&lt;br/&gt;travel bugs.  Please re-conceal the container just as it was&lt;br/&gt;found.  &lt;b&gt;Please be discrete, as&lt;br/&gt;country-muggles may not comprehend what you're up&lt;br/&gt;to.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Click To Rate This Cache

 There is a historical marker located a little further south along this highway which became known as King's Road.

The cache is a simple magnetic keybox. Hope you enjoy the visit and the history lesson.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Hillcrest Cemetery of Holly Springs, Mississippi established sometime in the 1830’s is as beautiful as it is historically rich and is known as “Little Arlington” because of the numerous and distinguished veterans that are buried there. There are two beautiful memorials honoring the veterans of the Confederate States of America. There is also a memorial honoring the Catholic clergy who gave their lives in the service of caring for the sick of Holly Springs during the Yellow Fever outbreak in the 1870’s. Some of the notable buried here are; 
-ten Confederate Generals
-a veteran of the Alamo (KIA of course)
-a veteran of the Mexican War (KIA)
-a veteran that was one of the first eleven servicemen taken as prisoners of war in France during WWI
-the Colonel that commanded the defense of Vicksburg during the Civil War
-numerous Civil War veterans
-the first black man to serve as Senator for the State of Mississippi
-six Catholic nuns and one Catholic priest that died treating the sick during the Yellow Fever epidemic in
the 1870’s

There are so many old and beautiful grave markers in this cemetery that you really should allow extra time to visit the whole site and while your at it visit the Marshall County Historical Museum to learn more about Holly Springs rich history.

Closed from 5p.m. to 7a.m. daily.

Take a camera for cover and act like a tourist while you sign the log. Watch out for muggles!

Please return cache as found and bring your own pen and HAVE FUN!</groundspeak:long_description>

The citizens of Holly Springs, led by Catholic clergy, cared for hundreds of fever stricken people and in the end paid a heavy price. Hundreds of Holly Springs citizens died of the Yellow Fever including six of the Catholic nuns and one priest who were running the hospital caring for the sick. This is a museum dedicated to this part of Holly Spring's history.</groundspeak:long_description>

IS NOT AT THE LISTED COORDINATES ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats
to Jaybirder on the FTF!!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Background:&lt;br/&gt;

     While completing some comunity service at this
location I could not help but notice that there was NO cache here.
So after explaning the game to the Shelter Director. She gave me
permission to place a cache here. You may even run into the cache
placer if he is out volunteering.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The
Shelter's Mission:&lt;br/&gt;
      To ensure the safety, health, and welfare
needs of the people and animals of the Town of Collierville by
responsibly and humanely enforcing animal related laws; providing
nourishment, medical care, and a safe enviroment for unwanted,
stray, abused, and impounded animals; educating the public about
responsible pet ownership; finding new loving homes for the
adoptable animals at the shelter; and providing a humane euthanasia
to thoes animals that are not adoptable due to aggression or health
concerns.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The
Puzzle:&lt;br/&gt;
The above coords will lead you to one of the entrances to the
Collierville Animal Shelter. Once there you will need to find out
the answer to 6 simple questions.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
(1.) How many laps around the lake
will it take to walk aprox. 1 mile?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 1, then A=6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 2, then A=4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 3, then A=2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 4, then A=0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
(2.) While walking around the lake
observe and note the number of fire hydrants visible. How many did
you see?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 4, then B=4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 3, then B=0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 6, then B=6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 2, then B=9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
(3.) Also, while walking around the
lake observe and note the number of concrete light posts are
visible. How many did you see?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 10, then C=9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 12, then C=1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 6, then C=3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 9, then C=7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
(4.) After you count the number of
concrete light posts. Make note there is only one with two lights
atop of it. There is a silver plate on the pole. What is the number
stamped into the plate?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 163471, then
D=2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 163741, then
D=8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 163417, then
D=0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 136471, then
D=4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
(5.) There is one tree dedicated to
a person. Locate this tree. What type of tree is it?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Maple, then
E=3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Oak, then E=1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Pine, then
E=9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Ceder, then
E=7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
(6.) Ok, I ran out of creative
questions. Last one. How many total parking spaces are
there?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 23, then F=0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 25, then F=6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 24, then F=8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 22, then F=4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The
Cache:&lt;br/&gt;
      You are looking for a large camouflaged
lock-n-lock. If there are any cats around please do not try to pet them!!
They are feral cats. More than likely they will run before you even
see them. Yes, this cache is avaible 24/7 but it is strongly
recommended that you attempt this find during the daylight hours.
The shelter staff know about this cache and should not bother
you.&lt;br/&gt;
The cache is NOT in any flower bed!!&lt;br/&gt;

A few
tidbits about the shelter:&lt;br/&gt;


Shelter
Hours
The hours posted are for the public to
come and see our wonderful pets, and my change with special events.
However, staff, volunteers, and community service workers are there
from 8am to 5pm. If you would like more info on how to volunteer
please inquire within. I will try to keep some flyers in the cache
about the shelter and the volunteer program. Volunteers help the
shelter in many ways. You can help walk dogs, love on the cats,
help with adoptions, assist with special event fundraisers.

&lt;br/&gt;
This cache is intended to be a bit challenging. Nothing you
seasoned pros will have any trouble with, I am just trying to make
you work for this smiley face a bit. You can park several places,
and approach from several ways. It is near a path but not a
well-worn one. And it is well hidden. PLEASE, WHEN YOU ARE DONE, BE SURE TO HIDE IT
AS WELL AS IT WAS WHEN YOU FOUND IT; the challenge is part
of the fun of this cache.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
You are looking for a 7.62 cal. ammo can with log and the typical
tradeables. In season, bring some bug spray along as you
will need it.
***Remember this cache is part of &quot;The Whodunit Multicache,&quot; so
please make note of the CLUE game card fastened to the inside ammo
can lid. PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE CARD FROM THE CACHE***&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Hear the words of the Great Teacher:&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;The seed that fell among thorns
stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are
choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not
mature&quot; (Luke 8:14).
&lt;br/&gt;
Don’t let that which passes away choke out that which really
matters.&lt;br/&gt;

DO NOT REMOVE THE CARD FROM THE CACHE

***PLEASE MAKE NOTE OF THE &quot;CLUE&quot; GAME CARD IN THE CACHE, BUT LEAVE THE CARD IN THE CACHE*** 

My Geocaching obsession began nine months ago in Shelby Farms, so I return to this wonderful piece of paradise we are so blessed to have in Memphis.  This cache is a par 5 &quot;golf&quot; style multicache. Start at the first &quot;hole&quot; and &quot;tee off&quot; to one of the holes listed on the first tag. The object is to find the final stage in the fewest number of searches.    

There are 7 golf &quot;holes&quot; scattered around Shelby Farms, all north of Walnut Grove and east of Farm Road.  At six of the seven &quot;holes&quot; you will find traditional micro containers, each containing a tag with three sets of coordinates.  These are to stay with the micros, of course.  Each coordinate has been assigned an arbitrary icon (i.e., airplane, telephone, bell, smiley face, cross, and star) so that you can use the hints below, if need be.  Eventually you will be lead to a seventh &quot;hole&quot; where you will find the final stage, a 7.62 cal. ammo can.  The only log will be in this box.  

Score: As with all golf games, you need to keep score. This course that I've made is a par 5, meaning that a good golfer/cacher should be able to find the cache in 5 searches. (Good of course, really means lucky, which seems to be the case in both Golf and Geocaching.)  It is possible to find the final stage in only four searches. Each &quot;hole&quot; you find (including the first one) counts as a stroke. You can deviate from the current hole that you are on and select a different coordinate from a previous hole, but this is really a &quot;lost ball&quot; and will cost you a stroke. The same penalty is incurred if you cannot find a hole at all and decide to take a different coordinate. There are no dead ends in this course, but you might end up navigating back in a loop to a hole that you've already found. You will need to count this hole a second time. The best score possible on this course is a 4 (birdie; 1 under par), although I expect a lot more bogies (6), double bogies (7), etc. Please note your score and any other golf related stories in your log. 

The final stage contains the typical tradeables, a golf ball in keeping with the theme of the cache, a Yellow Jeep TB, and your very own &quot;Canadian Bear&quot; if you wish. ***Don't forget to make note of the &quot;Clue&quot; card in the cache for &quot;The Whodunit Multicache.&quot;  Leave the card in the cache.***

I wore shorts while placing all stages, so you could to.  If you drive to different places in the park to get close to various &quot;holes,&quot; you are looking at about a mile round trip.  If you decide to walk or ride everything you are talking about more like 3 miles.  

Thanks to &quot;Centennial Park Scramble&quot; by fizbot in my birthplace of Toronto, Ontario, Canada for the idea for this cache.

 General Watkins Conservation Area can be reached driving on Hwy.61 south of Benton,MO. There is access on Hwy.77 south of Oran,MO also. Hwy.61 has four access points. This cache is the first access road south 2.2mi. from Benton,MO off Hwy.61. Look for a gravel road with a small Conservation Area and Camping Area sign at the entrance. Drive at a moderate speed since the road is hard to spot. Once on the gravel road travel SLOWLY to the first Conservation Area parking lot. The road is narrow with curves and people live in this area. At the parking lot look for two old barrier posts(both have a old cable attached to them). After locating this cache you can take the Cemetery Ridge Trail to Bushwacker cache if you want to. The trail is about 1 ½ miles long to the cemetery. I suggest going to the MDC website and download the General Watkins CA map or use the map program of your choice because the access roads just suddenly appear as you zoom by. The road to the cache is designated County Park Road. Take the proper precautions during hunting season. Permission granted by Missouri Department of Conservation. Daylight caching preferred. Special thanks to Officer Rocky.This cache can be wheelchair accessible(read hint).BYOP</groundspeak:long_description>

 At General Watkins Conservation Area south of Benton,MO on Hwy.61. This is a camo bison tube cache. Look for a small conservation area and camping sign visible on Hwy.61 to your right if traveling south from Benton,MO. This is County Park Road but the sign says Park Rd. Drive conservatively up this gravel road to the fork and go left. The road to the right is private land. You will arrive at a big parking lot with the campsites visible to the left. The Schlosser Loop Trail is here as well as Lakes 1 and 2. Cache is about 15 yards from Attention Anglers sign. Cache is low and well camoed, I was surprised at how well it blends in. A little bit is visible at the correct tree. BYOP     Permission granted by Missouri Department of Conservation for daytime caching, as long as there is some daylight you’re good to go.

Circuit riding minister, Peter Cartwright, held quarterly meetings in the township. Churches were later established including an old Presbyterian Church on this site. It stood from 1857 to 1936.

Peddlers named the stern rural neighbor to the west of here &quot;Tight Row.&quot; The German neighborhood to the east was known as &quot;Pleasant Row.&quot; The general area was called &quot;The Quiver Land&quot; because a man could make the spongy soil near the creek shake and cause the water to Quiver.

This is a well maintained old cemetery. If you look around, you will find the old out house that once belonged to the church. Please be respectful while you are here and place the cache back the way that you found it. There is no cache hunting from dusk to dawn. You never know what maybe be out there in the dark waiting.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Jan 9th 1400 hrs If you have found this you maybe the last of our kind. My name is Sgt. Z.A. Tripp. I was traveling along 474 heading to Springfield taking Lieutenant Colonel Anna Moody from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institue of Infectious Dieases. We was to deliver a strain for the cure of the infection. We are the last of our convey. 


As we crossed the bridge, we came upon a road jam. Cars and trucks completey blocked both lanes of traffic. As we checked the map for a different route we became surrounded by hundreds of the carriers.
We had to make a plan and make it fast. We was still in the hummer but was not sure how long it would shelter us from them.
I decide that splitting up was our best chose. I was to head south along Rt 29 and Anna would go east to highway 74. With ammo low and two grenades left, we split the sample of the morningstar strain, pulled the pins from the grenades and let them fly. It cleared us a path out of the hummer to get us headed in our different directions. 
Jan 9th 1900hrs
I hope Anna fair better than me. I am holed up in a deserted gas station but I was bitten. There is no hope for me now, I can feel the infection running through my body. I plan on sneaking out in the cover of night to find a place to hide the sample. If anyone finds my journal then please find the sample and get it to the research team in hopes to finding a cure. Without it, we will all be victums of the dead. I know it is too late for me as I will already be one of the undead......

Follow the listed coordinates to start you on your way to the cure........ I left a clue at the listed coordinates. Once you have the starting coordinates, use your flashlight to follow my trail.

Welcome to the Marquette Heights Public Library. Once you find the first stage, go inside, you will be looking for a little black book. 
As you sign the log book, please include a favorite book or story that you have enjoyed. Maybe even a favorite author you have enjoyed. Even tell us about your caching adventures.

Please take a minute and say hello to Katie the librarian if she is there. She helped me out with the labeling and placement of the book. She was excited about the whole idea of this cache.

In the early spring the waterfall is flowing well and is a nice quite place to sit and relax. The creek has cut thru the earth where you can see a seam of coal. The cache is a regular loc-n-loc. It is hidden in the normal caching style. Please rehide as well or better than you had found it.

Thanks you the City of Marquette Hts for allowing the cache.

You are looking for a ammo box. I grew up playing in these woods as a kid. The hill you walk down is called Superman Hill. In the winter we would sled down it. It gets steep towards the creek. I hope you enjoy the cache as it is my first to hide. If the feed back is good you may see more around here. </groundspeak:long_description>

These trails are used mostly by Mountain Bikers so hide the cache as well if not better than you found it. I grew up in this area and played many games out here in these woods.</groundspeak:long_description>

Welcome to the third stage of extreme caching. For the ones who have done the first two classes knows that these caches are not for everyone. If for any reason you get to this class and see that you can not do it, just turn around and go on recess. This isn't your simple park and grab. If you have already passed 101 and 102, this one may be for you. If you are one who copied off of the other students, you may want to think twice. If your up to passing the test, then by all means, come and get it. </groundspeak:long_description>

Morningstar Strain 
Jan 13th 0100 hours
This is Lieutenant Colonel Anna Moody from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institue of Infectious Dieases. If you have found my journal then you are still one of the living and you will know my story.

Four days ago I was traveling east on highway route 474 with Sgt. Z.A. Tripp. When we crossed a bridge we ran upon a road jam. Within minutes we was underseige by the undead. I had once called them carriers but now being on foot and alone I have seen them for what they are, undead souls. It was our plan to split up and go two different routes to try and get a sample of the Morningstar Strain back to the research lab in Springfield.
I can only hope that Sgt.Tripp has fair better than I. As I write in my journal I can feel that I don't have much time left before I become one of them. They are now smarter than we once knew. They are more organized, they are hunting in packs now. I tried to find transportation in town but was quickly over come and now out of ammo. I had to head out to the country side away from the population in town. I took shelter in a park but I was not alone as I thought I might have been. One snuck up on me and in the fight I was bitten. I know I don't have much time before I become one of them so I had to hide the morningstar sample in hopes someone finds this journal and can get it to the research lab for me. Be careful, they are everywhere, I soon will be joining their ranks.............

Location Morton park/ Northwoods
Difficulty: See above
Parking: Either Paved or gravel depending on which lot you select
Time: Sunset to 11PM

This cache is placed to test you. If you don't feel up to the cache don't even try and find it. Anyone that has cached in this area before knows how steep the hills can be. To date, this is the biggest I have found. Be sure to plan you trip right, you may have to bring the right item to retrieve it. Remember, this cache is meant to be hard.

Cache is directly off right-of-way. There is no need to go into the field or onto private property. You should be able to safely park on the side of the road as this is a low-traffic area most times of the day, but be mindful of farm implements in the harvest season. </groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;i&gt;“If you’ve ever seen a store go out of business and
remove the signage from their old building, then you’ve seen
a labelscar. It’s more or less the equivalent of a watch tan
– the mark left on a building where the elements didn’t
take their toll on the facade. But it’s more than that, too.
A labelscar is also a metaphor for the changing world of retailing
in general...”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;www.labelscar.com&quot;&gt;-
Labelscar.com&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constructed in the late ‘80s, Town Center II (Town Centre
I is located across Washington Street, and houses an Aldi, Dollar
General, and other discount stores) was a standard strip mall
anchored by East Peoria’s original Walmart, with additional
smaller stores in the connected structure as well as other
disconnected buildings. Walmart vacated the Town Centre II location
in 1998 when the expanded Walmart Supercenter opened nearby. In
2000, ShopKo, which operates a number of retail stores in small to
mid-size markets, opened a new 90,000 sq. ft. store as Town Centre
II’s new anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, over the next several years ShopKo’s sales
suffered and the chain closed many stores, even exiting some
markets entirely. In late 2006, ShopKo announced that the East
Peoria location would be closed for “economic reasons”,
and in 2007 the building was emptied and has been vacant since; the
property is currently for lease. The other plaza tenants have done
well for the most part, with only a few changes, and have enjoyed
relative success and stability in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

Here volunteers from the Peoria area were prepared for combat in the Civil War.  In all, 536 Peoria County men gave their lives for the preservation of the Union.

This monument marks the location of the camp and is inscribed with the dates of muster for the newly-trained regiments and their commanding officer.

This is a nano in an urban setting.  Some stealth may be required as well as tools to aid in the retrieval.  BYOP.

*Please* replace the cache where it was found, otherwise you defeat the purpose of the original placement.  If it was easier to put back that it was to retrieve, then it's in the wrong place.  Thanks!</groundspeak:long_description>

You are looking for a camo'd plastic container.  It is kid-friendly and should be easy to locate.  Room for small trade items, travel bugs, etc. The container is large enough that it can serve as a TB hotel for trackables travelling through the area.

Please be sure to replace the cache exactly as found in order to keep out of muggle visibility.

Enjoy! </groundspeak:long_description>

strong following for both the &lt;b&gt; St. Louis
Cardinals&lt;/b&gt; and the &lt;b&gt;Chicago
Cubs&lt;/b&gt;. The National League teams have a great division
rivalry. Let's find out which has the best geocachers. &lt;br/&gt; 
 &lt;br/&gt;
 Find the cache, a small container with log, pencil and trading
items, at a baseball field. In your Web log entry, let us know your
favorite team (White Sox fans are OK, too). We'll see which team
scores the most finds. 
&lt;p&gt;No climbing needed. If the terrain confuses your readings, try
approaching from an open area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Placed with permission of the Peoria Park District. Park past
the outfield to avoid muggles. Check the gallery for location
photos.&lt;/p&gt;

The Ronald Reagan Peace Garden -- A Place of Remembrance

In a May 9, 1982 speech at Eureka College, President Reagan challenged the Soviet Union to a new era of negotiations to reduce nuclear arms -- called START. The speech has been labeled &quot;The Beginning of the End of the Cold War.&quot;

To commemorate President Reagan's commitment to world peace and the important 1982 speech he presented at Eureka, the College dedicated the Ronald Reagan Peace Garden in May of 2000. The Peace Garden was a gift to the College from Mr. and Mrs. David J. Vaughan of Peoria Heights, Illinois.

Dedicated on the 18th anniversary of what is known as &quot;The Eureka Speech,&quot; highlights of the Peace Garden include a bust of Mr. Reagan, sculpted by nationally-recognized artist, Lonnie Stewart. In designing the bust, Mr. Stewart commented, &quot;There are many different images of Ronald Reagan but I think the one that's most dear to the hearts of all the millions of Americans who loved him, is that Ronald Reagan smile. A smile of reassurance, of dignity and integrity, and one that we all know and love.&quot; 

The Peace Garden also includes a large remnant of the Berlin Wall. It is only fitting that a piece of the symbolic barrier between East and West that Mr. Reagan helped bring down has found a place at Eureka.</groundspeak:long_description>

You are looking for a container that is somewhat between a micro and small in size. BYOP. There is room for very small TBs or trade items.

Some light bushwhacking may be required in the greener seasons, so
prepare accordingly. Parking is available at the roadside near GZ.
There's a memorial to a departed pet 20 or 30 feet from the cache,
so please don't disturb it - the cache isn't located there. </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;li&gt;Even numbered Doctors have the Longitude.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctor Who is a British science fiction television programme
produced by the BBC. The programme depicts the adventures of a
mysterious and eccentric Time Lord known as the Doctor who travels
through time and space in his time machine, the TARDIS (an acronym
for Time And Relative Dimension(s) In Space), which normally
appears from the exterior to be a blue 1950s British police box.
With his companions, he explores time and space, faces a variety of
foes and saves civilizations, helping people and righting wrongs.
The programme is listed in Guinness World Records as the
longest-running science fiction television show in the world. It
was during the Fourth Doctor's time that the series' fandom took
off, including the first convention in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old
alien, a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, who travels in time
and space in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the
Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body but in
doing so gains a new physical appearance and with it, a distinct
new personality. Tom Baker portrayed the Fourth Doctor from
1974-1981. The Fourth Doctor is a natural bohemian who permanently
left UNIT in order to return to a life of deep universal wandering.
More so than his previous incarnations, he is thrilled by discovery
and adventure. During one of these adventures he acquires the
robotic dog K-9. Galvanized by higher purpose, he is disarmingly
loopy (constantly offering friends and foes jelly babies). To an
extent, the Fourth Doctor is the most unpredictable of his
incarnations, befuddling all with his intelligence, constantly
leaving others wondering if they have his full attention and using
his more off the wall mannerisms against adversaries to distract
them while arranging to take control of the situation. His keen
judge of character also enables him to navigate his way through
situations with new people, helping him to discern friend from foe.
Although like all his selves he prefers his brain over his brawn,
he is a capable swordsman and fighter, following on from the
martial expertise of his immediate former self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite his charm and offbeat humour, the Fourth Doctor is
arguably more aloof and sombre than his previous incarnations. He
could become intensely brooding, serious and even callous, and
would keenly scrutinise his surroundings even when playing the
fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Would you like a jelly baby?&quot; - the Fourth Doctor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always be on the look out for Daleks, Cyberman, Autons, the
Master, Sontarans, Silurians, Slitheen, Ood, Judoon, Weeping Angels
and the occasional Muggle.&lt;/p&gt;

Poplar Lane Park is located along the Illinois River in
Peoria Heights.
If you have not heard of it before, maybe it is because, a few
years ago, the north part held a trailer park and a beach club bar.
The area was cleared due to flooding. The South part remains a
wetland when the river runs over its banks.
More recently, the park has acquired a new playground and other
facilities. While you are there, enjoy the view of the river.
You are looking for a small plastic container holding small
trading items.
River note: During the Spring, the river floods parts of the
park. While the cache is in a safe area, use appropriate caution if
the river is above flood stage.
Placed with permission from the Village of Peoria Heights.

Benchmark LC1335 is located nearby at N40 45.040 W089 33.605. Drive
across the road, and park at Bielfeldt Park.

You are looking for a camoed waterproof money/valuables container. Contains log only, BYOP. There is some room for small items/swag.

Permission obtained from church to place cache here. Please park in their lot using the suggested coordinates below; do not use the private drive to the east. No caching after dark, and also replace cache exactly as found in order to preserve difficulty for the next cacher and avoid muggling.
Good luck and happy caching!

Just another P&amp;G for your numbers, but I guarantee you haven't grabbed one like this before...or maybe you have...who knows? I've been wanting to place a cache here for a while now, and the container is rather apropos for the location, at least if you're into double entendres.

Experienced cachers shouldn't have much trouble finding this one...some stealth may be required depending on the day and time that you attempt to find it.

Please be sure to replace in the exact orientation that it was hidden in order to keep out of view from muggles and also to prevent any water unnecessarily getting into the log, although the container is semi-waterproof by design.</groundspeak:long_description>

Part of my effort to pump up the caches in the rural areas east of Peoria. Take some time to pull off the country roads and enjoy the area as you pass through to or from the big cities.

Cache is a small pill container with log only, so BYOP. It is located on public right-of-way. Bring your stealth suit as the nearby roads are a high traffic area.

Another interesting historical fact surrounding this cache location: when a F4 tornado stormed through here in 2004 and destroyed the original Parsons plant, all of the employees miraculously survived thanks to the foresight of Bob Parsons to include storm shelters in the original design. </groundspeak:long_description>

You are looking for a 35mm film canister; it should be fairly straightforward to find once you are at the target area.

Use caution and stealth when retrieving as traffic on the nearby road is busy most mornings and afternoons.  Shouldn't be a problem if you try not to call much attention to yourself.  Parking is available on the side road to the north.</groundspeak:long_description>

following puzzle in order to determine the actual location of the
cache:

F1 - 3.65
A4 - 390.129
D2 + 15.58
E3 - 125.337

Cache is well hidden at ground zero and will require some minor
climbing to successfully retrieve and replace. Think it through
carefully before approaching. It is meant to be a challenge but not
impossible by any means as long as you are careful with
footing.

You are looking for a small camo'd lock and lock box. Log book
and small pencil included, although you may wish to bring your own
pen. Some swag included for FTF. Room for TBs/small trade
items.

You can check your answers for this puzzle on 
Geochecker.com.</groundspeak:long_description>

The terrain to GZ is pretty sedate but the last few feet may be a challenge, depending on your physical condition. Know your abilities and be safe.

You are looking for a micro that blends in well with its surroundings. BYOP, and watch out for critters/birds that like to nest nearby, lest they fly out and spook ya!

Be sure to replace the cache and camo'ing cover exactly as found to ensure that it stays in place, and to preserve the difficulty rating for the next person.

There is a headstone for Christian Camery who died at the age of 83 that was a in the war of 1812.

As with all cemeteries in my spirit quests, please do not hunt for the caches after dusk and be respectful while you are visiting. The cache is on the outer edge of the cemetery. Please rehide as you found it.

This should be a PNG but bring your own scribbler, and please return cache to its attachment point!


South of this location is the land parcel that was once the Sunset Drive-in. The Sunset was originally named Lin's Air Theatre when it opened in the 1950's. Eventually, the theater took a turn for the worse in its later years during the 1980's. This is partly because the theater had to subject itself to showing pornographic films to attract customers. Those films were shown before laws were enacted that prohibit such films from being shown publicly in this manner now.

Efforts to re-open the drive-in in 2007 as a purely family venue for the enjoyment of citizens of the Stateline area were shot down by the efforts of people who live in the condominiums located near the site.

Info about the Sunset
Screens: 1
Car Capacity: 1000

The screen is still intact and in place over the rise you see to the South past the ticket booths that still can be seen.

Please DO NOT ENTER the fenced off area to the South, obey the No Trespassing signs. Cache is located on Public Right-of-Way. The road this is located on can be heavily traveled at certain times of the day, so some efforts to be stealthy are recommended!

Congrats to rperchen for FTF!!! 
 
This cache is the first of two caches that I will be placing that were spawned by locutos' Cache full of Cache(s) Cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the fourth cache in a series that will educate cachers about some of the businesses and locales in the Rockford Area that have been lost to time.

This should be a PNG but bring your own scribbler, and please return cache to its hiding spot! Also remember: this area is very overrun with muggles... Stealth required!


This parcel of land on the Northwest corner of the busy intersection to the South had at least three different businesses on it at one time before the building that now stands. I know of Murphy's Amoco Gas Station, Rockford Ski Shack, and a doughnut shop.

But today, I bring you here not for those three lost businesses, but for something else on a larger scale that was lost long before...

Fifty to Sixty years ago, Northwest of this place where the large neighborhoods now stand, there used to be nothing but farmland. Within several hundred yards of where you stand to get this cache, the large farm's buildings stood for many years. This particular farm was the Hill-Man Farms Dairy. The farmhouse stood about where the larger apartment buildings are along Harrison, just East of Buckbee Apartments. Also as part of the property, there used to be a Log Cabin further down Harrison where the car wash is now. The farm buildings including the large barn stood about where the smaller apartment buildings and houses are 100 yards West of the cache and North of Beach St. The entire Rolling Green neighborhood to the Northwest, including the land that Rolling Green Elementary School occupies, was created from Hill-Man's pasture lands. An aerial view of the area as it stood in 1948 is the page background and is included in the gallery of images.

The farm had many cattle that had won awards over the years before the farm disappeared. A small tabletop display with photos of some of the award-winning cattle still exists and is on display at Edwards Apple Orchard East in Poplar Grove (NE of Rockford at N42° 23.544, W88° 48.096). Some other historical data like an aerial photo showing the neighborhoods North and South of Harrison are on display as well.

More about the area: On the Southeast corner of the Alpine and Harrison Intersection stands Union Cemetery (aka Starkey Cemetery). The cemetery dates to the 19th Century, and is sometimes a landing spot for out-of-control vehicles. On the Southwest corner is where old Buckbee School used to stand. It's very hard to believe that this intersection used to be out in the country, or even the East end of town like it used to be!

More Trivia: The Swan Hillman Elementary School located within a mile of GZ was not named for the Dairy Farm, it was named for a man that, with three friends, founded Rockford Screw Products (now known as Rockford Products). Some info on Swan Hillman in the Company History of Rockford Products here: Rockford Products Corporation. Oh, the &quot;Watch for Livestock&quot; attribute is a tribute and a joke...

This should be a PNG but bring your own scribbler, and please hide cache as found or better!


West of this location is a restaurant called Alpine View Inn. It has been in this building for a bit of time but the focus on this cache is what this building used to be. This place used to be a Hollywood Dining Center and before that it was a Hollywood Drive In Restaurant. This Drive-In was a popular hang out in the 1960's and 1970's as told to me by natives of Rockford.

I don't know much about the history of this establishment, only that I know that it was there. I originally intended to place this cache at the site of another popular Drive-In within .25 mile of this one called The Alps Root Beer Drive-In. That location is on Charles Street where El Burrito Loco now stands. I didn't think that that location would be really supportive of a cache, so I brought it here.

While I have you here, I can also tell you about the building to the Southeast of the hide. That building is being renovated as a church but before that it was one of Rockford's original Hilander grocery stores. The store moved .60 mile South to a building vacated by Eagle grocery store. Hilander is a Rockford original and has been lost in a sense because the smaller chain was sold to Kroger in the past ten years.

&lt;br/&gt;
Seekers: Be mindful of the streets around the cache location. There
are many one-way streets in the area.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt; Before this parking lot was built, a wooden floor roller skating
rink occupied these grounds. Its name was The Ing Skating Palace.
For many years it stood as a popular place for people to go and was
a hangout most weekend nights. To many of the patrons that
frequented the establishment, it was known simply as &quot;The Ing.&quot; Of
all of the places I have highlighted in the Lost Rockford Series so
far, this is the only place that I actually had been to myself. I
visited once in 1998 or 1999 when it was still a popular place to
hang out.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Ing Skating Palace got its start in 1918 and was originally a
dance hall named The Inglaterra. In the period of time between
World War I and World War II, people flocked to the Ing to dance to
the music played by Big Bands led by notable band leaders such as
Lawrence Welk and Jimmy Dorsey. In the 1940's a national roller
skating craze started to emerge which led to the change of focus
from dance which created The Ing Roller Skating Palace. Eventually,
even though roller skating was a year-round-six-day-a-week mainstay
for The Ing, a return to the dance hall roots was undertaken in
later decades of its history.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Ing Skating Palace was eventually sold and demolished in the
2000's to make way for the parking lot in which you stand to log
this cache.&lt;br/&gt;

placed on 01/01/2008 http://coord.info/GC18A69 : &quot;It's been nearly
a decade now since we left Chicago and moved to Rockford. Let this
cache commemorate that event.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
For the squeamish, there is a daycare playlot nearby, although a
psychological barrier exists between the cache and the lot. If the
kids are out and you're uncomfortable, just come at another
time.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Happy New Years&quot; (Old FTF info removed)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;There have been some questions concerning the playlot. It has
been suggested that I stress that seekers should only seek this
cache after 6-7PM or on weekends and I agree. If you should happen
upon this hide outside of the recommended hours and the kids are
inside like on a rainy day, then cache on!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The original container was replaced with a standard container for a
cache of this type... PLEASE PLACE BACK IN THE ORIGINAL HIDE
LOCATION.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Congrats to CasheNCarry for FTF!!!&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This hide is in tribute to one of Rockford's slightly hidden
jewels.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please be stealthy when seeking. The parking structure nearby is
not free during the day, and charges $5 or more when an event is
being held at night and on weekends in one of the entertainment
venues nearby. I recommend using the parking coordinates and to not
seek the hide while an event is going on (unless you are attending
the event anyways).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; Since 1956, Phantom Regiment Drum &amp; Bugle Corps has been wowing
audiences with their signature style. In 1972, Phantom Regiment
became one of the charter corps of Drum Corps International
(Marching Music's Major League). The corps has reached the finals
every year that they have competed since 1974 (top twelve).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The site near here where the parking structure stands is where many
alumni have told me that the original music hall the corps called
home was located. The hall burned down in 1964 or 1965. All of the
uniforms and instruments were lost in the fire. An attempt to field
a corps for the 1965 season failed due to lack of funds and a three
year hiatus ended in 1968 with Phantom Regiment's return to the
field.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Phantom Regiment became what it is known today in 1987. The corps
has consistently and aggressively brought complex classical music
to the field in a distinct powerful style with some forays into
lighter music along the way.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Phantom Regiment has won two DCI World Class (formerly Division I)
championships: 1996's &quot;A Defiant Heart&quot; shared the title with the
Blue Devils of Concord, CA and 2008's &quot;Spartacus&quot; held the title
outright. If you drove into town by way of Business US 20 from
I-90, you would see a sign proclaiming the championships.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The corps is loved the whole world over (and hated in some
circles). I (RebelGTP) have had the opportunity to travel with this
corps during the 2009 and 2010 seasons and it has been a wonderful
ride for me. I actively volunteer my talents to the corps in the
off-season in the form of driving a coach bus shuttling the members
to camp sites and arrival/destination locations. My whole family
loves this corps for its approach to the music and how powerful the
music is brought to the field.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please join us in this humble tribute to our favorite drum
corps!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;

This should be a PNG but bring your own scribbler, and please return cache to its hiding spot! Also remember: much of the area surrounding hide is an Industrial Park... Stealth required!


Southwest of this location are the land parcels that were once the River Lane Outdoor Theatre. The theatre opened in 1948, operated until 1984, and was demolished in 1987.

If the screen tower was still in place, you could stand here and watch a movie if one was shown. The screen tower paralleled River Lane in the distance and the screen faced North.

Info about River Lane Outdoor Theatre
Screens: 1
Car Capacity: 650-700

Cache is located on Public Right-of-Way. You cannot get to this cache from GC1DQET - Field of Honor.

Congrats to CasheNCarry for FTF!!!


The cache is the second of two caches that I will be placing that were spawned by locutos' Cache full of Cache(s) Cache.

Not only that, but then I saw my name in the description of this cache for being FTF! ! Cool!

My wife gets the credit for the find, as she was just walking out the door to go to our friends house very close to this park when I got the published notification. I had to take my daughter to her softball game, so my wife said she'd try to find it. I put the coords in the GPSr for her and told her to make Team dingoagogo proud! :)

She says it is not exactly camouflaged, but it is also not easy to see. She hunted about 10-15 minutes before she spotted it.

TFTC, and thanks for publishing on OpenCaching.com too!</groundspeak:text>

Because this is a high muggle area, use some stealth and think like MacGyver. When you find the cache, make sure it's completely hidden in the original location. Use care in the summer, as the metal may be hot from the sun.

Are you are looking for the perfect place to experience 'hometown USA'? Sun Prairie, Wisconsin offers the best in small-city life with the advantages of the thriving metropolis in nearby Madison.

Sun Prairie is a place pleasing to the traveler who loves the arts, is thrilled by the roar and fast-paced action of midget car racing, and just plain enjoys biking and walking trails, fantastic food and fun festivals all year around.

This is my first cache so I made it close to home for easy maintenance. You are looking for an ammo can. Items in cache when placed include:green toy glasses, broken spider man pen, vampire teeth, Lego block,sponge bob toy, several matchbox cars, golf ball,swimming goggles, deck of cards, small Frisbee, and several pencils with a sharpener in case you need it</groundspeak:long_description>
