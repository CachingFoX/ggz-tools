I take a picnic lunch break here from time to time on mild sunny days. It is such a short hop from where I work sometimes I just can't resist getting away from the office.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring the kids and a picnic to enjoy this hunt even more. You may want to take the Stennis Sphere Tour while you are here. You can also checkout the nearby construction of the new Infinity Science Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please ensure that cap is securely in place and return exactly as found.

The prize was donated by Ronbo (thanks Ronbo!). Originally not intended to be a cache; I made a few modifications to it and now it's a neat little hide. This should be a quick p-n-g for those that like that sort of thing. Still, ThingOne hopes it is just sneaky enough for you to enjoy the hunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cache is located along the public sidewalk outside the Live Oak Cemetery in Pass Christian, MS. The cemetery is the final resting place of at least 12 former town mayors. You will also recognize several of the family names here, such as Calvart, Heirn, Henderson, and Shipman; all founders of Pass Christian. Many of the main streets in the area bear their name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cemetery was ravaged by Camille &amp; Katrina. Some photos of the aftermath of Katrina can be found at http://katrinapics.passchristian.net/live_oak_cemetery.htm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please use stealth and care when hunting this cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;We would not want to disturb ANY inhabitants in the area&lt;/i&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the new and improved Bay Saint Louis Bridge!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original Bay Bridge was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. During the months after Katrina, a ferry service carried automobiles back and forth from the Bay St. Louis side to the Pass Christian side of the Bay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The debris from the original bridge was used to form a fishing reef just outside the mouth of the Bay. The locals call it &quot;Gene Taylor Reef&quot; after a local US congressman at the time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the construction of the new bridge, artists were commissioned to create artwork that reflects coastal MS life. These works of art are placed along a walking track that runs the entire two miles of the bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this cache, you must find the bronze relief art that depicts the mermaid. &lt;b&gt;The code phrase for this cache is the name of the object in her right hand.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Parking is available on either side of the Bridge, but there is a nice playground for the kids at the Pass Christian side. Enjoy the walk, the art, and the view!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">ThingTwo wanted to be mean and chose this spot for a cache. When we hid this cache (a couple of years after Katrina) the park was the temporary housing (trailers) for many local business and government offices. The park is finally returning to normal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An interesting bit of history on this hide:&lt;br/&gt;Originally, this was a really mean hide that required a well prepared cacher to retrieve. Some of these cachers took pity on the next guy and made it a little easier to spot. Well, that also helped the muggles spot it so the container disappeared a couple of times. I decided to rethink the hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As I probed around the area looking for an alternative, I spotted another cache container. I opened it and discovered it was a pre-Katrina hide (although some new people had been logging it as ThingOne's hide). It was just two feet away from ThingOne's placement. The original hider, a local legend, had assumed that the container was lost during Katrina since the whole area got covered by storm surge. It survived and the log was still sign-able!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a tribute to the ruggedness of both the container and the people of the Gulf Coast, I've kept this hide just as it was before &quot;The Storm&quot;.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well I found it, but it took a little work. The 1st stage seemed to point at the pavillion, so I went to the displays there but didn't find the answers. So I took the date from the only marker close by that had one. Next discovered I hadn't a clue what a &quot;sequential ordinal value&quot; was. Nothing a tried gave an answer I could subtract 29 from. Finally reached a lifeline and as I was talking to him a little light bulb finally glowed dimmly in my mind about what number I actually needed. After confirming that this was probably right I struck out for the final with my trusty umbrella in the pouring rain. Arrived at the general area the hard way and immediately realized there was an easier way. Began the search in an area that offered few obvious hiding spots. Finally expanded my search about 35 feet and hit a likely spot, but had a new problem. Poison ivy. Lots of it. Well balancing my umbrella on my shoulder with my chin and probing with two sticks finally revealed the cache, but it still took almost 10 minutes to work it out of its hiding spot under the evil plants using the sticks and umbrella.

Boo Boo had just returned from vacation, and he seemed&lt;br /&gt;to have a lot on his little mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yogi Bear:&lt;/b&gt;  Hey, Boo&lt;br /&gt;Boo!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boo Boo:&lt;/b&gt; Hey,&lt;br /&gt;Yogi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; Hey, little buddy, you don't&lt;br /&gt;seem very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB&lt;/b&gt;:  I'm not, Yogi.  I&lt;br /&gt;spent several hours stuck in Memphis on a layover flight, and I had&lt;br /&gt;to watch TV the whole time.  Mostly what was on was reruns of&lt;br /&gt;the TV show &quot; Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&quot;.  It got me to&lt;br /&gt;thinking...  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; About what, little&lt;br /&gt;buddy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt; Oh, I don't know.  Those&lt;br /&gt;people win a lot of money, and they do it in only an hour.  I&lt;br /&gt;knew a lot of the answers, and I think I could do it.   I&lt;br /&gt;think I could be a contender. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; Now, now, little&lt;br /&gt;buddy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt; No, Yogi, don't try to talk me&lt;br /&gt;out of this.  All I need to do is study a little bit. &lt;br /&gt;With enough money, I could buy the entire &lt;i&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;series of movies, maybe even meet my hero, Mr. George Lucas. &lt;br /&gt;I've always thought &lt;i&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/i&gt; was the first Lucas prime&lt;br /&gt;movie.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; Now, Boo Boo, don't get your&lt;br /&gt;head all filled up with nonsense...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB: &lt;/b&gt; It's not nonsense,&lt;br /&gt;Yogi.  I started watching the news, and learned all kinds of&lt;br /&gt;neat stuff abut the U.S. Supreme Court, and science stuff. &lt;br /&gt;Did you know there's a move underway to get Pluto kicked out of the&lt;br /&gt;planetary lineup?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt;  Yeah, sure, Boo Boo,&lt;br /&gt;but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt; No, Yogi, my mind is made&lt;br /&gt;up.  I'm going on that show.  I've got to improve my math&lt;br /&gt;knowledge some, you know, junk like the number of Stern primes, and&lt;br /&gt;the divisors of sphenic numbers, and such, but I can do this. &lt;br /&gt;I &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; Little buddy, you're setting&lt;br /&gt;yourself up for a big disappointment....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt; No, I'm not.  I'm not&lt;br /&gt;some dumb bunny like that goofus in Beatle Bailey.  No, I can&lt;br /&gt;do this.  I can take that TV show like the apocalyptic&lt;br /&gt;horsemen, and I'll make lots and lots of money, and never have to&lt;br /&gt;steal a picnic basket again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; Pic-a-nic baskets?  You&lt;br /&gt;don't like pic-a-nic baskets any more, BooBoo?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt; I still love them, Yogi. &lt;br /&gt;I just can't take the day in and day out struggle of trying to&lt;br /&gt;dodge Mr. Ranger, and getting rid of the used up baskets is a&lt;br /&gt;chore.  Besides, you always get the good stuff, and I end up&lt;br /&gt;with the crumbs.  I'm tired of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; But Boo&lt;br /&gt;Boo...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt; I'm firm on this, Yogi. &lt;br /&gt;Living in this park gives me the dickens.  After I win the TV&lt;br /&gt;show, I'm moving to one of the cities and get me a high-rise&lt;br /&gt;apartment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; But you won't make it in the&lt;br /&gt;big city, little buddy.  You won't get past the second square,&lt;br /&gt;I mean, the second city block without being so homesick you'll want&lt;br /&gt;to move back home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt;  Yogi, you got to have&lt;br /&gt;faith.  Besides, if I win, I'll take you to see Stone&lt;br /&gt;Mountain, or maybe even that big amusement park near&lt;br /&gt;there.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt;  Park?  They have a&lt;br /&gt;park in Georgia?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt; Oh, yes, Yogi!  It's&lt;br /&gt;huge, and they have.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; PIC-A-NIC BASKETS?  Do&lt;br /&gt;they have pic-a-nic baskets, little buddy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;BB:&lt;/b&gt; You bet they do,&lt;br /&gt;Yogi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;YB:&lt;/b&gt; Um......  Can I help you&lt;br /&gt;study?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cache INFORMATION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No hints will be given the first five&lt;br /&gt;days of publication.  &quot;Fluff&quot; notes on the cache listing are&lt;br /&gt;subject to deletion.  Working on the puzzle as a team is&lt;br /&gt;fine.  If you solve  the puzzle, please keep the answer&lt;br /&gt;and the solution method to yourself.  No climbing is necessary&lt;br /&gt;at any point.  The cache is not at the posted coordinates, you&lt;br /&gt;must derive the correct coordinates by some other method. The trick&lt;br /&gt;is to figure out the method. No safecracking skills are&lt;br /&gt;needed.  A hike is involved, but it should not be an obstacle&lt;br /&gt;for a person with average mobility.  No cleats are needed.&lt;br /&gt;Once at the cache location, the time between leaving your vehicle&lt;br /&gt;and returning to your vehicle should not exceed 20 minutes. &lt;br /&gt;Permission to place this cache has been obtained. No fences need to&lt;br /&gt;be crossed. Dogs are permitted.  There may be benchmarks in&lt;br /&gt;the area.   Flying pests such as mosquitoes or wasps may&lt;br /&gt;be present in the warmer months. This paragraph contains no&lt;br /&gt;information pertinent to the puzzle solution. Who's on first. &lt;br /&gt;What's on second. Have fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can check your&lt;br /&gt;answers for this puzzle on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geochecker.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click To Rate This Cache&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: BB1EZPN - Final&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;This spot is at one leg of an abandoned fire tower.</groundspeak:long_description>

We came upon one of my favorite spots along this&lt;br /&gt;stretch of lonely county road, and I realized it needed a&lt;br /&gt;geocache.  This area is rich in history.  Not far from&lt;br /&gt;this spot is the old town of Chestnut Log, now long gone. &lt;br /&gt;Even the remnants of the last church disappeared some years&lt;br /&gt;ago.  Also nearby is the site of an intense battle between the&lt;br /&gt;Oktibbeha Plowboys and Union forces in the War Between The&lt;br /&gt;States.  This stretch of road is prominent on an 1860 map of&lt;br /&gt;the area, and except for the pavement, is pretty much as it was&lt;br /&gt;140+ years ago.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Near the cache&lt;br /&gt;location&lt;/b&gt; is a spot Ole Miss fans will really&lt;br /&gt;appreciate.  It is the final resting place of a Mr.&lt;br /&gt;Sanford.  His plot is adorned with the likeness of Ole Miss's&lt;br /&gt;Col. Reb, as well as a small Col. Reb figurine.  Apparently he&lt;br /&gt;was quite an Oxford fan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache container&lt;br /&gt;contains&lt;/b&gt; a log book and a pen. There's room for small&lt;br /&gt;travel bugs.  Please re-conceal the container just as it was&lt;br /&gt;found.  &lt;b&gt;Please be discrete, as&lt;br /&gt;country-muggles may not comprehend what you're up&lt;br /&gt;to.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click To Rate This Cache

The citizens of Holly Springs, led by Catholic clergy, cared for hundreds of fever stricken people and in the end paid a heavy price. Hundreds of Holly Springs citizens died of the Yellow Fever including six of the Catholic nuns and one priest who were running the hospital caring for the sick. This is a museum dedicated to this part of Holly Spring's history.</groundspeak:long_description>

IS NOT AT THE LISTED COORDINATES ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats
to Jaybirder on the FTF!!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Background:&lt;br /&gt;

     While completing some comunity service at this
location I could not help but notice that there was NO cache here.
So after explaning the game to the Shelter Director. She gave me
permission to place a cache here. You may even run into the cache
placer if he is out volunteering.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The
Shelter's Mission:&lt;br /&gt;
      To ensure the safety, health, and welfare
needs of the people and animals of the Town of Collierville by
responsibly and humanely enforcing animal related laws; providing
nourishment, medical care, and a safe enviroment for unwanted,
stray, abused, and impounded animals; educating the public about
responsible pet ownership; finding new loving homes for the
adoptable animals at the shelter; and providing a humane euthanasia
to thoes animals that are not adoptable due to aggression or health
concerns.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The
Puzzle:&lt;br /&gt;
The above coords will lead you to one of the entrances to the
Collierville Animal Shelter. Once there you will need to find out
the answer to 6 simple questions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(1.) How many laps around the lake
will it take to walk aprox. 1 mile?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 1, then A=6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 2, then A=4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 3, then A=2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 4, then A=0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(2.) While walking around the lake
observe and note the number of fire hydrants visible. How many did
you see?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 4, then B=4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 3, then B=0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 6, then B=6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 2, then B=9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(3.) Also, while walking around the
lake observe and note the number of concrete light posts are
visible. How many did you see?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 10, then C=9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 12, then C=1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 6, then C=3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 9, then C=7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(4.) After you count the number of
concrete light posts. Make note there is only one with two lights
atop of it. There is a silver plate on the pole. What is the number
stamped into the plate?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 163471, then
D=2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 163741, then
D=8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 163417, then
D=0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 136471, then
D=4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(5.) There is one tree dedicated to
a person. Locate this tree. What type of tree is it?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Maple, then
E=3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Oak, then E=1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Pine, then
E=9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Ceder, then
E=7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(6.) Ok, I ran out of creative
questions. Last one. How many total parking spaces are
there?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 23, then F=0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 25, then F=6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 24, then F=8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If 22, then F=4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The
Cache:&lt;br /&gt;
      You are looking for a large camouflaged
lock-n-lock. If there are any cats around please do not try to pet them!!
They are feral cats. More than likely they will run before you even
see them. Yes, this cache is avaible 24/7 but it is strongly
recommended that you attempt this find during the daylight hours.
The shelter staff know about this cache and should not bother
you.&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is NOT in any flower bed!!&lt;br /&gt;

A few
tidbits about the shelter:&lt;br /&gt;


Shelter
Hours
The hours posted are for the public to
come and see our wonderful pets, and my change with special events.
However, staff, volunteers, and community service workers are there
from 8am to 5pm. If you would like more info on how to volunteer
please inquire within. I will try to keep some flyers in the cache
about the shelter and the volunteer program. Volunteers help the
shelter in many ways. You can help walk dogs, love on the cats,
help with adoptions, assist with special event fundraisers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too difficult, but can be slippery when wet. There is one easy way and many hard ways! It is not on the other side. 60CSX avg 150 readings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Memphis International Airport, &quot;America's Aerotropolis&quot; is a world-class facility serving more than a million passengers a year. It is the only airport in North America considered to be an &quot;aerotropolis,&quot; an airport-integrated region extending outward from the airport in strings and clusters of airport-linked businesses and their associate residential complexes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a convenient (but not TOO easy to prevent a missing cache) TB hotel (ammo can) close to the airport intended for caching travelers to import and export trackables. Help the trackables meet their GOALS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you're heading out or coming in, take or leave a trackable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travelers, include in your log what brings you to Memphis such as visiting family, work, or tourism! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations mgrommet for FTF !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is typical AMMO CAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July-2012: New hints and page text!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find yourself near the Wolf River trail systems. Be sure to walk, bike or jog the paths before or after the cache! However, you'll have to go for this on foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best experience from the suggested parking waypoint.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;*** CACHE IS NOT AT THE LISTED COORDINATES ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following passage is to lead you toward the concept of this puzzle via research. Once you stumble upon the concept, you will eventually learn or discover the method to solve!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Below are some &quot;Fibs.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The piano key scale consists of 13 keys, 8 of the keys are white, 5 of the keys are black, and are split into groups of 3 &amp; 2..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sonata # 1 in C Major has 100 measures in the 1st movement. The 1st section, with the theme, has 32 measures, and the last section, with theme variations, has 68 measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiral shells exhibit special patterns consistent with....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain rectangles are aesthetically pleasing and may be attributed to the typical shape of a picture frame&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a special ruler. Notice the length of the color pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leonardo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, enough Fibs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE CACHE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope the above Fibs pointed you in the right direction. When you find the Fib sequence, you can use the subscripts for each symbol below to get the value for the symbol&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt; AB° CD.E &lt;b&gt;W&lt;/b&gt; FGH° I.J&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symbol will be the number that corresponds to the subscript in the series when you figure our the series. Apply any blue adjustments to the series number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NORTH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WEST&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small container with pen. Can fit TBs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF gets some $$ and an unactivated trackable to make their own: Congratulations Bitbrain, Tiger130 and PeanutPapa for FTF team (in the middle of the night) !&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wolf River is estimated to be about 12,000 years old, formed by Midwestern glacier runoff carving the region’s soft alluvial soil. It is one of many rivers in West Tennessee and Mississippi that prompted the Chickasaw to call the region &quot;the land that leaks.&quot; Circa 400 CE, a massive seismic event in the Ellendale Fault (part of the New Madrid Fault system) raised a low ridge across present-day east Memphis, diverting Nonconnah Creek away from the Wolf, causing it to flow directly into the Mississippi River several miles south of the Wolf's mouth. The lowermost section of the Nonconnah that continued to flow into the Wolf eventually became known as Cypress Creek. The Mississippian culture thrived in this area until about the 16th century, as evidenced by mound sites and accounts by Hernando de Soto. Shortly afterwards, the Chickasaw nation settled northern Mississippi, western Tennessee, and eastern Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1682, French explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle claimed the region near the mouth of the Wolf River. The French alternately called the river Rivière de Mayot (or Margot), Blackbird River, and Rivière du Loup. The original Loup was rumored to be a Lenape Indian guide who disappeared along the river while guiding the French. The Delawares were also known as Les Loups or &quot;The Wolves.&quot; According to one account, both the English and Chickasaw afterwards called the river &quot;Loup&quot; in their respective languages: &lt;b&gt;&quot;Wolf&quot; and &quot;Nashoba.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; During a multi-river voyage from Chicago, Illinois, to Biloxi, Mississippi, Jesuit priest Jacques Gravier made the following journal entry for 26 October 1700, after reaching the mouth of the Wolf: &quot;We passed the Riviere a Mayot [Wolf] on the south, from the name of a savage of the Delaware nation who was of Mr. de la Salle's party. This river does not seem to be very large, but is said to be a good hunting ground, and that the Chickacha come to its mouth, from which they are only three days‚ journey, cutting south inland.&quot; Concerned about American activities in their territory along the east bank of the Mississippi River, the Spanish colonial government erected Fort San Fernando de las Barrancas in 1795 near the Chickasaw Bluffs at the mouth of the Wolf River. The fort was dismantled in 1797 in accordance with Pinckney's Treaty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wolf River's watershed (everything above the red dotted line), as surveyed in 1740 by Ignace Francois Broutin, chief engineer of French Louisiana. The French had named the Wolf &quot;Riviere a Margot&quot; Wolf River Harbor, at Downtown Memphis, was formerly the lowermost channel of the Wolf River before its 1960 diversion by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The old mouth of the Wolf River is visible in the upper-right corner, framed by the I-40 and Mud Island Monorail bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 19th century, the Wolf River was declared navigable, from Memphis to La Grange, by the Tennessee General Assembly, which appropriated funds to remove obstructions for keel boat travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1888, Memphis stopped using the Wolf River as its principal source of drinking water, switching to artesian wells, which are still used and which are replenished by the Wolf's watershed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*** ABOUT THE CACHE ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legend has it that before the Battle of News Orleans, pirate Jean Lafitte (pronounced lah-FEET) journeyed up the Mississippi to find a place to stash some of his loot. Few still remember pirate Lafitte's stories of his journey down the Loup river and back. Pirate Lafitte boasted that there were so many places to hide his fortune that nobody would find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your are out to get some booty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is intended to be a relaxing, yet challenging voyage down the Wolf River. With a lot of love given to the Ghost section of the Wolf, I wanted to spread some love to other parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab your favorite water vessel head out! This trip is just under 10 miles of pretty easy paddling. It will take about 4-5 hours to complete. The cache was placed when the river had a guage depth of 3.9 ft and a flow / current at 1.9MPH (PER 60 CSX GPS). You may send me a message to let me know your intent to find this cache. I will be sure to be on stand-by for any P-A-F needs. I don't want you to go through this to end up with a DNF!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache may be done without a water vessel, but it will take you many moons and take a LOT of walking!&lt;/p&gt;
*** PRINT THIS PAGE ***
&lt;p&gt;At each stage, you are looking for tacks that appear ORANGE or RED (There are no decoys to throw you. IF you see a tack, it is game). &quot;Plug&quot; the number of tacks (notated by a &quot;?&quot; -question mark) into the formula listed for each stage to advance to the next stage. Any solution that is negative should be made to be ZERO. (IE -1 = 0). You shold be able to see the tacks from the water at the 3.7 ft level. Pirate monocular or modern binoculars may be helpful if water levels are below 3.5 ft - OR you might have to take a few steps on land. This Will be more difficult if water level is under 3 ft, so wait for rain!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please CITO along the way! Coordinates via Garmin 60CSX.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Found myself here after a chat with a pair of beavers. They told me to beware of the fake tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beavers sent me west. From this direction, you will have to venture off the paved trail. There is a lot of intersting terrain along the way. You may find some trails again at some point. Were they abandoned or are they drafts of future trails. It makes me think that the Greenway trails might come through here someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June2012 - UPDATE! Looks like some trails popped up here! But don't let them trick you. Cache is still accessible, but you have to be creative. Don't rule out getting wet. Water boots might be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used CLayJar rating system for the D/T. My approach warranted a 2.5 terrain, but that was by luck! Of course, you could use an approach that requires special equipment and experience a 5.0 terrain! D/T updated to account for the new obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for an ammo can literally IN the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations Peanutpapa for FTF !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PSEUDO - not actually, but having the appearance of;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRINT THIS PAGE;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was supposed to be a night cache until it was brought to my attention that the park was closed after dark! In the spirit of a night cache, you get to deal with tacks! The tacks will get you through the stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may need something to write with, but not necessarily. You may not want to wear your best shoes. Always CITO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each stage will have tacks to get you to the NEXT stage. Enter the correct numbers in your GPS to advance. I will give you the last 3 digits of the coords with the variable being related to the tacks found. The calculation will be inside of the brackets [ ]. The numbers on the outside of brackets remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 1: Find W orange tacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt; 35° 07. 4 [W 2] 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;W&lt;/b&gt; 089° 49. 4 [W-1] 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 2: Find Z orange tacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt; 35° 07. 4 [Z] 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;W&lt;/b&gt; 089° 49. 4 [4 Z] 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stage 3: Find Y orange tacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;N&lt;/b&gt; 35° 07.[3] [Y 3] 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;W&lt;/b&gt; 089° 49. [3] [Y 2] 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stage calculations are in the hints if you load hints to GPS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinates verified with a 62ST and 60CSX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations PeanutPapa for FTF and Jackthebear for runner up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash prizes will be randomly left inside the cache. You may be the next to win! Please take only 1 bill per log. Please include in your log if you are a winner!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll find this one the way to a nice lake view....off the trail of course. To assist efforts of the Greenway, please practice CITO. The recent flooding moved a lot of trash around the area and your CITO efforts will make a BIG difference! Coordinates via Garmin 60CSX.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Wolf River floodplain, carving a green passage through 90 miles of forests, fields, and communities in northern Mississippi and west Tennessee, is the Mid-South's greatest natural resource. The upper reaches are lush wetlands of unmatched natural beauty and its lower stretches contain refuges of undisturbed forest in the heart of Memphis. Few large cities can boast of such a scenic and relatively unspoiled river in their midst. The creation and protection of a continuous Greenway from the Wolf's subtly majestic beginnings in the Holly Springs National Forest to the Mississippi River is a primary goal of the Wolf River Conservancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is typical size container just off the trail. Replace just as found. After you sign the log, just continue south to the lake for the view! Don't forget to CITO. Please post pictures since in time it will be a nice timeline of the evolution of the trail extension!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bike trail has made this one a lot easier than a 2.0/2.5, so consider it a gift!.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations Peanutpapa for FTF - enjoy the prize.&lt;/p&gt;

&quot;Some seed fell among thorns,
which grew up with it and choked the plants&quot; (Luke
8:7).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is intended to be a bit challenging. Nothing you
seasoned pros will have any trouble with, I am just trying to make
you work for this smiley face a bit. You can park several places,
and approach from several ways. It is near a path but not a
well-worn one. And it is well hidden. PLEASE, WHEN YOU ARE DONE, BE SURE TO HIDE IT
AS WELL AS IT WAS WHEN YOU FOUND IT; the challenge is part
of the fun of this cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a 7.62 cal. ammo can with log and the typical
tradeables. In season, bring some bug spray along as you
will need it.
***Remember this cache is part of &quot;The Whodunit Multicache,&quot; so
please make note of the CLUE game card fastened to the inside ammo
can lid. PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THE CARD FROM THE CACHE***&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hear the words of the Great Teacher:&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;The seed that fell among thorns
stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are
choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not
mature&quot; (Luke 8:14).
&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t let that which passes away choke out that which really
matters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PLEASE
DO NOT REMOVE THE CARD FROM THE CACHE

This cache is a par 5 &quot;golf&quot; style multicache. Start at the first &quot;hole&quot; and &quot;tee off&quot; to one of the holes listed on the first tag. The object is to find the final stage in the fewest number of searches.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are 7 golf &quot;holes&quot; scattered around Shelby Farms, all north of Walnut Grove and east of Farm Road.  At six of the seven &quot;holes&quot; you will find traditional micro containers, each containing a tag with three sets of coordinates.  These are to stay with the micros, of course.  Each coordinate has been assigned an arbitrary icon (i.e., airplane, telephone, bell, smiley face, cross, and star) so that you can use the hints below, if need be.  Eventually you will be lead to a seventh &quot;hole&quot; where you will find the final stage, a 7.62 cal. ammo can.  The only log will be in this box.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Score: As with all golf games, you need to keep score. This course that I've made is a par 5, meaning that a good golfer/cacher should be able to find the cache in 5 searches. (Good of course, really means lucky, which seems to be the case in both Golf and Geocaching.)  It is possible to find the final stage in only four searches. Each &quot;hole&quot; you find (including the first one) counts as a stroke. You can deviate from the current hole that you are on and select a different coordinate from a previous hole, but this is really a &quot;lost ball&quot; and will cost you a stroke. The same penalty is incurred if you cannot find a hole at all and decide to take a different coordinate. There are no dead ends in this course, but you might end up navigating back in a loop to a hole that you've already found. You will need to count this hole a second time. The best score possible on this course is a 4 (birdie; 1 under par), although I expect a lot more bogies (6), double bogies (7), etc. Please note your score and any other golf related stories in your log. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final stage contains the typical tradeables, a golf ball in keeping with the theme of the cache, a Yellow Jeep TB, and your very own &quot;Canadian Bear&quot; if you wish. ***Don't forget to make note of the &quot;Clue&quot; card in the cache for &quot;The Whodunit Multicache.&quot;  Leave the card in the cache.***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wore shorts while placing all stages, so you could to.  If you drive to different places in the park to get close to various &quot;holes,&quot; you are looking at about a mile round trip.  If you decide to walk or ride everything you are talking about more like 3 miles.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to &quot;Centennial Park Scramble&quot; by fizbot in my birthplace of Toronto, Ontario, Canada for the idea for this cache. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FNJYWV - GCJYWV Final&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S2JYWV - GCJYWV Stage 2&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S5JYWV - GCJYWV Stage 5&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S6JYWV - GCJYWV Stage 6&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S7JYWV - GCJYWV Stage 7&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

THE LISTED COORDINATES ***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1827, the United States witnessed the birth of a third
political party. This had never happened before, and the new party
offered America its first alternative to the two dominant political
groups. Like so many third parties to come, this one had a rather
narrowly-focused platform: it was dedicated to countering the
malevolent and subversive influence of the international cabal
known to the world as Freemasonry. This group called itself the
Anti-Masonic Party, and its members were well aware that they faced
an uphill battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America's first President, George Washington, had been a Mason.
So were many other Founding Fathers, including Ethan Allen, John
Paul Jones, Paul Revere, John Hancock, and Benjamin Franklin. Eight
of the 56 signatures on the Declaration of Independence belonged to
avowed Masons, as well as nine on the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1832, the Anti-Masonic Party managed to elect Millard
Fillmore to Congress, but their candidate for President received
only seven votes in the Electoral College. He was crushed by Andrew
Jackson who — you guessed it — was also a Mason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freemasons claim that their group dates back to the stonemason
guilds of the Middle Ages, and some even say it originated with the
building of King Solomon's Temple in 850 BC. Most historians,
however, believe that it was actually founded in 1717 by a bunch of
affluent Englishmen with too much time on their hands. Whatever its
origins, the organization flourished and spread rapidly throughout
the British empire, and Masonic lodges appeared in the American
colonies as early as the 1730s. A separate strain later popped up
in France and swept across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freemasonry became a fraternity of sorts, attracting the
community's best and brightest. They gathered for strange and
secret rituals, swearing oaths of allegiance to the brotherhood and
to each other. Naturally, it became a place for negotiating
business deals and the exchange of gossip. The fraternity soon
emerged as a major power center in most large cities, and the
international network of lodges constituted an immense, wealthy,
and well-connected supra-governmental organization. Such a society
obviously had good reason to keep secrets, and its adherents became
adept at using ciphers and various other encryption schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE CACHE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the strange markings below to determine the true location of
the cache container, a large Lock&amp;Lock stuffed full of swag.
Once you've unearthed the cache and signed the log, try to keep the
information secret lest it fall into the hands of those who would
do harm to our own little &quot;fraternal society.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A simple hide outside the small town of Gates in West Tennessee placed in honor of George Taliaferro, the first African-American drafted to play in the National Football League.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;George Taliaferro was born on January 8, 1927 in the small West Tennessee town of Gates.  Taliaferro actually grew up and starred as high school football player in Gary, Indiana.  He was the first African-American drafted by a National Football League team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the leading rusher and an All-American at Indiana University, he led the Hoosiers to their only undefeated Big Ten Conference championship. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1981.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taliaferro, a halfback, quarterback, and punter, was picked by the Chicago Bears in the thirteenth round of the 1949 NFL Draft but chose to play instead with the Los Angeles Dons of the All-America Football Conference. He had already agreed to a contract with the Dons before being drafted.  He played with the Dons in 1949, then moved to the NFL, where he played with the New York Yanks 1950-51, Dallas Texans 1952, Baltimore Colts 1953-54, and Philadelphia Eagles 1955. He went to the Pro Bowl in 1951, 1952, and 1953.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He completed his Bachelor's  degree at Indiana in 1951.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following his playing career, Taliaferro served as dean of students and assistant football coach at Morgan State University, and received a master's in social work from Howard University in 1960.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taliaferro married his wife Viola in December of 1950.  She is a retired juvenile court judge in Bloomington, and spends his retirement active in community work, including raising money to finance organ transplants for adults and children.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a camo bison tube cache. Look for a small conservation area and camping sign visible on Hwy.61 to your right if traveling south from Benton,MO. This is County Park Road but the sign says Park Rd. Drive conservatively up this gravel road to the fork and go left. The road to the right is private land. You will arrive at a big parking lot with the campsites visible to the left. The Schlosser Loop Trail is here as well as Lakes 1 and 2. Cache is about 15 yards from Attention Anglers sign. Cache is low and well camoed, I was surprised at how well it blends in. A little bit is visible at the correct tree.

Only a couple disabled ones, a night cache, and one multi in a park that had a bunch of darn kids playing baseball. What are they thinking on such a nice day?

There are trails throughout this area and I advise you to follow them they will make these caches easier to locate. They are all a little off the trails. Please put all caches the way you found them. Do not attempt this cache if the river is flooded you will not be able to get to one of the caches but it is high enough it should not be affected. The terrain is only rated so high because I am sure if you take a different route it may be more difficult and it's a decent hike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*FTF There is a gift card awaiting you, so what are you waiting for? The rest if full of swag and kid friendly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Round trip you will travel about a mile so leave plenty of time to finish all stages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will not need to go over any fences, roads, or through any trespassing signs. I would suggest long pants to avoid posion ivy and itch weed. Follow me and you will find it and let me know how it was the is out first multi-cache hide.</groundspeak:long_description>

Others soon followed and Grist Mill was established on Quiver Creek as early as 1838 &lt;br/&gt;Circuit riding minister, Peter Cartwright, held quarterly meetings in the township. Churches were later established including an old Presbyterian Church on this site. It stood from 1857 to 1936.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Peddlers named the stern rural neighbor to the west of here &quot;Tight Row.&quot; The German neighborhood to the east was known as &quot;Pleasant Row.&quot; The general area was called &quot;The Quiver Land&quot; because a man could make the spongy soil near the creek shake and cause the water to Quiver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a well maintained old cemetery. If you look around, you will find the old out house that once belonged to the church. Please be respectful while you are here and place the cache back the way that you found it. There is no cache hunting from dusk to dawn. You never know what maybe be out there in the dark waiting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It tells the story of a wagon train and some of the members who died of scarlet fever in the winter. It is believed that 30 men, women and children are buried here in unmarked graves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please respect the area you are in. There is no caching after dusk. Rehide the cache as you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The river is land locked with private property so you must hunt for these caches while floating the river. Enjoy your day out here and be careful while in the river. Depending on the season, the water could be high and the current very strong.

Float Trip Caches are located along the Mackinaw River. These caches are meant to be found while floating along the river. you are looking for a bison tube. Bring along a pen. The river is land locked with private property so you must hunt for these caches while floating the river. Enjoy your day out here and be careful while in the river. Depending on the season, the water could be high and the current very strong.

Float Trip Caches are located along the Mackinaw River. These caches are meant to be found while floating along the river. you are looking for a bison tube. Bring along a pen. The river is land locked with private property so you must hunt for these caches while floating the river. Enjoy your day out here and be careful while in the river. Depending on the season, the water could be high and the current very strong.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(10:40:24 AM/fwgb) What a great series!  My father-in-law, son and daughter loaded in to the canoe and set off at about 10am.  We found 4 and DNF'd a couple of the first 8.  I didn't spend too long looking for any of them, because I didn't want the rest of the team to get impatient.  A couple we didn't notice until too late, since reading a GPS while paddling wasn't easy.  We then decided to high-tail it for the end because of the storms rolling in. We sheltered under the bridge at Dillon Road, waited for the lightning to pass, then finished up in the rain.  

I had the chance to help a couple in a canoe that we'd watched capsize right in front of us.  I was already out of the boat helping getting us through a shallow spot.  The only real casualty was bag of hotdog buns :)  It was raining hard enough at that point that falling in didn't really make anybody wetter.

Just FYI - taking the boat out at Towerline road was pretty hard. With two little ones, in the pouring rain, climbing up the bank and up the trail was a little tough.  My father-in-law's canoe is pretty big too.  Even so, I'm hoping I can get back to finish this series soon!  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(10:29:01 AM/fwgb) What a great series!  My father-in-law, son and daughter loaded in to the canoe and set off at about 10am.  We found 4 and DNF'd a couple of the first 8.  I didn't spend too long looking for any of them, because I didn't want the rest of the team to get impatient.  A couple we didn't notice until too late, since reading a GPS while paddling wasn't easy.  We then decided to high-tail it for the end because of the storms rolling in. We sheltered under the bridge at Dillon Road, waited for the lightning to pass, then finished up in the rain.  

I had the chance to help a couple in a canoe that we'd watched capsize right in front of us.  I was already out of the boat helping getting us through a shallow spot.  The only real casualty was bag of hotdog buns :)  It was raining hard enough at that point that falling in didn't really make anybody wetter.

Just FYI - taking the boat out at Towerline road was pretty hard. With two little ones, in the pouring rain, climbing up the bank and up the trail was a little tough.  My father-in-law's canoe is pretty big too.  Even so, I'm hoping I can get back to finish this series soon!  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Float Trip Caches are located along the Mackinaw River. These caches are meant to be found while floating along the river. you are looking for a bison tube. Bring along a pen. The river is land locked with private property so you must hunt for these caches while floating the river. Enjoy your day out here and be careful while in the river. Depending on the season, the water could be high and the current very strong.

This time the weather was pleasant.  Had a great trip with a fun group!  We're very tempted to buy a canoe or kayak now!  

On our last trip through, we skipped this one (as well as all the subsequent ones) in order to escape the storm.  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(10:18:24 AM/fwgb) What a great series!  My father-in-law, son and daughter loaded in to the canoe and set off at about 10am.  We found 4 and DNF'd a couple of the first 8.  I didn't spend too long looking for any of them, because I didn't want the rest of the team to get impatient.  A couple we didn't notice until too late, since reading a GPS while paddling wasn't easy.  We then decided to high-tail it for the end because of the storms rolling in. We sheltered under the bridge at Dillon Road, waited for the lightning to pass, then finished up in the rain.  

I had the chance to help a couple in a canoe that we'd watched capsize right in front of us.  I was already out of the boat helping getting us through a shallow spot.  The only real casualty was bag of hotdog buns :)  It was raining hard enough at that point that falling in didn't really make anybody wetter.

Just FYI - taking the boat out at Towerline road was pretty hard. With two little ones, in the pouring rain, climbing up the bank and up the trail was a little tough.  My father-in-law's canoe is pretty big too.  Even so, I'm hoping I can get back to finish this series soon!  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Float Trip Caches are located along the Mackinaw River. These caches are meant to be found while floating along the river. you are looking for a bison tube. Bring along a pen. The river is land locked with private property so you must hunt for these caches while floating the river. Enjoy your day out here and be careful while in the river. Depending on the season, the water could be high and the current very strong.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">What a great series!  My father-in-law, son and daughter loaded in to the canoe and set off at about 10am.  We found 4 and DNF'd a couple of the first 8.  I didn't spend too long looking for any of them, because I didn't want the rest of the team to get impatient.  A couple we didn't notice until too late, since reading a GPS while paddling wasn't easy.  We then decided to high-tail it for the end because of the storms rolling in. We sheltered under the bridge at Dillon Road, waited for the lightning to pass, then finished up in the rain.  

I had the chance to help a couple in a canoe that we'd watched capsize right in front of us.  I was already out of the boat helping getting us through a shallow spot.  The only real casualty was bag of hotdog buns :)  It was raining hard enough at that point that falling in didn't really make anybody wetter.

Just FYI - taking the boat out at Towerline road was pretty hard. With two little ones, in the pouring rain, climbing up the bank and up the trail was a little tough.  My father-in-law's canoe is pretty big too.  Even so, I'm hoping I can get back to finish this series soon!  

Looked around for a few minutes on this one, but could come up with it.  The kids were getting restless, so we moved on.</groundspeak:text>

Neither of us were really in the zone today but we managed to find a few. Thanks for the hide, we enjoyed finding it.

Loaded up the Patriot with some tools this morning and had the perfect one for this. Didn't see any pizza coupons but I wasn't really looking for them either. Might have been there still. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cash is to honor the #7 cacher in the world (for now, I don't believe he is stopping yet). 40,000 finds? He has to be some kind of secret agent to do this. Anyway, you can access this 2 ways: from the Mackinaw River or from the road to the south. There is not access from the north without trespassing. Just a short walk from the parking area, if you choose to take the easy way. Then you are there, ALMOST. Way to go Bruce!!! I owed you this one. Please replace EXACTLY as found.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;For many years I've driven through Banner on the way to visit my parents.  Today, on the way through, I noticed a road called &quot;Banner Bypass.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, a bypass is usually a quicker route than heading through a city.  I was really excited to try it out, and avoid all the traffic of this major metropolitan area.  As it turns out, though, it's not a good alternate route for Route 24, and you'll have to negotiate several speed bumps along the way.  I guess it could save you a little time getting to the Conservation Areas though.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Shouldn’t take very long. Tremont isn’t that big.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Solve for: N40 31.ABC &amp; W089 DE.FGH Stage 1: N40 31.286 W089
29.275 Here you will find a plaque with information on it. AC = the
height posted minus 20. Stage 2: N40 31.686 W089 29.464 Here you
will find an aluminum tag with PTCO inspected _ _ _ _. B = the last
3 numbers added together then divided by 7. Stage 3: N40 31.145
W089 29.792 Here you will find a dedication plaque. F = the last
number of the date minus the first digit of the year. G = the third
digit of the year minus the second digit of the date. H = the
second digit of the year plus the first digit of the year minus the
last digit of the year. Stage 4: N40 31.373 W089 29.150 Here you
will find some bushes. DE = the number of groups of bushes here
times the number of bushes in each group then add 3. Now you should
have the information needed to find the cache. Do not search for
the final after dark and be respectful of your surroundings at all
stages.

One of the stages was within 50' of a huge &quot;Homeland Security&quot; vehicle, so we tried not to look too terroristy while finding the info.  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

This cache is not at the posted coordinates. Do not go there. I
doubt you can hold your breath long enough.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is placed at the SW Lake by I155. It has been placed
with permission by the Tremont Area Park District. This lake is a
by-product of the interstate when it was built and is now part of
the park district. Nice walking path around the lake and is open 24
hours for fishing WITH A PERMIT. Solve the puzzle below. It
shouldn’t be that hard. Follow the arrows. &lt;a href=&quot;http://s950.photobucket.com/albums/ad346/Claystalker/?action=view&amp;amp;current=Arrows.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;a href=&quot;http://peoriaareacachers.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An old and long forgotten railroad with an interesting history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;T&amp;G Railway connected forestry in region The Tremont &amp; Gulf&lt;br/&gt;Railway Company began around 1904, as a logging railroad in&lt;br/&gt;conjunction with Tremont Lumber Company during the height of the&lt;br/&gt;early timber boom operations. The railroad's history is related to&lt;br/&gt;that of Tremont Lumber Company as both were owned by the Joyce&lt;br/&gt;interests. The Chicago-based Joyce family, among whom were William&lt;br/&gt;T. Joyce, first president of the Tremont &amp; Gulf, his two sons,&lt;br/&gt;David G. Joyce and James Stanley Joyce, and Beatrice Joyce Kean,&lt;br/&gt;the daughter of James Stanley Joyce, worked in the development of&lt;br/&gt;this region. The local airport was named for David G. Joyce, and&lt;br/&gt;the Village of Joyce was named for this family. In 1899 the Joyce&lt;br/&gt;family, who had previously operated sawmills on the Mississippi&lt;br/&gt;River in Iowa from timber logged in Minnesota, acquired a small&lt;br/&gt;sawmill at Tremont, Louisiana, in the pine hills of Lincoln Parish,&lt;br/&gt;and there Tremont Lumber Company was founded. The lumber industry&lt;br/&gt;in the South was beginning to boom, and sawmills were springing up&lt;br/&gt;overnight. The first major expansion following establishment of the&lt;br/&gt;Tremont mill was the organization of a logging railroad to operate&lt;br/&gt;between the mill and the company's pineland at Eros, Louisiana.&lt;br/&gt;This was the beginning of the Tremont &amp; Gulf Railway Company,&lt;br/&gt;which was the vital link with logging operations. In rapid-fire&lt;br/&gt;order came the acquisition of more mills, along with more acres and&lt;br/&gt;more logging railroads, among those the Winn Parish Lumber Company&lt;br/&gt;at Dodson and another railroad, a mill at Pyburn, and finally in&lt;br/&gt;1907 the Louisiana Lumber Company at Rochelle in Grant Parish,&lt;br/&gt;including two sawmills and the Western Railroad Company with ten&lt;br/&gt;miles of track. When a railroad link between Rochelle and Dodson&lt;br/&gt;was constructed, Tremont possessed a network of rail transportation&lt;br/&gt;ranging from Tremont in the north to Rochelle in the south, with&lt;br/&gt;links connecting Chatham, Jonesboro, and Dodson. The logging road&lt;br/&gt;became Tremont &amp; Gulf Railroad in 1905 with William T. Joyce as&lt;br/&gt;president. At this time there was endless virgin pineland in the&lt;br/&gt;South, and the Tremont &amp; Gulf was lined with numerous sawmills&lt;br/&gt;from which flowed an incredible output. After the logging road&lt;br/&gt;became a full-fledged railroad, development was begun in earnest&lt;br/&gt;and an extension from Chatham to Winnfield was completed in 1907.&lt;br/&gt;On September 19, 1907 the Tremont &amp; Gulf rolled its first train&lt;br/&gt;into Winnfield. Afterwards the Tremont &amp; Gulf built several&lt;br/&gt;branches, the first from Menefee, six miles north of Winnfield, to&lt;br/&gt;Pyburn on the Rock Island; another from Menefee to Rochelle; and&lt;br/&gt;another from Sikes to Jonesboro. Instead of using the telegraph,&lt;br/&gt;the railroad was operated by a telephone switchboard from the train&lt;br/&gt;dispatcher's office. In a reorganization in 1908 the road became&lt;br/&gt;the Tremont &amp; Gulf Railway Company, and the general offices&lt;br/&gt;were located at Winnfield, where they remained. During the heyday&lt;br/&gt;of railroads in the 1920s the various lines serving Winnfield had&lt;br/&gt;12 passenger trains and 8 freight trains running into Winnfield&lt;br/&gt;daily. The Tremont &amp; Gulf had 71 miles of track in 1936,&lt;br/&gt;connecting with the Missouri Pacific at Rochelle, Illinois Central&lt;br/&gt;at Tremont, O N &amp; W at Gulf Crossing, and Louisiana &amp;&lt;br/&gt;Arkansas and Rock Island in Winnfield. It had 100 employees and a&lt;br/&gt;$150,000 payroll. In a book published in 1947, Lucius Beebe and C.&lt;br/&gt;M. Clegg, Jr. wrote: &quot;By far the most enterprising and functionally&lt;br/&gt;animate of short lines we encountered in the Deep South was the&lt;br/&gt;Tremont &amp; Gulf, which operates out of Winnfield, Louisiana, and&lt;br/&gt;maintains no fewer than six separate train movements, four&lt;br/&gt;scheduled and two unscheduled, daily over its 97 miles of well-kept&lt;br/&gt;iron. While the road is controlled by one of the vast lumber&lt;br/&gt;projects of the region, its freights and mixed consists are&lt;br/&gt;unusually various as to types of merchandise carried and its&lt;br/&gt;locomotives are among the most beautifully shopped and maintained&lt;br/&gt;anywhere in the South. A handsome green- and gold-painted Packard&lt;br/&gt;limousine with flanged wheels for the exclusive use of the&lt;br/&gt;roadmaster adds a panache of deluxe urbanity that might well be&lt;br/&gt;envied by more comprehensive railroad systems. &quot;The Tremont &amp;&lt;br/&gt;Gulf's motive-power roster includes four enchanting ten-wheelers&lt;br/&gt;built between 1907 and 1915 by Baldwin and numbered 15, 20, 24, 25.&lt;br/&gt;Of somewhat later vintage is No. 30, a Baldwin Mikado. All are oil&lt;br/&gt;burners, and their silvered rod assemblies, red and gold trim on&lt;br/&gt;the cabs and general air of spit and polish set them in a class&lt;br/&gt;with such proudly maintained motive power as that of the little&lt;br/&gt;Colorado and Wyoming ... &quot;Every morning at one-hour intervals&lt;br/&gt;beginning at 6:30 the three trains roll out of Winnfield yards: one&lt;br/&gt;a solid freight which runs to West Monroe 40 miles away and return;&lt;br/&gt;a mixed freight and passenger on schedule between Winnfield and&lt;br/&gt;Tremont where it connects with the Yazoo &amp; Mississipi Valley&lt;br/&gt;branch of the Illinois Central; and another freight with passenger&lt;br/&gt;accommodations in its spacious caboose on the 20-mile run to&lt;br/&gt;Waggoner, where it connects with both the Rock Island and the&lt;br/&gt;Louisiana &amp; Arkansas.&quot; The authors wrote more about the&lt;br/&gt;maintenance of the motive power: &quot;The T. &amp; G.'s motive power is&lt;br/&gt;among the most beautiful in the South,&quot; and of the road's motive&lt;br/&gt;power, &quot;which is spotlessly maintained in the quintessence of&lt;br/&gt;short-line chic.&quot; Responsible for the well-kept equipment were&lt;br/&gt;Jesse L. Corley, Superintendent of Motive Power, and his shop crew.&lt;br/&gt;Mr. Corley served 40 years with Tremont &amp; Gulf, from May 25,&lt;br/&gt;1919 to July 31, 1959. Lucius Beebe and C. M. Clegg, Jr. had this&lt;br/&gt;to say about Winnfield at the time of their visit in the middle&lt;br/&gt;1940s: &quot;In Winnfield, where the hotel was overflowing with oil&lt;br/&gt;riggers, derrick-men and geologists attracted by a nearby offset&lt;br/&gt;property that had come through against the expectation of everyone&lt;br/&gt;concerned, we were lodged in overstuffed comfort at the home of the&lt;br/&gt;local magistrate whose lady, palm-leaf fan in hand, made pin money&lt;br/&gt;by taking in travellers whose credentials passed her inspection and&lt;br/&gt;standards of respectability. For two dollars we mounted to a&lt;br/&gt;bedroom whose Irish linen sheets, shaded bed lamps and Niagaras of&lt;br/&gt;hot water could have spelled luxury in New York or San Francisco.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;On August 1, 1959 when the Tremont &amp; Gulf Railway Company was&lt;br/&gt;sold to the Illinois Central Railroad Company, the transaction&lt;br/&gt;closed a chapter of Winn's history which began more than a&lt;br/&gt;half-century before with the beginning of the timber boom. At that&lt;br/&gt;time trains were operated between Winnfield and Monroe daily, and&lt;br/&gt;Sunday when necessary, and between Winnfield and Rochelle daily&lt;br/&gt;except Sunday; but the operation had ceased to be profitable. Other&lt;br/&gt;railroads serving Winnfield in 1959 were Louisiana &amp; Arkansas&lt;br/&gt;Railway Company, as part of the KCS-L&amp;A System; Chicago, Rock&lt;br/&gt;Island &amp; Pacific Railroad; and Louisiana Midland Railway&lt;br/&gt;(formerly a branch of the L&amp;A). Beatrice Joyce Kean, a&lt;br/&gt;descendant of William T. Joyce, was the sole owner of the Tremont&lt;br/&gt;&amp; Gulf when it was sold to the Illinois Central in 1959. She&lt;br/&gt;was also the sole owner of Tremont Lumber Company at the time she&lt;br/&gt;died in 1973, leaving no descendants. She left her holdings to the&lt;br/&gt;Joyce Foundation; and Tremont Lumber Company was sold to Crown&lt;br/&gt;Zellerbach Corporation in 1974.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There have been a few caches in the area that center on the use of the chirp feature available in some GPSr units. It sounds like fun, but not everyone has the right GPSr. In my case, I use a smartphone for caching. It has some advantages and some disadvantages over a standard GPSr. This is one cache that favors the smartphone users. It can be completed without a smartphone, but it will probably take more than one trip.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Teamed up with MutherAndSun to wipe out some Peoria area caches. I think Muther summed up the day pretty well, I don't really have much to add. There were a lot of laughs, some strange muggles, possibly a couple traffic laws violated(but nobody saw so it's all good), a few thorns and bloodshed, some bushwacking we really didn't need to do, and a lot of caches. Oh, and a couple turns missed but it wasn't the navigators(me) fault, I said turn there twice. It really was a beautiful day in Peoria and I think we enjoyed every moment.

Needs a new log, it's crumbling. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

Too much thinking about the upcoming surgery for TSC. Neither of us were really in the zone today and this was just one we gave up on too easy.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(9:11:19 AM/fwgb) Took the day off work to go on my son's field trip, but it was cancelled due to weather.  I needed to get over to Morton, so I spent the morning caching in the area.  I didn't have great luck, ending up with 11 DNFs out of 20 attempts.  

Thankfully, this one I found!  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

The wife and I brought our daughter here today for a lunch on the lawn event with a local children's musician, and this cache has been on my to-do list for quite some time, so I couldn't resist the lure. [:D]  I wandered around inside for a bit on my own, and finally got tired of my GPS acting up indoors so asked the librarian for a hint and she directed me to the next clue...from that point it didn't take me long to find the final location.

VERY well done - I can tell you put a lot of thought and planning into it.  The execution worked well!  Definitely going on my favorites list, and happy to count it as #500 for me. SL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

I found this one on my 2nd visit, having left to avoid muggles.  I made this one way too hard.  I can't exactly figure out the &quot;BM&quot; part though.  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Now you have the opportunity to do the same while staying on dry land. For this cache, start at the posted coordinates, find the clue and let the lighthouse aid your navigation to the next stage. A special tool is needed to complete this cache. The tool required should be fairly obvious once you reach the first stage. Some of you will have this tool with you and some of you may need to get creative to work around this tool.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Jan 9th 1400 hrs If you have found this you maybe the last of our kind. My name is Sgt. Z.A. Tripp. I was traveling along 474 heading to Springfield taking Lieutenant Colonel Anna Moody from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institue of Infectious Dieases. We was to deliver a strain for the cure of the infection. We are the last of our convey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As we crossed the bridge, we came upon a road jam. Cars and trucks completey blocked both lanes of traffic. As we checked the map for a different route we became surrounded by hundreds of the carriers.&lt;br/&gt;We had to make a plan and make it fast. We was still in the hummer but was not sure how long it would shelter us from them.&lt;br/&gt;I decide that splitting up was our best chose. I was to head south along Rt 29 and Anna would go east to highway 74. With ammo low and two grenades left, we split the sample of the morningstar strain, pulled the pins from the grenades and let them fly. It cleared us a path out of the hummer to get us headed in our different directions. &lt;br/&gt;Jan 9th 1900hrs&lt;br/&gt;I hope Anna fair better than me. I am holed up in a deserted gas station but I was bitten. There is no hope for me now, I can feel the infection running through my body. I plan on sneaking out in the cover of night to find a place to hide the sample. If anyone finds my journal then please find the sample and get it to the research team in hopes to finding a cure. Without it, we will all be victums of the dead. I know it is too late for me as I will already be one of the undead......&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Follow the listed coordinates to start you on your way to the cure........ I left a clue at the listed coordinates. Once you have the starting coordinates, use your flashlight to follow my trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Assembled the team early in the week in hopes of a nice evening to finish this up since our last try ended in the low lying flood waters. As usual I picked the best night with strong storms and tornado watches rolling through the area. As I drove through Pekin on the flooded streets I expected to get that call any second that everyone was bailing out, but surprisingly all but a couple showed up and wanted to go. By this time the rain had slowed to a steady light rain, so we geared up, hopped the train, and we were on our way. We managed to pick up our trail close to where we stopped before and had no problem making our way to the final. I guess the zombies didn't like the thunder and lightning, because we never heard or saw anything the whole time we were out there. The next group through may not be so lucky. Mission complete we headed for a dry place to warm our bones. Great job on this one, can't wait for episode 3. TFTCSL</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(9:19:29 AM/fwgb) Took the day off work to go on my son's field trip, but it was cancelled due to weather.  I needed to get over to Morton, so I spent the morning caching in the area.  I didn't have great luck, ending up with 11 DNFs out of 20 attempts.  

Glad to find this one, and perhaps figure out the naming.  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

I needed to get over to Morton, so I spent the morning caching in the area.  I didn't have great luck, ending up with 11 DNFs out of 20 attempts.  

Due to recent events, I'm not sure whether to imply this one might have been muggled.  I'm not the best searcher, but from the logs this one shouldn't have been too hard.  I couldn't spot it though.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(12:14:03 PM/fwgb) Took the day off work to go on my son's field trip, but it was cancelled due to weather.  I needed to get over to Morton, so I spent the morning caching in the area.  I didn't have great luck, ending up with 11 DNFs out of 20 attempts.  

My GPS was leading me astray, but after I committed to getting my knees wet I made the find!  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

In the early spring the waterfall is flowing well and is a nice quite place to sit and relax. The creek has cut thru the earth where you can see a seam of coal. The cache is a regular loc-n-loc. It is hidden in the normal caching style. Please rehide as well or better than you had found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks you the City of Marquette Hts for allowing the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I grew up playing in these woods as a kid. The hill you walk down is called Superman Hill. In the winter we would sled down it. It gets steep towards the creek. I hope you enjoy the cache as it is my first to hide. If the feed back is good you may see more around here. </groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://peoriaareacachers.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A quick P&amp;G in a local cemetery along Muller Road between East Peoria and Morton. Parking is available by the cemetery entrance. Please respect local ordinances and do not hunt this cache after sunset.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is a micro camo painted pill container with log only, so BYOP. The nearby road can get busy at times, so use stealth and please replace as found or better to avoid muggling. Good luck and happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

For the ones who have done the first two classes knows that these caches are not for everyone. If for any reason you get to this class and see that you can not do it, just turn around and go on recess. This isn't your simple park and grab. If you have already passed 101 and 102, this one may be for you. If you are one who copied off of the other students, you may want to think twice. If your up to passing the test, then by all means, come and get it. </groundspeak:long_description>

This is one of a few nasty puzzle caches that have plagued me for the past year and a half.  So simple in its design...deceptively simple once you unlock the codex...but until you figure the method to the madness, it drives you NUTS! [:P]  The most recent hint is what finally pushed me past a roadblock to the finish line.  Without that hint, it would have taken infinitely longer to crack the code.  I don't think I've ever been happier to see a confirmation message from Geochecker than with this cache, to date!

Once I got to GZ, finding the physical container was no picnic either.  The coordinates ended up being a little off, but within reasonable distance - only about 15' or so from where my GPSr was stating GZ to be.  A quick call was made to the CO to verify the location, since the cache was hidden so long ago, and soon the cache was in hand...not without going through tons of weeds and plants though!  I was in my work slacks, and needless to say, my pants and socks were covered in burrs by the time I got back to the car!  It was worth it for the FTF though. [:D]

In order to maintain the integrity of the hide and the rating, I don't want to say much more about this cache, other than all of the clues you need to obtain the info for solving the puzzle is located on this listing.  And one more thing to say, for the CO...and I think you know what it is...paybacks. [;)]

Well deserving of a favorite point!  Nicely done puzzle and hide.  SL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

attacked your supply lines and seem able to anticipate your every
move. It can mean only one thing, they have a spy feeding them
information. The following message was intercepted and needs to be
decoded. Send the message to Bletchley Park and see if they can
decode it and locate the spy's drop off point before the enemy gets
any more information.&lt;br /&gt;

Drove to the vicinity of GZ today, finding the container was a breeze...what a great area, and a great day of weather for caching.  Even my two-year-old daughter enjoyed the short walk to the cache!  As korey99 indicated, no worries here about the terrain not being kid-friendly.  Well done!  SL TFTC

The puzzle was excellent, and challenging (but straightforward) to solve.  I like that kind better than the ones where the solution method is hard to determine.

If you have found my journal then you are still one of the living and you will know my story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four days ago I was traveling east on highway route 474 with Sgt. Z.A. Tripp. When we crossed a bridge we ran upon a road jam. Within minutes we was underseige by the undead. I had once called them carriers but now being on foot and alone I have seen them for what they are, undead souls. It was our plan to split up and go two different routes to try and get a sample of the Morningstar Strain back to the research lab in Springfield.&lt;br/&gt;I can only hope that Sgt.Tripp has fair better than I. As I write in my journal I can feel that I don't have much time left before I become one of them. They are now smarter than we once knew. They are more organized, they are hunting in packs now. I tried to find transportation in town but was quickly over come and now out of ammo. I had to head out to the country side away from the population in town. I took shelter in a park but I was not alone as I thought I might have been. One snuck up on me and in the fight I was bitten. I know I don't have much time before I become one of them so I had to hide the morningstar sample in hopes someone finds this journal and can get it to the research lab for me. Be careful, they are everywhere, I soon will be joining their ranks.............&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Location Morton park/ Northwoods&lt;br/&gt;Difficulty: See above&lt;br/&gt;Parking: Either Paved or gravel depending on which lot you select&lt;br/&gt;Time: Sunset to 11PM&lt;br/&gt;Season: Year Round&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you to the Morton Park District for permission to place this cache!&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

As we followed the markers left behind by Moody, we heard rustling in the timber not far from us. At first we thought we were scaring up wildlife, but when we kept hearing it we realized that we were being tracked by the undead. Once we neared the final location and it had been quiet for a while, we figured we had shook him, but waiting for us was the one that had been following us the whole time. I think the screams and the size of our group scared him off for now, but he is still out there and probably not alone. Be careful. TFTCSL</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Out with Noto and 2 Little. Where do you begin to tell of this adventure? Normal river = about 8'. Flood stage = 18'. River stage today = 21 '. Doing Castaway Island = Priceless. Pulled up in the boat as close as we could, Dave said it was 5' deep there. Jumped in and could not touch bottom. Swam in about 300' before we could touch ground, then waded in the rest of the way. Not much of an island when the river is at this stage. Took off in the direction of the cache when we hit water again in the middle of the island. Swimming again for about 100' before we could touch bottom. Hit dry land again and it wasn't long before we had the prize in hand. Then off into the river we go again to get back to the boat where we had plenty of cold ones for the ride home. Couldn't find two better guys to share this adventure with. This will have to go down as the craziest caching to date. Thanks for the adventure.</groundspeak:text>

As it turns out, I had my hand practically on it last night, but the dark skies and the big end of the cache being down at the opening made it too hard for my large fingers to retrieve by hand without a geotool. Was successful in retrieval and replacement today though. SL TFTC

mid-size markets, opened a new 90,000 sq. ft. store as Town Centre
II’s new anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, over the next several years ShopKo’s sales
suffered and the chain closed many stores, even exiting some
markets entirely. In late 2006, ShopKo announced that the East
Peoria location would be closed for “economic reasons”,
and in 2007 the building was emptied and has been vacant since; the
property is currently for lease. The other plaza tenants have done
well for the most part, with only a few changes, and have enjoyed
relative success and stability in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;  </groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a micro cache. Please bring along your own pen or pencil.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I introduced Dsvmusic to caching a while back, little did I know that he would beat me to 1000 finds. We've been friends for over 15 years, and in that time, I've learned a lot about him. I thought I'd share a few tidbits about him so that you can get to know him a little better too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dsvmusic once found over 1200 caches in a 48 hour period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was not credited, but is widely believed to have actually written Justin Bieber's hit debut single &quot;One Time.&quot; He recorded a version and posted it to YouTube three months before the emergence of the young pop star.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While working at Cargill, he was on the team that developed the first bison tube. It was actually designed as a reusable medicine delivery system for cattle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His parents claim that Dsvmusic learned to walk at the age of three weeks, and was talking at eight weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He has an older brother, Brandon, who portrayed &quot;Doug Porter&quot; on &quot;The Wonder Years.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several species of peanut plant are known to be allergic to Dsvmusic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get out there and find it! When you log this cache, be sure to congratulate Dsvmusic, and feel free to share any other facts you might have heard about him.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I had been planning to make The Journal my 1000th find, but when Korey contacted me a few days ago to tell me he had a special tribute cache planned for me after work today, I was very excited! He really outdid himself with his creativity today...hiding a cache container inside a frozen block of ice was brilliant! Busting it open to find...a DECOY...beyond brilliant! [:)] Of course, he was there to take pictures of the fun, and hopefully we'll get them uploaded soon!

That being said, the real cache that remains is a straightforward P&amp;G, so you other cachers can rest easy!

Many thanks to you for getting me hooked on caching...here's to the next 1000! SL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Its a little know fact that Dsvmusic once defeated a 13 foot alligator in a wrestling match with just his bear hands.  He had to use his bear hands because on a previous attempt against the same alligator, he lost his real hands and had bear hands attached instead.</groundspeak:text>

and I've been wanting to place a quick lunchtime grab. Thanks to
MrLuckyPants for reminding me about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be a quick grab, but it's near a high-traffic area,
so try not to call too much attention to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h3&gt;Welcome to Central Illinois' first Wherigo cache!&lt;/h3&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a short tour of the Peoria River Walk, showcasing the sculptures of artist Preston Jackson. The posted coordinates will take you to a parking area that makes a good starting point. If you walk, it'll be around 1 mile round trip. To complete this cache, you will visit a number of sculptures in the area, then you will be guided to a container with a log sheet to sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To complete a Wherigo, you'll need to use a Garmin Oregon, Garmin Colorado, or a smartphone.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've never done a Wherigo before, this one is pretty simple. You'll be given a number of &quot;tasks&quot; to perform, which you can access from a menu. Once you've completed all the tasks, you need to navigate to a &quot;location,&quot; is also accessed from the menu. Once you've found and signed the log, you can log this cache here, and you can log the Wherigo on Whereigo.com as well if you'd like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cartridge has been successfully tested on Garmin Oregon and on an Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Garmin Oregon/Colorado:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the appropriate cartridge for your device from here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wherigo.com/cartridge/details.aspx?CGUID=c50dea49-2007-448e-8690-48a9aa9b43fb&quot;&gt;Wherigo cartridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the file into the /Wherigo folder on your device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch the Wherigo app from the main menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Android:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=menion.android.whereyougo&quot;&gt;WhereYouGo&lt;/a&gt; app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the &lt;b&gt;&quot;PocketPC&quot;&lt;/b&gt; cartridge for your device from here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wherigo.com/cartridge/details.aspx?CGUID=c50dea49-2007-448e-8690-48a9aa9b43fb&quot;&gt;Wherigo cartridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the file into the /sdcard/WhereYouGo folder on your device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch the WhereYouGo app and tap &quot;Start.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: I've noticed that WhereYouGo sometimes shuts off the GPS receiver, so check on that if you're at a waypoint and it isn't triggering. You can also shut off the &quot;Disable when hidden&quot; setting under Settings &amp;gt; GPS and location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;iPhone:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't have any firsthand experience with iPhone, but you can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wherigo/id385035547?mt=8&quot;&gt;Whereigo&lt;/a&gt; by Pi-Soft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Wherigo apps are a little flaky, so &lt;b&gt;save your game often&lt;/b&gt;, normally by exiting and relaunching the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have problems, or have a new device to report, feel free to let me know and I'll do my best to help. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

This is the first WhereIGo I've done. It was a nice tour of Peoria and an introduction to the artist Preston Jackson. I have seen most of these sculptures over the years, but I've never realized they were the work of one artist.

TFTWIG!

This one took me longer than it should have...I actually looked in the correct spot first, but my hand must have just missed it, and I went on to search other areas.  Came back to the original spot to do one more sweep before leaving and...there it was!

Little known fact about MrLuckyPants: he once brought disco back, but then thought better of himself and returned it to its rightful owner.

They made the difficulty in signing the log a little higher than what the permanent placement will be (I'm sure they'll post pics).  Korey99 originally got me started caching, and when Boris72 joined us we really started hitting the finds.  They've been great caching partners over the last couple of years, and I really appreciate the effort Boris72 went to on the FTF challenge.  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Although I found the cache today and the container is fine, I am posting a &quot;needs maintenance&quot; log because it is most definitely on private property...I know this because I ran into the property owner during my last visit to grab &quot;Before CSNY&quot; which was originally located near this spot as well (before he made me move it).  The tree stand nearby is evidence enough of it being his property, if not for the fact that the nearby home is only about a tenth of a mile away.

I would hate to see another cacher have a run-in with the land owner, as he wasn't the friendliest, or worse yet get shot by him (he is a hunter).  Hence, this one needs to be moved further south.  I would have done it today being a PAC member myself, but I was out of time and needed to get home.  Thanks...</groundspeak:text>

hard-to-retrieve cache down by the river. It's intended to be a
physical challenge, and won't be retrievable by all cachers. The
terrain to get to ground zero is pretty sedate, but the last
several feet might give you some problems.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cache is located near an area visited by fishermen, but most
of the time you'll have the area to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's located in plain sight, but out of the normal view of those
not actively looking for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be careful when retrieving the cache, and don't attempt
it if you have doubts about your abilities. Also, please be
respectful of the environment by not using any equipment or
techniques that might damage the plant life. I test-retrieved it
without any gear, so it's possible to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that not everyone who logs this cache will have
physically retrieved it him or herself, but if you do the retrieval
for a group, be sure to take the credit you deserve in the
logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun, and be safe!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Came back here today to try again, but guess I need to work on building my upper body strength some more, as the end result was another epic fail!  In the process, I noticed TWO cache containers on the &quot;birch&quot;, but the CO confirmed that both were his after a quick conversation - looks like the original got moved MUCH higher than originally hidden.  The replacement was not meant to be for me today, either. [:(]  I'll be back...</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So close to home (less than a mile)...so far away from FTF!  Finally had a few minutes to spare today and stopped by while en route from work to mi casa.  Definitely a high-traffic area - parking off-road while avoiding traffic flow is certainly a challenge at 5pm, and stealth...forget about it!  It's pretty much impossible to remain muggle-invisible here.  Regardless, I quickly made my way to GZ, found the cache, signed the log, replaced it, and jetted back to the car before any law enforcement could show up to inquire what I was doing with/on city property.

Container is really more of a micro than a small...this threw me off for a minute, as I was looking around the tree for a true small container (since that is where the coordinates took me), but all I got there was an allergic reaction to the needles!  I finally thought some more about the hint and then easily made the find.

Thanks for the fun cache! SL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

my favorite geocaches to log was &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC1REAJ&quot;&gt;P2 Extreme&lt;/a&gt;. Finding the cache
wasn't hard, but grabbing it was! I wanted to place one along the
same lines. This one isn't &quot;extreme&quot; but the challenge is in the
retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Located near the Taco Bell, which I like because they always
give large drinks with their combo meals. The container is a small
bison tube. Parking is easy, and locating the cache may not be too
difficult, but retrieving it will require some ingenuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safety first: you'll know the you've found the right hiding
place without touching anything, so don't dig around in spots you
shouldn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't disassemble anything, please. It won't be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Here volunteers from the Peoria area were prepared for combat in the Civil War.  In all, 536 Peoria County men gave their lives for the preservation of the Union.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This monument marks the location of the camp and is inscribed with the dates of muster for the newly-trained regiments and their commanding officer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a nano in an urban setting.  Some stealth may be required as well as tools to aid in the retrieval.

(And yes, I took the &quot;right&quot;, i.e. long, way - no brute force shortcuts for me today!)  I brought a replacement log and baggie with me, not knowing what to expect for sure, but didn't need it as the original log is still nice and dry!  My only regret was not wearing gloves for this cache - it's COLD in there nowadays! Definitely going on my favorites list. SL TFTC

P.S. For anyone having doubts on attempting this one - if this 6'4&quot;, 230lb cacher can fit in there - then you can, too, if taking the CO's intended route! [:D]</groundspeak:text>

#10 of 34 found on an absolutely gorgeous day along with a few dnf's. The morning started early with a nice drive down Rt. 9 through B-N and over to Mackinaw for the first find of the day. Then there was a cache I saw but couldn't sign and 1 I couldn't look for. Managed to grab 1 more before making my way to the park. So 2 found before crossing the river and then met up with Team Jimni, Ge0Jester, Ge0Scavenger, and NoLemon for some group caching of some multis.

We found three multis together and then got stuck on the other side of Haynes park behind an antique tractor show. I don't take well to people telling me I can't go through just because of some old tractors. I grew up on a farm, I've seen enough tractors to last a lifetime. So I drove through the grass, around the announcer, and then along side the tractor parade and parked over near Haynes Our Way. Then I wait because the rest of the caravan stopped. Then frustration starts to set in. This tractor parade is long and SLOW. Finally I see the rest of the group walking my way. So we hit the trail. Now it was mid-afternoon and I hadn't ate anything yet. After searching 3 diff. locations and no luck we return to parking lot. So hungry, tired, confused and frustrated, NoLemon and I agree we should move on. Took some convincing to get Team Jimni to join us. On to Alpha Park and after that find, Team Jimni and NoLemon return to Haynes and I headed North. Grabbed a few solo finds, met fathead67 and did a couple with them, then off for quite a few more solo finds and another dnf. Finally stopped at 9:30pm and started the long drive home. 

Thanks for all the great caches I found today and even a couple of the dnf's because I'll be back.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was thinking the other day of all the places I've been, all the
places I've cached, and all the places I might want to cache. Since
I have most of the local caches, I came up with a few places I
could go. Manchester, Connecticut; Tangent, Oregon; Hauppauge, New
York; Tacoma, Washington and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In honor of the man, the myth, the geo-legend that introduced me to caching in 2009...korey99 finally hit 1000 finds!  This hide should be an almost-P&amp;G for the seasoned cacher.  The cache is a specialized container, in honor of a special man! It contains room only for log and small pathtags, so BYOP.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://peoriaareacachers.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Korey and I have shared lots of memories over the past 17 years. He's one of the smartest people I know, and has a special knack for creating puzzle caches that give me fits!  Having the opportunity to learn the geocaching trade from him, and meet the local caching community, has been a special highlight for sure! What better way to honor him than with a 1000 find milestone tribute cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a small ammo can. Please stay out of the electrical box - it is NOT located on or around there. Use caution and stealth when retrieving as traffic on the nearby road is extremely busy. Shouldn't be a problem if you try not to call much attention to yourself. Parking is available near the cache. Good luck and happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>

I don't think it would be a good idea to wear sandals to retrieve this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This park has something for just about everybody including fishing, picnic areas, baseball and soccer fields and of course, playground equipment.  You may need to use stealth when there are games going on. You will need to bring your own pen to place your name on the log sheet.  Good luck.

Found with MutherAndSun and super_cacher on the way to the CIGA Cookout. Muther and I were still tired from Thursday's Indy caching and Super_cacher was sunburnt but we still managed to have a pretty good day caching.

stared at the moon to long, because when looking at the coords, all
I saw were these symbols. Maybe you can find this Cache.

strong following for both the &lt;b&gt; St. Louis
Cardinals&lt;/b&gt; and the &lt;b&gt;Chicago
Cubs&lt;/b&gt;. The National League teams have a great division
rivalry. Let's find out which has the best geocachers. &lt;br /&gt; 
 &lt;br /&gt;
 Find the cache, a small container with log, pencil and trading
items, at a baseball field. In your Web log entry, let us know your
favorite team (White Sox fans are OK, too). We'll see which team
scores the most finds. 
&lt;p&gt;No climbing needed. If the terrain confuses your readings, try
approaching from an open area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Placed with permission of the Peoria Park District. Park past
the outfield to avoid muggles. Check the gallery for location
photos.&lt;/p&gt;

Alas the cache had gone missing. So while he is balancing up in the air we all scramble to put together a new cache for him. Then we all had to figure out a way to get it up to him. What a fun time. You Peoria Cachers sure do like to get the blood pumping. Thanks for the fun.</groundspeak:text>

Spotted this one pretty quickly within a minute or so of searching...retrieving the container was a bit trickier, but I finally got it!  Not sure what the muggles on the nearby shore were thinking, watching four of us in kayaks poking around in the cove...but at least they can't muggle it! [:D]  

Very nicely done hide!  Oh, and I prefer &quot;Dercy Cups&quot;, myself. [:P]  SL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Decided to finish the afternoon completing the Bradley Park caches, since I hadn't yet found many of them.  I parked near the bridge by Bradley Park #1 Microcache and hiked to all of the rest in a huge loop, which drastically changed the terrain rating for some of them, but it was all in good fun and I enjoyed the exercise! [:D] 

This was my third find in the park today, after hoofing it up the hill from Microcache #2.  I'm surprised this one hasn't been muggled yet, given its accessibility to small children and animals, and proximity to the dog park!  I did my best to cover it up as much as possible with natural camo once I signed the log. SL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Once we reached GZ, I quickly found You're Under Where!  [:P]  Retrieval/replacement was straightforward with the right tool and we were soon on our way to the next cache!  Thanks for the fun hide, and for helping me get another box completed on my well-rounded cacher grid with this cache!  SL TFTC

Then there were people fishing at one spot, the second spot had us scratching our heads for a few minutes, and then things went into the water at the last stop. Overall a great time! Better than a P&amp;G any day. TFTCSL </groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(12:53:42 PM/fwgb) Quick afternoon of caching on my day off.  Found this one on the ground a little farther away from GZ than I expected.  I replaced it in a non-clever obvious spot above where I found it, but from the previous logs, I'm assuming there was supposed to be someplace more clever.  I wish I knew what that was.

This was a fun one to hide, and test drive for the find after cruising around the rest of the lake. 

Thanks Korey for another clever cache! SL TFTC

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(12:35:55 PM/fwgb) Quick afternoon of caching on my day off.  I'd heard about this one before, but not by name.  I was glad to have stumbled upon it.  After checking each possibility a couple of times, I found the container in the grass below.  Found a spot that would accommodate it and replaced it.  Also, the log sheet was completely full.  TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://peoriaareacachers.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One of
my favorite geocaches to log was &lt;a href=&quot;http://coord.info/GC1REAJ&quot;&gt;P2 Extreme&lt;/a&gt;. Finding the cache
wasn't hard, but grabbing it was! I wanted to place one along the
same lines. This one isn't &quot;extreme&quot; but the challenge is in the
retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The container is a small bison tube. Locating the cache may not
be too difficult, but retrieving it will require some ingenuity.
You can park within a few feet from the cache, but there are some
weeds to deal with for the last couple of feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please don't disassemble anything. It won't be
necessary.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Harry LaHood Park...a new shelter cache awaits you! Placed with permission of Washington Park District.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://peoriaareacachers.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I decided that it was time to place another &quot;shelter challenge&quot; cache, to make all of the seasoned veterans in the area work a bit harder than usual! It's a tough find...but it's there...it blends in WELL. BYOP and an extraction tool.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to employ a great deal of stealth, as there is a LOT of muggle traffic most months of the year, and the difficulty rating is set accordingly for this. Please use common sense when hunting this cache, and no caching after dark per park district guidelines.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have fun, and happy caching!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>No hints will be given since this is a level 5 difficulty cache.  Good luck!</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My last find of the day coming back from a business trip to Madison.  I didn't arrive at the park until almost 7:30 PM, so grabbed my flashlight and ended up jogging the .35 miles to the cache in a race against sundown.  Lots of insects buzzing in the air but just brushed them aside and persisted.  Saw a family of white-tailed deer in the field near GZ, but my presence didn't seem to bother them one iota.

Quick find once I got close to GZ.  The flashlight came in handy for searching as it was getting dark under the tree cover, and expedited the process.  Weeds?  Not an issue today...I was wearing my trusty caching jeans. [:D]  Nothing that a properly suited teen/grown can't step through or around, anyway.

Well done hide!  SL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

We enjoyed the primary obstacle between the stages, though I don't know how his short little legs managed!  The final gave us some trouble, but we were making it too hard.  When we found it, Chris Hansen was nowhere to be seen.

By the time we finished up, we were a long way from where we parked (way farther than we'd planned), and sunlight was in short supply, so we called for extraction!  

Thanks for the cache, and for the additional checkmark on my well-rounded cacher chart.</groundspeak:text>

BYOP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ronald Reagan Museum at Eureka College http://www.eureka.edu/campus/museum.htm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ronald Reagan Peace Garden -- A Place of Remembrance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a May 9, 1982 speech at Eureka College, President Reagan challenged the Soviet Union to a new era of negotiations to reduce nuclear arms -- called START. The speech has been labeled &quot;The Beginning of the End of the Cold War.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To commemorate President Reagan's commitment to world peace and the important 1982 speech he presented at Eureka, the College dedicated the Ronald Reagan Peace Garden in May of 2000. The Peace Garden was a gift to the College from Mr. and Mrs. David J. Vaughan of Peoria Heights, Illinois.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dedicated on the 18th anniversary of what is known as &quot;The Eureka Speech,&quot; highlights of the Peace Garden include a bust of Mr. Reagan, sculpted by nationally-recognized artist, Lonnie Stewart. In designing the bust, Mr. Stewart commented, &quot;There are many different images of Ronald Reagan but I think the one that's most dear to the hearts of all the millions of Americans who loved him, is that Ronald Reagan smile. A smile of reassurance, of dignity and integrity, and one that we all know and love.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Peace Garden also includes a large remnant of the Berlin Wall. It is only fitting that a piece of the symbolic barrier between East and West that Mr. Reagan helped bring down has found a place at Eureka.</groundspeak:long_description>

Of course I saw &quot;placed on Peoria Park property&quot; in the description and assumed that this meant navigating through Glen Oak Park...NOT SO.  All routes through there ended at least a tenth of a mile away from GZ.  I finally zoomed out on my map and saw that Perry Street ran adjacent to the location, and made the drive around the heights to Adams Street and then so on and so forth.  Thankfully the find was super easy once I got there...this part of town always makes me a little nervous.  And hey, the container is exactly as described! [:D] SL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

No snow and little traffic made it much easier! Word of note though, there wasn't a back on the cache container to secure the log inside, it was dark so I didn't see anything else laying around...I just wedged the log and baggie back in the cache as securely as possible, hopefully it's the way it is supposed to be.

At least I got a nice hike out of this one, having parked off Spring Creek Road to avoid traffic. There was some snow driftage around GZ as well so I think it may be hiding the cache...I'll come back for this one in warmer (and drier) weather! TFTH

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Had to look at this one a few times before finally solving it. Found the cache quicker. TFTH.

#12 of 34 found on an absolutely gorgeous day along with a few dnf's. The morning started early with a nice drive down Rt. 9 through B-N and over to Mackinaw for the first find of the day. Then there was a cache I saw but couldn't sign and 1 I couldn't look for. Managed to grab 1 more before making my way to the park. So 2 found before crossing the river and then met up with Team Jimni, Ge0Jester, Ge0Scavenger, and NoLemon for some group caching of some multis.

We found three multis together and then got stuck on the other side of Haynes park behind an antique tractor show. I don't take well to people telling me I can't go through just because of some old tractors. I grew up on a farm, I've seen enough tractors to last a lifetime. So I drove through the grass, around the announcer, and then along side the tractor parade and parked over near Haynes Our Way. Then I wait because the rest of the caravan stopped. Then frustration starts to set in. This tractor parade is long and SLOW. Finally I see the rest of the group walking my way. So we hit the trail. Now it was mid-afternoon and I hadn't ate anything yet. After searching 3 diff. locations and no luck we return to parking lot. So hungry, tired, confused and frustrated, NoLemon and I agree we should move on. Took some convincing to get Team Jimni to join us. On to Alpha Park and after that find, Team Jimni and NoLemon return to Haynes and I headed North. Grabbed a few solo finds, met fathead67 and did a couple with them, then off for quite a few more solo finds and another dnf. Finally stopped at 9:30pm and started the long drive home. 

Thanks for all the great caches I found today and even a couple of the dnf's because I'll be back.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&quot;The End&quot; is a song by The Doors. Originally written by Jim Morrison as a song about breaking up with girlfriend Mary Werbelow,it evolved through months of performances at Los Angeles' Whisky a Go Go into a nearly 12-minute opus on their self-titled album. The band would perform the song to close their last set. It was first released in January 1967. &quot;The End&quot; was ranked at #336 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time (2010).

#9 of 34 found on an absolutely gorgeous day along with a few dnf's. The morning started early with a nice drive down Rt. 9 through B-N and over to Mackinaw for the first find of the day. Then there was a cache I saw but couldn't sign and 1 I couldn't look for. Managed to grab 1 more before making my way to the park. So 2 found before crossing the river and then met up with Team Jimni, Ge0Jester, Ge0Scavenger, and NoLemon for some group caching of some multis.

We found three multis together and then got stuck on the other side of Haynes park behind an antique tractor show. I don't take well to people telling me I can't go through just because of some old tractors. I grew up on a farm, I've seen enough tractors to last a lifetime. So I drove through the grass, around the announcer, and then along side the tractor parade and parked over near Haynes Our Way. Then I wait because the rest of the caravan stopped. Then frustration starts to set in. This tractor parade is long and SLOW. Finally I see the rest of the group walking my way. So we hit the trail. Now it was mid-afternoon and I hadn't ate anything yet. After searching 3 diff. locations and no luck we return to parking lot. So hungry, tired, confused and frustrated, NoLemon and I agree we should move on. Took some convincing to get Team Jimni to join us. On to Alpha Park and after that find, Team Jimni and NoLemon return to Haynes and I headed North. Grabbed a few solo finds, met fathead67 and did a couple with them, then off for quite a few more solo finds and another dnf. Finally stopped at 9:30pm and started the long drive home. 

Thanks for all the great caches I found today and even a couple of the dnf's because I'll be back.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://peoriaareacachers.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The cache is not
at the listed coordinates - they will take you to within 50 feet of
the final cache. From there you are on your own to find, and log,
the cache. No claiming a find unless you physically sign the log,
please.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a camo'd pill container. Parking is available
roadside on Cruger Road near the coordinates - do NOT park on route
24. Some stealth may be needed at times, although this is a
low-traffic area for the most part. Please use extra care when
handling the cache container in order to keep it secured in its
spot, and to keep it away from muggles and critters.&lt;br /&gt;

Maybe you can make some sense of them.&lt;br /&gt;

Once you have arrived at GZ, you are searching for a micro. BYOP.&lt;br /&gt;

It was a nice warm day with a decent breeze. Today it seemed like I tried to turn a few caches into Terrain 4 and then #2000 ended up being much more memorable than I had anticipated.

We got a slow and late start in the afternoon, only managed 12 before 5pm and then teamed up w/MutherAndSun for the All County cache and the rest of the evening. Got 3 more before dark and the rest at night. But our goals were completed, no calls to 911 and other than a tiny bruise that actually may have happened at an earlier cache, no injuries. We had planned to celebrate at Monical's but I was soaking wet and smelled like creek so I had to pass, bummer.

Ahh, Don, I found you. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Find #2000. I hadn't planned on doing this cache today because I had forgotton my 2 pounds. I hadn't planned on it being #2000 and I most certainly, DEFINITELY, ABSOLUTELY did not plan on it being that memorable. 

I told Muther I wanted to do one of Fuzzy's creative caches for #2000. Possibly the Chambers or maybe Hook and Loop. Nope she insisted that it should be Thats Water Under The Bridge, she did say in her log it was her favorite Fuzzy cache. I said I forgot my 2 lbs. She said, That's OK I got enough.

So this was stop #3 on what I will now refer to as Fuzzy's &quot;MacGyver&quot; series. We retrieved the cache and then the next few seconds are a bit of a blur. I know Fuzzy said Thats Water Under The Bridge but apparently I didn't believe him because I decided to check for myself. Next thing I know neither of my feet are on solid ground. Oh crap, this is going to hurt. Here is a graphical representation of the last thing TSC and MutherAndSun saw [:O]. SPLASH. 

Landed Belly flop, face down in the soft sand/mud/water. First thing I hear is MutherAndSun &quot;PAM!&quot;. I lift my head, evaluate my pain, spit the creek water out and reply &quot;I'm ok&quot;. I was so far away I guess they didn't hear me cause Muther is still yelling &quot;PAM&quot; and TSC &quot;Are you OK?&quot; So I jump up and reply again &quot;I'm fine, REALLY&quot;. Now I would like to say it was my Cat-like reflexes that saved me, but I believe it was pure Luck. Lucky that there were no big rocks down there, cause that wouldn't have been pretty. I believe I got by with just one small bruise.

I climb back up, assure them that I'm really OK, and then I believe I said &quot;So, where is that LOG?&quot; There were a couple OMG I'm fine hugs, some WhooHoo!'s yelled out into the dark Peoria night, and some Happy Dances performed badly.[:D]

Down the road, we were still in shock that I wasn't hurt in any way. Then we laughed and laughed. And celebrated some more. Then laughed some more. Talk about memorable. I guess for 3000 I'll have to pick a 1/1 so nobody will be scared. I'm sorry for freaking everybody out, it wasn't my intention to turn this into a terrain 4 or was it a 5.

The original plan was for a post-caching celebration at Monical's, but I was soaking wet from head to toe and smelled like creek. And No, that's not a new fragrance from Paris Hilton.

Dropping Signal coin in cache and picking back up because it was in my pocket and went into the creek with me.

Thanks Fuzzy for the creative hides. Thanks TSC, MutherAndSun, super_cacher, and Lil Sis for being there to celebrate with me.

And as Los Lonely Boys would say &quot;I'm Still Alive, so I say ORALE!&quot;
So ORALE and Gracias!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Another football season is in the air, and this year, Washington's Teenage Mutant Ninja Panthers have constructed a new secret lair closer to their rivals! However, they've lost the new micro that contains the source of their power and energy to defeat their rivals. It's somewhere in the murky depths of the lair...can YOU help them find it and ensure victory for the team?
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://peoriaareacachers.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You are looking for a micro with only a log. The listed coordinates will take you to the entrance of the secret lair...from here, it's up to you to find and locate the cache. BYOP, a flashlight, and oh yes, old clothes...as you may get dirty and wet attempting to save the day for the TMNP!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is located off of right-of way. Placed with permission of nearby land owner. Recommended parking coordinates are listed, please use them - do NOT park on route 24! Please take care when handling the cache so as not to detach it from its hiding spot...and wear your stealth suit, at least for the first leg of your journey. No night caching please, and Sunday mornings are also not recommended for hunting this cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Back in the 19th century, the phrase &quot;Will it play in Peoria?&quot; was used to ask whether a given product, person, promotional theme, or event will appeal to mainstream (also called &quot;Main Street&quot;) America, or across a broad range of demographic and psychographic groups. Extrapolating this to geocaching, will IT play in Peoria? I say a resounding YES!
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://peoriaareacachers.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In the United States, Peoria, Illinois, has legendary status as a test market. Peoria has long been seen as a representation of the average American city, because of its demographics and its perceived mainstream Midwestern culture. In the 1960s and 1970s, Peoria was deemed an ideal test market by various consumer-focused companies, entertainment enterprises (films and concert tours), even politicians, to gauge opinion, interest and receptivity to new products, services and campaigns.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the 1980s and 90s, comedians like Sam Kinison and musicians such as Bob Dylan, Robert Plant, Metallica and Phil Collins all perfected and launched concert tours in Peoria. During Presidential campaigns, major TV networks would visit Peoria to &quot;take the pulse&quot; (gauge the response) of everyday Americans on national issues and candidates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Peoria's historical test market status can be attributed to a number of factors. The term 'Heartland of America' refers to this region, though over the years the moniker has been embraced by other markets as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for a typical small-sized container, large enough to hold average travel bugs, geocoins, and pathtags, as well as a few small toys and trinkets for kids. BYOP. Cache is on public property and is handicap accessible. There is no need to climb the retaining wall or enter any private property to find the cache. Please be respectful of the area and nearby local businesses, and wear your stealth suit as this is an urban cache near the busiest road in town. Should be a quick park and grab for all but the newest of cachers.</groundspeak:long_description>

This would have definitely been easier to find in the winter though, at least without anything on the ground.  I'm not sure that the statement applies to this location though...there ALWAYS seems to be stuff on the ground here!  Less weeds and green in the winter, anyway. [:P]

#11 of 34 found on an absolutely gorgeous day along with a few dnf's. The morning started early with a nice drive down Rt. 9 through B-N and over to Mackinaw for the first find of the day. Then there was a cache I saw but couldn't sign and 1 I couldn't look for. Managed to grab 1 more before making my way to the park. So 2 found before crossing the river and then met up with Team Jimni, Ge0Jester, Ge0Scavenger, and NoLemon for some group caching of some multis.

We found three multis together and then got stuck on the other side of Haynes park behind an antique tractor show. I don't take well to people telling me I can't go through just because of some old tractors. I grew up on a farm, I've seen enough tractors to last a lifetime. So I drove through the grass, around the announcer, and then along side the tractor parade and parked over near Haynes Our Way. Then I wait because the rest of the caravan stopped. Then frustration starts to set in. This tractor parade is long and SLOW. Finally I see the rest of the group walking my way. So we hit the trail. Now it was mid-afternoon and I hadn't ate anything yet. After searching 3 diff. locations and no luck we return to parking lot. So hungry, tired, confused and frustrated, NoLemon and I agree we should move on. Took some convincing to get Team Jimni to join us. On to Alpha Park and after that find, Team Jimni and NoLemon return to Haynes and I headed North. Grabbed a few solo finds, met fathead67 and did a couple with them, then off for quite a few more solo finds and another dnf. Finally stopped at 9:30pm and started the long drive home. 

Thanks for all the great caches I found today and even a couple of the dnf's because I'll be back.</groundspeak:text>

Must have gotten washed away despite my quick grab out of the water.  I did not have the necessary supplies on hand to make the repair myself, so this one will need some maintenance. Sorry for the trouble Fuzzy...guess the cache lived up to its name after all!]

In the meantime, so as not to leave the site cacheless, I hung it on a sidewall bolt near GZ.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Had trouble finding 2 of the answers. Finally found 1 and took a guess at the other. Looks like I was right because I signed the log. TFTH.

#13 of 34 found on an absolutely gorgeous day along with a few dnf's. The morning started early with a nice drive down Rt. 9 through B-N and over to Mackinaw for the first find of the day. Then there was a cache I saw but couldn't sign and 1 I couldn't look for. Managed to grab 1 more before making my way to the park. So 2 found before crossing the river and then met up with Team Jimni, Ge0Jester, Ge0Scavenger, and NoLemon for some group caching of some multis.

We found three multis together and then got stuck on the other side of Haynes park behind an antique tractor show. I don't take well to people telling me I can't go through just because of some old tractors. I grew up on a farm, I've seen enough tractors to last a lifetime. So I drove through the grass, around the announcer, and then along side the tractor parade and parked over near Haynes Our Way. Then I wait because the rest of the caravan stopped. Then frustration starts to set in. This tractor parade is long and SLOW. Finally I see the rest of the group walking my way. So we hit the trail. Now it was mid-afternoon and I hadn't ate anything yet. After searching 3 diff. locations and no luck we return to parking lot. So hungry, tired, confused and frustrated, NoLemon and I agree we should move on. Took some convincing to get Team Jimni to join us. On to Alpha Park and after that find, Team Jimni and NoLemon return to Haynes and I headed North. Grabbed a few solo finds, met fathead67 and did a couple with them, then off for quite a few more solo finds and another dnf. Finally stopped at 9:30pm and started the long drive home. 

Thanks for all the great caches I found today and even a couple of the dnf's because I'll be back.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found w/TSC, MutherAndSun, super_cacher, and Lil Sis on a half-day trip to Peoria with a couple goals-The All-County Challenge and Find #2000. It was a nice warm day with a decent breeze. Today it seemed like I tried to turn a few caches into Terrain 4 and then #2000 ended up being much more memorable than I had anticipated.

We got a slow and late start in the afternoon, only managed 12 before 5pm and then teamed up w/MutherAndSun for the All County cache and the rest of the evening. Got 3 more before dark and the rest at night. But our goals were completed, no calls to 911 and other than a tiny bruise that actually may have happened at an earlier cache, no injuries. We had planned to celebrate at Monical's but I was soaking wet and smelled like creek so I had to pass, bummer.

1st stop of what I will now refer to as Fuzzy's &quot;MacGyver&quot; series. I had the Hook but not the Loop. Muther had to explain that I was not on the right track. Luckily she had the right stuff and after a few tries we were successful. Thanks Fuzzy, off to buy more stuff.</groundspeak:text>

A couple miles away though and I don't know if I leaned on the touch pad or a button got stuck on the laptop or what happened but all of a sudden the laptop starts opening multiple Internet Explorer windows. Not 2, not 5, not 10, not 25, not 50, but something like a gazillion. I'm clicking them closed and clicking close group as fast as I can but they just keep coming. And more, and more, and they're still opening. Hurry, shut it down. I close the Delorme program and close Mapsend and click hibernate (thought I was clicking shut down). Start it back up and guess what they're still opening. Hand it over to Muther for a proper shut down and reboot. Finally when it came back up everything was back to normal. Now hurry, meeting starts in 2 minutes and we're 17.6 miles away.

Found with MutherAndSun and Super_cacher on the way to the CIGA meeting. Orale! and TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

Saw this one was back up so I finally put the jigsaw puzzle together a couple days ago. After a few disappointing dnf's in the early afternoon, I was glad to be able to find 3 Fuzzy B puzzle hides in a row. That felt good. Thanks again B.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://peoriaareacachers.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I drive over this
bridge often when en route to I-39 and decided it was time to place
a cache here. This cache is intended to be a challenge and may not
be retrievable by everyone. Know your limits and be safe. It is
possible to retrieve it without specialized equipment, if you put
your MacGyver skills to work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Parking is available roadside by the bridge, or there is a gravel
pulloff just east of the bridge if you wish to use that. Some
stealth may be required en route to the cache. Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

It was a nice warm day with a decent breeze. Today it seemed like I tried to turn a few caches into Terrain 4 and then #2000 ended up being much more memorable than I had anticipated.

We got a slow and late start in the afternoon, only managed 12 before 5pm and then teamed up w/MutherAndSun for the All County cache and the rest of the evening. Got 3 more before dark and the rest at night. But our goals were completed, no calls to 911 and other than a tiny bruise that actually may have happened at an earlier cache, no injuries. We had planned to celebrate at Monical's but I was soaking wet and smelled like creek so I had to pass, bummer.

2nd stop of what I will now refer to as Fuzzy's &quot;MacGyver&quot; series. 1st chamber-no problem, 2nd chamber-no problem, 3rd-hmmm, back to the Jeep for a MacGyver tool and flashlight. 1st try-nope, 2nd try-nope, 3rd try-gotcha. All is well. Now off to #2000....TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

I pretended to&lt;br/&gt;hear, something else instead. When I last saw him, he asked me to&lt;br/&gt;stay. Sorry Dad, had to drive home, it was a long day. We wasted&lt;br/&gt;time, lost many years.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found w/TSC, MutherAndSun, super_cacher, and Lil Sis on a half-day trip to Peoria with a couple goals-The All-County Challenge and Find #2000. It was a nice warm day with a decent breeze. Today it seemed like I tried to turn a few caches into Terrain 4 and then #2000 ended up being much more memorable than I had anticipated.
 
We got a slow and late start in the afternoon, only managed 12 before 5pm and then teamed up w/MutherAndSun for the All County cache and the rest of the evening. Got 3 more before dark and the rest at night. But our goals were completed, no calls to 911 and other than a tiny bruise that actually may have happened at an earlier cache, no injuries. We had planned to celebrate at Monical's but I was soaking wet and smelled like creek so I had to pass, bummer.

1st stop after The IL All County Challenge. After traveling all over the state and logging a cache in 102 counties what's better than a cache you barely have to get out of your car for. Thanks Fuzzy.

Very good climbing gear would be the best way to do this.&lt;br/&gt;If you are not able to replace it, DON'T DO IT !!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Its my intention to provide a Challenge, not put people at risk.&lt;br/&gt;There are safe ways to do this, think about.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is a good idea to not drop it after retrieval but we found it after a little river dredging and replaced where found. Everyone signed the log and we were on our way to the next. Orale! Live, laugh, love, cache.</groundspeak:text>

It's still under construction so it will be much easier to access once paving is completed. Parking is avaiable at several different locations but will require a short walk to a small wooded area. Bushwacking may be required once undergrowth has developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You're looking for a small cylindrical container that is big enough for the log,a pen,and small trading items.</groundspeak:long_description>

travels through time &amp; space in his TARDIS. Look for the 4th
Doctor's little blue box. Due to the difficulties with travel
through time &amp; space this series will not be posted in
chronological order.&lt;/p&gt;

look under the lid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odd numbered Doctors have the Latitude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even numbered Doctors have the Longitude.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctor Who is a British science fiction television programme
produced by the BBC. The programme depicts the adventures of a
mysterious and eccentric Time Lord known as the Doctor who travels
through time and space in his time machine, the TARDIS (an acronym
for Time And Relative Dimension(s) In Space), which normally
appears from the exterior to be a blue 1950s British police box.
With his companions, he explores time and space, faces a variety of
foes and saves civilizations, helping people and righting wrongs.
The programme is listed in Guinness World Records as the
longest-running science fiction television show in the world. It
was during the Fourth Doctor's time that the series' fandom took
off, including the first convention in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old
alien, a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, who travels in time
and space in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the
Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body but in
doing so gains a new physical appearance and with it, a distinct
new personality. Tom Baker portrayed the Fourth Doctor from
1974-1981. The Fourth Doctor is a natural bohemian who permanently
left UNIT in order to return to a life of deep universal wandering.
More so than his previous incarnations, he is thrilled by discovery
and adventure. During one of these adventures he acquires the
robotic dog K-9. Galvanized by higher purpose, he is disarmingly
loopy (constantly offering friends and foes jelly babies). To an
extent, the Fourth Doctor is the most unpredictable of his
incarnations, befuddling all with his intelligence, constantly
leaving others wondering if they have his full attention and using
his more off the wall mannerisms against adversaries to distract
them while arranging to take control of the situation. His keen
judge of character also enables him to navigate his way through
situations with new people, helping him to discern friend from foe.
Although like all his selves he prefers his brain over his brawn,
he is a capable swordsman and fighter, following on from the
martial expertise of his immediate former self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite his charm and offbeat humour, the Fourth Doctor is
arguably more aloof and sombre than his previous incarnations. He
could become intensely brooding, serious and even callous, and
would keenly scrutinise his surroundings even when playing the
fool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Would you like a jelly baby?&quot; - the Fourth Doctor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always be on the look out for Daleks, Cyberman, Autons, the
Master, Sontarans, Silurians, Slitheen, Ood, Judoon, Weeping Angels
and the occasional Muggle.&lt;/p&gt;

We made a date for a movie which is a rarity for us.  Had dinner at Quizno's first but when we got to the theater, the 7 pm showing of &quot;The Blind Side&quot; was sold out.  So, we wasted some time at Office Max, mosied next door for a drink (or two) at Applebee's, then hung out at the theater until the 9:10 showing.  This cache popped up on the Blackberry just before the show began.  After the show we headed over to the cache site and even with some trouble with the cacheberry Rick was able to locate the treasure.  

I had previously found A Real Stretch with icuspark after two attempts and a trip into Lowes for supplies to make a special tool in order to retrieve the cache.  That one was a challenge but well worth the effort.  

Thanks for the Cache!</groundspeak:text>

After placing the Cache I found the north access, which is a third shorter distance, than coming in from the south. With all the side tunnels there may even be other ways to access this one.

The South part remains a&lt;br/&gt;wetland when the river runs over its banks.&lt;br/&gt;More recently, the park has acquired a new playground and other&lt;br/&gt;facilities. While you are there, enjoy the view of the river.&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a small plastic container holding small&lt;br/&gt;trading items.&lt;br/&gt;River note: During the Spring, the river floods parts of the&lt;br/&gt;park. While the cache is in a safe area, use appropriate caution if&lt;br/&gt;the river is above flood stage.&lt;br/&gt;Placed with permission from the Village of Peoria Heights.&lt;br/&gt;Benchmark&lt;br/&gt;Benchmark LC1335 is located nearby at N40 45.040 W089 33.605. Drive&lt;br/&gt;across the road, and park at Bielfeldt Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Link to CIGA Home Page</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to GOCC! Thanks to my historical relationship with this church, they have enthusiastically embraced geocaching and have allowed me to place several hides here on their land. This one is an easy handicapped-accessible park and grab, geared for new geocachers and anyone wanting an easy boost for their numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a small-sized clear container. Contains log only, so BYOP. There is some room for small items/swag.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plenty of parking within walking distance, although the lot gets busy a few days out of the week. Sunday mornings are not a good time to look for this cache. Permission obtained from land owner. Please no caching after dark, and also replace cache exactly as found in order to avoid muggling and preserve difficulty for the next cacher.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and happy caching! </groundspeak:long_description>

We just finished eating and went over to grab this one.  After finding it, we were walking back around the building to where our car was when a security officer (at least that's what he claimed...no uniform and in an unmarked car) asked what we were doing.  &quot;We are just taking a walk while waiting for our friends to finish paying the bill and use the restroom.&quot;

This is my first cache in Peoria, and the first time I've been back to Peoria in ten years.  I grew up here and we got this after finally fulling a 10 year old craving for Monical's Pizza.  TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Didn't have my GPS with me, but knowing where to look from last time, I managed to find it without any trouble in about five minutes of searching.  Guess my geosense was working overtime today after yesterday's night caching! [:)] Looks like there are actually two logs in the container now, wasn't sure which to sign, so signed both.  Finally able to knock the last Willow Knolls cache off of my list!  SL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

25 of 31 found w/TSC on a short Peoria area excursion w/Your Name in Lights being the primary goal. It was a beautiful, not too hot day, with a nice breeze. Enjoyed hunting the caches as always and found some very nice hides. Thanks for all the hides.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A new puzzle cache for your intellectual stimulation. Solve the puzzle below to determine the final location of the cache. The final is a typical micro container in a traditional park and grab location.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://peoriaareacachers.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; To find and log this cache, Sir Occam's Razor shall apply,&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;How do I do THAT?&quot;, the average cacher may reply.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem&quot;, some will say,&lt;br /&gt;
Confused by Latin definition?  Then I'll put it this way:&lt;br /&gt;
A set of theories put before you,  &lt;br /&gt;
Competing for prediction,&lt;br /&gt;
Hypotheses for which you must&lt;br /&gt;
Elect an explanation.&lt;br /&gt;
I'll strip it down to just one sentence:&lt;br /&gt;
Simplest is the best!&lt;br /&gt;
Assumptions should be minimized&lt;br /&gt;
To help complete your quest.&lt;br /&gt;
The Razor, when in science, is&lt;br /&gt;
Heuristic in its use.&lt;br /&gt;
Einstein and&lt;br /&gt;
Poincaré recognized it in their proofs.&lt;br /&gt;
Other versions of the theorem also do exist,&lt;br /&gt;
Stephen Hawking, paraphrased, extrapolated this:&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;There may be laws in place that set&lt;br /&gt;
Events most predetermined, for&lt;br /&gt;
Deities who&lt;br /&gt;
Could observe all mass and not disturb it.&lt;br /&gt;
On the other hand, such models&lt;br /&gt;
Of the universe&lt;br /&gt;
Really don't apply to mortals&lt;br /&gt;
Denoting the obverse.&lt;br /&gt;
I think it's therefore better to employ Sir Occam's Razor,&lt;br /&gt;
Negating things that cannot be observed by human gazer.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
A final word of wisdom, here, that I shall leave you with:&lt;br /&gt;
To find the cache, the use of Occam's Razor is the pith.&lt;br /&gt;
Encoded in this poem is the answer that you seek.&lt;br /&gt;
So read it once again, you'll find there's really no mystique.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check your answer for this puzzle on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=5a616ef28aa1389caf190e9f12447d02&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=474333505a3745&amp;amp;name=4f6363616d27732052617a6f72&quot;&gt;Geochecker.com&lt;/a&gt;. Good luck and happy caching!&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Remember the Razor's axim: simpler explanations are, other things being equal, generally better than more complex ones.  Possible explanations/solutions can get needlessly complex.  It is coherent, for instance, to add the involvement of Leprechauns to finding this geocache, but Occam's Razor would prevent such additions, unless they were necessary.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I remember when i used to go caching with BulliSue. This is a
special spot since it is the site of where he showed me what a
geocache was. I am hoping this gets him back into geocaching.</groundspeak:long_description>

Fortunately the find was mine after a few minutes today!  I repositioned the cache in its original intended hiding location, as per the PAF.  SL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

Since this area of Peoria doesn't yet have a convenient-yet-low-muggle-traffic TB hotel close to the highway/interstate exchange, I decided that it was time to place one. Bring your road-weary TBs here for a rest, trade, or the start of a new journey!
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://peoriaareacachers.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Large-sized camo'd container in public area with log book and pen, kid-friendly swag, and three TBs to get things started. Some stealth may be required at certain times of the day for the first 30-40 feet or so from parking, but once you're inside the treeline you should be golden. There are a few thorny/sticky pants you'll need to circumvent to reach the cache, so dress appropriately - long pants recommended! Please use the recommended parking, and be sure to replace the cache exactly as found in order to keep out of muggle visibility.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

Take some time to pull off the country roads and enjoy the area as you pass through to or from the big cities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is a small pill container with log only, so BYOP. It is located on public right-of-way. Bring your stealth suit as the nearby roads are a high traffic area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another interesting historical fact surrounding this cache location: when a F4 tornado stormed through here in 2004 and destroyed the original Parsons plant, all of the employees miraculously survived thanks to the foresight of Bob Parsons to include storm shelters in the original design. </groundspeak:long_description>

Couldn't come up with it in my brief inspection, but reading through the old logs now it seems that perhaps expanding my search might be in order.  Plus I managed to rip a seam in my work slacks climbing on the gate looking for it...so that promptly put an end to the search!  I'll be back when I have more time, and more durable pants.

Remember to enjoy the trip and look up from your GPSr occasionally! There are plenty of opportunities to smile here besides the ones on your gps.&lt;br /&gt;

Remember to enjoy the trip and look up from your GPSr occasionally! There are plenty of opportunities to smile here besides the ones on your gps.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://peoriaareacachers.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bring your Dandy Horse if you have one and start in Peoria. Move up the trail for 26 miles and locate these caches of various sizes, but not overly difficult hides.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember to enjoy the trip and look up from your GPSr occasionally! There are plenty of opportunities to smile here besides the ones on your gps.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trail is open from sunrise to sunset, please no night caching. &lt;a href=&quot;http://dnr.state.il.us/lands/Landmgt/PARKS/sitemaps/rockisland.gif&quot;&gt;For a trail map click here.&lt;/a&gt; A big thanks for the permission granted from DNR to place this series of caches.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Green Acres is the place to be...bring your hiking shoes, a pen/pencil, and plenty of geosense, because you're in for a +2.5 mile round trip cache hunt!
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://peoriaareacachers.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is a traditional multi-stage cache. No puzzles to solve or crazy containers, just lots of exercise and hunting skills required! Park at the Kickapoo Creek Recreation Area entrance (N 40 49.657 W 089 39.430) and hike your way to stage 1. Do NOT attempt to access the cache from the Rock Island Trail - none of the stages are on that trail, although the first stage is within a stone's throw. All stages are within roughly 100 feet of well-maintained trails.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are looking for micros at every stage except for the final, which is a regular sized ammo can which contains the logbook and some swag. Be sure to replace the container exactly as found to ensure that they stay in place, and to preserve the difficulty rating for the next person.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Placed with permission at Kickapoo Creek Recreation Area. While you're here, be sure to grab all of the other terrific geocaches nearby...and enjoy the hunt!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The only stage located on the ground is the final.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I managed my way through the already greening weeds and thickets to GZ, and located the cache without any trouble.

Tripped over a tree root on my way out and almost took out my left knee...in the process, I managed to pick up three or four wanted hitchhikers...TICKS!!!  Gah!  I quickly sent them to their doom as soon as I discovered them on my pants.  Be careful, folks!

Then on Sunday Brian mentioned that no one had logged it yet so we decided to do a drive by and check it out. Realized when we got there that we didn't have the proper equipment, so we would have to come back. Got there today and retrieved the container, signed log, and put back exactly as was found. I love it when my own evil mind comes back to haunt me. TFTCSL</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is located at the Clayton Cemetery near Benson. You will
need a Sharpie to log this cache and a fine point is best to save
room for the next loggers. Please do not tear up the bushes looking
for this cache, you won't find it there. Please show respect for
those resting here and remember that all Illinois cometaries are
not open after dark. I have bumped up the difficulty of this one
since so many experienced cachers are having trouble with it.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So Thelma &amp; Louise were supposed to meet in Bloomington at 8. Louise is always late. 8:15 they leave the Schnucks and pull into the gas station for some caching fuel. 8:20 they pull out of the gas station and not even 100ft from the station they're spotted by Hal, better known as Mr. Po Po. Thelma grabs the seatbelt that she always wears but somehow forgets when they're in the Cache Wrangler. Too late Hal has their number and as Louise pulls away from the stop light, Mr. Po Po turns on his pretty party lights. 

Louise knows she's in trouble because she let her license expire on her B-day. Mr. Po Po informs them they're both getting tickets for no seat belts and that Louise will have to appear in court for the expired license. Louise responds that she likes having Wednesday's off. I think Mr. Po Po has an eye for Louise because he says she seems &quot;like a real nice lady&quot;, to which Thelma has a hard time not laughing at. Louise and Thelma have to switch driver/navigator positions (well at least for 20 miles out of town). After 45 minutes of ticket writing, Thelma&amp;Louise finally get to leave town to begin their caching day.

....Later that same day- Thelma: Are you sure we should be driving like this, I mean in broad daylight and everything? 

Louise : No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last crime.

Thelma: Driiive Louise! Drive! Drive the car! Go! Go! Go go go go go go! 


Found cache on ground because it was replaced upside down. Orale and TFTC.

&lt;br /&gt;
The terrain is pretty flat but not quite wheelchair accessible.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is located in the Linn Mt Vernon Cemetery out in the
country, just a few miles from Washburn. This a beautiful, well
kept place. Notice that each corner is marked by concrete markers
and there are other small markers along the edge as you walk
around. I love the old fence that borders here. Please be
respectful of those resting here and remember that no cemetery in
Illinois is open after dark.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache could be handicache accessible if the ground is not wet.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There is no town or church anywhere near this cemetery, it is just
out in the country. The cache should not be hard to find but some
may have trouble extracting it from its hiding spot. The container
is really larger than a micro but smaller than a small and will
hold a micro coin. Please bring your own writing utensil. Please be
respectful of those resting here and remember that Illinois
cemeteries are closed after dark.</groundspeak:long_description>

Bjstover did the difficult part and after not coming up with the cache a call was made and some photos were sent to the owner confirming the cache was MIA. Sort of fitting for a cache called Vietnam. Got the ok to replace. Now since I didn't want bjstover to end up in a body cast before his wedding day which would probably cause me to become a POW, I offered to do the replacement. Hopefully this one will stay in place. I can definitely see this being a party spot during high school. Rock on. Orale! Live, laugh, love, cache.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The posted coords will take you to the site of one of Oregon, IL most popular attractions. Please remember that the park is open only from Dawn to Dusk. &lt;br/&gt;As you take in the view, you'll notice a sign posted near the stone wall. This is where you will get the answer to the question you need. But first, let's learn a bit about the statue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Black Hawk Statue, or The Eternal Indian, is a sculpture by Lorado Taft located in Lowden State Park which is near the city of Oregon, Illinois. The statue is perched over the Rock River on a 77 foot (23.5 m) bluff overlooking the city. &lt;br/&gt;The statue was created by Lorado Taft, beginning in 1908. Taft at first created smaller studies of what would become the statue. The statue itself was dedicated in 1911. Taft noted at the dedication that the statue seemed to have grown out of the ground. It stands on the ground that was once home to the Eagle's Nest Art Colony, which Taft founded in 1898. Though not publicized at the time of construction, original funds were exhausted before the completion of the work and future Illinois Governor Frank Lowden had stepped in to ensure that the statue was completed and erected.&lt;br/&gt;The statue stands 125 feet above the Rock River, though its height only accounts for 48 feet of that. Black Hawk weighs in at 536,770 pounds and is said to be the second largest concrete monolithic statue in the world. It wears a long blanket and stares across the river with folded arms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's something about the man the statue was inspired by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Black Hawk (1767 – October 3, 1838) was a leader and warrior of the Sauk American Indian tribe in what is now the United States. Although he had inherited an important historic medicine bundle, he was not one of the Sauk's hereditary civil chiefs. His status came from leading war parties as a young man, and from his leadership of a band of Sauks during the Black Hawk War of 1832.&lt;br/&gt;During the War of 1812, Black Hawk fought on the side of the British. Later he led a band of Sauk and Fox warriors, known as the British Band, against European-American settlers in Illinois and present-day Wisconsin in the 1832 Black Hawk War. After the war, he was captured and taken to the eastern U.S., where he and other leaders toured several cities. Black Hawk died in 1838 in what is now southeastern Iowa. He left behind an enduring legacy through many eponyms and other tributes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To log this cache, please answer the following question. On the bottom right hand corner of the sign is a photo of a man. What is his name? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***Congrats to LILLIBAS for getting the FTF!***&lt;br/&gt;***This cache is listed on Opencaching.com only!*** </groundspeak:long_description>

We've been to this park before, so we knew where it was.  What a great cache. Very well stocked with lots of cool stuff. We took the pathtag for our collection. We also took the Bass travel tag to enter in the GONIL tb race this year. I'm happy to see another cacher finding and placing hides on this site. Please keep it up! Other cachers will come around sooner or later.TFTC! It was alot of fun!</groundspeak:text>

The Sunset was originally named Lin's Air Theatre when it opened in the 1950's. Eventually, the theater took a turn for the worse in its later years during the 1980's. This is partly because the theater had to subject itself to showing pornographic films to attract customers. Those films were shown before laws were enacted that prohibit such films from being shown publicly in this manner now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efforts to re-open the drive-in in 2007 as a purely family venue for the enjoyment of citizens of the Stateline area were shot down by the efforts of people who live in the condominiums located near the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Info about the Sunset&lt;br/&gt;Screens: 1&lt;br/&gt;Car Capacity: 1000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The screen is still intact and in place over the rise you see to the South past the ticket booths that still can be seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please DO NOT ENTER the fenced off area to the South, obey the No Trespassing signs. Cache is located on Public Right-of-Way. The road this is located on can be heavily traveled at certain times of the day, so some efforts to be stealthy are recommended!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to rperchen for FTF!!! &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This cache is the first of two caches that I will be placing that were spawned by locutos' Cache full of Cache(s) Cache.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the fourth cache in a series that will educate cachers about some of the businesses and locales in the Rockford Area that have been lost to time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This should be a PNG but bring your own scribbler, and please return cache to its hiding spot! Also remember: this area is very overrun with muggles... Stealth required!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This parcel of land on the Northwest corner of the busy intersection to the South had at least three different businesses on it at one time before the building that now stands. I know of Murphy's Amoco Gas Station, Rockford Ski Shack, and a doughnut shop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But today, I bring you here not for those three lost businesses, but for something else on a larger scale that was lost long before...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fifty to Sixty years ago, Northwest of this place where the large neighborhoods now stand, there used to be nothing but farmland. Within several hundred yards of where you stand to get this cache, the large farm's buildings stood for many years. This particular farm was the Hill-Man Farms Dairy. The farmhouse stood about where the larger apartment buildings are along Harrison, just East of Buckbee Apartments. Also as part of the property, there used to be a Log Cabin further down Harrison where the car wash is now. The farm buildings including the large barn stood about where the smaller apartment buildings and houses are 100 yards West of the cache and North of Beach St. The entire Rolling Green neighborhood to the Northwest, including the land that Rolling Green Elementary School occupies, was created from Hill-Man's pasture lands. An aerial view of the area as it stood in 1948 is the page background and is included in the gallery of images.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The farm had many cattle that had won awards over the years before the farm disappeared. A small tabletop display with photos of some of the award-winning cattle still exists and is on display at Edwards Apple Orchard East in Poplar Grove (NE of Rockford at N42° 23.544, W88° 48.096). Some other historical data like an aerial photo showing the neighborhoods North and South of Harrison are on display as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More about the area: On the Southeast corner of the Alpine and Harrison Intersection stands Union Cemetery (aka Starkey Cemetery). The cemetery dates to the 19th Century, and is sometimes a landing spot for out-of-control vehicles. On the Southwest corner is where old Buckbee School used to stand. It's very hard to believe that this intersection used to be out in the country, or even the East end of town like it used to be!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More Trivia: The Swan Hillman Elementary School located within a mile of GZ was not named for the Dairy Farm, it was named for a man that, with three friends, founded Rockford Screw Products (now known as Rockford Products). Some info on Swan Hillman in the Company History of Rockford Products here: Rockford Products Corporation. Oh, the &quot;Watch for Livestock&quot; attribute is a tribute and a joke...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to triton66mike for FTF!!! &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It has been in this building for a bit of time but the focus on this cache is what this building used to be. This place used to be a Hollywood Dining Center and before that it was a Hollywood Drive In Restaurant. This Drive-In was a popular hang out in the 1960's and 1970's as told to me by natives of Rockford.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don't know much about the history of this establishment, only that I know that it was there. I originally intended to place this cache at the site of another popular Drive-In within .25 mile of this one called The Alps Root Beer Drive-In. That location is on Charles Street where El Burrito Loco now stands. I didn't think that that location would be really supportive of a cache, so I brought it here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While I have you here, I can also tell you about the building to the Southeast of the hide. That building is being renovated as a church but before that it was one of Rockford's original Hilander grocery stores. The store moved .60 mile South to a building vacated by Eagle grocery store. Hilander is a Rockford original and has been lost in a sense because the smaller chain was sold to Kroger in the past ten years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to triton66mike for FTF!!!&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

all of the places I have highlighted in the Lost Rockford Series so
far, this is the only place that I actually had been to myself. I
visited once in 1998 or 1999 when it was still a popular place to
hang out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Ing Skating Palace got its start in 1918 and was originally a
dance hall named The Inglaterra. In the period of time between
World War I and World War II, people flocked to the Ing to dance to
the music played by Big Bands led by notable band leaders such as
Lawrence Welk and Jimmy Dorsey. In the 1940's a national roller
skating craze started to emerge which led to the change of focus
from dance which created The Ing Roller Skating Palace. Eventually,
even though roller skating was a year-round-six-day-a-week mainstay
for The Ing, a return to the dance hall roots was undertaken in
later decades of its history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Ing Skating Palace was eventually sold and demolished in the
2000's to make way for the parking lot in which you stand to log
this cache.&lt;br /&gt;

placed on 01/01/2008 http://coord.info/GC18A69 : &quot;It's been nearly
a decade now since we left Chicago and moved to Rockford. Let this
cache commemorate that event.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the squeamish, there is a daycare playlot nearby, although a
psychological barrier exists between the cache and the lot. If the
kids are out and you're uncomfortable, just come at another
time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Happy New Years&quot; (Old FTF info removed)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;There have been some questions concerning the playlot. It has
been suggested that I stress that seekers should only seek this
cache after 6-7PM or on weekends and I agree. If you should happen
upon this hide outside of the recommended hours and the kids are
inside like on a rainy day, then cache on!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The original container was replaced with a standard container for a
cache of this type... PLEASE PLACE BACK IN THE ORIGINAL HIDE
LOCATION.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This hide is in tribute to one of Rockford's slightly hidden
jewels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please be stealthy when seeking. The parking structure nearby is
not free during the day, and charges $5 or more when an event is
being held at night and on weekends in one of the entertainment
venues nearby. I recommend using the parking coordinates and to not
seek the hide while an event is going on (unless you are attending
the event anyways).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Since 1956, Phantom Regiment Drum &amp; Bugle Corps has been wowing
audiences with their signature style. In 1972, Phantom Regiment
became one of the charter corps of Drum Corps International
(Marching Music's Major League). The corps has reached the finals
every year that they have competed since 1974 (top twelve).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The site near here where the parking structure stands is where many
alumni have told me that the original music hall the corps called
home was located. The hall burned down in 1964 or 1965. All of the
uniforms and instruments were lost in the fire. An attempt to field
a corps for the 1965 season failed due to lack of funds and a three
year hiatus ended in 1968 with Phantom Regiment's return to the
field.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Phantom Regiment became what it is known today in 1987. The corps
has consistently and aggressively brought complex classical music
to the field in a distinct powerful style with some forays into
lighter music along the way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Phantom Regiment has won two DCI World Class (formerly Division I)
championships: 1996's &quot;A Defiant Heart&quot; shared the title with the
Blue Devils of Concord, CA and 2008's &quot;Spartacus&quot; held the title
outright. If you drove into town by way of Business US 20 from
I-90, you would see a sign proclaiming the championships.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The corps is loved the whole world over (and hated in some
circles). I (RebelGTP) have had the opportunity to travel with this
corps during the 2009 and 2010 seasons and it has been a wonderful
ride for me. I actively volunteer my talents to the corps in the
off-season in the form of driving a coach bus shuttling the members
to camp sites and arrival/destination locations. My whole family
loves this corps for its approach to the music and how powerful the
music is brought to the field.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please join us in this humble tribute to our favorite drum
corps!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Also remember: much of the area surrounding hide is an Industrial Park... Stealth required!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Southwest of this location are the land parcels that were once the River Lane Outdoor Theatre. The theatre opened in 1948, operated until 1984, and was demolished in 1987.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the screen tower was still in place, you could stand here and watch a movie if one was shown. The screen tower paralleled River Lane in the distance and the screen faced North.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Info about River Lane Outdoor Theatre&lt;br/&gt;Screens: 1&lt;br/&gt;Car Capacity: 650-700&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is located on Public Right-of-Way.

Not only that, but then I saw my name in the description of this cache for being FTF! ! Cool!

My wife gets the credit for the find, as she was just walking out the door to go to our friends house very close to this park when I got the published notification. I had to take my daughter to her softball game, so my wife said she'd try to find it. I put the coords in the GPSr for her and told her to make Team dingoagogo proud! :)

She says it is not exactly camouflaged, but it is also not easy to see. She hunted about 10-15 minutes before she spotted it.

TFTC, and thanks for publishing on OpenCaching.com too!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Traditional cache in one of my grandpa's WWII ammo boxes. It's packed full of goodies for kids. Please replace whatever you take with something from your pocket. As of the time of hiding, it has two travel bugs (please take only one of them) and a trackable geocoin. FTF prize is the CD that contains tons of good music. Happy hunting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Located close to the belt line just off of Broadway in wonderful Monona, WI. Easy to access.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Look for the &quot;novel&quot; container in the top compartment and take a book if you see one that looks interesting. Geoswag and trackables too large for the container can live in here as well. This cache placed at our house and we give ourselves permission to keep it on the front lawn (pending any blizzards, this one should be pretty winter friendly).

should be south of the river where there is a parking area; use
Cloverland Dr.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The first part is located on signs read from a self-guided tour.
The self-guided tour is open to the public 24 hrs. a day; 7 days a
week. NOTE: Please get your information from the signs and not from
a brochure. Part 1: There were two horizontal generators installed;
one in 1922 and the other in 1924. Find the total rated capacity of
kilowatts of electrical power for these two generators. Subtract
170 (-170) from that number. This will get you AAA. Then find how
long (in miles) the Wisconsin River is. Subtract 115 (-115) from
that number. This will get you BBB. Final Cache: N45 54.AAA and
W089 19.BBB It is a 2 quart container wrapped in camouflage tape.
Enjoy the rest of the tour and the area.

Cache is a camo ammo can. Not handicap accessible without
help.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache contains logbook, pen and an assortment of trade items. A
special $ gold coin is included for FTF prize. I also place a
Travel Bug wanting to go to England.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy this cache and the tranquility and nature of the area. It is
a place I love to visit for rest/ relaxation in these beautiful
surrondings.

I've never been a fan of the &quot;I saw it from the car.&quot; logs, but in this case it was true. While the rest of the crew wandered around trying to figure out where you'd hide a &quot;regular&quot; cache around here, I stayed in the car for a quick getaway (and to figure out where we were going next). I looked out at their progress and something caught my eye so I told WiHi to check it out. Yup! Clever. Thanks for the fun stop along our journey.</groundspeak:text>

coordinates just incase one gets lost. The second cache will take
you on a short drive on the Military Road near a small lake in the
northern part of the Blackjack Springs Wilderness area. There are a
few trails that will take you to the cache. From one designated
parking place there is a nice .4 mile hike on a well established
wilderness trail to the lake. The cache is located a short distance
off the trail that goes around the lake. You may want to take your
swim gear and fishing pole along and make a day of it.

wrapped 35mm film container containing the coordinates for the
final part; the final is an ammo can. Since this cache is located
on the Eagle River Chain of Lakes, it is also accessible by boat.
When searching for the first part, please do not break any
branches. The 3 Difficulty Rating is for the first part only. The
Difficulty Rating for the final is closer to a 1.5.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Please visit the cache site between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and
10:00 p.m. Park in the restaurant parking lot (north side of
restaurant). The cache is on private property (with owners'
permission) in an area that was Eagle River's first settlement
(1855) then occupied by fur traders, woodsmen, and loggers. During
that time it consisted of a trading post, bank, and the first
regional post office. The trading post received furs from the
trappers, who were mostly Indians, in exchange for tobacco, meal,
flour, salt pork, and wearing apparel. The bank authourized the
first printing of paper currency. In the fall of 1860, the first
county votes for President Lincoln were cast here at the post
office. The area was given the Chippewa Indian name
“Kee-Mi-Con” which when translated means “I have
found it.” Please take time to reminisce the past and enjoy
the beauty. Lastly, be respectful of the property.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tale of Two Raindrops: Nicolet’s Watershed Divide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a Virtual Cache; there is no container. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1634, Jean Nicolet, a French explorer, “discovered” this area. The Nicolet Forest was established in 1933 and now comprises over 661,000 acres. There are over 1,500 ponds and lakes here with 34,000 surface acres of water and 500 miles of shoreline. Over 500 miles of fresh water streams snake through the forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forest features over 800 miles of trails which are open for hiking, mountain biking, cross country skiing, horseback riding, snowmobiling, and even dog sledding. Animals common to the forest include black bear, deer, wolves, bald eagles, loons, grouse, waterfowl, many species of songbirds and small mammals including the American Sables and the Fisher. If you choose to bring your own pets, you will need to keep them on a leash at all times and away from all beach areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine two raindrops falling from the clouds and landing only a few inches apart here at the Nicolet watershed divide. One falls just to the east of the ridge and the other falls a bit further west. These drops of water will take very different paths. The raindrops have fallen into different water basins and will end up over a thousand miles apart in two different oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A watershed is a land area which is drained by a stream or river. The borders of a watershed are called &quot;divides&quot;, because they divide the water's flow. In gently sloping terrain, divides may be hardly noticeable. In other areas divides can be mountains. Most small watersheds contribute to larger watersheds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hilly country, divides normally lie along topographical peaks and ridges, but in flat country (especially where the ground is marshy) the divide may be invisible – just a more or less notional line on the ground on either side of which falling raindrops will start a journey to different rivers, and even to different sides of a region or continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin is divided into 3 major river basins each identified by the primary water-body into which the basin drains. Wisconsin’s major river basins are the Lake Superior Basin, Mississippi River Basin and the Lake Michigan Basin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This location sits atop the Mississippi River and Lake Michigan divide. Water falling to the east of the nearby marker will flow into Franklin and Butternut lakes and then make their way to the Atlantic Ocean by way of the Lake Michigan Basin. Water falling to the west of the marker will flow into the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers then on to the Gulf of Mexico by way of the Mississippi River Basin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mississippi River Basin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mississippi River drainage basin is the world's second largest, draining 1.83 million square miles including tributaries from thirty-two U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. The Mississippi River watershed encompasses 40 percent of the contiguous United States .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lake Michigan Basin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lake Michigan basin covers more than 45,000 square miles and drains parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. Lake Michigan discharges into Lake Huron through the Straits of Mackinac at a rate that allows for a complete change of water about every 100 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; At the listed coordinates there is an informational sign.  Fill in the two blanks: &quot;Water is one of the most ___________    __________  of your National Forests.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

At the time of this cache hide, he&lt;br/&gt;has been with us on 75 cache finds. Even though he has some visual&lt;br/&gt;problems, he loves to hike in the woods. When helping us hide this&lt;br/&gt;cache, the trail was easy for him to hike. There are two parking&lt;br/&gt;lots; one to the north of the cache and the other to the west. A&lt;br/&gt;person can bike or ski the trails too.

Beginnings: The Wisconsin River&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a Virtual Cache; there is no container. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please park at N46 07.337 W89 09.313&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this location you will follow a path over a
wooden bridge to the posted coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You are in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National
Forest.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1634, Jean Nicolet, a French explorer,
“discovered” this area. The Nicolet Forest was
established in 1933 and now comprises over 661,000 acres. There are
over 1,500 ponds and lakes here with 34,000 surface acres of water
and 500 miles of shoreline. Over 500 miles of fresh water streams
snake through the forest. Much of this water helps to begin the
Wisconsin River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forest features over 800 miles of trails
which are open for hiking, mountain biking, cross country skiing,
horseback riding, snowmobiling, and even dog sledding. Animals
common to the forest include black bear, deer, wolves, bald eagles,
loons, grouse, waterfowl, many species of songbirds and small
mammals including the American Sables and the Fisher. If you choose
to bring your own pets, you will need to keep them on a leash at
all times and away from all beach areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;History:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first documented exploration of the Wisconsin River by
Europeans took place in 1673, when Jacques Marquette and Louis
Jolliet of France canoed from Lake Michigan up the Fox River until
reaching the present-day site of Portage. The river would soon
become a major travel route for traders, trappers and loggers.
Today the river is an important source of hydroelectric power and
has twenty-six power dams utilizing 640 feet of the fall of the
river to produce an annual average of one billion kilowatt hours of
electrical energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wisconsin Valley Improvement Company, created after passage
of state enabling legislation in 1907, operates a system of 21
reservoir dams in the upper valley designed to store water during
high flow periods for use in the downstream power dams during
periods of low flow. The reservoir system, in addition to enhancing
power production, diminishes flood damage and enriches the
recreational potential of the valley. This means that the water
flow you see today is regulated by man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Geology:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wisconsin River was likely formed in several stages. The
lower, westward-flowing portion of the river (located in
Wisconsin’s unglaciated “Driftless Area,”) likely
predates the rest of the river by several million years. Many of
the remaining sections of the river may have been formed gradually
as glaciers advanced, retreated or melted over northern Wisconsin.
It is likely that the river sections were joined late in
Wisconsin’s ice age due to the bursting of large ice dams.
The resulting torrent from the released glacial pools cut large
trenches through the state (one of these trenches can be see in the
Dells for example) and was likely responsible for making the river
one connected feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wisconsin River is the states
longest river at approximately 430 miles in length and is a
tributary of the Mississippi River. The source of the Wisconsin
River is right here at Lac Vieux Desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this location the river flows south across Wisconsin
through a plain made by a glacier during the last ice age. It
passes through the cities of Wausau and Stevens Point and then down
through the gorge known as the Wisconsin Dells near Madison. From
here the river turns west and makes its way to the Mississippi
River where they merge near Prairie du Chien. From its source at
Lac Vieux Desert to the Mississippi River at Prairie du Chien, the
Wisconsin River descends 1,071 feet over the length of its
journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the listed coordinates there is a historical marker. Give the first, middle and last name of the person who wintered here in 1791?&lt;/p&gt;

Should be a quick find. Able to hold very small travel bugs.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Once upon a time there were three billy goats, who were to go up to
the hillside to make themselves fat, and the name of all three was
&quot;Gruff.&quot; On the way up was a bridge over a cascading stream they
had to cross; and under the bridge lived a great ugly troll , with
eyes as big as saucers, and a nose as long as a poker. So first of
all came the youngest Billy Goat Gruff to cross the bridge. &quot;Trip,
trap, trip, trap! &quot; went the bridge. &quot;Who's that tripping over my
bridge?&quot; roared the troll . &quot;Oh, it is only I, the tiniest Billy
Goat Gruff , and I'm going up to the hillside to make myself fat,&quot;
said the billy goat, with such a small voice. &quot;Now, I'm coming to
gobble you up,&quot; said the troll. &quot;Oh, no! pray don't take me. I'm
too little, that I am,&quot; said the billy goat. &quot;Wait a bit till the
second Billy Goat Gruff comes. He's much bigger.&quot; &quot;Well, be off
with you,&quot; said the troll.

Cache is a camoed Lock 'n' Lock.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But just then up came the big Billy Goat Gruff . Trip, trap, trip,
trap, trip, trap! went the bridge, for the billy goat was so heavy
that the bridge creaked and groaned under him. &quot;Who's that tramping
over my bridge?&quot; roared the troll. &quot;It's I! The big Billy Goat
Gruff ,&quot; said the billy goat, who had an ugly hoarse voice of his
own. &quot;Now I 'm coming to gobble you up,&quot; roared the troll. Well,
come along! I've got two spears, And I'll poke your eyeballs out at
your ears; I've got besides two curling-stones, And I'll crush you
to bits, body and bones. That was what the big billy goat said. And
then he flew at the troll, and poked his eyes out with his horns,
and crushed him to bits, body and bones, and tossed him out into
the cascade, and after that he went up to the hillside. There the
billy goats got so fat they were scarcely able to walk home again.
And if the fat hasn't fallen off them, why, they're still fat; and
so, Snip, snap, snout. This tale's told out.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Checked on cache and it is still in its hiding spot and still clearly visible the water is now much higher though and you will have to get your feet wet to make the find. Bring rubber boots or wait till the river freezes. Good luck hunting.  </groundspeak:text>
