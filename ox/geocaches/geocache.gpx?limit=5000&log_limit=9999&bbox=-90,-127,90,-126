&lt;p&gt;BC Parks is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. The
first BC Park was Strathcona Park on Vancouver Island which was
officially created on March 1, 1911.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the parks system in British Columbia is one of our
greatest resources. Currently 14.26% (13.5 million hectares) of
British Columbia's land base is protected. There are more than 340
campgrounds, 6000 km of hiking trails, 118 boat launches and 263
day-use areas in B.C.'s provincial park system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BC Parks and the BC Geocaching Association are partnered along
with the Year of Science to invite you to explore BC Parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of 100 caches placed in parks throughout BC. Each
cache will have a unique trackable geocoin available for the first
3 finders. There are also BC Parks trade items, BC Geocaching
Association buttons, and Year of Science pins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a maximum of one coin per Geocaching account. Please
trade fairly for all items in the cache. If you have a coin from
another cache, please leave it for another cacher - you would want
them to do the same for you.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;White River Provincial Park on northern Vancouver Island is a
small, undeveloped wilderness area that offers excellent fishing
opportunities and protection for important Roosevelt elk and black
bear habitat. This scenic park and its old-growth forest were
stunning enough for Hollywood to take notice – portions of
White River were used as a film site for the movie The Scarlet
Letter, filmed here in 1994. Visitors to the park today will find
remnants of the film set, including wide boardwalks designed to
accommodate horse-drawn carriages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A short loop trail through the forest leads down to the White
River. Along the way, visitors will be rewarded with views of some
massive Douglas fir and western red cedar trees – giants
which, no doubt, helped White River earn the nickname, “the
Cathedral Grove of the North Island.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Park is accessed via White River mainline and Victoria mainline.
Possibility of active logging in the area. Please drive with your
lights on, and watch for logging trucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are activities going on in BC Parks all year to celebrate
this wonderful anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2011 is also the Year of Science in BC.&lt;br /&gt;
There are events and a collection of interesting stories about
people who chose Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An open, grassy site with trail access to the river pool. Site
is good for swimming and fishing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From Campbell River, head north on Highway 19. 26 km north of the
Sayward junction(almost immediately after the 260 km marker on the
highway), turn right off the highway onto Eve River Main (caution:
active haul road). Follow the mainline for 14.5 km, then turn right
on to the East Main. Travel another 700 metres or so and the access
road to Junction Pool will be on the left. It is one hour from
Campbell River to the turn-off on the highway and another 20-25
minutes to the site.&lt;/p&gt;
