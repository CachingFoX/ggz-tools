            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache itself is small with not a lot to trade; it is in the Groenkloof nature reserve on the 4x4 trial. This cache is called “Low range in”. Cache is hidden under some rocks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I enjoyed the Groenkloof Nature reserve so much that I planted two caches on the 4x4 trail at probably the worst section. These two caches are for those that love off-road driving. You can also walk to these caches or you can cycle to them. We spend a lot of time doing the caches in the reserve and we enjoyed the animals. It is good to see so many people cycling, walking and driving around so early in the morning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trial itself is nothing in comparison with some of the trials we have done such as Berakha and Three provinces but the stretch between these two caches is probably the best test for low range driving in this reserve. During rainy seasons this road should be difficult as water should be running down this hill. There are also some clay areas so it should be fun in the rain. Differential locks should then be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special note:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a nature reserve and before the cache is removed you need to verify that there are no snakes present. &lt;br/&gt;You are allowed to exit from your vehicle. &lt;br/&gt;Please park in such a way that you do not annoy other road users. &lt;br/&gt;Please cover the cache well.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The dam is fed by a small river on the other side of Nelmapius street, and regularly overflows the street after heavy rain. The dam also quadruples its size after rain, so beware – you might be wading in the rainy season. I’m pretty sure the cache will stay dry though - if you put it back exactly as you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FTF swag included.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please be gentle when retrieving the container with logsheet from the house.

From the guard house they cannot see the ossewa, but ensure that you are always out of sight of the guards by keeping to the “back” side of the wagon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photography could work well here as a front to finding the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main road going past the cache is quite busy, so please be careful who may be watching. Suggest you park your car to hide you from the traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a magnetic nano, but not the usual kind.  Please replace it exactly where you found it.  Please wipe it dry if you can if it is wet.   &lt;br/&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;Note 30 June 2012: The wagon was temporarily moved from it's spot for restoration and to revamp the garden.&lt;br/&gt;The wagon is now in plain sight and not at the listed coordinates, but the cache can still be found. Cachers will need to use more stealth, as it is in the open with lots of traffic and muggles passing by.&lt;br/&gt;I'm not changing the cache coordinates for now - as the wagon should move back there sometime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;This cache is also available on Groundspeak's geocaching.com site. </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Far, far away in a land with lots of heavy traffic and little to no power, there once lived a young maiden on a magnificent property. She woke up every morning, full of excitement to go to work and later retreated to her home to relax. Many evenings she spent playing with the doggies in the pretty garden.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But she was alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every night she dreamt of her prince, fighting traffic and deadlines to come to her rescue in his sleek company car. He would bring her a bunch of intersection-bought flowers and pizza from the nearest Debonairs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One morning she had had enough. She stopped looking after the property and refused to do anything until her prince arrived. The property became dilapidated and the garden is a retreat no more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where is the prince who will rescue her from her misery?&lt;br/&gt;Find her house and find the cache. Sign your name and leave. &lt;br/&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;This cache is also available on Groundspeak's geocaching.com site. </groundspeak:long_description>

Went to check on the cache today after seening that it was not found by the Woodies.
Sadly it seems that it has been Muggled! Looked all around but found no trace of it anywhere!
Seems the spot is a popular eating &amp; chilling spot during the week as it provides good shade.
Replaced the cache with a new one today and moved it to a less frequented spot in the same park.
Have updated/listed the new coordinates as follows: S 26'02.657, E 028'05.076
New tradables are: Plastic Giraffe, Glow-in-the-dark star &amp; a Wire Star.</groundspeak:text>

On your way to this cache you will notice two environmental impacts to this reserve. You will notice farming on the right; spraying chemicals on the crops and on the left you will see enough past mining activity in the form of huge mine dumps. Mining had a huge impact on this reserve and it continues even today. The bull frog that used to live here is on the red list. Some species are no longer found here.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is large traditional LnL cache in Marievale nature reserve. This one is to say thanks for visiting our caches. There are not many large caches&lt;br/&gt;for geocachers in RSA so this is for you. You should find it easy -&lt;br/&gt;follow the hint exactly. You are probably in a hurry at this point&lt;br/&gt;and we will make it an easy one. Please cover the cache&lt;br/&gt;well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope you enjoyed the walk and/or drive and I hope you learnt something new. In this birding reserve there is in each and every area that was shown to you something unique. You probably noticed how certain birds stayed&lt;br/&gt;together in one area. On your way to this one I hope you noticed the wild flowers. I also hope you noticed the mine dumps and the efforts that were made to protect the reserve. I hope you noticed the rocks around the base of the mine dumps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this final location you will find a man made rock barrier. Was this a railway line or was this another attempt to protect the reserve - you comment will be appreciated. Please stay clear of the mine dumps and do not visit them. You do not want to be exposed to cyanide. I included&lt;br/&gt;a parking way point; please do not proceed any further - there are hidden barbed wire in this area. I tried to clean up as much as possible but please park at this point and walk to the cache. Thanks and well done.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a history lesson and Oom Lang Piet started it all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A long time ago during 1882 a farmer Petrus Johannes Marais (nicknamed Oom Lang Piet) who owned the farm Varkensfontein in the Heidelberg district made an agreement with a prospector named Johnstone allowing him to prospect for gold on the farm Varkensfontein. Mr. Johnstone' s prospecting operations continued for a considerable time shrouded in secrecy. Then one day a stranger turned up at Oom Lang Piet's home and made an offer to buy the farm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the time of the offer Oom Lang Piet was by chance busy reading &quot;The Fortunes of Nigel&quot; by Sir Walter Scott, a story about a young man who was the victim of a dishonest intrigue but eventually achieved his goal in life. The stranger's visit immediately aroused Mr. Marais's suspicions to the extent that he decided to visit his farm himself. Once at the farm he found that his suspicions were well founded. With the experiences of Nigel, the character in the novel in mind, he determined not to allow himself to be cheated by cunning fortune seekers and at once set about to establish his own company. In July 1888, two years after the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand, he achieved his goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marais attributed his luck to the novel he had been reading and, therefore, called his company Nigel. In this way, the town of Nigel came into being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1888 the State President Paul Kruger declared Nigel as a public digging under notice no. 331 and since then the history and development of Nigel are inseparable from those of the gold mines. The town was little more than a mining camp until 1923, when the control of the town was passed into the hands of a Dorpvillage. The first meeting of this council was held on 2 January 1923. As you drive around in this area you will notice the old mining houses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sub Nigel mine had, in the meanwhile, come into existence and proved to be the riches gold mine in the world. As a result of this fact a great influx of people to the town occurred. Within a space of 7 years the local authority was given increased status and in 1930 was elevated to a Town Council. On 24 November 1930 the first meeting of the Town Council was held and Mr. C.L. Mackle was elected the first Mayor. This event also marked the starting point of fast growth of Nigel. Today many people stay here but work elsewhere. The town today have a out of town feeling to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The years 1934 - 1939 saw the most noteworthy development of the town. This was only slowed down by the outbreak of World War II. During those five years, no less than 5 suburbs were proclaimed and speculation in fixed property soared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The railway line between Springs, Nigel and Heidelberg was opened on 18 October 1935. Until then, the nearest railway station had been Kaydale; situated five miles from Nigel on the main line between Johannesburg and Durban, and all transport had been conducted by ox wagon, horses or car. Sadly the train station is no longer in use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to my world and I hope you like the caches. As you drive around in Nigel you will notice several houses and structures that relates to mining. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Here we use big crop sprayers for insects and if that does not work then we bomb them. :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope you enjoy this one.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a nano cache. There is no pencil or pen. My daughter will attend this school from next year and she will keep an eye on this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The school was founded on 10 May 1963. The forerunner of this school was the Klip Skool, so named because it was built of stone, which started round about 1894 when Nigel was a Mining Camp. When Nigel became a Village Council, the first Principal, Mr Diamone, was appointed. The Klip School eventually became a Junior High School - Gr 1 to Standard 8. In 1948 the Principal was Mr Kloppers and the Vice-Principal was Mr Malherbe. The Head Prefects were Poppie Pretorius and Peter Raccine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The School moved to the new buildings, where H/S John Vorster is today, in 1949. The Senior class was Standard 9 and the Principal was Mr Kloppers and the Vice-Principal was Mr Malherbe. The Head Prefects were, once again, Poppie Pretorius and Peter Raccine. In 1950 Nigel High had its first Matric Class and, you guessed it, Poppie and Peter were, yet again, Head Prefects. The School was dual medium - English and Afrikaans. At that time the school never had a hall. Every morning started with assembly in the Quad and the teachers stood on the balcony, which was between the Principal's Office and the Staff Room. Assemblies alternated between English and Afrikaans and every Wednesday a Minister from one of the local churches would take a service - again, alternating one week English and one week Afrikaans. The school uniform was bottle green, as is H/S John Vorster today. In the summer, the girls wore green tunics, with white short sleeve blouses. In the winter they wore the same tunics with whilte shirts and the green school tie. They wore grey long socks with the green, orange, black and white stripes. The boys wore grey trousers and white shirts. The blasers were plain bottle green with the school badge on the pocket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1951 Mr Kloppers retired and Mr L. Spruyt became the Principal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1952 a competition was held to design a blazer with colours. Mr Rossouw, an Afrikaans teacher, won the competition. The blazer had a bottle green background with a broadish orange stripe and a narow black and white stripe on either side. It was very striking. The badge on the H/S John Vorster blazer is still the same as the one on the 1952 blazer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1963 the English and Afrikaans speaking pupils parted company. The English High School moved to the present premises of Nigel High School and H/S John Vorster remained as the Afrikaans H/S.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache consists of the normal goodies in a small LnL container. It is close to the road and it should be easy to find. There is no plastic bag. I forgot to include a pencil so please make sure you have one with you. There is an easy way and a hard way. Hard way is to budu bash through the tall grass and blackjacks. The easy way is to find the walking trial crossing the road. Try to find the yellow marker on your right hand side and it will guide you to the cache. While you are at the cache sit down and listen and you will understand the cache name.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is close to my “home” and it is placed to remind me in future of a different time in my life. This is my story. You can also skip my story and enjoy the reserve, the animals and the trip around the reserve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My story:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I accepted a job offer in Alberton as a Service Manager in charged of a production department and engineering and to make it a little bit more interesting I am directly responsible for all projects. It also expected from me to give support to a factory in Botswana. Soon I will be logging caches that side. I decided to stay in this reserve at the camping site for security reasons. On 12 May 2009 I parked my caravan and I pitched my tent with one hell of a struggle. Damn they do not design this as a one man operation. I was the only one at the camp site at that time. My daughter is now in grade 7 and we can not move her to another school. If I can sell the house in Ermelo then we could be together again but until such time this is my “home”. Sometimes we do a lot for our children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I got used to the routine, the cold and the people that come and go on a weekend. During the week it does get lonely when there is no one camping. I use this time to study. Every second weekend I do go home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One night at about 02h30 walking in the dark I spotted a movement about 10 meters away from me. The eyes were that of a jackal. I switch on the torch and I noticed that he is not moving away. I then checked the area if there are more as a pack is extremely dangerous. You can tame this animal but there will always be a dark streak in them. Many of these tamed ones turned on their owners. They are dangerous when they are hungry and they will attack. I stood my ground and he stood his ground but my training told me to stay put and to watch for an attack. He then sneaked behind a tree and started to move out of the area but he kept on turning back. He then left to my relief. On Monday 15 June 2009 at 00h23 my mother passed away while psalm 23 was read to her while I was here.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

päästäksesi loppupurkille. Walk or run around the track and do some
simple calculations to achieve final point.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Perä-Hakalin kuntopolku on 1.7 km pitkä hieman huonoon kuntoon
kulunut valaistu rata, jolla kulkee talvisin hiihtolatu. Talvella
ei tosin ole suositeltavaa etsiä purkkia, sillä se hautautuu
lumeen. Sinun tehtäväsi on kiertää rata ympäri ja tehdä muutamia
yksinkertaisia laskutoimituksia päästäksesi loppupurkille. Varo
kulkiessasi mahdollisia juurakoita. Myöskin kallio voi olla
liukasta märkänä.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jos tulet autolla, auto kannattaa jättää koordinaatteihin N61°
04.228 E28° 17.999.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tultuasi aloituspisteelle laske vaakasuuntaisten lyhyiden tankojen
määrä. Olkoon tämä luku A. Seuraavan pisteen koordinaatit saat
kaavasta nnn+(6xA)-2 eee-(8xA)-3, jossa nnn ja eee ovat nykyisen
pisteen koordinaattien minuuttien desimaaliosat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seuraavalla pisteellä näet kaksinumeroisen luvun. Olkoon tämä luku
B. Loppupurkin koordinaatit saat kaavasta nnn-(2xB)+2 eee-4, joissa
nnn ja eee ovat nykyisen pisteen koordinaattien minuuttien
desimaaliosat, kuten edelliselläkin pisteellä.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Löydettyäsi purkin kannattaa kiertää polku loppuun.&lt;br /&gt;

Sports track of Perä-Hakali is a 1.7 km long illuminated path. In
winter there's a skiing track. You probably can't find the
container in winter. The track is not in best possible condition,
so watch your step. The cliffs can also be slippery when wet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you come by a car, leave it to parkin lot at N61° 04.228 E28°
17.999.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you arrive the first point, count the number of short
horizontal bars. Let the number be A. Calculate coordinates for the
next point from formula nnn+(6xA)-2 eee-(8xA)-3, where nnn and eee
are the last digits of the coordinates for current point.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you get to the next point, you see a 2-digit number. Let the
number be B. Calculate coordinates for the last point from formula
nnn-(2xB)+2 eee-4, where nnn and eee are the last digits of the
coordinates for current point, as it was for the previous
point.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you're finished with the final point, it's recommended to
finish your lap on the track.</groundspeak:long_description>
