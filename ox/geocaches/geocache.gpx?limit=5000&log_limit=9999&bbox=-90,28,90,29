            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache itself is small with not a lot to trade; it is in the Groenkloof nature reserve on the 4x4 trial. This cache is called “Low range in”. Cache is hidden under some rocks.

I enjoyed the Groenkloof Nature reserve so much that I planted two caches on the 4x4 trail at probably the worst section. These two caches are for those that love off-road driving. You can also walk to these caches or you can cycle to them. We spend a lot of time doing the caches in the reserve and we enjoyed the animals. It is good to see so many people cycling, walking and driving around so early in the morning.

The trial itself is nothing in comparison with some of the trials we have done such as Berakha and Three provinces but the stretch between these two caches is probably the best test for low range driving in this reserve. During rainy seasons this road should be difficult as water should be running down this hill. There are also some clay areas so it should be fun in the rain. Differential locks should then be used.

Special note:

This is a nature reserve and before the cache is removed you need to verify that there are no snakes present. 
You are allowed to exit from your vehicle. 
Please park in such a way that you do not annoy other road users. 
Please cover the cache well.

Yep, what is needed to have a home in this area is something different and if you have the money then architecture is less important. Thanks for showing me this - great cache.

This cache is hidden at a lovely country lodge.

You’ll always find many muggles around.  The guards at the entrance may ask why you are here - it is best to tell them you want to walk &amp; look around.  There is also a restaurant you may want to visit.

Take a leisurely stroll around the lake.  You can walk either clockwise or counter clockwise as it is a circular route.
In the middle of the lake are some interesting ruins left for the birds.  If there are guards around or other muggles please just mill about till they pass on.  Do not attempt the cache if they are in sight.

You don't have to drive through any boom gates to get to this cache.  If your GPS takes you to a security check point, try a different (more scenic) route.

We had a great time hiding it and hope you’ll have as much fun finding it too!

Please note that RDP Houses are built for numbers and not for quality.  This RDP House's quality has already been rejected by 'council' once and then re-established by the Ginger-municipality, here.

IMPORTANT:  The house itself is fixed and cannot be removed from its 'foundation'.  Please be gentle when retrieving the container with logsheet from the house.  The cache is very fragile to human hands!

The guards are not aware of a cache in the area.  I've had no problems getting access, but 'showing the kids the horses' or going to 'riboville rd' or 'elevation rd' should get you in.
The houses in this area are huge and magnificent and the gardens are green and massive.  A nice drive around the area is a must.

Please make sure you do NOT block any driveways when parking to retrieve this cache.  It is not a shortcut for muggles, but many people take their dogs here for walks and you could meet riders on horseback here too.

DO NOT DRIVE UP TO THE CACHE SITE!  There were sign boards up at the time of placing the cache, that indicated that vehicles are not allowed on the green belt - only pedestrians, doggies and riders on horseback.  You don't want security to drive past and start asking questions, please! 

Ensure no one is watching you and that you hide the cache well out of sight before leaving.

Photography could work well here as a front to finding the cache.

The main road going past the cache is quite busy, so please be careful who may be watching. Suggest you park your car to hide you from the traffic.

The cache is a magnetic nano, but not the usual kind.  Please replace it exactly where you found it.  Please wipe it dry if you can if it is wet.

The original building (1868) stood in Pietermaritzburg and was known as 'St Saviour's Cathedral'.  It was (or parts of it) later moved here to Midrand and is today the gathering place of a Prysbetarian Congregation.

Read more about the history of this beautiful building here: http://www.midchurch.co.za

Feel free to wander about the grounds and enjoy the peacefulness.  Please consider your movement, actions and noise levels during service times on Sundays.

The cache is a film canister which holds the logsheet.  Please bring your own writing implement and cover the cache as you found it, before leaving.

Although the &quot;Ginger Sitter&quot; is not one of the bird species found in the Sanctuary, is this area home to quite a variety of birds and it is well worth it to take a stroll or sit at one of the bird hides to see how many bird species can be identified.
..and no, you may not ask questions about the cache-name... **blush**.

The cache will be easy to find if there are no muggles around.  If the cache is inaccessible due to muggle-activity, don’t attempt a find - please - rather hang around and wait patiently or leave to hopefully return another time.

The above coordinates are for the first waypoint and not the final location of the cache.  In order to find the cache, you will need to go to the above coordinates and search the birding charts for the “Olive Bee-Eater”.

This bird grows between AB and CD cm in size.  
Once you have AB and CD apply the following formula:

S25 58.RST E28 04.XYZ
where
RST  = (21 * AB) + 13 and
XYZ  = (3 * CD) + 6

For those of you who want to know more about the Guide Dog Association you can find information on the following website:

 Then this Mega (I mean nano) is for you. Amandla - Power to the people. It's shocking that there hasn't been a cache here yet. No need for those reVolting lamp post caches - when you can do this little power packed cache.

Eish!

Serious: You may need to looki like you're taking a photo as it is within line of sight from the security access boom gate.</groundspeak:long_description>

Just a bit further on you will cross the Blesbok Spruit. On your way to this cache you will notice two environmental impacts to this reserve. You will notice farming on the right; spraying chemicals on the crops and on the left you will see enough past mining activity in the form of huge mine dumps. Mining had a huge impact on this reserve and it continues even today. The bull frog that used to live here is on the red list. Some species are no longer found here. Feel free to share your environmental concerns and
observations.</groundspeak:long_description>

for geocachers in RSA so this is for you. You should find it easy -
follow the hint exactly. You are probably in a hurry at this point
and we will make it an easy one. Please cover the cache
well.

I hope you enjoyed the walk and/or drive and I hope you learnt something new. In this birding reserve there is in each and every area that was shown to you something unique. You probably noticed how certain birds stayed
together in one area. On your way to this one I hope you noticed the wild flowers. I also hope you noticed the mine dumps and the efforts that were made to protect the reserve. I hope you noticed the rocks around the base of the mine dumps.

At this final location you will find a man made rock barrier. Was this a railway line or was this another attempt to protect the reserve - you comment will be appreciated. Please stay clear of the mine dumps and do not visit them. You do not want to be exposed to cyanide. I included
a parking way point; please do not proceed any further - there are hidden barbed wire in this area. I tried to clean up as much as possible but please park at this point and walk to the cache. Thanks and well done.</groundspeak:long_description>

This bird hide contain some information on the birds in this area but you will also notice that some of the info boards are now gone. Pity that vandals are also visiting bird hides. Here you are surrounded by the water.
Different species are found here and they are a little bit people shy. If you wait long enough you will have the chance to see them.</groundspeak:long_description>

As far as we could gathered this graveyard contain black people and they were part of Marievale's history. Here you will see the traditional graves of black people. There are quite a number of graves if you look at the stone heaps. The cache is not in the cemetery area but outside as a sign of respect. During 1920 - 1930 mining activities were dangerous. Some of them buried here are from that era.

They are truly forgotten.

General:

This is a nano cache stashed inside a public area. There is no pen/pencil please take a pen with you. Please note that the hint is descriptive because of high muggle activity and this hint could spoil your fun. Please sit down and relax a while before you start with the search. You need to be in and out quickly without jeopardising the cache. Good luck.

This cache encourages you to take a break and to find a cache at the same time. Use the cache to stretch your leg and to relax a bit. You are probably heading towards Durban at this cache. We hope you and the family will enjoy a safe trip and/or a lovely holiday.

I drive pass this point on my way to home (Nigel) during weekdays between 17h00 and 19h00. If you see a white 3 litre terrano you can be 100% sure that it is me - there are only 4 of these vehicles in the country. Have a good trip. .</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is micro cache at the entrance to Nigel, my home town. This is a history lesson and Oom Lang Piet started it all.

A long time ago during 1882 a farmer Petrus Johannes Marais (nicknamed Oom Lang Piet) who owned the farm Varkensfontein in the Heidelberg district made an agreement with a prospector named Johnstone allowing him to prospect for gold on the farm Varkensfontein. Mr. Johnstone' s prospecting operations continued for a considerable time shrouded in secrecy. Then one day a stranger turned up at Oom Lang Piet's home and made an offer to buy the farm.

At the time of the offer Oom Lang Piet was by chance busy reading &quot;The Fortunes of Nigel&quot; by Sir Walter Scott, a story about a young man who was the victim of a dishonest intrigue but eventually achieved his goal in life. The stranger's visit immediately aroused Mr. Marais's suspicions to the extent that he decided to visit his farm himself. Once at the farm he found that his suspicions were well founded. With the experiences of Nigel, the character in the novel in mind, he determined not to allow himself to be cheated by cunning fortune seekers and at once set about to establish his own company. In July 1888, two years after the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand, he achieved his goal.

Marais attributed his luck to the novel he had been reading and, therefore, called his company Nigel. In this way, the town of Nigel came into being.

In 1888 the State President Paul Kruger declared Nigel as a public digging under notice no. 331 and since then the history and development of Nigel are inseparable from those of the gold mines. The town was little more than a mining camp until 1923, when the control of the town was passed into the hands of a Dorpvillage. The first meeting of this council was held on 2 January 1923. As you drive around in this area you will notice the old mining houses.

The Sub Nigel mine had, in the meanwhile, come into existence and proved to be the riches gold mine in the world. As a result of this fact a great influx of people to the town occurred. Within a space of 7 years the local authority was given increased status and in 1930 was elevated to a Town Council. On 24 November 1930 the first meeting of the Town Council was held and Mr. C.L. Mackle was elected the first Mayor. This event also marked the starting point of fast growth of Nigel. Today many people stay here but work elsewhere. The town today have a out of town feeling to it.

The years 1934 - 1939 saw the most noteworthy development of the town. This was only slowed down by the outbreak of World War II. During those five years, no less than 5 suburbs were proclaimed and speculation in fixed property soared.

The railway line between Springs, Nigel and Heidelberg was opened on 18 October 1935. Until then, the nearest railway station had been Kaydale; situated five miles from Nigel on the main line between Johannesburg and Durban, and all transport had been conducted by ox wagon, horses or car. Sadly the train station is no longer in use.

Welcome to my world and I hope you like the caches. As you drive around in Nigel you will notice several houses and structures that relates to mining.

Here in Nigel we do things different. Here we use big crop sprayers for insects and if that does not work then we bomb them. :)

Hope you enjoy this one. If you are lucky you will have the chance to see how this company practise their skills.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a nano cache. There is no pencil or pen. My daughter will attend this school from next year and she will keep an eye on this cache.

The school was founded on 10 May 1963. The forerunner of this school was the Klip Skool, so named because it was built of stone, which started round about 1894 when Nigel was a Mining Camp. When Nigel became a Village Council, the first Principal, Mr Diamone, was appointed. The Klip School eventually became a Junior High School - Gr 1 to Standard 8. In 1948 the Principal was Mr Kloppers and the Vice-Principal was Mr Malherbe. The Head Prefects were Poppie Pretorius and Peter Raccine.

The School moved to the new buildings, where H/S John Vorster is today, in 1949. The Senior class was Standard 9 and the Principal was Mr Kloppers and the Vice-Principal was Mr Malherbe. The Head Prefects were, once again, Poppie Pretorius and Peter Raccine. In 1950 Nigel High had its first Matric Class and, you guessed it, Poppie and Peter were, yet again, Head Prefects. The School was dual medium - English and Afrikaans. At that time the school never had a hall. Every morning started with assembly in the Quad and the teachers stood on the balcony, which was between the Principal's Office and the Staff Room. Assemblies alternated between English and Afrikaans and every Wednesday a Minister from one of the local churches would take a service - again, alternating one week English and one week Afrikaans. The school uniform was bottle green, as is H/S John Vorster today. In the summer, the girls wore green tunics, with white short sleeve blouses. In the winter they wore the same tunics with whilte shirts and the green school tie. They wore grey long socks with the green, orange, black and white stripes. The boys wore grey trousers and white shirts. The blasers were plain bottle green with the school badge on the pocket.

In 1951 Mr Kloppers retired and Mr L. Spruyt became the Principal.

In 1952 a competition was held to design a blazer with colours. Mr Rossouw, an Afrikaans teacher, won the competition. The blazer had a bottle green background with a broadish orange stripe and a narow black and white stripe on either side. It was very striking. The badge on the H/S John Vorster blazer is still the same as the one on the 1952 blazer.

In 1963 the English and Afrikaans speaking pupils parted company. The English High School moved to the present premises of Nigel High School and H/S John Vorster remained as the Afrikaans H/S.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The cache consists of the normal goodies in a small LnL container. It is close to the road and it should be easy to find. There is no plastic bag. I forgot to include a pencil so please make sure you have one with you. There is an easy way and a hard way. Hard way is to budu bash through the tall grass and blackjacks. The easy way is to find the walking trial crossing the road. Try to find the yellow marker on your right hand side and it will guide you to the cache. While you are at the cache sit down and listen and you will understand the cache name.

This cache is close to my “home” and it is placed to remind me in future of a different time in my life. This is my story. You can also skip my story and enjoy the reserve, the animals and the trip around the reserve.

My story:

I accepted a job offer in Alberton as a Service Manager in charged of a production department and engineering and to make it a little bit more interesting I am directly responsible for all projects. It also expected from me to give support to a factory in Botswana. Soon I will be logging caches that side. I decided to stay in this reserve at the camping site for security reasons. On 12 May 2009 I parked my caravan and I pitched my tent with one hell of a struggle. Damn they do not design this as a one man operation. I was the only one at the camp site at that time. My daughter is now in grade 7 and we can not move her to another school. If I can sell the house in Ermelo then we could be together again but until such time this is my “home”. Sometimes we do a lot for our children.

I got used to the routine, the cold and the people that come and go on a weekend. During the week it does get lonely when there is no one camping. I use this time to study. Every second weekend I do go home.

One night at about 02h30 walking in the dark I spotted a movement about 10 meters away from me. The eyes were that of a jackal. I switch on the torch and I noticed that he is not moving away. I then checked the area if there are more as a pack is extremely dangerous. You can tame this animal but there will always be a dark streak in them. Many of these tamed ones turned on their owners. They are dangerous when they are hungry and they will attack. I stood my ground and he stood his ground but my training told me to stay put and to watch for an attack. He then sneaked behind a tree and started to move out of the area but he kept on turning back. He then left to my relief. On Monday 15 June 2009 at 00h23 my mother passed away while psalm 23 was read to her while I was here.

MOOTTORITIE on tarkoitettu nopealle moottoriajoneuvoliikenteelle. Moottoritiellä ei saa pysähtyä, pysäköidä, peruuttaa eikä käyttää ajoratoja yhdistävää poikittaistietä. Toisin sanoen vain eteenpäin ajaminen on moottoritiellä sallittua. Poikkeuksia säännöistä voivat tehdä erityisiä valomerkkejä antavat hälytysajoneuvot sekä tienpitoon käytetyt ajoneuvot.</groundspeak:long_description>
