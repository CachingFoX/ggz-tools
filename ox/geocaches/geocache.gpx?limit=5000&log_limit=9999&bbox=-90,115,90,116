            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This Cache is located on the edge of the Neerbup National Park.  

It is close to the heritage walking trail that stretches for nearly 30 km's between Joondalup and Yanchep.

This trail hides a good variety of Caches 
so perhaps make this hunt part of a larger expedition.

This cache can be reached on foot, by making a diversion off the main walking trail.  

Alternatively you may elect to drive up the wide sandy track that runs parallel to Wanneroo Road. 

This will take you to within a few metres of GZ.  You will require a suitable 4x4 vehicle for this route as the sand is deep in a significant number of places.

The Cache you are seeking, is a small container, which when placed contained a pencil, log and a trackable.

I would suggest you keep your swappables for other local Caches. 

Please take care with this cache and replace it exactly as you find it.  

Many thanks.

It's location is a just 20 meters off the trail and is purposely not deeply hidden in undergrowth, so it &quot;could possibly&quot; be a quick and easy grab at GZ for some...!!!

Orchids produce no nectar so many specialise in MIMICRY to attract insects to assist with pollination.....

Donkey orchids MIMIC the native pea flowers in colour and shape....

Cowslip orchids MIMIC the yellow buttercups....

Blue china orchids MIMICS the blue day lily... !!!

This cache.... well there maybe just a  bit of MIMICRY involved....</groundspeak:long_description>

You are searching for just a Nano cache just 7/16th of inch tall. It contains a teeny log, so please take your own pencil, tweezers and write small...

When replacing the log, roll up and place into lid first, then into barrel)

If you participate in the &quot;Cache In Trash Out&quot; initiative, this area needs your support, though it's lovely spot i was really disappointed with the quantity of litter, i took what i could, but it needs continued help, so please take a bag if you can !!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Came across this man-made park quite by chance and happened to have a Cache in my pocket, so pulled up, and placed &quot;Babbling Banksia&quot;

This Cache was going to be a traditional, P&amp;G, but the park is very compact and worth taking a few moments to walk round, has some tranquil spots to sit and some interesting modern statues, so it grew to a Multi.

The posted coordinates will take you to a sign post. 

You will need to simply count the number of times particular letters appear on this sign

Your next WP is at:

S 31.  41.  UVW
E 115. 48  XYZ

U= The number of O's
V= The number of C's
W=The number of T's Plus the number of F's

X=The number of F's Minus the number of T's
Y=The number of N's Plus the number of C's
Z= The number of O's Minus the number of Y's

These coords will lead you to a small info sign that displays a 10 digit phone number.   

Label the last six digits of the phone number A-F

The Cache can then be found at: 

S 31  41   LMN
E 115 48  OPQ

L=  B Plus C
M= D Minus E
N= A Plus E

O= B Plus C Minus F
P= B Minus D
Q= E Minus D 

The Cache is a traditional bison style tube, it just contains a log, so please bring your own writing utensil.

&lt;p&gt;All the physical Caches are colour coded to match the original

Nerrabup National Park, which in time will in form a part of
circular Cache walk, linking up with the Yaberoo Budjarra
trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To succeed with this game you firstly have to seek and find the
following six caches.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Trivial Trail (Geography)&lt;br/&gt;
Trivial Trail (Entertainment).&lt;br/&gt;
Trivial Trail (History).&lt;br/&gt;
Trivial Trail (Art &amp;
Literature).&lt;br/&gt;
Trivial Trail (Science &amp;
Nature).&lt;br/&gt;
Trivial Trail (Sport &amp;
Leisure).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These initial six Caches are Eclipse tins containing a log and a
pencil but also a general knowledge question based on the category
in it's title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have the correct answers to all six of the questions,
you wil be able to calculate the coordinates of the final and
winning &quot;Mystery Cache&quot;, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Trivial Trophy&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the physical Caches are colour coded to match the original
board game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Caches are all located on an easily accessible part of the
Nerrabup National Park, which in time will form a part of circular
Cache walk, linking up with the Yaberoo Budjarra trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Cache is located within a few metres of the track, so very
little bush bashing is required, but again each hide will offer a
slightly different challenge to the seeker.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Cache is not at the above coordinates.
&lt;p&gt;To succeed with this Cache you must have already have found all
six Caches that are associated with the series and correctly
answered all the questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; You must now use your two digit answers from each question to find
the correct coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
GC2QMV2 Trivial Trail (Geography) Answer = A
&amp; B&lt;br/&gt;
GC2QMYT Trivial Trail (Entertainment) Answer = C
&amp; D&lt;br/&gt;
GC2QMZM Trivial Trail (History) Answer = E
&amp; F&lt;br/&gt;
GC2QMZW Trivial Trail (Art &amp; Literature)
Answer = G &amp; H&lt;br/&gt;
GC2QN06 Trivial Trail (Science &amp; Nature)
Answer = I &amp; J&lt;br/&gt;
GCQN0D Trivial Trail (Sport &amp; Liesure)
Answer = K &amp; L&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The coordinates for this 'Winning Cache&quot; are.....&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
S 31.42. NOP.&lt;br/&gt;
E 115.45 QRS.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
When...&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
N= J - D&lt;br/&gt;
O= E - F&lt;br/&gt;
P= G + H&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Q= K + L&lt;br/&gt;
R= A + I + H&lt;br/&gt;
S= B - C - K&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The container is a Colour co-ordinated Medium Ammo Can, (see
images) and on its launch contains a few goodies and swaps, some
trackables, and of course the mandatory log and pencils.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
All questions &amp; answers are taken directly from the board game,
so any disputes please speak to Hasbro Games, not me.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 72 year old dad answered 5 out of 6 questions correctly just
by using his noodle....but it may help some to carry a smart phone
that uses Google !!!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Congratulations, as ever, go to CHWILIWR for completing the trail
and then being the FTF for &quot;Trivial Trophy&quot;. Congrats also to
BLINGG for being FTF for the majority of the other Caches on the
&quot;Trivial Trail&quot;and 2TF the Trivial Trophy&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
(NB. My thanks go to team PRIMREY, who kindly donated this Ammo Can
to me prior to their move overseas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: TT2QN0R - Trivial Trophy&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Trivial Trek&quot; series, is based on a family board game of a
similar name.&lt;/p&gt;
The questions and the Cache hides in this second series are from
the &quot;Family Edition&quot;, so are a little easier than those on the
neighbouring &quot;Trivial Trail&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To succeed with this game you will have to seek and find the
following six caches.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Trivial Trek (Geography)&lt;br/&gt;
Trivial Trek (Entertainment).&lt;br/&gt;
Trivial Trek (History).&lt;br/&gt;
Trivial Trek (Art &amp;
Literature).&lt;br/&gt;
Trivial Trek (Science &amp;
Nature).&lt;br/&gt;
Trivial Trek (Sport &amp;
Leisure).&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These initial six Caches are Eclipse tins containing a log and a
pencil but also a general knowledge question based on the category
in it's title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have the correct answers to all six of the questions,
you wil be able to calculate the coordinates of the final and
winning Unknown Cache, &lt;strong&gt;Trivial Trophy II&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the physical Caches are colour coded to match the original
board game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Caches are all located on an easily accessible part of the
Yaberoo Budjarra trail, which will now form a circular walk linking
up with a &quot;Trivial Trail&quot; in the Neerabup National Park and return
you to Burns beach Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Cache is located within a few metres of the track, so very
little bush bashing is required, but again each hide will offer a
slightly different challenge to the seeker.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

similar name. It continues on from the &quot;Trivial Trail&quot; and forms a
circular Geocache walk, returning you to Burns Beach Road.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
The Cache is not at the above coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To succeed with this Cache you must have already have found all six
Caches that are associated with the series and correctly answered
all the questions.&lt;br/&gt;

The container is a Colour co-ordinated Medium Ammo Can which on its
launch contains, a small gift for the FTF, some trackables and of
course the mandatory log and pencils.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
All questions &amp; answers are taken directly from the board game,
so any disputes please speak to Hasbro Games, not me.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions are general knowledge, but it still may help some
to carry a web enabled smart phone, just to &quot;check&quot; your answers of
course!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check your final coords for this puzzle on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=9280cbd2b37c01babe50afaa2a86d9f1&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=47433254464450&amp;amp;name=5472697669616c2054726f706879204949&quot;&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This Cache is called &quot;Petulant Putter, as it's location is on a public dual purpose pathway that runs alongside a local mini golf centre.

As I was placing the Cache the air was full of emotional cries from the participants who were evidently very frustrated as their ball refused to drop in the hole.

It was funny to listen to.

Not much to add about the Cache itself.  It's a micro and blends into its surroundings quite well, but even so  should be a quick grab.

Please replace Cache in the exact spot where you found it, I know all Cache listings say it, but its especially important with this one.

You can walk and cycle to the Cache easily, however if you are driving there is free parking 150 meters north at the local shops.

Bring a pen. No real room for swaps or TB's with this one.</groundspeak:long_description>

Cache is hidden on the edge of Lake Joondalup in an area that has recently been burnt out. 

It is a 2 litre round container that shouldn't be hard to find at the moment.

There is no definate trails to the cache but there is a walk trail to the East and other animal trails around.

There are plenty of Kangaroos in the area so watch out for ticks and possibly snakes.</groundspeak:long_description>

So bring your Geobike and make a day of it.

If driving to the Cache its about a 1km round trip from nearest carpark on grass and pathway.

The Cache is 500ml Round container with the usual log book &amp; bits &amp; pieces. 

Ensure you have the correct coords before setting out for this Cache.

The new placement is further North than original location due to lack of vegetation caused by firebug.</groundspeak:long_description>

Its called the 'Vehicular Vestibule&quot; as the Cache has now become refuge to a variety of toy/model vehicles.

The idea of this Cache is for you to bring along any number of small old toy/model vehicles, whether they be cars, trucks, boats or planes and if you so wish, swap it for another to take home.

Any form of Toy/Model Vehicle is allowed in this cache, the more different kinds the better.

Sorry, no other swappable items of any other kind may be “parked” in this cache. 

If you have images of your vehicles please feel free to add them, so we can keep a record of all the vehicles that visit.....!!!!

You can of course still visit the vehicles and log this cache even if you don’t happen to have a swap to hand..

All types of Travel Bugs and Coins are still of course more than welcome to visit... but parking a vehicle themed one will win you brownie points.

I have parked up a small collection of vehicles to get things started and also a “Double Decker Bus” TB is starting its journey from this Cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A three stage multi cache that will take you on light stroll through a small part of the Northern Yellagonga. 

This Multi cache is replacing the now archived &quot;Seriously Stumped&quot;, which was muggled on four occasions, so I am trying something new.

For the most suitable parking check out the WP below.

The coords posted will take you to an information sign located at the entry gate to the Yellagonga. 

Make your way to it and you locate the telephone number that is present at the bottom of the information panels.

You will need this phone number to calculate the first waypoint which is at:  S 31 43 UVW  E 115 46.XYZ

Label the phone number whereby 
the 1st digit = A, the 2nd= B the 3rd = C etc etc then complete the following simple sums.

U=  B + F
V=  A - C
W= B - D

X= C + D
Y= E -  C
Z= E + D

This will take you directly along the pathways to the WP which is in very easy reach.  The Cache coords will then be in your hands.    

You can continue to follow various pathways all the way to the Cache, or you can choose the shortcut down the grassy bank (Slippery Slope !!).  

In the depths of winter when the water levels in the lake are high, the two main pathways that can be used to reach the Cache, may be damp under foot as you close in on GZ, so wear some gum boots...( or wait till spring)..!  

At GZ you are looking for a large ammo can that contains the usual logbook, pencils, swappables and trackables and there is plenty of room for more.

After leaving the Cache please try to cover your trail the best you can... !!!!

Thank you.

It was also the prior location of a long established Multi Cache from Team Layabout that I had been asked to adopt.

However due to a recent bush fire the old Cache perished and much of the surrounding bushland now has very restricted access whilst the area revegetates.

Consequently I have been forced to archive that old Cache and launch this new one in it's place.

At the posted coords you will initially be searching for an Eclipse tin.

This tin will hold the final coords of the new Cache, that you will find by following the dual purpose path by foot or bicycle, from the Viewing Platform.

The Cache is a straight forward find, nothing cryptic involved, just a decent sized Ammo Tin, tucked out of sight of passers by, which hopefully will be fully resistant to future fires.

On launch the Cache contains, the usual log, a few pencils and a few swappables for the geo kids.

Enjoy.

The coordinates shown are for the nearby carpark. The actual cache location is a short walk or ride along the pathway.
The actual cache location is in code as shown below. This code was last used in Australia in the early 80's.
The two symbols are meaningless except to indicate the two different states (binary based). 
AZZZZZZ AZAZAAZ AZZAZZZ AZAAAAZ AZZZAZZ AZZZZZZ AZAAZAZ AZZAZZZ AAZAZAZ AAZAZAZ AZZZZZZ AAAZZZZ AZZAZZZ AAZAZAZ AZAAAAZ AAAZZZZ AZZZAZZ AZZZZZZ AZAZAAZ AAZAAAZ AZAAAAZ AZZAZZZ AZZZAZZ AZZZAZZ AAAAAZZ AZZZZZZ AZAAZAZ AZZAZZZ AAZAZAZ AZAAAAZ AZZZZZZ AAAZZZZ AZZAZZZ AZZAAZZ AAZZAAZ AAAZZZZ AZAAAAZ AZZZZZZ AZAZAAZ

Look at the structure of the code, it is quite distinctive. 
This is the Australian version of the code.

BBQ, play in the park, but remember to keep an eye out and listen
very carefully for the unique call of the &quot;Chirping Chicken&quot;.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This bird is so rare, we believe this location was the very first
recorded sighting in Western Australia.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So to find this unusual species and more importantly to hear its
unique call, just ensure you are standing in the right spot, be
very still, quiet and patient.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
If you are lucky you will be rewarded with a friendly greeting from
the Chicken, which will include the location of its secret nest
where the Cache is hidden&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Next, enjoy a light stroll or cycle along the dual purpose pathway,
its about 1.5 mi until you reach the sacred spot.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
On arrival, you will need to look for a cylindrical container,
about 10 inches in length, holding the log, pencil and a few small
items of Chicken treasure.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
It's in plain view, but in a discreet position as the Chicken does
not welcome uninvited visitors.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please take care to replace the item, in just the same place as you
found it, otherwise the Chicken may not share its secret with
anyone else.&lt;br/&gt;

The cache is now at a new location, which I hope will give much better access for all.  It's now only a short stroll off the main dual purpose pathway, leading from a very popular park in Joondalup.

The vegetation is fairly sparce, so there is no need to trample over any local flora, there is always a clear route round.

On arrival at GZ keep your eyes open for any wildlife.
I heard a few startled movements coming from the bushes as I approached.

You will not really need to rummage on your hands and knees in the undergrowth to succeed with this cache, just keep your eyes open and all will become apparent.

The Cache contains a log within the inner container, please bring your own pencil.

Happy Hunting.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A multi that will take you on a 10 minute stroll around this centrally located public park, close to Lakeside, Joondalup.

Parking at the recommended coords (below) is ideal, it's free in the evenings and most of the weekend. 60c for an hour at other times.

Once parked, attend the listed coords.

In front of you will see a number of spherical objects.  Count them, and then add the total to the both the S and E of the following coords to find WP1.
 
S 31 44.675
E 115.46.265

Attend WP1.  Carefully examine the boy.  He will provide you with a four figure number.  (The largest plaque on the monument can also be used to confirm this number). 

Add the first two digits of this number to the S and the second two digits to the E, of the following coords.

S 31. 44.764
E 115 46.248

This will give you WP2. 

Attend this WP. Before you is another set of spherical objects, once again count them and add the total to both the S and the E of the following coords.

S 31  44.780
E 115 46.200

This will give you the final Cache location.

At GZ you will be searching for a small commonly used Sistema container, which on launch holds the usual log and pencils and also a couple of trackables.

This Cache will also be a pick up point for The Machman PathTag, for  any visitors to the Cache who happen to collect them.

Due to the proximity of the local Uni, choose your moment to search as there can be a steady stream of inquisitive students close by.

A visit to this Cache during the weekends, early evenings or Uni holidays would make for a considerably easier search as the area becomes deserted.

Enjoy.

Alternatively if you fancy more of a trek, you can make your way to the Cache, via the dual purpose pathway that's runs through the Yellagonga and then follow convenient animal tracks Westwards.  There's a significant number of other Caches along the way.

On arrival at GZ, you will be searching for a decent sized Cache, that when placed contains just a log, so bring a pencil.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Secluded Spheres is back, but it is now at a new location, with new coords and a brand new way to find!

Secluded Spheres is now exclusively a night time cache and can only be found by the use of a torch, your GPS, and a trail of 18 fire tacks which form a trail, spread over a few hundred metres.

The posted coords will take you to the start of the trail, but do not arrive until night fall.

Once at the coords, turn on your torch, hold it at head height and slowly turn a 360 degree circle looking directly in the beam as you do.

At some point during your 360 turn your torches beam will fall onto a shining &quot;fire tack&quot; (see firetacks.com), this will be the first marker of the trail.  

Proceed towards the shining marker, upon arrival you will need to then shine your torch, again at head height, until you pick up your second marker.  Walk to each marker and repeat the process and you will gradually make your way towards the Cache.

At your 17th marker, you will find a set of final coords.  You will need to enter these coords into your GPS to find the final Cache.

The Cache location is also marked with twin fire tacks, so you will be assured your GPS has brought you to the correct final location.

I've made the Cache a very generous size so
it will be very easy to find in the dark.

You will find the traditional &quot;log book and pencil&quot; (well not so traditional actually), a bag for trackables and a second bag for swappables.

I've noticed a common theme, in nearly all Caches I've found. They have all contained balls..so I thought I would put out a big cache where all the balls can get together, so please bring along any number of balls, whether they be golf, snooker, bouncy, marbles or whatever...and if you so wish, swap it for another to take home.

All types of Travel Bugs and Coins are most welcome.

The coords listed above will take you initially to WP 1, an Anglicare clothing bin.

WP 2 can be found at 

S 31 46. ABC
E 115 46. DEF

To find the coords label the 8 digit telephone number on the face of WP1 bin, where the first digit is G and last being an N.

A= G-I        B= G-H     C= I+H
D= G+M.     E= L-K.     F=J+K-H      
 
At WP 2 you will find collection points for Good Sammy, Breast Cancer and the Paraplegic\quadriplegic Association. 

Please make any further contribution here before calculating the final cache location.

GZ is located at 

S 31 46. ABC
E 115 47. DEF

To find these coords label the 8 digit telephone number on the face of the bin, located to the far left, as you look at these WP2 collection points front on.

The first digit becomes a G and last
being an N.

A= M-J         B= G-N    C= N+H
D= H+I          E= L-J     F= H+J

On arrival at GZ you will find that the Salvation army and other organizations have further collection points here,  if you have any remaining contributions to make.

Many Thanks To You.

You can complete this Cache by foot by enjoying a 40 minute suburban stroll through parks and on quiet roads, or if pushed for time or overladen with charitable goods you can also drive and park at each WP.  

I would definitely avoid arriving at 3 pm as there are two local schools in the vicinity.

The Nano cache that was located here was muggled or blown away in the wind or something, so I replaced it with another Cache, much larger than its baby brother, but in the same location.

NB. This replacement Cache has now been reincarnated and offers a different challenge again......

Please ensure you replace the cache with critical precision. 

Please take your own pencil.</groundspeak:long_description>

The Cache is located within the same park, but has slightly differing coordinates.

The cache container is a reasonable size, (25cm), but due to its design currently only has only room for a log, so please bring your own pen, and no swappables for this one i'm afraid.  

Please be aware this cache is equally well camouflaged as its predecessor.

The park has plenty of free parking, and is great for exercising your dog or your children, so bring them along.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A short two stage multi cache which does not involve a significant walk, but may require a systematic search.

The initial coords will take you to WP1, where you will be required to hunt for a small jar. To make the hunt easier this jar has been placed within a larger canister which is then in turn is placed in a larger camouflaged container which blends into the natural environment.

From here you will get the new coords which will take you to the Cache.

On arrival at GZ you are looking for a traditional Sistema container that on placement holds a log book, pencil and a trackable.  This container is only partially camouflaged.

To get from the WP1 to the Cache there is a direct line through the scrub and various animal paths to follow, however if you wish for an easier but slightly longer route, with less risk to local flora, then there are a couple of open vehicle paths/tracks that will take you to within just  a few meters of GZ.

D = degrees; M = minutes and period = decimal point
This code doesn't have the symbols for these.
I placed the fwd slashes between characters to make the delineation obvious, they are not part of the code.
Before I am accused of symbol and/or coding errors I will refer you back to the name of the cache.

But perhaps just take five mins after you log your find to wander round the pond nearby,  lots of birdlife to admire.

The challenge on this cache, apart from finding it, is completing your log without being spotted !

It's located in an idylic park, but very open and surrounded by two storey homes, so please look over both shoulders when picking up and replacing this hide.

To find the exact Cache coordinates you are going to have join me on a voyage of discovery with Captain Horatio Pugwash.

For those of you who don't know Captain Pugwash, he was a fictional pirate in a series of books by John Ryan.  

The character's adventures were adapted into a TV series, using cardboard cut-outs filmed in live-action first shown on the BBC in 1957.   In the late 1990's it was remade into a traditional cartoon for new generations of kids.  

Captain Horatio Pugwash – sails the high seas in his ship called the Black Pig, ably assisted by cabin boy Tom, pirates Willy and Barnabas, and Master Mate. His mortal enemy is Cut-Throat Jake, captain of the Flying Dustman.

Captain Pugwash is renowned for his exclamations and often speaks in alliterations..... so to find the coords for this cache you are going to have to complete the following famous &quot;Pugwashisms&quot;....     

The Cache will be found at the following coords:
S31 46.UVW   E 115 43 XYZ

U  = &quot; Dolloping   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _&quot; (1st missing letter) 
V  = &quot; Suffering   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ &quot; (2nd missing letter)   
W = &quot; Staggering _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _&quot; (10th missing letter)  

X= Nautical _ _ _ _ _ _ _ &quot; (2nd missing letter)    
Y= Lolloping _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ &quot; (4th missing letter)      
Z= Scuttling _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _&quot; (8th missing letter)      

Once you have found the missing letters simply convert the letters into numbers using A=1 B=2 etc.  You will then have the coords to start your seaward voyage.

As for the Cache you are looking for a small container, stored in a watertight pouch which has a log and a pencil.

However you will not need to go excavating or climbing over the fence line.
it is within arms reach at a sensible hieght.

Extreme Stealth will be required here, as the area is very popular with runners/cyclists and dog walkers alike.

Avast, me harties !

(The previous cache went missing over winter so I have replaced it with another style of Cache, in a similar location, but will offer a different challenge than its the origanal &quot;Obscure Outlook&quot;.  So if you have found the last one come back and try again.

Obscure Outlook is now a small traditional cache, a Sistema container, tucked a short stroll off the path, but in a nice clearing, with views over the lake.  

The cache is not burried as the ground can be damp underfoot as you get close!!  It currently just contains just a log and pencil but there is room for a small swappables or geocoins/bugs etc..

The cache is located close to the waters edge, so take care whilst searching.  If it is winter time you may need to be prepared for a little wading so please take care.</groundspeak:long_description>

You will actually find your self adjacent to a &quot;Nature Reserve&quot; but ironically from here all you will experience is the the sweet sound of vehicle engines and of course a chance to suck in some fresh carbon monoxide.

Take a moment to stop and view the natural beauty of barbed wire fences, telegraph poles, towering street lamps, six lane carriageways &amp; tarmac cycle paths and of course the mandatory graffiti.

Also for your viewing pleasure gas, electric and water pipes are also easily accessible and of course no area would be complete without the usual quantity of conveniently located litter.

So if you do have a foolish desire to visit this Cache, then don your earplugs and face masks and come and marvel in what was once an area of outstanding national beauty.  You Have Been Warned !!

This Cache, currently contains just a log  sheet, I still haven't got round to making mini pencils..but will do so in due course, so please bring your own until then.

You will only have to venture a little way off the path to find it, so please don't go rummaging to far into the undergrowth.

There is parking on the verge a few hundred yards North of the Cache, if required.

Enjoy!

The location is easily reached with a 10 minute stroll over some sandy track. 

On arrival at GZ you will eventually be seeking a 35mm canister, containing a log sheet and a pencil.

However it is very well camouflaged, so keep searching and you'll be rewarded.

On the verge parking is available due West of the site.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is another traditional Sistema container containing the usual logbook, pencil, with room for swapables and trackables.

Its an easy to walk to location, with a variety of sandy tracks to follow.

I would suggest that you tackle this cache with a Geo Friend or family as you will really appreciate the extra pair of hands to assist with its retrieval and more importantly its correct and secure replacement !!!

The Cache you are searching for is a traditional Sistema container, containing a log, pencil. 

Theres also room for a few swappables/trackables.

You will have to pass through some long grass, so watch out for local  forna in the summer months !!!  Also it may get a little damp and slippery underfoot in winter.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This short multi is located in a very prestine park, with a lake, a fantastic fountain and some very well maintained landscaping.  

There is only a short stroll between the WP and the Cache so you don't need your hiking gear, just some patience.

But please attempt this one when you have plenty of time, it's not a park and grab, the challenge at both the WP and for the final search may take a little time to complete.

The published coords will take you to a sign post that holds three City Of Joondalup notices for your strictest attention.

You will need to use all three signs to get the required results. 

So bring paper and a pencil. All you have to do is simply count how many times each of the following letters appear on the sign post !

J,M,S,V,W,X,Y's  

Once you have an answer for each letter you will then need to complete the very simple sums below to
seek the cache at the following coordinates.

S 31 48. ABC      E 115 44. DEF

A=  The number of &quot;W's&quot; plus the number of X's&quot;
B=  The number of &quot;S's&quot; minus the number of V's&quot;
C= The number of &quot;W's&quot; plus the number of &quot;V's&quot; 

D= The number of &quot;M's&quot; minus the number of W's&quot;
E= The number of &quot;Y's&quot; minus the number of M's&quot;
F= The number of &quot;J's&quot; plus the number &quot;W's&quot;.

When you have your new coords, enjoy the short stroll over the perfectly manicured lawns, remembering to bring your pencil with you, as you will need this to sign the log book in this very discreetly hidden cache.

You will also need to be on the lookout whilst conducting your search as not only is the park overlooked by two storey houses, there are also a lot of locals enjoying the area and a kindergarten close by.

Enjoy

NB.  The above calculations were changed on 25.03.2011, when the local Authority altered the original content of the signs.

Found this small piece of Parkland whilst having a nosey round this posh new housing development.  

There is roadside parking around the park and a wooden walkway takes 
you through it.

After youve found the cache theres a few nice house designs to admire so have a wander round and only a  stones throw from the beach.... mmm wheres my lotto ticket ???</groundspeak:long_description>

you could hide dozens of caches in here and never know.

Anyway nothing cryptic about this cache, its just a simple traditional Sistema container, that contains a log book pencil and a few small swapables.

It may take a bit of a methodical hunt to find, there were so many great hiding options, but you may just get lucky first time.

If you enter the reserve from O'Leary Road, you get the best walk and there is also limited street parking.

Please be aware there is a school next door so I would avoid visiting the area between 2.45pm to 3.15pm...it's chaotic !!!</groundspeak:long_description>

This new cache is the same size as....lets say.... a Lemon !!!
It's a similar shape to.....lets say.....a Lemon !!!
It's also a similar colour to .. lets say... a Lemon !!!

This Cache at first glance looks like a gentle stroll past the aquarium and walk along the western breakwater... which in part it is.   

HOWEVER the last 100m as you close in on GZ the path finishes and you are left to clamber over the rocks.

It's relatively straightforward as mostly they are even and seem stable and well spaced for stepping from rock to rock.

Though I would perhaps suggest you leave this cache alone at night, and certainly in high winds or if it is or has been recently raining.  I would also suggest you have sensible sturdy footwear and BYOP

At GZ you are offered panoramic views over the Indian Ocean, so take a drink, sit on the rocks and watch the ocean go by.</groundspeak:long_description>

This Cache is strictly urban, certainly no need for trekking gear with this one.

The cache is also a really good size, so not a nano hunt, however you will still need to take a pencil to sign the Cache.

The Cache is in an open public area but not so much as to spoil your hunt.</groundspeak:long_description>

In order to place this cache, we went on a great bushwalk in Whiteman Park. Please share your story about how you got to the cache, especially if it was using an environmentally friendly means of transportation.

While this particular trail is not conducive to bicycling, there are many great bicycle paths within Whiteman Park.

In these caches, you'll find some ProjectBlueSky geocoins for the first finders. Please only take one... if you have one from another cache, please leave them for other people. There are also some other pins and swag from BC Parks, BCGA and Project Blue Sky.

This is the second of my coin swap caches and it runs on the Gold theme. The way it works is you swap a forign coin. This is quite easy to find but there are many muggles about!

Out on a short Caching run with FELIX II, when three new Caches were published, 
so we amended our route and headed straight for this one. 

Straight forward find at GZ..and a bonus to be greeted by an empty logbook.

Thanks also for the FTF prize Loubla , but i'm afraid we left it in the Cache.
Sorry I guess I thought it was for swaps!!!

I did pick up the trackable you left though, which I will move on very shortly.

Slightly confusing because geocaching.com doesn't show any caches at this location - that would because the logbook is supposed to be in a cache in Armadale. It seems a geocaching.com cache that hasn't yet been archived (but is listed as being unavailable) has been recycled to this new location logbook and all. All very confusing.

The logbook should be replaced to reflect this new location and cache and the geocaching.com cache should be archived (or replaced and the logbook from this cache put backk into it).

So I think I'm 2nd to find after Rogue's FTF at its new location.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located near the Barlee River on Stewart Road.  We realised there were no caches along this road while travelling through the area. 

 The cache is a mint tin with log only so BYO pen.  Parking is available down a dirt track located beside the bridge. This is also a handy spot to camp overnight.</groundspeak:long_description>
