You will require a suitable 4x4 vehicle for this route as the sand is deep in a significant number of places.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cache you are seeking, is a small container, which when placed contained a pencil, log and a trackable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would suggest you keep your swappables for other local Caches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please take care with this cache and replace it exactly as you find it.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many thanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M</groundspeak:long_description>

The Cache is not at the above coordinates.
&lt;p&gt;To succeed with this Cache you must have already have found all
six Caches that are associated with the series and correctly
answered all the questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You must now use your two digit answers from each question to find
the correct coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
GC2QMV2 Trivial Trail (Geography) Answer = A
&amp; B&lt;br /&gt;
GC2QMYT Trivial Trail (Entertainment) Answer = C
&amp; D&lt;br /&gt;
GC2QMZM Trivial Trail (History) Answer = E
&amp; F&lt;br /&gt;
GC2QMZW Trivial Trail (Art &amp; Literature)
Answer = G &amp; H&lt;br /&gt;
GC2QN06 Trivial Trail (Science &amp; Nature)
Answer = I &amp; J&lt;br /&gt;
GCQN0D Trivial Trail (Sport &amp; Liesure)
Answer = K &amp; L&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The coordinates for this 'Winning Cache&quot; are.....&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
S 31.42. NOP.&lt;br /&gt;
E 115.45 QRS.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
N= J - D&lt;br /&gt;
O= E - F&lt;br /&gt;
P= G + H&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Q= K + L&lt;br /&gt;
R= A + I + H&lt;br /&gt;
S= B - C - K&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The container is a Colour co-ordinated Medium Ammo Can, (see
images) and on its launch contains a few goodies and swaps, some
trackables, and of course the mandatory log and pencils.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All questions &amp; answers are taken directly from the board game,
so any disputes please speak to Hasbro Games, not me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 72 year old dad answered 5 out of 6 questions correctly just
by using his noodle....but it may help some to carry a smart phone
that uses Google !!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congratulations, as ever, go to CHWILIWR for completing the trail
and then being the FTF for &quot;Trivial Trophy&quot;. Congrats also to
BLINGG for being FTF for the majority of the other Caches on the
&quot;Trivial Trail&quot;and 2TF the Trivial Trophy&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(NB. My thanks go to team PRIMREY, who kindly donated this Ammo Can

you wil be able to calculate the coordinates of the final and

&lt;p&gt;All the physical Caches are colour coded to match the original

circular Cache walk, linking up with the Yaberoo Budjarra
trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Cache is located within a few metres of the track, so very
little bush bashing is required, but again each hide will offer a

game of a similar name.&lt;/p&gt;
The questions in this second series are from the &quot;Family Edition&quot;,
so are a little easier than those on the neighbouring &quot;Trivial
Trail&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To succeed with this game you will firstly have to seek and find
the following six caches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These initial six Caches are Eclipse tins containing a log and a
pencil but also a general knowledge question based on the category
in it's title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have the correct answers to all six of the questions,
you will be able to calculate the coordinates of the final and
winning Unknown Cache, &lt;strong&gt;Trivial Trophy II&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the physical Caches are colour coded to match the original
board game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Caches are all located on an easily accessible part of the
Yaberoo Budjarra trail, which will now form a circular walk linking
up with a &quot;Trivial Trail&quot; in the Nerrabup National Park and return
you to Burns Beach Road&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Cache is located within a few metres of the track, so very
little bush bashing is required, but again each hide will offer a
slightly different challenge to the seeker.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

similar name. It continues on from the &quot;Trivial Trail&quot; and forms a
circular Geocache walk, returning you to Burns Beach Road.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The Cache is not at the above coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; To succeed with this Cache you must have already have found all six
Caches that are associated with the series and correctly answered
all the questions.&lt;br /&gt;

The container is a Colour co-ordinated Medium Ammo Can which on its
launch contains, a small gift for the FTF, some trackables and of
course the mandatory log and pencils.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All questions &amp; answers are taken directly from the board game,
so any disputes please speak to Hasbro Games, not me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions are general knowledge, but it still may help some
to carry a web enabled smart phone, just to &quot;check&quot; your answers of
course!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check your final coords for this puzzle on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=9280cbd2b37c01babe50afaa2a86d9f1&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=47433254464450&amp;amp;name=5472697669616c2054726f706879204949&quot;&gt;

It's a micro and blends into its surroundings quite well, but even so  should be a quick grab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please replace Cache in the exact spot where you found it, I know all Cache listings say it, but its especially important with this one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can walk and cycle to the Cache easily, however if you are driving there is free parking 150 meters north at the local shops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring a pen.

To make the most of this trail, it's advised that you start at #1Testing Tube, &quot;for it's a very good place to start&quot;..... (reminds me of a song I once knew)... to walk the trail it only takes 30 minutes... plus your logging time !!!

All the Caches are about 15cm in size, not camouflaged, so &quot;should&quot; be quite easy to spot.&lt;br /&gt;

All Caches contain both a log and a pencil.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
To make the most of this trail, it's advised that you start at #1Testing Tube, &quot;for it's a very good place to start&quot;..... (reminds me of a song I once knew)... to walk the trail it only takes 30 minutes... plus your logging time !!!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
All the Caches are about 15cm in size, not camouflaged, so &quot;should&quot; be quite easy to spot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All Caches contain both a log and a pencil.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy.</groundspeak:long_description>

BBQ, play in the park, but remember to keep an eye out and listen
very carefully for the unique call of the &quot;Chirping Chicken&quot;.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This bird is so rare, we believe this location was the very first
recorded sighting in Western Australia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So to find this unusual species and more importantly to hear its
unique call, just ensure you are standing in the right spot, be
very still, quiet and patient.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you are lucky you will be rewarded with a friendly greeting from
the Chicken, which will include the location of its secret nest
where the Cache is hidden&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next, enjoy a light stroll or cycle along the dual purpose pathway,
its about 1.5 mi until you reach the sacred spot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On arrival, you will need to look for a cylindrical container,
about 10 inches in length, holding the log, pencil and a few small
items of Chicken treasure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's in plain view, but in a discreet position as the Chicken does
not welcome uninvited visitors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please take care to replace the item, in just the same place as you
found it, otherwise the Chicken may not share its secret with
anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;

Walk to each marker and repeat the process and you will gradually make your way towards the Cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At your 17th marker, you will find a set of final coords.  You will need to enter these coords into your GPS to find the final Cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cache location is also marked with twin fire tacks, so you will be assured your GPS has brought you to the correct final location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've made the Cache a very generous size so&lt;br/&gt;it will be very easy to find in the dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will find the traditional &quot;log book and pencil&quot; (well not so traditional actually), a bag for trackables and a second bag for swappables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've noticed a common theme, in nearly all Caches I've found. They have all contained balls..so I thought I would put out a big cache where all the balls can get together, so please bring along any number of balls, whether they be golf, snooker, bouncy, marbles or whatever...and if you so wish, swap it for another to take home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All types of Travel Bugs and Coins are most welcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FT2C2XK - Coords for final cache&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;location of final coords.&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: SS2C2XK - Secluded Spheres V2&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Final Cache Location.</groundspeak:long_description>

In the late 1990's it was remade into a traditional cartoon for new generations of kids.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captain Horatio Pugwash – sails the high seas in his ship called the Black Pig, ably assisted by cabin boy Tom, pirates Willy and Barnabas, and Master Mate. His mortal enemy is Cut-Throat Jake, captain of the Flying Dustman.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Captain Pugwash is renowned for his exclamations and often speaks in alliterations..... so to find the coords for this cache you are going to have to complete the following famous &quot;Pugwashisms&quot;....     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cache will be found at the following coords:&lt;br/&gt;S31 46.UVW   E 115 43 XYZ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U  = &quot; Dolloping   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _&quot; (1st missing letter) &lt;br/&gt;V  = &quot; Suffering   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ &quot; (2nd missing letter)   &lt;br/&gt;W = &quot; Staggering _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _&quot; (10th missing letter)  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X= Nautical _ _ _ _ _ _ _ &quot; (2nd missing letter)    &lt;br/&gt;Y= Lolloping _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ &quot; (4th missing letter)      &lt;br/&gt;Z= Scuttling _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _&quot; (8th missing letter)      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have found the missing letters simply convert the letters into numbers using A=1 B=2 etc.  You will then have the coords to start your seaward voyage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for the Cache you are looking for a small container, stored in a watertight pouch which has a log and a pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However you will not need to go excavating or climbing over the fence line.&lt;br/&gt;it is within arms reach at a sensible hieght.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extreme Stealth will be required here, as the area is very popular with runners/cyclists and dog walkers alike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Avast, me harties !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: PP2AQ8G - Pugwash Paradox&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Cache Final Location.</groundspeak:long_description>

So if you have found the last one come back and try again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obscure Outlook is now a small traditional cache, a Sistema container, tucked a short stroll off the path, but in a nice clearing, with views over the lake.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is not burried as the ground can be damp underfoot as you get close!!  It currently just contains just a log and pencil but there is room for a small swappables or geocoins/bugs etc..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is located close to the waters edge, so take care whilst searching.  If it is winter time you may need to be prepared for a little wading so please take care.</groundspeak:long_description>

You Have Been Warned !!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Cache, currently contains just a log  sheet, I still haven't got round to making mini pencils..but will do so in due course, so please bring your own until then.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will only have to venture a little way off the path to find it, so please don't go rummaging to far into the undergrowth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is parking on the verge a few hundred yards North of the Cache, if required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;The Machman&quot;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This short multi is located in a very prestine park, with a lake, a fantastic fountain and some very well maintained landscaping.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is only a short stroll between the WP and the Cache so you don't need your hiking gear, just some patience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But please attempt this one when you have plenty of time, it's not a park and grab, the challenge at both the WP and for the final search may take a little time to complete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The published coords will take you to a sign post that holds three City Of Joondalup notices for your strictest attention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need to use all three signs to get the required results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So bring paper and a pencil. All you have to do is simply count how many times each of the following letters appear on the sign post !&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;J,M,S,V,W,X,Y's  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you have an answer for each letter you will then need to complete the very simple sums below to&lt;br/&gt;seek the cache at the following coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S 31 48. ABC      E 115 44. DEF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A=  The number of &quot;W's&quot; plus the number of X's&quot;&lt;br/&gt;B=  The number of &quot;S's&quot; minus the number of V's&quot;&lt;br/&gt;C= The number of &quot;W's&quot; plus the number of &quot;V's&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;D= The number of &quot;M's&quot; minus the number of W's&quot;&lt;br/&gt;E= The number of &quot;Y's&quot; minus the number of M's&quot;&lt;br/&gt;F= The number of &quot;J's&quot; plus the number &quot;W's&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you have your new coords, enjoy the short stroll over the perfectly manicured lawns, remembering to bring your pencil with you, as you will need this to sign the log book in this very discreetly hidden cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will also need to be on the lookout whilst conducting your search as not only is the park overlooked by two storey houses, there are also a lot of locals enjoying the area and a kindergarten close by.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NB.  The above calculations were changed on 25.03.2011, when the local Authority altered the original content of the signs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FF2AZXT - Frightful Fountain&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

I would also suggest you have sensible sturdy footwear and BYOP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At GZ you are offered panoramic views over the Indian Ocean, so take a drink, sit on the rocks and watch the ocean go by.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Noted for her cleverness and creativity and regarded as one of the greatest witches of the age, Ravenclaw was one of the four Founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry along with Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin, as well as the namesake of the Ravenclaw House.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ravenclaw was &quot;beautiful yet slightly intimidating.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The four founders were later commanded by the Ministry of Magic to each hide a secret Cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Any Wizard or Muggle that was able to seek out and find these four Caches and answer the questions which they held, would have the power and knowledge to then seek out a fifth and FINAL cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Legend tells us that
&lt;br /&gt;

hid her Cache in a large object two score paces SSW from S31.50.WWW E115.57.WWW

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Salazar Slytherin was a pure-blood wizard and a Parselmouth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was one of four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft &amp; Wizardry and the former best friend of Godric Gryffindor, a fellow founder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Slytherin didn't trust Muggle-born students due to their persecution against wizards, and he expressed his opinion not to accept them at Hogwarts. However, when the other Hogwarts founders didn't agree, Slytherin left the school and did not return again.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Each of the four founders were later commanded by the Ministry of Magic to hide a secret Cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Any Wizard or Muggle that was able to seek out and find these four Caches and answer the questions which they held, would have the power and knowledge to then seek out a fifth and FINAL cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Legend tells us that

hid his Cache somewhere close to S31.50.XXX E115.57.XXX

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The &quot;Therapeutic Threesome&quot; is a Letterbox, a Geocache and also a
QR code capture site.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even though this hide is a three way hybrid, I have attempted to
maintain the characteristics of Letterbox.&lt;br /&gt;
Please note the &quot;Letterbox&quot; is NOT at the above coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Hide contains three boxes:
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Box 1: Letterbox.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Contains a quantity of blank &quot;Machman&quot; postcards and also my
personal ink stamp. If you are an experienced letterboxer and carry
your own personalised ink stamp, then please stamp one of my post
cards and write any message you so wish.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can use &quot;The Machmans&quot; stamp in your own personal log.&lt;br /&gt;
PLEASE ensure this stamp remains sealed in the letter box.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If this is your first &quot;Letterbox&quot;, and you don't have a personal
stamp, then you can still record your visit but you must draw a
realistic stick man figure of each of you attending the box on one
of the post cards provided and then sign and date it
accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Box 2: Geocache&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A Traditional Cache, containing a log book and pencil and has room
for a few Trackables or Coins, but please no swaps at his
site.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Box 3: QR CODE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Just contains a personalised QR CODE for you to capture to confirm
that you have visited the &quot;Therapeutic Threesome&quot;. Please also
record a journal online prior to submitting your capture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Your Directions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. Using your GPSR navigate to the spot identified by the above
coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Mark this as a Waypoint.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Look SOUTH and you will see a prominent hard surfaced
path.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Start to walk on this path, it meanders in different
directions.&lt;br /&gt;
5. It then takes you in a general Easterly direction.&lt;br /&gt;
6. DO NOT leave the path.&lt;br /&gt;
7. When you are 775M (as the crow flies) from your starting WP you
will reach a crossroads.&lt;br /&gt;
8. Do not turn, but cross over and continue in an Easterly
direction.&lt;br /&gt;
9. Keep your eyes open&lt;br /&gt;
10. A short distance after the crossroads you will reach this tree
stump along side the pathway.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
11. Look to the NORTH.&lt;br /&gt;
12. The Letterbox is hidden in a very traditional manner just 12M
North of the pictured stump.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
He was good friends with Salazar Slytherin, but opposed him when he later thought that they should not accept mudblood students at Hogwarts&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gryffindor's birthplace became known as Godric's Hallow, in his honour.&lt;br /&gt;
Godric Gryffindor's portrait still remains at Hogwarts.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Each of the four founders were later commanded by the Ministry of Magic to hide a secret Cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Any Wizard or Muggle that was able to seek out and find these four Caches and answer the questions which they held, would have the power and knowledge to then seek out a fifth and FINAL cache.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">HISTORY&lt;br/&gt;Perth Modern School was established as the first government senior secondary school in Western Australia in 1911, after lengthy representations to the State Government. Selection from 1912 was by scholarship. Both male and female students studied science and modern languages as part of their courses.&lt;br/&gt;The sphinx, representing wisdom and knowledge, was adopted as the school symbol; together with the motto &quot;Savoir c'est Pouvoir&quot; (&quot;Knowledge is Power&quot;).&lt;br/&gt;In 1958 Perth Modern School ceased operating as an academic scholarship school and became a comprehensive high school. Academic standards, the traditions of the past and the establishment of the special Music Scholarship in 1968 continued to have significant influence on the school.&lt;br/&gt;The decision by the State Government to return Perth Modern School to a fully selective government school has attracted record enrolment inquiries. Parents of students enrolled at Perth Modern School, and the wider community, have recognised that by gathering students of high ability in the one school encourages students to “be themselves” with like-minded peers allows opportunity for the development of higher-order thinking skills and meets the social, emotional and educational needs of gifted students.The gifted program is based on Professor Francous Gagne's Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;Located near West Leederville station. At the start and end of school time, students from Perth Modern frequent this station. The cache is a micro in a camo outer, so BYOP and micro tools. Muggles may be abundant at times.</groundspeak:long_description>

Out on a short Caching run with FELIX II, when three new Caches were published, 
so we amended our route and headed straight for this one. 

Straight forward find at GZ..and a bonus to be greeted by an empty logbook.

Thanks also for the FTF prize Loubla , but i'm afraid we left it in the Cache.
Sorry I guess I thought it was for swaps!!!

I did pick up the trackable you left though, which I will move on very shortly.

Didn't have a coin to contribute so I left a pathtag.  However it appears the Machman and Felix combo had signed the back of the logbook earlier - ah well.  TFTC

Firstly you need to attend the above &quot;coded&quot; coordinates

This pouch contains a second set of coded coordinates which
is the final location of the Cache.
&lt;br /&gt;
However the large object that you find at GZ is NOT
actually the final prize...

You will need to LOOK a little harder to find
that.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Hmmm, first to log but second to find or is that 16th to find. No logs here but numerous logs for the geocaching.com cache id on the logbook. Slightly confusing because geocaching.com doesn't show any caches at this location - that would because the logbook is supposed to be in a cache in Armadale. It seems a geocaching.com cache that hasn't yet been archived (but is listed as being unavailable) has been recycled to this new location logbook and all. All very confusing.

The logbook should be replaced to reflect this new location and cache and the geocaching.com cache should be archived (or replaced and the logbook from this cache put backk into it).

So I think I'm 2nd to find after Rogue's FTF at its new location.</groundspeak:text>

Found by Mark, we were coming up to Yallingup today for Chloes's 10th birthday to the Maze. 
I decided to check for any caches in the area and saw this one which i had not seen previously and downloaded to gps to go and look for. 
Gps sent me off course into sand dunes which i thought was a bit strange and then i remembered the hint and soon found cache. It was out in the open so when i had signed the log i hid a bit better under some bushes, still in the same spot. NO need to go over fence to find this one! TFTC. TNLN. 
Love the location, thanks for bringing us back to this beautiful spot. </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located near the Barlee River on Stewart Road.  We realised there were no caches along this road while travelling through the area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The cache is a mint tin with log only so BYO pen.  Parking is available down a dirt track located beside the bridge. This is also a handy spot to camp overnight.</groundspeak:long_description>

Managed to reach from the first step, which was good as i was not so keen on going down too far, however i was determined to find and was considering extending my search under the bridge this time but luckily i didnt have to. lol. Good to see lots of new log sheets to chose from.
We stopped on our way down to Northcliffe for a few days of exploring. Ive even got a made up geocache, or three, to put out here somewhere. Keep a look out in the next week or so to see what pops up! Tftc. :)

previously logged find on GC website, should automatically log find!</groundspeak:text>
