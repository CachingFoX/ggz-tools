The great outdoors isn't the place from the TV-commercials with blue skies and fleecy clouds.There are no fresh towels or machines with all-in-one shampoo in the wild. It is as far as possible away from our sterile world with their safety belts, guardrails, seat cushions and &quot;please wash your hands now&quot; signs. This is how it should be and this is why we love it. Geocaching was in the truest sense of the word inspired by the unforeseen and inhospitable. If the enemy is the unknown, a perfect performance is not a luxury but a necessity. With geocaching, mountaineering and other outdoor activities, you have to face real dangers. Just because your equipment can cope with everything, that does not mean you can too. Have great respect for the environment in which you find yourself. Be prepared for everything!  
 
I hope you enjoyed the reading but seriously:
 
This cache is dangerous and can cause severe injuries or death! Thunderstorms, tidal changes and lack of skills are the greatest threats to your health and safety! DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID!

The Facility
The Black Mesa Research Facility is a private research and defence contractor comprised of a massive complex built within Phillip Bay just off the coast of Melbourne. Built deep into the bottom of the ocean, Black Mesa is the site of broad scientific research relating to theoretical, quantum, and particle physics, applied mathematics, robotics, genetics, biotechnology, trans-dimensional travel, teleporting, and other classified subjects.
 
The submerged character of Black Mesa is due to the shielding nature of vast amount of water on top of it. Although it being close to a major metropolitan area, it is considered to be one of the safest facilities on this planet ... until three hours ago.
	



The Incident
Three hours ago the Black Mesa relay station in Point Cook lost all communication with the research facility. Only a small data burst was received prior to a massive electromagnetic surge. The data indicates that lambda-experiment resulted in a catastrophic failure of the containment field and therefore opened an uncontrolled trans-dimensional portal. Fortunately the fail-safe system did work and closed the portal after 350 ms with a 32.5 t RDX charge. Most of the blast energy was absorbed by the portal however a small portion did render the research facility inert.
 
We believe that this is the reason why the second fail-safe system didn't engage and secondary rift opened close to the Black Mesa facility. As of now we have no information where that rift is located. Our lambda satellite shows a reading but the glare from the first portal is still visible. The rift has to be within the purple zone. Our best guess at the moment is that the second fail-safe sensors did record the rift jump and launched a buoy with the exact coordinates.
 
Since this is a class three incident the SASR has been notified to take care of the situation. Although they have to fly in from Swanbourne, WA your window of opportunity is limited. You have to retrieve the coordinates, get to ground zero and close it with a hollow charge. Make absolutely sure the charge is pointing to the centre of the rift. Any misaiming would have catastrophic consequences since it would expand the rift instead of closing it. Previous similar incidents and the following involvement of military personnel suggest that this vital information is not know to every operator.
 
We recommend that you get the job done before the SASR arrives.

(The Hunt)
Three easy steps and you are at the portal / cache. You'll only need this paragraph to find the cache.
 

    * Stage 1 - S37 53.783 E144 58.412
       
      At the given coordinates you'll find a buoy with a number at the top = A. Attached to one of the handles are two plaques with the coords for stage 2 and the final. (In case you can't find them / you don't want to get close to that buoy, write down the eight numbers at the bottom and calculate the coords: BCDEFGHI)
       
    * Stage 2 - S37 53.(C-1)(H)(E) E144 59.(G)(D-I)(B)
       
      If the number A is even enter portside (left) - if A is uneven enter starboard (right). If there are more than 2 doors / gates / hatches / ... use the very left or very right.
       
    * Stage 3 - Final - S37 53.(E+I)(G)(F-E) E144 59.(C)(D-I)(E)
       
      The cache-box is about 2m above your feet. Well done You found it!
