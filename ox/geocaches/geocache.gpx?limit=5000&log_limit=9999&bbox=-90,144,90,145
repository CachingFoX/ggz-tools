You should be an experianced Open Water Diver or Advanced Diver to seek this cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is hidden on a hidden reef about 100 yards North of Gab Gab swimming pool. There is a mouring buoy that you can decend. When you get to about 45' depth leave the decent line and head North until you reach the reef. There is a tourist submarine that is regularly at this location. It is safe to dive when it is there but keep your distance. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To find the cache you will need to go where the big fish eat from a 20 quart food dish. From there you will take a compass heading of 330°. Follow that heading until you are in about 65' of water. It will be tucked under a piece of coral. Please put the cache back right where you found it when you are done. Enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

we have in Australia
&lt;p&gt;My kids are part of this great movement and I am a leader as
well. Some of these kids have shown an interest in geocaching so
why not help them participate.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Baden-Powell was encouraged to set down his views on how he would
apply Scouting to the training of boys. He first conducted an
experimental camp in 1907 on Brownsea Island off the Dorset coast
of the UK. With some 20 boys from all walks of life and suitable
adult leaders, Baden-Powell taught the boys what he meant by
Scouting. They lived in tents, cooked their own food and learnt
many valuable skills through games.
&lt;p&gt;1 August 1907 is regarded as the beginning of the Scout Movement
worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camp was a great success and proved Baden-Powell's ideas, so
he tackled the task of writing down his experience in a book.
Scouting for Boys was first published in fortnightly parts,
beginning 15 January 1908. Every issue sold out as soon as it hit
the news stands, despite the cover price of 4d which was expensive
at the time. In fact, Scouting for Boys ranks fourth in the
best-selling books of the 20th Century after the Bible, the Koran
and Mao's Little Red Book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every other Wednesday until the end of March, boys (and girls)
all over England eagerly awaited the next issue of Scouting for
Boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Australia hosted the successful 16th World Scout Jamboree and the
31st World Scout Conference in 1988. Some 15,000 Scouts from 94
countries attended the Jamboree at Cataract Scout Park near
Sydney.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 
&lt;br /&gt;
The conference held in Melbourne dealt with the theme of Scouting
as an education for life. Adapting to the general changes in
Australian society,&lt;br /&gt;
Scouting admitted girls and young women to its Venturer Scout and
Rover Sections in 1973 and its Cub Scout and Scout Sections in
1988. The Joey Scout Section commenced on 1 July 1990 and is open
to boys and girls aged between six and seven-and-a-half years of
age.&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is near 1st Woodend Scout group which was founded in
1927</groundspeak:long_description>

It is as far as possible away from our sterile world with their safety belts, guardrails, seat cushions and &quot;please wash your hands now&quot; signs. This is how it should be and this is why we love it. Geocaching was in the truest sense of the word inspired by the unforeseen and inhospitable. If the enemy is the unknown, a perfect performance is not a luxury but a necessity. With geocaching, mountaineering and other outdoor activities, you have to face real dangers. Just because your equipment can cope with everything, that does not mean you can too. Have great respect for the environment in which you find yourself. Be prepared for everything!  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;I hope you enjoyed the reading but seriously:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This cache is dangerous and can cause severe injuries or death! Thunderstorms, tidal changes and lack of skills are the greatest threats to your health and safety! DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Facility&lt;br/&gt;The Black Mesa Research Facility is a private research and defence contractor comprised of a massive complex built within Phillip Bay just off the coast of Melbourne. Built deep into the bottom of the ocean, Black Mesa is the site of broad scientific research relating to theoretical, quantum, and particle physics, applied mathematics, robotics, genetics, biotechnology, trans-dimensional travel, teleporting, and other classified subjects.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The submerged character of Black Mesa is due to the shielding nature of vast amount of water on top of it. Although it being close to a major metropolitan area, it is considered to be one of the safest facilities on this planet ... until three hours ago.&lt;br/&gt;	&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Incident&lt;br/&gt;Three hours ago the Black Mesa relay station in Point Cook lost all communication with the research facility. Only a small data burst was received prior to a massive electromagnetic surge. The data indicates that lambda-experiment resulted in a catastrophic failure of the containment field and therefore opened an uncontrolled trans-dimensional portal. Fortunately the fail-safe system did work and closed the portal after 350 ms with a 32.5 t RDX charge. Most of the blast energy was absorbed by the portal however a small portion did render the research facility inert.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We believe that this is the reason why the second fail-safe system didn't engage and secondary rift opened close to the Black Mesa facility. As of now we have no information where that rift is located. Our lambda satellite shows a reading but the glare from the first portal is still visible. The rift has to be within the purple zone. Our best guess at the moment is that the second fail-safe sensors did record the rift jump and launched a buoy with the exact coordinates.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Since this is a class three incident the SASR has been notified to take care of the situation. Although they have to fly in from Swanbourne, WA your window of opportunity is limited. You have to retrieve the coordinates, get to ground zero and close it with a hollow charge. Make absolutely sure the charge is pointing to the centre of the rift. Any misaiming would have catastrophic consequences since it would expand the rift instead of closing it. Previous similar incidents and the following involvement of military personnel suggest that this vital information is not know to every operator.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;We recommend that you get the job done before the SASR arrives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(The Hunt)&lt;br/&gt;Three easy steps and you are at the portal / cache. You'll only need this paragraph to find the cache.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    * Stage 1 - S37 53.783 E144 58.412&lt;br/&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;      At the given coordinates you'll find a buoy with a number at the top = A. Attached to one of the handles are two plaques with the coords for stage 2 and the final. (In case you can't find them / you don't want to get close to that buoy, write down the eight numbers at the bottom and calculate the coords: BCDEFGHI)&lt;br/&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;    * Stage 2 - S37 53.(C-1)(H)(E) E144 59.(G)(D-I)(B)&lt;br/&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;      If the number A is even enter portside (left) - if A is uneven enter starboard (right). If there are more than 2 doors / gates / hatches / ... use the very left or very right.&lt;br/&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;    * Stage 3 - Final - S37 53.(E+I)(G)(F-E) E144 59.(C)(D-I)(E)&lt;br/&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;      The cache-box is about 2m above your feet. Well done You found it!&lt;br/&gt;       &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be prepared&lt;br/&gt;For the latest weather report check the following websites:&lt;br/&gt;Melbourne Radar Loop&lt;br/&gt;Elwood SC Webcam&lt;br/&gt;Brighton Weather&lt;br/&gt;Point Ormond Tides (High Tide is bad)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Don't forget your PFD and the rest of your safety-gear.

Of course, road was quiet until we found cache and were trying to be surreptitious(!) *lol* Took nothing, but left green tricerotops, and signed log. Cache in good knick. Afternoon was still sunny at this point, paused for a 'family' photo, then we hit the road again. Cheers, vkc1sr!</groundspeak:text>

MAKE SURE YOU TAKE A COPY OF THE PICTURE FROM GALLERY, WILL HELP
WITH NAVIGATION!!! Welcome to the Inverleigh Flora &amp; Fauna
Reserve. Please take your time and enjoy the natural beauty of this
bush land. There is plenty of wildlife about if you stop, look and
listen.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a multi cache with no clues, hence the difficulty rating.
There are plenty of hiding spots and tree cover. You do not have to
venture off road in your car, the roads are all driveable in a 2wd
vehicle just take your time. You will have to walk no more than
about 10 metres off any track.&lt;br /&gt;
It may help you to remember track names as some of the clues may
help you navigate!!!&lt;br /&gt;
Onto the cache (This is the only lot of maths required,
promise)&lt;br /&gt;
In front of you and to your left there should be a sign:
&lt;p&gt;How many words on the sign = AB&lt;br /&gt;
How many letters in the first word = C&lt;br /&gt;
How many letters in the last word = D&lt;br /&gt;
How many letters in the second word = F&lt;br /&gt;
How many letters in the first word of the third line = G&lt;br /&gt;
Head to:&lt;br /&gt;
S 38° 05.ACF E 144° 02.F (A+D) G&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you will find a small container with your next set of
instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your final goal is to locate the ammo tin containing the usual
goodies.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Was really looking forward to this multi today. Unfortunately, while we located the first cache without problem, there were no contents, and so we couldn't go any further. Great concealment (we even took a photo for posterity), so we were disappointed our hunt was cut so short. Also, there were some dodgy people in the area, so didn't stick around to leave a note saying we'd passed by. Loved solving the code, and enjoyed our walk at any rate - we parked in Inverleigh, and walked up with our furry cacher. Just feel we have unfinished business with this one! </groundspeak:text>

Lovely to see some of the spring flowers coming out in the garden. Loved the bridge(!!), cool and springy... although His Furriness loved it slightly less coming back again! Nice and camouflaged cache. Took nothing, left nothing, signed log. Returned to spot as found, before heading to the Inverleigh Hotel for a well-earned beverage to quench our thirst. Great afternoon on the chase. Ninja Wasabi strikes again! :)
vkc1sr thanks so much, you do a great job! Cheers!!

Know it wasn't the first log, but this one was new, and we were on first! Sometimes it's the small things.... :)

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to Inverleigh Churches. This cache will give you history on
3 churches in Inverleigh.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;You are standing outside the Presbyterian Church. A wooden
building was erected for church services and schooling in 1855. On
31/1/1862 the current bluestone building was opened for worship by
the Rev. A. Campbell of Geelong. Following Scottish custom of
planting a fir tree near the front door of a new church, Mr J.
Venters of Murgheboluc had a fir tree sent from Scotland and it was
planted on the west side of the church in line with the front of
the building. On the 125th anniversary of the opening of the
church, Stewart Venters, great-great-grandson of J. Venters,
planted a cedar tree on the east side of the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look 30 metres to the east you will see St Paul’s
Anglican Church. The first Anglican Church was built near the
cemetery in 1854. In 1858 a combination church and school was built
of bluestone on the same site. In 1869 that building was demolished
and much of the stone was transported to the present site. Mr A.B.
Clark of Melbourne was the architect, Mr Stevens was the builder
and contractor for the stonework, while Messrs. Arthur &amp; Tom
Alderson and Jim Dale were the carpenters with Mr Fred Hawes as
apprentice. The foundation stone was laid by Mrs Moriarty who
contributed 1,200 pound to the project. A solemn dedication service
was performed by Bishop Field Flowers Gow on 2/2/1890.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third church is about 200 metres to the west (same side of
the street). It is the Sacred Heart Catholic Church. The first of
three Catholic churches was built near the original Anglican church
in the vicinity of the cemetery. It was burnt down in the late
1860s or early 1870s with children from the nearby Anglican Sunday
School being blamed. The present church was opened by Dr. Mannix on
the 19/11/1933. The cost of the building and furnishings was 1,050
pound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information from Inverleigh Progress Association and Inverleigh
Historical Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the cache, you are looking for a 35mm film canister with
a log only so bring a pen. You may have GPS trouble due to trees so
the hint is fairly descriptive to assist if required. Please
remember you are in a country town and there may be plenty of
muggle eyes watching you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache will be for premium members only for the first couple
of weeks, as will all new VKC1SR caches.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It was overcast, but not too cold, and we had a great time soaking up the small town feel. Had never visited here before. Found @ 15:45 hrs. Signed log and returned to hiding place. Testament to the fact that we often don't see things in (almost) plain sight in our day to day lives, and/or venture off the beaten track at all often. 
Thanks vkc1sr, this has been a great afternoon, due to your work. :)</groundspeak:text>

reserve.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome to Murgheboluc reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache has been placed in memory of 1SR's granddad, who used
to play cricket here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother and I never knew why he kept bowling us out when we
had a game with him, after all you should be able to hit granddad
for a 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he died, there was an article in the local paper where it
showed his bowling record. He took 5 wickets in 5 balls, a triple
hatrick. There were other figures which I will update when I can
find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the cache!! You are looking for a 1 litre sistema
container with log book, pen and some swaps. It should be quiet
here during winter but they still use the ground in summer for
cricket. Pick your day carefully in Summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the bird lovers there are wetlands behind the park and
numerous large trees in the reserve. While placing the cache, there
were birds everywhere. Take the time and have a stroll around the
reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Please rehide carefully to prevent
kid muggles finding&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I don't think we would have even known that this reserve existed - a hidden gem. Found @ 14:15 hrs, on a cool afternoon. Wind cold, but nice in the sun. Loved the bird life that lives in the trees here. Parrots very raucous and colourful. Cool little cache. Took nothing, but left a very scary shark and signed log (although we did get a day ahead of ourselves when dating it - doh!). Thanks to VKC1SR for another cool cache, and for grandad's!! :)
N.B Was a little concerned to see that someone had set a camp fire very near to the cache (cache was not harmed in anyway). Returned cache to where we found it, but did wonder how safe it was if people are going to keep lighting fires. Not sure if this affects anything? Just a thought! </groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Welcome to the Portarlington Flour Mill. The Mill is on the
National Trust of Australia (Victoria) Register with a State
Classification.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; First settlers in the Port Phillip District needed grain for the
staples of life, and found the Bellarine Peninsula suitable for
grain growing. The first flour mill was built at Drysdale, but the
difficulty of land transport made Portarlington's water access
attractive, and its handsome stone, steam flour mill, was built in
1857. It was a substantial sandstone building and equipment was
steam powered.
&lt;p&gt;The notice of the formation of the Portarlington Steam Flour
Mill Company (Capital £7,500, Chairman John Henderson) appeared in
the Geelong Advertiser 1st August 1856, the public being invited to
purchase shares. Andrew McWilliams, a Geelong municipal engineer,
designed the building, which was built by T.H Widdicombe, a local
identity, from stone quarried on site, and beams from a large stand
of blue gum at Swan Bay, now extinct. Within a year the completed
mill was open for business, and a short jetty built to facilitate
loading of the small traders which carried the flour to Melbourne
and to Tasmania. Later the jetty was extended into deep water and
the bay steamers were able to call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life of the building as a mill was only seventeen years, as
in the 1870's the wider Wimmera lands were opened for cultivation,
and in 1874 the mill was closed and the machinery used for milling
was sent to the Wimmera. Tom Widdicombe the builder was the next
occupant, using the mill as part of his brickworks. Later it had
other industrial uses - the processing of seaweed for upholstery
and insulation, ink production, and then artificial fertiliser. In
the twentieth century the growth of Portarlington as a seaside
resort brought conversion of the mill to residential use. In 1962
the owner Mrs. Dye, was served with a Housing Commission notice to
demolish the 105 year old building, condemned as unfit for
habitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In due course this came to the notice of the National Trust,
which conferred with the Shire of Bellarine with the aim of saving
the building. In 1970 the Shire purchased the building and gave it
to the National Trust, which spent over $40,000 restoring it,
opening it to the public in 1977. Since then it has been managed by
a committee of local volunteers, and fitted as a local folk museum.
Local residents have collected a number of artefacts and these are
displayed on the three floors of the mill. Archaeological digs
around the mill have given evidence of the old boiler house at the
rear, and also earlier aboriginal activity in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can tour the mill if it is open for a small fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache you are looking for is a magnetic nano and is outside
the locked gates so is available all the time. It is painted to
match its surrounds. Please be careful of muggles in the nearby
houses. The clue will help you out if it is busy, please only use
if really stuck. This will be a premium member cache for the first
few weeks. This is to thank those that help support the system by
having a membership.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Another cool cache from VKC1SR! Loved the camo coordination with this one Unfortunately, the mill wasn't open today, but we were so impressed that we'll definitely be back to check it out another day. Thanks for the tip, VKC1SR. Found @ 16:20hrs. Obviously a busy hide, as we were one of a few finders today according to the log, which we also signed. Luckily, all the muggles were over at the reserve watching the very full footy game, but we were still stealthy. Ninja Wasabi strikes again! *hehehe* Thanks again for another goodie, VKC1SR.</groundspeak:text>

Bit concerned about this cache.. we had 2 hand held Garmin GPS units that we have used all over the world.. and they were both pointing 50M over a fence line into a farmers paddock.
We jumped the fence and had a stroll around looking through the rock piles and no cache was to be found.

The fact that the GPS places us on private property after jumping a fence.. and the walk thru also takes us through private property.. we are a bit dubious about the validity of this cache.

The cache owner needs to go and check the co-ords with a decent GPS (not a mobile phone) and let it sit for a few minutes to settle. 

At least it didn't rain.

&lt;p&gt;This is a lovely stroll around the river that shouldn't take you
long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't know what a Sudoku puzzle is goto
&lt;b&gt;www.sudoku.com&lt;/b&gt; and have a look because you will need to know
on this trip. The difficulty rating is set reasonably high due to
the high muggle factor. Especially at weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SAFETY NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; This cache is along side a river and also
runs beside a very active golf course. Small children will need to
be supervised at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be at a wooden fence where you need to answer a
simple questions to get you on your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many wooden posts (upright)make up the fence? = AB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now head to S 38.08.((A+B)*A)(A*A)A*3 E 144.19.B(A*4) (A*A) Here
you are looking for a 200ml sistema with a puzzle for you to take
and solve on your walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please advise in log if the puzzle sheets are getting low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint Wp2 if required. This puzzle will also have your next
co-ordinates. Good Luck!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please read the instructions on how to access cache and close
it again carefully. They are on the bottom of the puzzle
sheet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look out for a dead tree on your walk there are lots of parrots
in it. This appears to be a nesting site so please respect that.
See photo.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a round clip lock container painted
black&lt;/p&gt;

We got within 200m of the first cache, but couldn't continue due to the Barwon having breached its banks, and flooded the path - and a lot more besides. We could've cut through the golf course, as a few muggles were doing, but my offsider - let's call her, &quot;Pickled Ginger&quot; - didn't fancy the (small) trespass, esp with our furry cacher in tow! Thought about approaching from further upstream, but weren't convinced that the flooding wouldn't have thwarted this attempt, too. Will leave this one for another day, at a time when there are fewer water tortures. Just hope the cache survives the floodwaters! Apart from the excess river, it was a lovely sunny day out, and lovely walking weather. </groundspeak:text>

      &lt;strong&gt;A
      nice simple cache you can pretty much drive up
      to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 The Windmill Reserve is named after the
Windmill family who were quarrymen and tanners who built their
house near a 19 acre quarry at this
location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Their house is actually located at 245 Noble
St, Newtown and is Heritage Listed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The quarry, originally known as James
Austin's quarry, was brought and worked by the Windmill Bros. who
established a stone crushing plant there, supplying metal and
screenings for many years.&lt;br /&gt;
 The Windmill Reserve created in recent times re-used the old
site which was used as the Newtown tip in the intervening
years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Have a seat and enjoy the views over
the river and down the
valley.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You are looking for a small
camouflaged cache with enough room for the log. BYO
Pen!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You can park your car right at the
cache and use the car as cover if you
want.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Be careful with children as there is a
cliff face in front of you and nil
fencing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 If you are lucky you may get to watch a game
of cricket or footy at the oval behind
you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy the views.&lt;/strong&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Very sneaky, but Ninja Wasabi strikes again - mainly due to Pickled Ginger's lateral thinking skills. Well played, vkc1sr! Really love the time and thought you put into these caches. Great views, although very windy up there today, and a tad grey. Aptly named cache! Thanks again!! :))</groundspeak:text>

Geelong in a relatively unknown lookout.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Located in a park which used to be an old homestead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a nice little lookout from which you can get
uninterrupted views of&lt;br /&gt;
Geelong and area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park on street down the hill from the cache and walk from
there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short stroll of about 100M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a 200ml Clip Top Sistema painted black&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have found the cache you might want to walk up the park
and have a look at&lt;br /&gt;
the foundation of the old homestead.&lt;/p&gt;

Thankyou &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=f22d1380-087d-4af6-a9e7-75223791ee9a&quot;&gt;
Bushfire&lt;/a&gt; for the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk to the top of the park to get even better views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good spot to take hairy cachers for run or frizbee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*** Bring a pen just in case the pencil inside is having a bad
day***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt; Please make sure that
you replace cache properly and&lt;br /&gt;
it is well hidden. Many a time I have had re-hide whilst out
there&lt;br /&gt;

Found cache easily, and returned to where we found it, but did wonder if we should have hidden it a bit more. Decided not to, as we weren't the 'owners'. Signed the log, and didn't take anything - mainly because we had to nothing to add. Must up our geocaching game, and remember next time! Only second ever geocaching expedition, so learning as we go. Enjoyed a walk with our furry companion up to the ridge and around. Thanks to vkc1sr for taking the time to get us up here to enjoy the views. Another great time out and about in Geelong! </groundspeak:text>

This was my 54th GC find and my very first FTF just before midnight so I returned today and found this cache in a different location but a better position as the previous hide was muggled. So I will claim another FTF as I have revisited and signed the log again not like the other cacher who cut and pasted their log from 17 Feb 2007, I think this is defeating the purpose of this new cache site.At least I know the identity of dessek which is a new username for a very successful GC cacher. I may be old fashioned but I believe you should have to find the cache again to claim a find. If it's a new cache multi listed then that is different story.Thanks again to the VKC1SR team for bringing the ageing Bushfire back to this wonderful location where some of my relations owned the original homestead before it was destroyed.</groundspeak:text>

A quick stroll to GZ and I soon had the cache in hand.

Well, we certainly got all three, the first two in spades [:O], and even had a screaming tail wind thrown in just to make things interesting [:O].  I had done most of this half of the trail after the fantastic [url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=c3044b69-41b0-444b-a329-07057262420c&amp;log=y&amp;decrypt=]Geelong event[/url] of a couple of years ago so for most of this part, I was just a traveller with my only &quot;partner-in-crime&quot;, LZZ(m) (if the weather had been only half-way decent, we might have had a dozen or more fellow riders but dem's da breaks [;)]).

This cache was first on [i]my[/i] list.  We spent quite a while trying to find it and the wind was making it impossible to even hear each other!  Finally, we decided to check the hint [:I] and had the stash in hand straight away at 11:20.  We quickly signed the log and scarpered before the massive gum tree decided to drop a limb or two on top of us [:O].

Maybe they were blown away, washed away or a combination of both but there were only 3 &quot;locals&quot; to meet us and the only place they were going was to a nice warm fire. That was incentive enough for LZZ(m) and me to bail as well but not before nabbing this one.

With the hail coming down and the temperature plummeting, we had to make it a quick one. Thankfully it was and we were soon logging the find at 11:40. We figured that the best place to write our logs was under shelter but, amazingly, that was about 3 metres east of the end of the actual roofline [:O] !!!!

TNLNSL, although a few geocoins in our possession had a visit to mark this momentous occasion. Thanks VKC1SR but to paraphrase Arnie, &quot;we'll be back&quot;  [;)].</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This replaces our old multi that did not get many visits. Hopefully people will make the short detour for a quick find and enjoy the location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the location: Swan Bay is a shallow, 30-square-kilometre (12 sq mi) marine embayment at the eastern end of the Bellarine Peninsula in Port Phillip, Victoria, Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The township of Queenscliff lies at its southern end, and St Leonards at its northern. It is partly separated from Port Phillip by Swan Island, Duck Island and Edwards Point. Most of the area is included in the Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park as well as being listed as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention as part of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar Site. Matthew Flinders named the bay &quot;Swan Ponds&quot; after its Black Swans, up to 2,700 of which can be seen in summer and early autumn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swan Bay contains a variety of ecosystems that make it environmentally important for waterbirds and migratory waders. These include salt marsh, intertidal mudflats and vast seagrass beds on which, almost everything living in the bay relies on for food. Although much of the surrounding land is farmland, some remnant woodland survives in the adjoining Edwards Point Nature Reserve and Swan Bay Itself. The bay has been recognised as having international importance and the Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park almost entirely occupies the bay. Nearly 200 species of birds have been recorded in Swan bay. Birds of conservation significance for which the bay and its shore are internationally important include the Critically Endangered Orange-bellied Parrot as well as Little Tern, Fairy Tern, Eastern Curlew, Lewin's Rail and White-bellied Sea-eagle. It also supports over 1% of the Australian population of four wader species: Grey Plover, Pacific Golden Plover, Double-banded Plover and Eastern Curlew.[2] Other birds found in the region include the Australian Pelican, Silver Gull, Royal Spoonbill, Caspian and Crested Terns, White-fronted Chat, Sacred Ibis, Red-necked Stint, Little Pied Cormorant and Pied Oystercatcher. Some of these birds travel from as far away as arctic Siberia and Alaska where they breed, to feed on the intertidal mudflats of Swan Bay.(info from Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above picture is of a very high tide blocking access to the pier, that eliminated that hiding spot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a 1.2 lt sistema conatiner. Please rehide so it is not visible. This will be a premium members cache for the first few weeks to thank them for helping keep the hunt running.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Waypoint 2 took a while with Geko pointing me to the wrong side but eventually I had the final co-ordinates keyed in after finding the sneaky hide.  By now, I was committed (or needed to be [;)]) so I headed off to find the cache.

That also took a while but after much persistence, I had the stash in hand at 15:30.

The cache looks like it has been found by muggles although it is still quite intact and the messages in the logbook just note that they found it.  Maybe however, I just didn't recognise their names.

TNLNSL.  Thanks for this great series VKC1SR.  ssmc4 (and us) are going to have some fun doing the whole thing in a day, especially with this one in the mix.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A Grand Tour of Winchelsea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Winchelsea is a pleasant small town of 1000 people which is located on the Barwon River 112 km south-west of Melbourne on the Princes Highway between Geelong and Colac. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Wathaurong tribe originally occupied the land from Ballarat to the Otways and 80km west of Lake Corangamite. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several historic homesteads in the area and a number of old bluestone buildings in town although they tend to be scattered about and hence do not form as strong a focal point as they might. The shire relies principally on pastoral and agricultural activities for its income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite its inland location, Winchelsea is named after one of the Cinque Ports on the south-east coast of England. The first Europeans to reside in the area were squatters who established grazing runs here c.1837. The town developed around the Barwon Hotel and a general store, both of which were established in 1842 on the coaching route between Geelong and Warrnambool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first church was built, with the help of the local grazier, Thomas Austin, in 1846.&lt;br/&gt;In the manner of the wealthy country squire, Austin loved shooting and, in 1859, he imported quails, pheasants, foxes and rabbits for that purpose. &lt;br/&gt;In this way he became responsible, in the eyes of many, for Australia's substantial rabbit problems.&lt;br/&gt;So profuse did they soon become that the Duke of Edinburgh's 1867 hunting party shot either 400 or 1000 rabbits in an afternoon, depending on which source you want to believe. Shooters were subsequently hired for the express purpose of eradicating the vermin and a rabbit-meat factory even operated for a time at Colac.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Austin was a noted and wealthy sheep-breeder, being the first to import Lincoln sheep. His wife, a great benefactor, founded the Austin Hospital in Melbourne.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Albert Jacka, the first Australian to win a Victoria Cross in World War I, and future mayor of St Kilda, was born at Winchelsea is 1893. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a four stage multi-cache – it requires you to arrive at the initial waypoint and then make your way around the beautiful town Winchelsea, learning about it’s history in order to arrive at ground zero. Ground Zero comes with a Muggle warning, especially in the warmer weather.  You can bring a picnic to enjoy at the final destination or just a short walk away you will find the tearooms, hotels and a bakery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOW ONTO THE CACHE!!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WP1:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At WP1 (S 38 14.074, E 144 00.792) you will find a sign to know you are in the right place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Welcome to ??&quot; Number of letters in town name = AB&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Sister town is in East ??&quot; Number of letters in suburb = C&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now apply your calculation to determine WP2&lt;br/&gt;where S 38 AB+3.CA3&lt;br/&gt;E 144 BB.(C-4)(C+3)A&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WP2:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At WP2 you will find a sign indicating that you are at a structure built in 1869 for Thomas and Elizabeth Austin. This was gifted by Sydney Batson in 1973 to the National Trust who currently maintain the property and open it to the public every Sunday and Wednesday from 11:00am to 4:00pm (just in case you would like to look inside, but there is a charge to enter the building).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will need to find two phone numbers listed on the board – the phone number on left should be attributed to ABCDEFGH and the phone number on the right is attributed to IJKLMNOP when reading the numbers from left to right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To find the WP3, complete the following calculations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AB = L x 2&lt;br/&gt;C = O&lt;br/&gt;DE = (C x 10) + (D + L) - O&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FG = (A x 10) + B + D&lt;br/&gt;H = (L + O) - J&lt;br/&gt;IJ = (M x 10) + (D + H)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now apply your calculations to determine WP3&lt;br/&gt;where S 38 AB.CDE, E 143 FG.HIJ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WP3:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The co-ordinates will take you to a famous construction in Winchelsea that was built as a memorial to local soldiers who died in WW1. This building was constructed using the “Knitlock” pre-caste concrete block system patented by famous architect, Walter Burley Griffin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take note of the year of construction and the cost before you proceed through the gates to see the construction from the front. &lt;br/&gt;Once in front of the construction count the number of steps on the RIGHT HAND SIDE that lead to the viewing deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You’re nearly there.&lt;br/&gt;To get to WP4 you will need to calculate the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Year of construction = JKLM&lt;br/&gt;Cost of construction = NOP&lt;br/&gt;Number of steps on the right hand side (Including the top step but not the concrete step) = QR &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AB = (N + O)	&lt;br/&gt;C = (M + Q)					&lt;br/&gt;DE = (M + N)	&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FG = (P x 10) + K&lt;br/&gt;H = M&lt;br/&gt;IJ =  (O x 10) + (K-R)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now apply your calculations to determine WP4&lt;br/&gt;where S 38 AB.CDE, E 143 FG.HIJ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WP4&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The above co-ordinates will take you to the best place to park your car in order to collect the final information to get you to ground zero and a 1.2L sistema container painted black that is full of goodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A short distance from where you park you will find the child’s equivalent to heaven. Here you will need to find the answers to these questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now apply them as follows to get the co-ordinates for Ground Zero:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AB = How many half holes on the end wall.&lt;br/&gt;C = Number of red fireman's poles&lt;br/&gt;D = Number of yellow telescopes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For your final task, apply your calculations to determine GZ&lt;br/&gt;where: &lt;br/&gt;S38. AB - 8.(A + D)(C - 1)(B x 3)&lt;br/&gt;E143.(AB x 2)+ 15.(D + 2)(D - 1)(B - C)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please make sure to hide the cache well as it is in an area visited by muggles regularly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a FTF prize.. but just remember who gave you the scratchie if you win!!!&lt;br/&gt;Additional Hidden Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FN1BMWM - GC1BMWM FINAL&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Final Location of Cache&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S11BMWM - GC1BMWM WP1&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;1st Waypoint&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S21BMWM - GC1BMWM WP2&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;2nd Waypoint&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: S31BMWM - GC1BMWM WP3&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;3rd Waypoint</groundspeak:long_description>

St Wilfrid's Anglican church, the consolidated Mount Duneed primary school (with almost 200 students from neighbouring districts), a small wooden meeting hall and the bus shelter are the only public buildings at Mount Duneed. Closer to Grovedale, the Geelong Airport, a caravan park and restaurant are on the west side of Surfcoast Highway. In recent years, larger farm properties have been subdivided into 10 and 20 acre lots. There are also some three and four acre blocks. The area is attracting a mix of young families and retirees. The highest hill in the region has views over the entire district, south towards the coast and north to Geelong. Mount Duneed is next to the Geelong Airport, less than 10 minutes drive from the Surfcoast and 15 minutes from Geelong.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;History&lt;br/&gt;Originally called Mount Disappointment, a disused hotel was moved from nearby Germantown to Mount Duneed to serve as a manse for the first Presbyterian church in the 1860s. Primarily a farming district, the people first gathered on holy days around the church and cemetery. Palmer's Beer Shop, serving Surfcoast travellers, opened on the highway nearby. A school was established in the Anglican church in 1862 and a building was finished in 1863. A small Presbyterian school opened soon after. In 1890, Mount Duneed was described as a postal hamlet and had two stores as well as a school and churches. A 1944 bushfire razed the early town buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hokay then.. onto the questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many uprights are there on the pergola? = AB&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many brown tables/chairs (picnic tables)? = C&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the South/East picnic table.. how many pieces of wood make up the table top? (not the seat)= D&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is located at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S 38.14.(ABx55)- 3&lt;br/&gt;E 144.19.(Cx14)+ (Dx84)+25&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gloves are recommended when searching for this cache.  You are looking for a 1.2 litre Sistema container with the usual goodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for the name of this cache: Think of the Caped Crusader (BatMan). Don't ask why.. as there is absolutely no relevance to bats and this cache. Just the strange way my (VKC's) mind works.

Easy find. Returned safely and camouflaged. Left geocoin.

Apparently there is a dolphin lurking near WP1 at the moment but I caught no sign of it while collecting the clues.  Darn.

TNLNSL.  Thanks again VKC1SR.</groundspeak:text>
