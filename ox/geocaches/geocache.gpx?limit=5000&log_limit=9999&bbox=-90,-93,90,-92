To find the cache, you first must find the
coordinates. Some of the info on this cache page will be helpful
and some will not. But the information you need to locate the cache
is on this page somewhere. The listed coordinates are for a
benchmark. Knowing that may or may not help you.

This can be a difficult cache. Wear clothing appropriate for mud and sand burrs. Watch for snakes. Before setting out on this one, remember that the level of Bull Shoals Lake can fluctuate during different seasons. Once you get to GZ, have a sharp eye for something that just doesn't look right.

The cache is a hidden bison tube. Bring a pencil, log only. Please replace the cache as you found it. Good luck!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Althea Spring is manged by the Missouri Department of
Conservation and this Earthcache has been placed by permission.
This area is mostly forest. Facilities/features here include:
picnic areas and 2 permanent streams (Althea Spring, North Fork of
the White River.) We have been down to this area on a number of
occassions to canoe and float the rivers. It is a beautiful area.
We hope you enjoy your visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Althea Spring, just up the hill from Patrick Bridge, is the 23rd
largest spring in Missouri. It was named for the daughter of Dr.
Paul Patrick, an early owner of land on the North Fork of the White
River. Patrick Bridge is a one-lane, low-water bridge that is on a
part of the river that is within the famous North Fork trout
fishing area. Below Bull Shoals, the White has tremendous trout
fishing along the scenic bluffs and inviting gravel bars for
picnicking or overnight camping. The trout section of the river
stretches a distance of about 90 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spring's flow is 18.80 CFS/second; an estimated 12 million
gallons per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Althea Spring is located in the Ozark Moutains. The region is
actually a high and deeply dissected plateau. The Ozarks consist of
four primary physiographic sections—the Springfield Plateau,
the Salem Plateau, the Saint Francois Mountains, and the Boston
Mountains. The topography is mostly gently rolling. Karst features
such as springs,losing streams, sinkholes, and caves are common in
the dolostone bedrock of the Salem Plateau. Althea spring is
located in the Salem Plateau region in Ozark County, Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spring is any natural occurrence where water flows on to the
surface of the earth from below the surface, and is thus where the
aquifer surface meets the ground surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spring may be the result of karst topography where surface
water has infiltrated the Earth's surface (recharge area), becoming
part of the area groundwater. The groundwater then travels though a
network of cracks and fissures - openings ranging from
intergranular spaces to large caves. The water eventually emerges
from below the surface, in the form of a spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forcing of the spring to the surface can be the result of a
confined aquifer in which the recharge area of the spring water
table rests at a higher elevation than that of the outlet. Spring
water forced to the surface by elevated sources are artesian wells.
This is possible even if the outlet is in the form of a 300-foot
deep cave. In this case the cave is used like a hose by the higher
elevated recharge area of groundwater to exit through the lower
elevation opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonartesian springs may simply flow from a higher elevation
through the earth to a lower elevation and exit in the form of a
spring, using the ground like a drainage pipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still other springs are the result of pressure from an
underground source in the earth, in the form of volcanic activity.
The result can be water at elevated temperature as a hot
spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action of the groundwater continually dissolves permeable
bedrock such as limestone and dolmite creating vast cave
systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types of spring outlets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seepage or filtration spring. The term seep refers to springs
with small flow rates in which the source water has filtered into
permeable earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fracture springs, discharge from faults, joints, or fissures in
the earth, in which springs have followed a natural course of voids
or weaknesses in the bedrock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tubular springs are essentially water dissolved and create
underground channels, basically cave systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logging requirements:Email the answers to these questions to
me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. What type of spring and outlet do you think Althea Spring
is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. At the posted coordinates you will find a sign, who owned the
land from 1958 to 1977?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Go to N 36 38.540 W 092 13.682 and take a picture of yourself
with the remains of the dam. Post this picture with your log.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In 1950 the original Monastery was built abt .2 mile to the west of the cache location, near the low water bridge is a trail that will lead you to where the old Monastery once stood I would not recommend taking children on that trail just due to the difficult climb that is involved. However the cache is kid friendly just still need to be careful as there are loose rocks which could cause slipping. The new Monastery which is named Assumption Abbey is located about 1.5 miles south of the cache location. You will also find near the cache a nice place to swim as well as fish.

A good deal of thanks goes to Assumption Abbey for the placement of this cache as well as the facilities near here.

You are looking for a camo'ed water tight box with pleanty of room for tradeables as well as trackables started off with a log book, pencil, and some trade items for the kids, good luck and enjoy this area but be respectful.
Washington is waiting for the FTF

!!Congrats to ScottyLove and BigHef32 on the FTF!!

I recommend taking the path that starts where the plaque is that reads The Road Not  Taken ( Robert Frost poem ).Take time to read the poem at co-ordinates 37 01.642, 092 37.322....Otherwise you might get your feet wet.  Amazing little creek with lots of little water falls. PLEASE re hide the cache as it is in a very open area. A few cacher's have been having some problems locating this cache. And to those who have wondered the water has not moved and when you find it you will see why. This area does pose some challenges when using your GPSr especially when the trees are full of leaves, and yes it is down along the creek bed. I did up the difficulty rating a bit due to the foliage.</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a standard cache, the posted coordinates are correct and
true and is in plain sight for anyone to see. The catch? It has a
padlock securing it. The hint to get the combination is: Standing
tall made of wood the &quot;number&quot; on top is what you seek. A bit of
information on Microwaves, Long before any study of microwaves
occurred, Scotsman John Napier, born in 1550, developed the theory
of logarithms, in order to eliminate the frustration of hand
calculations of division, multiplication, squares, etc. We use
logarithms every day in microwaves when we refer to the decibel.
His &quot;numbering rods&quot;, constructed of ivory, became known as
&quot;Napier's Bones&quot;, and comprised the world's first slide rule. Some
of his neighbors suggested that he was in league with the powers of
darkness... a trait that has often been associated with successful
microwave engineering! The Neper, a unitless quantity for dealing
with ratios, is named after John Napier.  999.222 The

This is a two tier hunt, each stage will be camoed by natural surroundings.  If you look close enough you will realize what's not supposed to be there, please be sure to place everything back as you found it so the next cacher has an opportunity to enjoy the hunt. Please be aware of the flora and fauna that Missouri is famous for.Stage 1 is very small so you will need tweezers to remove what is inside of the container. This cache is not wheelchair accessible but is an easy walk, the final is not on any marked trail so a little bushwhacking might be in order. When the trees are full of leaves the GPSr might give you some problems.
After finding stage 1 you will realize which direction to go to get to stage 2, I do have to mention if you go straight through to stage 2 the terrain could be rated at a 5+ for dense undergrowth, an easier way is to continue on the path 70 ft beyond the bench.
Did I mention stage 1 is VERY TINY?
One thing I would like to ask is that if you remove a trackable item please replace it with another one.

For some this will be an easy P&amp;G others it will not. Log only byop and be sure you place cache back where you found it.

Please be aware of what Missouri is famous for.

Well this is my first cache hide so for the veterans out there it will probably be easy. Anyway make sure you watch out for all the things Missouri is known for.
Beware of occasional muggles near here especially on hot days.

This is just another one of those that either you love or hate.  Within a mile of the cache location is the reason you were brought here. And the name of that is also Crossroads. No bushwacking required.

Smith Park.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Mrs. Smith Bushwhacks to Columbia&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first attempt to hide a cache. I noticed this little
park when dropping my kids off for school. The cache is a small
ammo can hidden in the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A land donation from Jeff Smith gave Columbia Parks &amp;
Recreation 50.29 acres in northeast Columbia. The site is located
immediately southwest of the intersection of Brown Station Road and
Waco Road. No plans for development have been decided at this
time.&quot; - www.gocolumbiamo.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated before this land is undeveloped and lacks any real
trails and the undergrowth is pretty thick (at the time this cache
was placed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park is open to use, and is open to bow hunt (with prior
reservation) from Sept. 15 to Jan 15. The parking area is right off
Brown Station Road, you may want to be careful if it's been wet as
it is mostly a grassy area in front of the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: This park is open to
hunting from SEPT 15 to JAN 15 so please take appropriate
precautions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Permission to place this cache has been granted by the
Columbia Parks and Recreation Department. Special thanks goes out
to Lida Gochenour of the Columbia Parks and Recreation department
for working with me to obtain the permit to place this
cache.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Geocaching&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This geocache is part of a series
placed within the Cannon River valley. Some of these caches were
meant to be accessed by boat (canoe, kayak, innertube, etc), some
by bicycle, and some by hiking. Look at the ratings and attributes
to determine which equipment you should be using.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache is located along the sandstone palisade on Byllesby
Lake. I highly advise against being in bare feet when snooping
around this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area is ripe for an earthcache or two but since I don't
know the best resource to find this kind of geological information,
you get the next best thing.. an old fashioned smiley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IF YOU SEEK THIS GEOCACHE, PLEASE BE
COGNIZANT OF MUGGLES, RIVER CURRENTS, AND WATER LEVELS. Rehide the
geocache in such a way to preserve it from all of these
risks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Visiting this time with caching heros, Trekkin n' birdin. It was fun chatting as we snowshoed out to the caves here. Couldn't believe how beautiful the landscape was. My camera wasn't working too well, but would have never captured the wonder anyways. It's worth the trip however/whenever you can get here.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found it, 2 of 13, cache 2602 and a FTF!

I noticed this cache a couple days ago as I was looking at the &quot;newest in MN&quot;. These are the kind of caches I love. Loaded up the canoe (almost forgot the paddle) and headed out early this morning. The lake was weather was terrific and the lake beautiful and calm. There only sound was a trio of chainsaw cleaning up the drift wood on the shore.

Made my way to GZ and began to wonder. I spent some time circling to no avail. It took me a few moments to get the &quot;Shrinky Dinks&quot; idea out of my mind. After considering the cache page abit I decided to look somewhere else. Poked my nose in a few places until I saw something worth investigating. WooHoo! Found it.

What a thrill for me. An early morning paddle, far from home, a geocache and a FTF. Not bad. I spent some time here, STL and dropping in a TB along with some &quot;Wear It' PFD stickers. Wanting to share my find with someone, I sent a photo and text to the cache owner. I really appreciate these kind of caches and the effort that goes into hidding them. Thanks again. Replaced it as I found it.

Thanks for the adventure,

Kurt</groundspeak:text>

of two stages. Proceed to the listed coordinates to locate ten
unique gemstones. Once you find the gemstones, arrange them in the
proper sequence in order to locate the final pot-o-gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is much easier to bring
yourself a pencil and sheet of paper than it is to try and rehide
the gemstones. But if you do happen to collect them, please note
exactly where you found them and put them back where they belong.
If you fail to properly stow the gemstones in their places, the
child catcher will be summoned to come take away your
young.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This geocache is part of a series
placed within the Cannon River valley. Some of these caches were
meant to be accessed by boat (canoe, kayak, innertube, etc), some
by bicycle, and some by hiking. Look at the ratings and attributes
to determine which equipment you should be using.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache is located near the Cannon Valley
Trail. From April 1st though November 1st, there is a $3/day
or $20/year pass required for adults biking or rollerblading on the
trail. If you cross country ski on this trail when snow is on the
ground, The Great Minnesota Ski Pass is required. Otherwise it's
free to be on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In order to protect the resources of the Cannon Valley Trail,
and to ensure its safe use, users are required to follow the Trail
ordinance:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;No pets allowed, including those in baskets and/or
trailers&lt;br/&gt;
No motorized vehicles, including snowmobiles&lt;br/&gt;
No horses&lt;br/&gt;
No alcoholic beverages&lt;br/&gt;
Fires only in designated areas&lt;br/&gt;
No hunting&lt;br/&gt;
No weapons (including bows) unless unloaded and cased&lt;br/&gt;
Do not disturb any plant, flower, wildlife or other natural or
cultural resource.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ordinance applies to all Trail lands, usually 50 feet each
side of the trail centerline. Other regulations may apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remember to practice Trail etiquette and share the
trail:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Watch for and obey all signs&lt;br/&gt;
Look both ways at road crossings&lt;br/&gt;
Be in control of your bicycle at all times&lt;br/&gt;
Watch for hazards on or near the trail&lt;br/&gt;
Use the right hand side of the trail&lt;br/&gt;
Announce your presence when passing&lt;br/&gt;
Wear a helmet&lt;/blockquote&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;Located in the upper end of
Miesville Ravine Park. This area really is undiscovered and has
some very cool features.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;This geological feature MUST be added to your list while in the
area. When I first discovered this spot, I could hear voices inside
my head that kept whispering &quot;plant cache, plant cache, plant
cache&quot;. So, out of obligation to whatever geocaching spirits have
possessed my brain, I stopped the vehicle and immediately found the
best hiding spot I could muster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are searching for a standard sized container and should find
it with a fair amount of work. I stuffed it with a few things I had
remaining in the back of the truck at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though there is little chance that someone will
accidentially stumble upon this cache, please place the cache and
its cover materials EXACTLY the way you found it or better. The
cache should not be exposed at all by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This geocache was NOT meant to be too easy so if you're a whiner
or have physical limitations, you might want to pass on making the
find.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

in logic, often associated with math or philosophy, iff is short hand for &quot;If and Only If&quot; a biconditional connective between statements.

From diveryan:

My oldest son's first cache hide! This one is located near a soccer field he used to play on. The cache is located just a few yards off a paved walking trail/sidewalk. Wild mint (Mentha sp. ~thanks beans72!) is present in the area, and you may notice the smell of it as you search.

I see a few log entries stating something about taking the &quot;long way&quot; and parking on residential property. Please keep in mind that if you drove here, you can park in the Mariner Mall lot and follow a paved sidewalk almost right to the cache.

This one is kid friendly ~there is a school with a playground nearby!.

The winter is getting pretty long so I thought I'd continue placing winter friendly caches to help make spring get here faster. It'll be a fun summer cache too, but it should make for a fun diversion from the winter blahs.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located near the Norton Park soccer field and the Superior hiking trail. The terrain is a bit steep at first and by the ravine, so you'll need to take your time getting to this one. The cache fits in its location perfectly so watch how you get it out so you can get it back in. We started it off with some swag and a dollar for FTF.</groundspeak:long_description>

The field has changed a lot and I was sad to see that the baseball field is all but gone. There is a trail through here with a tunnel and a great field to let the dog run in so take some time and pack a lunch for a relaxing break.

There is excellent satellite signal until you get close so let me know how close your reading is to mine. To start it out there are a couple of swag items and a log &amp; pencil.</groundspeak:long_description>

I grew up at the local racetracks and have spent the past 13 years racing here. There's also an R/C track on the hill, just past where the road turns. You can park at the public ice rink and walk in from there. The gate is usually open on the road. Bring your kids and skate at the rink after the hunt.

Another childhood hang-out for me. The area has grown in quite a bit over the past 30 years and the rock that used to be clearly visible from the train tracks is now a hidden fortress in the woods. We had a lot of fun playing on this rock and sitting on it while looking down on the city. There is an area to climb under and it was a lot smaller back then. We used to have to crawl in but now my daughter was able to climb in with no effort at all. The kids will especially enjoy this one. Have fun!

To start it out there several swag items, a log and a pencil.

Welcome to the Laura Howe Marsh.
Laura Howe was an avid bird watcher, naturalist and conservationist who wrote a column in the local newspaper for years promoting these activities. She was a driving force behind preserving this wetland area and it is so named in her honor.
The best wildlife habitats are found in marshes, such as this one, that have a mix of open water and emergent plantlife.
The marsh provides a spawning ground and nursery area for fish and amphibians, a winter refuge for deer and songbirds and a rich food source for beavers and hunters such as snakes (harmless) fox and birds of prey.
Please take the time to enjoy the trails and who knows what you may discover!
Congrats to Hunter 5614 for the FTF.

The cache is a small camo'd lock'n'lock container stocked with some collector curling pins from several clubs around Canada and the USA for trading as well as some of the usual swag. A wallet, $10 CTC gift card and some CTC money is the prize for the FTF. The cache is well hidden but in an obvious spot. Muggles could be a problem at times so be aware and enjoy the walk/hunt!!!

The area to the west has a great sliding hill for sleds in the winter and bike climbing in the summer. To the east are some swings, flag football field and an outdoor skating rink/skateboard area and change room. This area was repaired and repainted thanks to the generosity of Chris Pronger who was playing for the St. Louis Blues at the time. It has since been repainted again to reflect the Philadelphia Flyers colors. Chris, along with countless others have spent many hours playing shinny on this rink over the years.
You are looking for a small camo'd waterproof match container that has a log book and pencil in it. A dollar for the FTF is also included. Bring your own writing stick just in case and be alert for muggles. Enjoy the area where I grew up.
Congrats to Team Ffej for the FTF!!!</groundspeak:long_description>
