I marked the spot and thought it'd make a nice place for my first hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I dubbed this one We Crave Visitors because most of the headstones here are pretty old, and the area hasn't been well kept up. It'd be nice to see some of the plots cleaned up. Coordinates are based on 10 minutes of averaging, so they should be accurate, but please advise if you disagree.</groundspeak:long_description>

That said, this one needed a cache in its honor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: You do NOT have to open anything!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>[SPOILER INSIDE] Behind the library are a set of three air conditioning units. Facing the library, look at the last unit on the right. On its left side (the one next to the middle AC unit) is a fake access panel attached with a magnet. [WARNING - THE HINT GIVES IT AWAY!]</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I averaged my coordinates over 10 full minutes on a clear day (but under the canopy), so this is about as good as it gets.

In honor of my first ever cache, I give you Executive Center Part Deux!  This one's camo is not as good as its predecessor (it was very clever!) but you may have to poke around a little to find this one.  You are looking for a match case designed to fit in with its surroundings, so please bring your own writing utensil.  And please return the hide back to its original state to preserve this one for future cachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is parking very close by you can utilize - PLEASE don't park in the street as it can get very busy and people tend to drive way faster than they should through here for some reason.  And be careful with kids and pets (and yourself too!).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck and happy hunting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to goff-family on the FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Most of the year this is parking for a local church, but in October it always seems to become a Halloween store for a month or so.  Always seemed like an odd coupling to me, but to each his own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, this should be a fairly easy grab, but trees overhead and landscaping may make it a bit tougher.  Please be mindful not to damage the flora as you look.  You should be able to look fairly stealthily, but could be busy at certain times  Good luck and happy hunting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to the-snowlight on the speedy ftf and getting back the ftf coin I got from him a bit back in another cache.  I look forward to the opportunity to reclaim it:)</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I have been out looking for a location to hide my first cache, and this spot just jumped out at me while I was driving by the other day.  When you get to this cache location, you will be standing very close to the location of the old 17th green at War Memorial Golf Course.  While growing up, I played lots of golf here, many times hitting from right around this tree to try to get back to the green just to the west. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent changes to the golf course modified the layout, moving the 17th hole across Fair Park and making way for a a nice little park area with a grand entrance off of Markham in the spot where the old 17th hole stood.  This is nice landscaped spot, often visited by workers on lunch break looking to enjoy a nice sunny day.  However, when the Razorbacks are in town for a football game, this area is packed with Hog fans looking to root the team to victory!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is quite a bit of traffic on Fair Park adjacent to this area so be careful with kids and pets, as well as the prying eyes of drivers waiting on the lights to change.  Golf balls shouldn't be a concern, but part of the course is nearby so please respect the golfers while they play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a bison tube (slightly larger than the typical) with a log only, so please bring your own writing utensil.  &lt;br/&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;This is a city of Little Rock park, so do not look for this one after park closing (10pm). Please replace the camo as close to the original to keep this one away from the muggles!  Good luck and happy hunting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to RonWhite for winning the race to the FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">If you are a frequent visitor to Allsop park, you know this area well.  There is an awesome little creek bounding down the hillside with a bike bridge over it, and an amazing rock garden that I'm told is built and maintained a man who lives nearby.  You can tell he has spent lots of time creating this rock garden, so do not damage or disturb his ongoing creation.  You DO NOT have to move or disturb any part of the rock garden to retrieve this cache, so PLEASE respect this area of the park!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now for the cache.  You are looking for a camoflage match safe of the plastic variety.  The cache is plainly visible, but only from a certain perspective, so you will need to use your eyes much more than your hands to find this one.  The hint will drop the challenge of finding this one significantly, but not totally.  The area is tree covered (esp. in the summer) so GSP will get you close, but you will need your geo-senses to make the find.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you find the cache, please place back exactly as found to preserve the cache and the challenge.  And remember this is a Little Rock City Park, so it closes at 10pm.  Good luck and happy hunting!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations the thefab5willisclan on the super speedy FTF!  Thought this one might be tougher but my fellow cachers continue to amaze!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Althea Spring is manged by the Missouri Department of
Conservation and this Earthcache has been placed by permission.
This area is mostly forest. Facilities/features here include:
picnic areas and 2 permanent streams (Althea Spring, North Fork of
the White River.) We have been down to this area on a number of
occassions to canoe and float the rivers. It is a beautiful area.
We hope you enjoy your visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Althea Spring, just up the hill from Patrick Bridge, is the 23rd
largest spring in Missouri. It was named for the daughter of Dr.
Paul Patrick, an early owner of land on the North Fork of the White
River. Patrick Bridge is a one-lane, low-water bridge that is on a
part of the river that is within the famous North Fork trout
fishing area. Below Bull Shoals, the White has tremendous trout
fishing along the scenic bluffs and inviting gravel bars for
picnicking or overnight camping. The trout section of the river
stretches a distance of about 90 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spring's flow is 18.80 CFS/second; an estimated 12 million
gallons per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Althea Spring is located in the Ozark Moutains. The region is
actually a high and deeply dissected plateau. The Ozarks consist of
four primary physiographic sections—the Springfield Plateau,
the Salem Plateau, the Saint Francois Mountains, and the Boston
Mountains. The topography is mostly gently rolling. Karst features
such as springs,losing streams, sinkholes, and caves are common in
the dolostone bedrock of the Salem Plateau. Althea spring is
located in the Salem Plateau region in Ozark County, Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spring is any natural occurrence where water flows on to the
surface of the earth from below the surface, and is thus where the
aquifer surface meets the ground surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spring may be the result of karst topography where surface
water has infiltrated the Earth's surface (recharge area), becoming
part of the area groundwater. The groundwater then travels though a
network of cracks and fissures - openings ranging from
intergranular spaces to large caves. The water eventually emerges
from below the surface, in the form of a spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forcing of the spring to the surface can be the result of a
confined aquifer in which the recharge area of the spring water
table rests at a higher elevation than that of the outlet. Spring
water forced to the surface by elevated sources are artesian wells.
This is possible even if the outlet is in the form of a 300-foot
deep cave. In this case the cave is used like a hose by the higher
elevated recharge area of groundwater to exit through the lower
elevation opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonartesian springs may simply flow from a higher elevation
through the earth to a lower elevation and exit in the form of a
spring, using the ground like a drainage pipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still other springs are the result of pressure from an
underground source in the earth, in the form of volcanic activity.
The result can be water at elevated temperature as a hot
spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action of the groundwater continually dissolves permeable
bedrock such as limestone and dolmite creating vast cave
systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Types of spring outlets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seepage or filtration spring. The term seep refers to springs
with small flow rates in which the source water has filtered into
permeable earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fracture springs, discharge from faults, joints, or fissures in
the earth, in which springs have followed a natural course of voids
or weaknesses in the bedrock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tubular springs are essentially water dissolved and create
underground channels, basically cave systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logging requirements:Email the answers to these questions to
me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. What type of spring and outlet do you think Althea Spring
is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. At the posted coordinates you will find a sign, who owned the
land from 1958 to 1977?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Go to N 36 38.540 W 092 13.682 and take a picture of yourself
with the remains of the dam. Post this picture with your log.&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In 1950 the original Monastery was built abt .2 mile to the west of the cache location, near the low water bridge is a trail that will lead you to where the old Monastery once stood I would not recommend taking children on that trail just due to the difficult climb that is involved. However the cache is kid friendly just still need to be careful as there are loose rocks which could cause slipping. The new Monastery which is named Assumption Abbey is located about 1.5 miles south of the cache location. You will also find near the cache a nice place to swim as well as fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A good deal of thanks goes to Assumption Abbey for the placement of this cache as well as the facilities near here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a camo'ed water tight box with pleanty of room for tradeables as well as trackables started off with a log book, pencil, and some trade items for the kids, good luck and enjoy this area but be respectful.&lt;br/&gt;Washington is waiting for the FTF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;!!Congrats to ScottyLove and BigHef32 on the FTF!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;MR2QWCF - Monastery Road&lt;br/&gt;N 36° 50.492 W 092° 28.182&lt;br/&gt;Entrance to the new Abbey</groundspeak:long_description>

Small lock n lock container with a white lid...Happy Caching.  Don't get your feet wet. And definitely bring your Geo-senses with you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I recommend taking the path that starts where the plaque is that reads The Road Not  Taken ( Robert Frost poem ).Take time to read the poem at co-ordinates 37 01.642, 092 37.322....Otherwise you might get your feet wet.  Amazing little creek with lots of little water falls. PLEASE re hide the cache as it is in a very open area. A few cacher's have been having some problems locating this cache. And to those who have wondered the water has not moved and when you find it you will see why. This area does pose some challenges when using your GPSr especially when the trees are full of leaves, and yes it is down along the creek bed. I did up the difficulty rating a bit due to the foliage.</groundspeak:long_description>

S0L and I had to finish the Cedar Gap, and it was fun out caching with a newbie to the sport. This wasnt the first time i have been here, i been here a couple of times when i have traveled to nashville, but it was never any luck since i was searching at night, and with my iPhone. But today was a different story. This was a clever hide and the newbie found the cache before S0L and I could get to thinking where it could be. This had a nice hidey hole for the container to rest. Glad to finally have a smilie here! tftc</groundspeak:text>

S0L and I had to finish the Cedar Gap, and it was fun out caching with a newbie to the sport. Well S0L had found this cache before and was nice enough to let the S0LBR0 and I grab this. I was so glad that when i went to Nashville over Spring Break that i had highway 60 all cleaned up and not even two hours of getting home this popped up. I even thought about going for the FTF just to get it off my map and 60 would be clean again, but i also knew that i would be out here again so i had to make it worth my while. This was a good and clever hiding spot, able to make the grab pretty quickly. tftc</groundspeak:text>

Some&lt;br/&gt;of his neighbors suggested that he was in league with the powers of&lt;br/&gt;darkness... a trait that has often been associated with successful&lt;br/&gt;microwave engineering!

Heading on the way back to springfield, decided to stop and find this one. This was the second lookout tower i was at today, except i wasnt going to climb this one. first one was big enough! We searched for a while at groundzero and nothing. ChelC90 kepted looking i did some CITO and found a benchmark. then came back and nothing, but after a little moving of the stump, we found the cache by luck. It had fallen out and the camo job helped it blend in. we signed the log and put the cache back were we thought it was supposed to be according to the hint. tfrc</groundspeak:text>

S0L and I had to finish the Cedar Gap, and it was fun out caching with a newbie to the sport. We had a great time talking and making jokes on the way up to the cache from the highway about road kill and how you dont see to many cheetahs as road kill. Got to groundzero and had to find our way into the acess point. I dont think i would say this cache is a 1.5 terrain, i would bump it up to at least a 2 maybe 2.5 since everyone in the party about fell when they slipped going up the hill. We were glad to find something other than a mirco in these neck of the woods and one of the main reasons we got of the highway to come up here. Thanks for also brining us to the interesting place just up the road. Thanks for taking the time to place the cache and make a cache that is a larger than most caches. tftc</groundspeak:text>

You might have some challenges with your gps signal due to the remote nature of this cache. It is not a hard one to find but in a couple of spots you loose your signal. Location was confirmed with a Garmin Oregon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On this 104 degree day I saw it fittin' (yes yer are in the hills) to place my Winter in July cache container. You are looking about 3-5 feet away from parking location. Hope you have fun finding this cache. We placed this because I couldn't find any caches in the area, with the hopes more will follow. This might also give you time to take a break and get a quick drink or fill up. Permission has been granted by property owner. </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">There were so many options for caching today.  So many places one could choose to go.  There were also multiple events to potentially go to.  Impossible to be in two places at once, though.  In the end after all considerations, I came down to BikeDH’s Breakfast at the Café 3.  It was a great event and I got to visit with multiple area cachers.  Several that I had not seen for many months.  It was a good time and the food at this venue was outstanding.  That omelet was giant and it was so good.  Great choice for location.

After the event it was time to get in a few caches.  Unfortunately, aside from a couple left in Sedalia last year and the several released this morning, that meant heading out of town for most of the day.  Fortunately, I had the company of so great cachers to escort me around as we went from adventure to adventure.  

Thanks for placing and maintaining this cache.  It contributed to a wonderfully memorable day of caching.</groundspeak:text>

Smith Park.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Mrs. Smith Bushwhacks to Columbia&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first attempt to hide a cache. I noticed this little
park when dropping my kids off for school. The cache is a small
ammo can hidden in the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A land donation from Jeff Smith gave Columbia Parks &amp;
Recreation 50.29 acres in northeast Columbia. The site is located
immediately southwest of the intersection of Brown Station Road and
Waco Road. No plans for development have been decided at this
time.&quot; - www.gocolumbiamo.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated before this land is undeveloped and lacks any real
trails and the undergrowth is pretty thick (at the time this cache
was placed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park is open to use, and is open to bow hunt (with prior
reservation) from Sept. 15 to Jan 15. The parking area is right off
Brown Station Road, you may want to be careful if it's been wet as
it is mostly a grassy area in front of the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: This park is open to
hunting from SEPT 15 to JAN 15 so please take appropriate
precautions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Permission to place this cache has been granted by the
Columbia Parks and Recreation Department. Special thanks goes out
to Lida Gochenour of the Columbia Parks and Recreation department
for working with me to obtain the permit to place this
cache.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

Yet another Sheldenn cache.  One wonders if the email notification chime will ever stop going off.</groundspeak:text>

I set out this morning from Kansas City with louinliberty and debrajean for another road trip to Iowa.  This was one of many we found today on our road trip for another fun caching weekend.  Thanks for the cache and the fun! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

Yet another Sheldenn cache.  One wonders if the email notification chime will ever stop going off.</groundspeak:text>

I set out this morning from Kansas City with louinliberty and debrajean for another road trip to Iowa.  This was one of many we found today on our road trip for another fun caching weekend.  Thanks for the cache and the fun! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

Thanks for another one, Sheldenn.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">11/10/2012 11:22:00 AM - mr_ewok and I were excited to come back to Honey Creek and &quot;Finish What We Started&quot;. Our mini ewoks were excited to spend their time in the water park. We had our muggle friend come with his children to partake in the activities and keep an eye on the kiddos since they didn't want to geocache with us.

We were supposed to leave in the afternoon to come here for the Friday afternoon/night events but mr_ewok's office got busy and he didn't get home until normal quitting time. Got on the road and things were sketchy in the dark...deer on the sides of the road, dodging dead deer on the road, a complete standstill on the road due to a helicopter medivac for a motorcycle accident, etc...

Part of our goal was to get more counties since we are out here and we went after the southeast counties in Iowa. Got all the counties we went after and DeLorme pages too.

Finally, we get to the resort to join in the festivities. For the Splish Splash event, we came after dinner at 9 p.m. and the waterpark was pretty empty. We walked all around and went upstairs looking for the sign in and other cachers. In the end mr_ewok and I played by ourselves on the lazy river and sliding down the slide. I figured most cachers would've been there during the adult swim but I guess they left to get ready for the Uno games.

We had fun caching to and from the events! Thank you to everyone who placed caches out there for us to indulge in!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

Yet another Sheldenn cache.  One wonders if the email notification chime will ever stop going off.</groundspeak:text>

The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.

You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.

Our mini ewoks were excited to spend their time in the water park. We had our muggle friend come with his children to partake in the activities and keep an eye on the kiddos since they didn't want to geocache with us.

We were supposed to leave in the afternoon to come here for the Friday afternoon/night events but mr_ewok's office got busy and he didn't get home until normal quitting time. Got on the road and things were sketchy in the dark...deer on the sides of the road, dodging dead deer on the road, a complete standstill on the road due to a helicopter medivac for a motorcycle accident, etc...

Part of our goal was to get more counties since we are out here and we went after the southeast counties in Iowa. Got all the counties we went after and DeLorme pages too.

Finally, we get to the resort to join in the festivities. For the Splish Splash event, we came after dinner at 9 p.m. and the waterpark was pretty empty. We walked all around and went upstairs looking for the sign in and other cachers. In the end mr_ewok and I played by ourselves on the lazy river and sliding down the slide. I figured most cachers would've been there during the adult swim but I guess they left to get ready for the Uno games.

We had fun caching to and from the events! Thank you to everyone who placed caches out there for us to indulge in!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

Yet another Sheldenn cache.  One wonders if the email notification chime will ever stop going off.</groundspeak:text>

We planned on picking up counties and Delrome squares on the way to help out with challenges. We worked our way out of Iowa on the ARLTM series. It started rainging which made the series enjoyable for me, but not so much for ChelC90. Thanks for all your efforts in placing them and adding to the fun of MOGA! tftc</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

Thanks for another one, Sheldenn.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Poison Ivy&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is a popular song by American songwriting duo Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. It was originally recorded by The Coasters in 1959. It went to #1 on the R&amp;B chart and #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. This was their third top-ten hit of that year following &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; and &quot;Along Came Jones&quot;. The song discusses a girl named Ivy, calling her &quot;Poison Ivy&quot; because of her reputation with men as a player. The song makes references to other flowers such as a rose and a daisy, and diseases like measles, mumps, chickenpox, the common cold, and whooping cough. In a recently published biography about Jerry Lieber &amp; Mike Stoller, the song's authors, it was revealed that the song's lyrics are about sexually-transmitted disease, not the illnesses previously thought.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Love Potion No. 9&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is a song written in 1959 by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. It was originally performed by The Clovers, who took it to no. 23 on the US charts that year. It is in chromatic-minor. The song describes a man seeking help finding love, so he talks to a Gypsy, who determines through palm reading that he needs &quot;love potion number 9&quot;. The potion causes him to fall in love with everything he sees, kissing whatever is in front of him, eventually kissing a cop on the corner, who breaks his bottle of love potion.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Jerry Lee Lewis (born Sept. 29, 1935) is an American rock &amp; roll and country music singer-songwriter and pianist. He is known by the nickname 'The Killer'. An early pioneer of rock &amp; roll music, Lewis had hits in the late 1950s with songs such as &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;, &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On&quot;, and &quot;Breathless&quot;. Lewis's career soon faltered after he married his young cousin. He didn't have much success in the charts following the scandal until his popularity recovered in the late '60s.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Lucille&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is a 1957 rock and roll song which was one of Little Richard's international hits. Released on Specialty Records in February 1957, Little Richard's single made number 21 on the US pop chart, and number 10 on the UK chart. It was composed by Albert Collins and Little Richard. As a rock standard, it has been covered live and/or recorded by thousands of artists including AC/DC, Status Quo, Wings, The Beatles, Mud, The Hollies, The Animals, Paul McCartney, Van Halen, Johnny Winter, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Peter &amp; Gordon, Queen, Deep Purple, the Ian Gillan Band, The Everly Brothers, Waylon Jennings, Kenny Rogers, Bill Haley &amp; His Comets, Otis Redding, The Sonics, John Entwistle of The Who, and the Detroit band The Rockets. It was also covered by Status Quo as part of their Anniversary Waltz, Pt. 1. John Lennon and Paul McCartney sang the song together during a jam session in 1974, which can be heard on the bootleg A Toot &amp; A Snore in '74, marking the only known occasion where the former songwriting team performed together after the bitter break up of the Beatles.&lt;br /&gt;

The Cadillac Series 62 Coupe de Ville was introduced late in the 1949 model year. It was luxuriously trimmed, with leather upholstery and chrome 'bows' in the headliner to simulate the ribs of a convertible top. In 1956 the Series 62 Coupe de Ville was joined by the Series 62 Sedan de Ville, Cadillac's first standard production 4-door hardtop.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Splish Splash&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is a 1958 song performed and co-written by Bobby Darin. It was written with DJ Murray the K (Murray Kaufman), who bet that Darin couldn't write a song that began with the words, &quot;Splish Splash, I was takin' a bath&quot;, as suggested by Murray's mother, Jean Kaufman. The song was credited to Darin and &quot;Jean Murray&quot; (a combination of their names) to avoid any hint of payola. The song helped to give Darin a major boost in his career, reaching No. 3 on the U.S. pop singles charts. It was recorded in a session at New York's Atlantic Studios on the evening of April 10, 1958.&lt;br /&gt;

In the end, I was able to spring free to accomplish this goal.  I’m so happy I was able to make that happen.  It was really a great time overall.  Not perfect, but how often can everything be perfect, even in a great resort over a wonderful weekend.  I really appreciate all the hard work put into these events and these caches from those near Honey Creek to those I picked up many miles away while looking for sustenance away from the resort.  I am looking forward to the next time I get this direction and can enjoy the company of so many great friends.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Jimmy Forrest (January 24, 1920 – August 26, 1980) was an African American jazz musician, who played tenor saxophone throughout his career. Forrest is famous for his first solo recording of &quot;Night Train&quot;. It reached #1 on the Billboard R&amp;B chart in March 1952, and stayed at the top for seven weeks. &quot;Hey Mrs. Jones&quot; (#3 R&amp;B) and &quot;Bolo Blues&quot; were his other major hits. All were made for United Records, which recorded Forrest between 1951 and 1953.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You Bet Your Life is an American quiz show that aired on both radio and television. The original and best-known version was hosted by Groucho Marx of the Marx Brothers, with announcer and assistant George Fenneman. The show debuted on ABC Radio in October 1947, then moved to CBS Radio in September 1949 before making the transition to NBC-TV in October 1950. Because of its simple format, it was possible to broadcast the show simultaneously on the radio and on television.

In the end, I was able to spring free to accomplish this goal.  I’m so happy I was able to make that happen.  It was really a great time overall.  Not perfect, but how often can everything be perfect, even in a great resort over a wonderful weekend.  I really appreciate all the hard work put into these events and these caches from those near Honey Creek to those I picked up many miles away while looking for sustenance away from the resort.  I am looking forward to the next time I get this direction and can enjoy the company of so many great friends.</groundspeak:text>

Known as &quot;Mr. Personality&quot;, after the name of one of his biggest million-selling hits. His first recording, &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot; was a huge hit on Specialty Records in 1952, and although he continued to turn out records, none were as popular until several years later, when he refined the New Orleans beat and achieved a series of national hits. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Peggy Sue&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is a rock and roll song written by Buddy Holly, Jerry Allison, and Norman Petty, and originally performed, recorded and released as a single by Buddy Holly in early July of 1957. The Crickets are not mentioned on the single (Coral 9-61885) but both Joe B. Mauldin (string bass) and Jerry Allison (drums) are known to be featured on the recording. The song was also released on Buddy Holly's self-titled 1958 album. The song is ranked #194 on the Rolling Stone magazine's 2004 list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song was originally called &quot;Cindy Lou&quot;, and was named for Buddy's niece, the daughter of his sister Pat Holley Kaiter. The title was later changed to &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; in reference to Crickets drummer Jerry Allison's girlfriend (and future wife), Peggy Sue Gerron, with whom he had recently had a temporary breakup. Appropriately, Allison played a prominent role in the production of the song, playing paradiddles on the drums throughout the song, the drums' sound rhythmically fading in and out as a result of real-time engineering techniques by the producer, Norm Petty. Many music critics regard this as Holly's all-time best recording. The song went to #3 on the Billboard Top 100 chart in 1957. The song is currently ranked as the 100th greatest song of all time, as well as the third best song of 1957, by Acclaimed Music. Initially only Allison and Petty were listed as the song's authors. At Allison's insistence, Holly was credited as a co-writer after his death.&lt;br /&gt;

It was available in three series models: the upscale Bel Air, the mid-range &quot;two-ten&quot;, and the &quot;one-fifty&quot;. A two-door station wagon, the Nomad was produced as a Bel Air model. The 1957 Bel Air is among the most recognizable American cars of all time, especially Sport Coupes and Convertibles are highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts.

In the end, I was able to spring free to accomplish this goal.  I’m so happy I was able to make that happen.  It was really a great time overall.  Not perfect, but how often can everything be perfect, even in a great resort over a wonderful weekend.  I really appreciate all the hard work put into these events and these caches from those near Honey Creek to those I picked up many miles away while looking for sustenance away from the resort.  I am looking forward to the next time I get this direction and can enjoy the company of so many great friends.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is a 12-bar-blues-based song written by Max C. Freedman and James E. Myers (the latter under the pseudonym &quot;Jimmy De Knight&quot;) in 1952. The best-known and most successful rendition was recorded by Bill Haley and His Comets in 1954. It was a No1 single in both the US and UK charts and also re-entered the UK Charts in the 1960's and 1970's. Haley's recording nevertheless became an anthem for rebellious Fifties youth and is widely considered to be the song that, more than any other, brought rock and roll into mainstream culture around the world. The song is ranked No. 158 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;La Bamba&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is a Mexican folk song, originally from the state of Veracruz, best known from a 1958 adaptation by Ritchie Valens, a top 40 hit in the U.S. charts and one of early rock and roll's best-known songs. Valens' version of &quot;La Bamba&quot; is ranked number 345 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, and is the only song on the list not sung in English. &quot;La Bamba&quot; has been covered by numerous artists, most notably by Los Lobos, whose version was the title track of the 1987 film La Bamba and reached #1 in the U.S. and UK singles charts in the same year. The music video for Los Lobos' version, directed by Sherman Halsey, won the 1988 MTV Video Music Award for Best Video from a Film.&lt;br /&gt;

The Belvedere replaced the Cranbrook as the top-line offering for 1954. Now, a separate model instead of just a two-door hardtop coupe, a buyer could choose a convertible, two-door station wagon, four-door sedan or the aforementioned two-door hardtop, now called the Sport Coupe. For the first time, small chrome tailfins appeared on the rear fenders &amp; a fully automatic transmission was offered.

Chieftains were one of the first all new car designs to come to Pontiac in the post World War II years. The Chieftain was initially introduced with four models: Sedan, Sedan Coupe, Business Coupe and Deluxe Convertible Coupe. In 1950, a Catalina Coupe was added to the range. The 1953 models were the first to have 1-piece windshields instead of the normal 2-piece units.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Edsel was an automobile manufactured by the Ford Motor Company during the 1958, 1959, and 1960 model years. The Edsel never gained popularity with contemporary American car buyers and sold poorly. Consequently, the Ford Motor Company lost millions of dollars on the Edsel's development, manufacture, and marketing. The name &quot;Edsel&quot; has since become synonymous with failure.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;The Fat Man&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is a rhythm and blues song co-written by Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew and recorded by Fats Domino. It is considered to be one of the first rock and roll records. The song was recorded for Imperial Records in Cosimo Matassa's J&amp;M studio on Rampart Street in New Orleans, Louisiana on Saturday, December 10, 1949. Imperial's Lew Chudd had previously asked Dave Bartholomew to show him some locally popular talent, and was most impressed with Fats Domino, then playing at a working class dive in the 9th Ward of New Orleans. Domino sang and played piano, along with Earl Palmer on drums, Frank Fields on string bass, Ernest McLean on guitar, and sax players Herbert Hardesty, Clarence Hall, Joe Harris, and Alvin &quot;Red&quot; Tyler. The tune is a variation on the traditional New Orleans tune &quot;Junker's Blues&quot;, as written by Drive'em Down, which also provided the melody for Lloyd Price's &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy,&quot; and Professor Longhair's &quot;Tipitina.&quot; &quot;The Fat Man&quot; features Domino's piano with a distinct back beat that dominates both the lead and the rhythm section. Earl Palmer said it was the first time a drummer played nothing but back beat for recording, which he said he derived from a Dixieland &quot;out chorus.&quot; Domino also scats a pair of choruses in a distinctive wah-wah falsetto, creating a variation on the lead similar to a muted Dixieland trumpet.&lt;br /&gt;

The automobile was specifically designed for women, an attempt to gain a foothold in the women's automobile market. For 1956, the La Femme was available in a Misty Orchid and Regal Orchid color scheme. The seat coverings were made of a heavy white cloth with random, organic-seeming patterns of short lavender and purple loops, in a manner similar to loop-pile carpeting.

Many sources erroneously give his second name as Edgar. He is best known for his popular music chart successes with songs such as, &quot;All Around the World&quot; (1955), &quot;Need Your Love So Bad&quot; (1956) and &quot;Fever&quot; the same year, the latter covered in 1958 by Peggy Lee.

It premiered on NBC in 1935 and continued until its demise in 1959, long after radio had ceased to be the dominant form of entertainment in American popular culture. The stars of the program were real-life husband James &quot;Jim&quot; Jordan (16 November 1896–1 April 1988) and his wife Marian Driscoll (15 April 1898–7 April 1961), who were natives of Peoria, Illinois.

I really appreciate all the hard work put into these events and these caches from those near Honey Creek to those I picked up many miles away while looking for sustenance away from the resort.  I am looking forward to the next time I get this direction and can enjoy the company of so many great friends.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Eldorado model was part of the Cadillac line from 1953 to 2002. The Cadillac Eldorado was the longest running American personal luxury car as it was the only one sold after the 1999 model year. For 1955, the Eldorado's body gained its own rear end styling with high, slender, pointed tailfins. These contrasted with the rather thick, bulbous fins which were common at the time and were an example of Eldorado once again pointing the way forward.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;The Things That I Used to Do&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is a blues song written by Guitar Slim (aka Eddie Jones) and his 1953 recording of it in New Orleans, was arranged and produced by a young Ray Charles. It was released on Specialty Records in 1954 to become a bestseller. It was one of the biggest hits in the label's history and stayed on the rhythm and blues charts for 42 weeks. Since Guitar Slim was a blues artist, Specially Record's Art Rupe figured that his appeal would be limited to the Southern rural audience. However, urban R&amp;B stations in the North picked up the song, pushing it into a national hit. As a result, Guitar Slim became in great demand as a performer and played on the stage of the Apollo Theater.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Teardrops from My Eyes&quot;&lt;/b&gt;, written by Rudy Toombs, was the first upbeat major hit for Ruth Brown, establishing her as an important figure in rhythm and blues. Recorded for Atlantic Records in New York City in September 1950, and released in October, it was on BillBoard's List of number-one R&amp;B hits for eleven non-consecutive weeks. It was Atlantic's first release on the new 45-rpm record format. The huge hit earned her the nickname &quot;Miss Rhythm&quot; and within a few months Ruth Brown became the acknowledged queen of R&amp;B. &quot;Teardrops from My Eyes&quot; was her first of five number one R&amp;B hits. Before this hit single, Ruth Brown was thought of strictly as a torch singer. When Ruby Toombs showed her the song she was initially reluctant to do it as it was so rhymatically different from the popular standards and ballads she was comfortable singing. The change of tempo, the backbeat of four/four, at first led her to dig in her heels. But Ahmet Ertegün, sensing the time was right, urged her to give the song a try and so she went along with his choice of tunes for her. The song featured a tenor solo by Budd Johnson. Atlantic used a process that it would repeat over the years, that is, turning an uptown singer funky. As with Ruth Brown, Ahmet Ertegün's method was to introduce popular black musical artists to older and more powerful black musical modes.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I Love Lucy is an American television sitcom starring Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance, and William Frawley. The black-and-white series originally ran from October 15, 1951, to May 6, 1957, on the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). After the series ended in 1957, however, a modified version continued for three more seasons with 13 one-hour specials, running from 1957 to 1960, known first as The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show and later in reruns as The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Goodnight Sweetheart, Goodnight&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is a popular song that was a hit during the mid 1950s. It was written by Calvin Carter and James &quot;Pookie&quot; Hudson in 1953. It was originally recorded by the rhythm and blues group, The Spaniels, in 1954. The original version peaked at number five on the R&amp;B Best Sellers chart. The best-selling version of the song was recorded by The McGuire Sisters in 1954. It was also recorded in 1954 by country music duo Johnnie &amp; Jack. The song became well known again in the late 1970s as the closing song performed by Sha Na Na on their weekly variety show as well as its appearance in American Graffiti and again in the late 1980s after its use in the major hit film Three Men and a Baby. This song is completely different from the 1930s song sung by Rudy Vallee, among others. This song has the sub-title &quot;it's time to go&quot; with the now famous doo-wop bass line intro.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Truth or Consequences was an American quiz show that originally aired on NBC radio (1940–1957) and later on television (1950–1988). The premise of the show was to mix the original quiz element of game shows with wacky stunts. If the contestant could not complete the &quot;Truth&quot; portion, there would be &quot;Consequences,&quot; usually a zany and embarrassing stunt. From the start, most contestants preferred to answer the question wrong in order to perform the stunt.

I hit the trails and the woods and the brush with kcnerdgirl and byonke this morning.   There was several tough caches back in this arm of the lake.  Wild rose bushes and thorns would reign supreme.

After walking the snowmobile trail and finding a number of caches on Saturday morning of MOGA with coupleofbucks, iowa2asia, and GuitarMan24, we had lunch and decided to drive from cache to cache on the southern end of this set of caches on the east side of the lake. Little did we know that many of these are much tougher terrain than the ones we walked to this morning. We did lots of bushwhacking, got lots of ticks and I even gouged my eye on a tree branch. All worth it though to find these nice new caches. We did skip several that looked too overgrown and on tough terrain, but we did score a bunch of them. Thanks for all the great new caches for MOGA!

The first contestant to correctly &quot;ring the bell and name that tune&quot; scored a point. Four tunes were played every game, and each tune was worth increasing dollar amounts.

In the end, I was able to spring free to accomplish this goal.  I’m so happy I was able to make that happen.  It was really a great time overall.  Not perfect, but how often can everything be perfect, even in a great resort over a wonderful weekend.  I really appreciate all the hard work put into these events and these caches from those near Honey Creek to those I picked up many miles away while looking for sustenance away from the resort.  I am looking forward to the next time I get this direction and can enjoy the company of so many great friends.</groundspeak:text>

After walking the snowmobile trail and finding a number of caches on Saturday morning of MOGA with coupleofbucks, iowa2asia, and GuitarMan24, we had lunch and decided to drive from cache to cache on the southern end of this set of caches on the east side of the lake. Little did we know that many of these are much tougher terrain than the ones we walked to this morning. We did lots of bushwhacking, got lots of ticks and I even gouged my eye on a tree branch. All worth it though to find these nice new caches. We did skip several that looked too overgrown and on tough terrain, but we did score a bunch of them. Thanks for all the great new caches for MOGA!

He was known as &quot;the King of the Slide Guitar&quot; and had a unique guitar style, noted for his use of loud amplification and his stirring voice. Elmore began making music at the age of 12 using a simple one-string instrument ('diddley bow' or 'jitterbug') strung up on a shack wall. As a teen he was playing at local dances under the names Cleanhead and Joe Willie James.

I hit the trails and the woods and the brush with kcnerdgirl and byonke this morning.   There was several tough caches back in this arm of the lake.  Wild rose bushes and thorns would reign supreme.  But hey, if you're not bushwhacking, you're not Geocaching.  Thanks for the cache and the fun! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

After walking the snowmobile trail and finding a number of caches on Saturday morning of MOGA with coupleofbucks, iowa2asia, and GuitarMan24, we had lunch and decided to drive from cache to cache on the southern end of this set of caches on the east side of the lake. Little did we know that many of these are much tougher terrain than the ones we walked to this morning. We did lots of bushwhacking, got lots of ticks and I even gouged my eye on a tree branch. All worth it though to find these nice new caches. We did skip several that looked too overgrown and on tough terrain, but we did score a bunch of them. Thanks for all the great new caches for MOGA!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Chantilly Lace&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is the name of a rock and roll song, written and originally performed by The Big Bopper (J.P. Richardson) in 1958. The co-writers of the song were Jerry Foster and Bill Rice. The single was produced by Jerry Kennedy. Originally cut for Pappy Daily's D label, the recording was purchased by Mercury and released in the summer of 1958; what ensued was that the song gained popularity (mostly on pop, with regional country music appeal). It peaked at number 6 and stayed 25 weeks in the charts.&lt;br /&gt;

I hit the trails and the woods and the brush with kcnerdgirl and byonke this morning.   There was several tough caches back in this arm of the lake.  Wild rose bushes and thorns would reign supreme.  But hey, if you're not bushwhacking, you're not Geocaching.  Thanks for the cache and the fun! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

After walking the snowmobile trail and finding a number of caches on Saturday morning of MOGA with coupleofbucks, iowa2asia, and GuitarMan24, we had lunch and decided to drive from cache to cache on the southern end of this set of caches on the east side of the lake. Little did we know that many of these are much tougher terrain than the ones we walked to this morning. We did lots of bushwhacking, got lots of ticks and I even gouged my eye on a tree branch. All worth it though to find these nice new caches. We did skip several that looked too overgrown and on tough terrain, but we did score a bunch of them. Thanks for all the great new caches for MOGA!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Packard was an American luxury-type automobile marque built by the Packard Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan. The Packard Caribbean was a &quot;halo&quot; vehicle produced by the Packard Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan during model years 1953 through 1956. Some of the Caribbean's styling was derived from the Pan American Packard show car of the previous year. Produced only as a convertible from 1953 to 1955, the Caribbean added a hardtop model in its final year of 1956.

Rolling Stone magazine ranked him at #6 on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. According to Edward M. Komara, King &quot;introduced a sophisticated style of soloing based on fluid string bending and shimmering vibrato that would influence virtually every electric blues guitarist that followed.&quot; King has been inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame.

I hit the trails and the woods and the brush with kcnerdgirl and byonke this morning.   There was several tough caches back in this arm of the lake.  Wild rose bushes and thorns would reign supreme.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Phil Phillips (born Philip Baptiste, March 14, 1926, Lake Charles, Louisiana) is an American singer and songwriter, best known for his 1959 hit, &quot;Sea of Love&quot;. &quot;Sea of Love&quot; went to #2 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 pop chart and spent 14 weeks in the top 40, as well as reaching #1 on the R&amp;B chart. In 1959 it sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Nonetheless, Phillips was paid only $6800, and received no further royalties for the song or its recording.

After walking the snowmobile trail and finding a number of caches on Saturday morning of MOGA with coupleofbucks, iowa2asia, and GuitarMan24, we had lunch and decided to drive from cache to cache on the southern end of this set of caches on the east side of the lake. Little did we know that many of these are much tougher terrain than the ones we walked to this morning. We did lots of bushwhacking, got lots of ticks and I even gouged my eye on a tree branch. All worth it though to find these nice new caches. We did skip several that looked too overgrown and on tough terrain, but we did score a bunch of them. Thanks for all the great new caches for MOGA!

I hit the trails and the woods and the brush with kcnerdgirl and byonke this morning.   There was several tough caches back in this arm of the lake.  Wild rose bushes and thorns would reign supreme.  But hey, if you're not bushwhacking, you're not Geocaching.  Thanks for the cache and the fun! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

After walking the snowmobile trail and finding a number of caches on Saturday morning of MOGA with coupleofbucks, iowa2asia, and GuitarMan24, we had lunch and decided to drive from cache to cache on the southern end of this set of caches on the east side of the lake. Little did we know that many of these are much tougher terrain than the ones we walked to this morning. We did lots of bushwhacking, got lots of ticks and I even gouged my eye on a tree branch. All worth it though to find these nice new caches. We did skip several that looked too overgrown and on tough terrain, but we did score a bunch of them. Thanks for all the great new caches for MOGA!

I hit the trails and the woods and the brush with kcnerdgirl and byonke this morning.   There was several tough caches back in this arm of the lake.  Wild rose bushes and thorns would reign supreme.  But hey, if you're not bushwhacking, you're not Geocaching.  Thanks for the cache and the fun! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

After walking the snowmobile trail and finding a number of caches on Saturday morning of MOGA with coupleofbucks, iowa2asia, and GuitarMan24, we had lunch and decided to drive from cache to cache on the southern end of this set of caches on the east side of the lake. Little did we know that many of these are much tougher terrain than the ones we walked to this morning. We did lots of bushwhacking, got lots of ticks and I even gouged my eye on a tree branch. All worth it though to find these nice new caches. We did skip several that looked too overgrown and on tough terrain, but we did score a bunch of them. Thanks for all the great new caches for MOGA!

During its time in production, the Commodore model represented the largest and most luxurious Hudson model. In its final year in 1952, the Commodore was split into a Six series and an Eight series. The exterior received another trim change, but by the end of 1953, the Step-Down styling was beginning to look outdated.

Captain Kangaroo had a loose structure, built around life in the &quot;Treasure House&quot; where the Captain would tell stories, meet guests, and indulge in silly stunts with regular characters, both humans and puppets.

The show follows the lives of the Mitchell family – Henry, Alice, and their only child, Dennis. Dennis is an energetic, well meaning, but trouble prone boy and sometimes a mischievous child. He was basically a good well-intentioned boy who always was trying to help people, but wound up making situations worse-often at Mr. Wilson's expense.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;I Only Have Eyes for You&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is a popular song by composer Harry Warren and lyricist Al Dubin, written in 1934 for the film Dames where it was introduced by Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler. According to Billboard magazine, the song was a #2 hit for Ben Selvin in 1934. The orchestras of Peter Duchin and Anson Weeks also figured in the song's 1934 popularity. This song was recorded in 1950 by Peggy Lee, and most notably by The Flamingos in 1959, becoming one of their most popular hits. Rolling Stone magazine ranked the Flamingos' version #157 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. This version peaked at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100chart. The song is a jazz standard, and has been covered by thousands of musicians. A remake of the song by Art Garfunkel was a number one song on the UK Singles Chart in October 1975 for two weeks. The song was his first hit as a solo artist in the UK. In the US, the song reached #18 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the adult contemporary chart. Garfunkel performed the song on the second episode of Saturday Night Live.&lt;br /&gt;

After walking the snowmobile trail and finding a number of caches on Saturday morning of MOGA with coupleofbucks, iowa2asia, and GuitarMan24, we had lunch and decided to drive from cache to cache on the southern end of this set of caches on the east side of the lake. Little did we know that many of these are much tougher terrain than the ones we walked to this morning. We did lots of bushwhacking, got lots of ticks and I even gouged my eye on a tree branch. All worth it though to find these nice new caches. We did skip several that looked too overgrown and on tough terrain, but we did score a bunch of them. Thanks for all the great new caches for MOGA!

Their biggest hit single was &quot;Silhouettes,&quot; a moderately-slow doo-wop piece of pop music that reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1957, released on XYZ Records (and picked up by Cameo Records for national distribution). It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.

I hit the trails and the woods and the brush with kcnerdgirl and byonke this morning.   There was several tough caches back in this arm of the lake.  Wild rose bushes and thorns would reign supreme.  But hey, if you're not bushwhacking, you're not Geocaching.  Thanks for the cache and the fun! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

After walking the snowmobile trail and finding a number of caches on Saturday morning of MOGA with coupleofbucks, iowa2asia, and GuitarMan24, we had lunch and decided to drive from cache to cache on the southern end of this set of caches on the east side of the lake. Little did we know that many of these are much tougher terrain than the ones we walked to this morning. We did lots of bushwhacking, got lots of ticks and I even gouged my eye on a tree branch. All worth it though to find these nice new caches. We did skip several that looked too overgrown and on tough terrain, but we did score a bunch of them. Thanks for all the great new caches for MOGA!

P.&quot; Richardson, Jr. (Oct. 24, 1930 – Feb. 3, 1959) also commonly known as The Big Bopper, was an American disc jockey, singer, and songwriter whose big voice and exuberant personality made him an early rock and roll star.

I hit the trails and the woods and the brush with kcnerdgirl and byonke this morning.   There was several tough caches back in this arm of the lake.  Wild rose bushes and thorns would reign supreme.  But hey, if you're not bushwhacking, you're not Geocaching.  Thanks for the cache and the fun! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Have Mercy Baby&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is a popular rhythm and blues song, written by Billy Ward and Rose Marks, recorded by The Dominoes in Cincinnati, produced by Ralph Bass, and released by Federal Records in 1952. It was Number One on the R&amp;B Charts for ten non consecutive weeks. Influenced by the group's lead singer Clyde McPhatter, its importance lies in that it was the first popular R&amp;B recording highlighting passionate black gospel music features.&lt;br /&gt;

The Nash Rambler established a new segment in the automobile market and is widely acknowledged to be the first successful modern American compact car. In 1951, the Nash Rambler line was enlarged to include a two-door station wagon and a two-door pillarless hardtop — designated the Country Club.

I hit the trails and the woods and the brush with kcnerdgirl and byonke this morning.   There was several tough caches back in this arm of the lake.  Wild rose bushes and thorns would reign supreme.  But hey, if you're not bushwhacking, you're not Geocaching.  Thanks for the cache and the fun! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

Spent Saturday morning of MOGA walking the snow mobile trail with coupleofbucks, iowa2asia and GuitarMan24 finding all kinds of juicy ammo boxes. We walked down to this one from the Abbot and Costello cache and made a quick find after waiting out some other cachers at the site. Also found the poker run cache... this is the only one of these that we made it to. Thanks for all the effort that went into placing and publishing these caches!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Good Golly Miss Molly&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is a hit rock 'n' roll song first recorded in 1958 by the American musician Little Richard. The song, a 12-bar blues, was written by John Marascalco and producer Robert &quot;Bumps&quot; Blackwell. Although it was first recorded by Little Richard, Blackwell produced another version by The Valiants, who imitated Little Richard, but sang the song even faster. Although the Valiants' version was released first, Little Richard had the hit. Like all his early hits, it quickly became a rock 'n' roll standard and has subsequently been covered by hundreds of artists. The song is ranked #94 on the Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The DeSoto Deluxe (also sometimes spelled DeLuxe) is an automobile produced by the Chrysler Corporation and sold under its DeSoto brand from 1939 through to the 1952 model year. While in production, the Deluxe was DeSoto's entry-level car, and was offered primarily as two-door and four-door sedans. The Deluxe differed from the more upmarket Custom line by virtue of the traits found in base models, namely less trim, fewer standard features, and plainer interiors in fewer color combinations.

After finding regular size caches this morning, I wasn't expecting a micro here. There was another MOGA cacher already searching when I arrived with iowa2asia, coupleofbucks and GuitarMan24. It didn't take long and i2a spotted this one. Lots of places it could have been, so we were lucky here. Thanks for all the new caches and for a great event!

Their first hit record was &quot;That'll Be the Day&quot;, released in 1957. They helped set the template for subsequent rock bands such as the Beatles, with their guitar-bass-drums arrangements and tendency to write their own material. After Holly's death in 1959 the band continued to tour and record with different vocalists, releasing new material into the 21st century.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is the title of a song written and recorded by American country music artist Johnny Cash. The song combines elements from two popular folk genres, the train song and the prison song, both of which Cash would continue to use for the rest of his career. It became one of Cash's signature songs. In the lyrics, the jailed protagonist listens to the whistle of a train outside his cell and recounts his crimes (&quot;I shot a man in Reno/just to watch him die&quot;), imagines the free people inside the train (&quot;They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars&quot;) and dreams of what he would do if he were free. &quot;I know I had it coming/I know I can't be free,&quot; sings the imprisoned man. &quot;But those people keep a'moving/and that's what tortures me.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;

I hit the trails and the woods and the brush with kcnerdgirl and byonke this morning.   There was several tough caches back in this arm of the lake.  Wild rose bushes and thorns would reign supreme.  But hey, if you're not bushwhacking, you're not Geocaching.  Thanks for the cache and the fun! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Eddie Cochran (October 3, 1938 – April 17, 1960), was an American rock &amp; roll pioneer who in his brief career had a small but lasting influence on rock music through his guitar playing. Cochran's rockabilly songs, such as &quot;C'mon Everybody&quot;, &quot;Somethin' Else&quot;, and &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;, captured teenage frustration and desire in the late 1950s and early 1960s.His image as a sharply dressed, rugged but good looking young man with a rebellious attitude epitomized the stance of the Fifties rocker.

Spent Saturday morning of MOGA walking the snow mobile trail with GuitarMan24, coupleofbucks and iowa2asia. The air was cool and the ground a bit damp, but all in all it was excellent weather to find a bunch of ammo boxes. These new caches are great for those like me who always enjoys a good ammo box in the woods. We averaged 3rd or 4th to find on many of these and they were still well stocked with some nice swag items from various sponsors. Thanks for all the effort that went into placing and publishing these caches!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  I even ran with a non-CC crew for a bit.  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  Though, I did not see this particular cache twice.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.</groundspeak:text>

From 1949 until its cancellation in 1971, the show ran on CBS every Sunday night from 8 – 9 P.M. E.T., and is one of the few entertainment shows to have been run in the same weekly time slot on the same network for more than two decades.

Spent Saturday morning of MOGA walking the snow mobile trail with GuitarMan24, coupleofbucks and iowa2asia. The air was cool and the ground a bit damp, but all in all it was excellent weather to find a bunch of ammo boxes. These new caches are great for those like me who always enjoys a good ammo box in the woods. We averaged 3rd or 4th to find on many of these and they were still well stocked with some nice swag items from various sponsors. Thanks for all the effort that went into placing and publishing these caches! Nice view from here... stopped for a couple of pictures. Thanks for bringing us out here.

The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  I even ran with a non-CC crew for a bit.  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  Though, I did not see this particular cache twice.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Green Hornet is an American radio program that premiered on January 31, 1936. The program continued through September 8, 1950, with a brief return in the fall of 1952. The Green Hornet is the alter ego of Britt Reid, wealthy young publisher of the Daily Sentinel by day. As the Green Hornet and accompanied by his confidant Kato, Reid masquerades as a criminal to infiltrate and then battle the underworld, leaving criminals and incriminating evidence behind for the police.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;White Christmas&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is an Irving Berlin song reminiscing about an old-fashioned Christmas setting. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the version sung by Bing Crosby is the best-selling single of all time, with estimated sales in excess of 50 million copies worldwide. Accounts vary as to when and where Berlin wrote the song. One story is that he wrote it in 1940, in warm La Quinta, California while staying at the La Quinta Hotel, a frequent Hollywood retreat also favored by writer-producer Frank Capra. He often stayed up all night writing — he told his secretary, &quot;Grab your pen and take down this song. I just wrote the best song I've ever written — heck, I just wrote the best song that anybody's ever written!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;

Spent Saturday morning of MOGA walking the snow mobile trail with GuitarMan24, coupleofbucks and iowa2asia. The air was cool and the ground a bit damp, but all in all it was excellent weather to find a bunch of ammo boxes. These new caches are great for those like me who always enjoys a good ammo box in the woods. We averaged 3rd or 4th to find on many of these and they were still well stocked with some nice swag items from various sponsors. Thanks for all the effort that went into placing and publishing these caches!

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; B.B. King recorded &lt;b&gt;&quot;3 O'Clock Blues&quot;&lt;/b&gt; for RPM Records around September 1951. The recording took place at an improvised studio in a room at the Memphis YMCA and the resulting audio quality &quot;was a step down from the standards set by Sam Phillips&quot;. King's version is a slow (65 beats per minute) twelve-bar blues notated in 12/8 time in the key of C. His guitar work on the song shows his T-Bone Walker influences, &quot;though his tone was bigger and rounder and his phrasing somewhat heavier&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;

Spent Saturday morning of MOGA walking the snow mobile trail with GuitarMan24, coupleofbucks and iowa2asia. The air was cool and the ground a bit damp, but all in all it was excellent weather to find a bunch of ammo boxes. These new caches are great for those like me who always enjoys a good ammo box in the woods. We averaged 3rd or 4th to find on many of these and they were still well stocked with some nice swag items from various sponsors. Thanks for all the effort that went into placing and publishing these caches!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Maverick is a western television series with comedic overtones created by Roy Huggins. The show ran from September 22, 1957 to July 8, 1962 on ABC and stars James Garner as Bret Maverick, a cagey, articulate cardsharp. The Mavericks were poker players from Texas who traveled all over the American Old West and on Mississippi riverboats, constantly getting into and out of life-threatening trouble of one sort or another, usually involving money, women, or both.

I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  I even ran with a non-CC crew for a bit.  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  Though, I did not see this particular cache twice.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.</groundspeak:text>

Spent Saturday morning of MOGA walking the snow mobile trail with GuitarMan24, coupleofbucks and iowa2asia. The air was cool and the ground a bit damp, but all in all it was excellent weather to find a bunch of ammo boxes. These new caches are great for those like me who always enjoys a good ammo box in the woods. We averaged 3rd or 4th to find on many of these and they were still well stocked with some nice swag items from various sponsors. Thanks for all the effort that went into placing and publishing these caches! I dropped &quot;Don't get around much anymore&quot; TB that I brought with me from Nebraska.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;There Goes My Baby&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is a song written by Ben E. King (Benjamin Nelson), Lover Patterson, George Treadwell, Jerry Leiber, and Mike Stoller, and produced by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller for The Drifters. This was the first single by the second incarnation of the Drifters (previously known as the 5 Crowns), who assumed the group name in 1958 after manager George Treadwell fired the remaining members of the original lineup. Leiber and Stoller used a radically different approach to production than Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler had employed with the original Clyde McPhatter-led Drifters. The combination of new style and new group fit, and the song reached number two on the Hot 100 and number one on the Billboard R&amp;B chart and on the Cash Box sales chart for two weeks, in the summer of 1959.&lt;br /&gt;

Spent Saturday morning of MOGA walking the snow mobile trail with GuitarMan24, coupleofbucks and iowa2asia. The air was cool and the ground a bit damp, but all in all it was excellent weather to find a bunch of ammo boxes. These new caches are great for those like me who always enjoys a good ammo box in the woods. We averaged 3rd or 4th to find on many of these and they were still well stocked with some nice swag items from various sponsors. Thanks for all the effort that went into placing and publishing these caches!

Freddy &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Cannon holds the record for most appearances at 110.

The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  I even ran with a non-CC crew for a bit.  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  Though, I did not see this particular cache twice.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is a song written by Tiny Bradshaw, Howard Kay, and Lois Mann. Bradshaw first recorded the song as a jump blues in 1951—his best known recording. After a rock and roll version of the song was recorded and released by Johnny Burnette and the Rock and Roll Trio in 1956, numerous other versions have been recorded. The Trio's version, considered a rockabilly classic, is an upbeat, high energy version of the original, with lead guitarist Paul Burlison playing what many consider to be the first introduction of the contemporary rock and roll feedback/distortion guitar sound.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)&lt;/b&gt;&quot; is a traditional Jamaican mento folk song, the best-known version of which was sung by Harry Belafonte. Despite the song's mento influences, &lt;b&gt;&quot;Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)&quot;&lt;/b&gt; is widely known as an example of calypso music. It is a work song, from the point of view of dock workers working the night shift loading bananas onto ships. Daylight has come, the shift is over and they want their work to be counted up so that they can go home.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Leave It to Beaver is an American television situation comedy about an inquisitive but often naïve boy named Theodore &quot;The Beaver&quot; Cleaver (portrayed by Jerry Mathers) and his adventures at home, in school, and around his suburban neighborhood. The show has attained an iconic status in the United States, with the Cleavers exemplifying the idealized suburban family of the mid-20th century. Comprising six full 39-week seasons (234 episodes), the show had its debut on CBS on October 4, 1957.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Bonanza is an American western television series that ran from September 12, 1959 to January 16, 1973. Lasting 14 seasons and 430 episodes, it ranks as the second longest running western series (behind Gunsmoke) and still continues to air in syndication. The show centers on the Cartwright family, which lives in the area near Lake Tahoe, Nevada. The show's title &quot;Bonanza&quot; is a term used by miners in regards to a large vein or deposit of ore, and commonly refers to The Comstock Lode.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Town &amp; Country was a debut of the first woodie wagon with an all-steel roof; the roof used was that of the big Chrysler Imperial 8-passenger sedan and limousine. After the war the Town &amp; Country nameplate returned, but the station wagon body did not. Town &amp; Country sedans, coupés, and convertibles were also produced from 1946 to 1950 in much larger numbers than the prewar wagon. Production of the original, woodie Town &amp; Country ended in 1950.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The original version of The Price Is Right was first transmitted on the NBC, and later ABC, from 1956 to 1965. Hosted by Bill Cullen, it involved four contestants bidding on expensive products. The contestant whose bid was closest to the correct value – without going over that value– won it. At the end of each edition, the contestant who had won the most (by dollar value) was declared the winner and became the returning champion. This version of The Price Is Right ended in 1965.

I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).

The Starlight body style was considered a halo model. For 1950 and 1951, all Studebakers received a freshening of the 1947 design with the addition of the &quot;bullet nose&quot; front sheet metal. This version of the Starlight body style continued until the end of the 1952 model year.

I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well. The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well. The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.

I even ran with a non-CC crew for a bit. You get the picture. It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way. I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before. I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs. Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes. 

The resort was great. There were so many wonderful spots to meet up with cachers and chat for a bit between runs. It was great to have so many people in the same location. It was also good to have a central hub where those who camped could come and meet up conveniently with those staying in the resort.

The competition was really something this year. I could not have asked for better team members. My team , Insane Cache Posse, came in second and I think we were pleased to take home the Silver. Not only did I walk away with Silver, but I took home some serious bumps and bruises. I also have a great caching story to break out on a moment’s notice as well. 

Thanks for all the MOGA caches.  Much appreciated.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

Big thanks, Sheldenn, for putting this cache out...  and for dealing with the ding ding ding of the email alerts.  I'm sure for a while, you thought it would never end.  It was good visiting with you at the cookout event post-MOGA.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

Big thanks, Sheldenn, for putting this cache out...  and for dealing with the ding ding ding of the email alerts.  I'm sure for a while, you thought it would never end.  It was good visiting with you at the cookout event post-MOGA.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

Big thanks, Sheldenn, for putting this cache out...  and for dealing with the ding ding ding of the email alerts.  I'm sure for a while, you thought it would never end.  It was good visiting with you at the cookout event post-MOGA.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’ve been monitoring the area for newly published caches for quite some time.  The results of these alerts have left me salivating to get up to take on some of the newer caches, especially some of the darling red variety.  But, I needed an another excuse to come.  An accompanying reason.  A secondary motivating force to move me.  What could that be?  How about…  Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to town today to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on…  caches!  And quite a few of those were Red Darling caches.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly… Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon before and after lunch.  We cached well into the night and were impressed by many of the offerings.  We didn’t get them all, but we did make a pretty good dent.

Got this one after a late lunch.  Thanks for the placement, smwilliams77.</groundspeak:text>

I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

Big thanks, Sheldenn, for putting this cache out...  and for dealing with the ding ding ding of the email alerts.  I'm sure for a while, you thought it would never end.  It was good visiting with you at the cookout event post-MOGA.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

Big thanks, Sheldenn, for putting this cache out...  and for dealing with the ding ding ding of the email alerts.  I'm sure for a while, you thought it would never end.  It was good visiting with you at the cookout event post-MOGA.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’ve been monitoring the area for newly published caches for quite some time.  The results of these alerts have left me salivating to get up to take on some of the newer caches, especially some of the darling red variety.  But, I needed an another excuse to come.  An accompanying reason.  A secondary motivating force to move me.  What could that be?  How about…  Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to town today to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on…  caches!  And quite a few of those were Red Darling caches.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly… Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon before and after lunch.  We cached well into the night and were impressed by many of the offerings.  We didn’t get them all, but we did make a pretty good dent.

Thanks for placing and maintaining this, Sheldenn.  Nicely hidden.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

Big thanks, Sheldenn, for putting this cache out...  and for dealing with the ding ding ding of the email alerts.  I'm sure for a while, you thought it would never end.  It was good visiting with you at the cookout event post-MOGA.</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

Big thanks, Sheldenn, for putting this cache out...  and for dealing with the ding ding ding of the email alerts.  I'm sure for a while, you thought it would never end.  It was good visiting with you at the cookout event post-MOGA.</groundspeak:text>

While crossing the square I took in some of the local sculpture work.

By the time I got back to the alley, my friends had driven over.  They had never cached before.  

This time, I ignored where the gps seemed to be pointing me and just used my head.  It didn’t take long to come up with it this time once I stopped relying on the gps.  

What a great hide.  This was a very slick hide Hill Folk.

Thanks for the hide and for placing one to demonstrate caching to my Albia friends.</groundspeak:text>

Put on thier property with their permission and amusement!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Easy to get to you can park in parking lot but to get to cache it you have to go in yard, and hopefully a little difficult to find.  Everyone in the office knows what you are up to and you might have several people watching you.  Of course the patients and thier Mom and Dad will not so that is where the sleath comes in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We spent alot of time on this cache hope you enjoy it!</groundspeak:long_description>

You are looking for a magnetic container that holds only a log!  Bring your own pen/pencil!  There is parking close by and you have a level and short walk!  There is a trailer court  near by so be aware of muggles!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats RedDarling on the FTF!</groundspeak:long_description>

I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

It was great to bounce into the cache owner at MOGA and thank them for all of their great caches out here.  I’ve done quite a few before on a previous trip, but even with this effort, I’m still going to have quite a few to mop up.  I’ll likely never get them all!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

It was great to bounce into the cache owner at MOGA and thank them for all of their great caches out here.  I’ve done quite a few before on a previous trip, but even with this effort, I’m still going to have quite a few to mop up.  I’ll likely never get them all!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’ve been monitoring the area for newly published caches for quite some time.  The results of these alerts have left me thinking that I might need to come up early to MOGA to get some back road caching done.  Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Hollow Trees&lt;br/&gt;Hollow trees result from a tree injury when Walls 1, 2, and 3 fail to stop the spread of decay. Fungi cause wood decay and insects assist with wood removal. Wall 4 remains intact so new growth continues to occur on the outer part of the trunk. The hollow portion of the tree will not exceed the diameter of the tree at the time of injury unless Wall 4 is damaged. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditionally, homeowners have attempted to clean decay from the cavity and to add a material, such as concrete, to fill the empty space. Cavity treatment is an exacting process that if done incorrectly can shorten the life of the tree. The hard rim of tissue, Wall 4, surrounding the decayed wood must not be broken or decay could spread to the wood produced after the initial injury. If you chose to remove decayed wood, only remove wood that comes out easily. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benefits from filling the cavity are questionable at best. Since the fill material will expand and contract at a different rate than tree wood it can create problems of its own. The strength of a hollow tree comes from the new wood produced after the injury, not from material used to fill a cavity. Remove hollow trees that appear weak and are likely to fall. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes the cavity will contain water. The old recommendation was to drill holes below the cavity so the water could drain. However, drilling holes will break the barrier that keeps the decay from invading healthy wood. If water has been present for one or more growing seasons, the tree has already adjusted. You can cover hollow openings with a piece of tin or window screen filled with plaster to keep out animals, water, and to form a surface that allows new tissue to grow over the opening.</groundspeak:long_description>

The results of these alerts have left me thinking that I might need to come up early to MOGA to get some back road caching done.  Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://s1194.photobucket.com/albums/aa362/jstrout/?action=view&amp;amp;current=1b9181b5.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The SS Edmund Fitzgerald was an American Great Lakes freighter that made headlines after sinking in a Lake Superior storm with the loss of the entire crew. When launched on June 8, 1958, she was the largest boat on the Great Lakes, and remains the largest boat to have sunk there. Nicknamed the &quot;Mighty Fitz&quot;, &quot;Fitz&quot;, or &quot;Big Fitz&quot;, the ship suffered a series of mishaps during her launch: it took three attempts to break the champagne bottle used to christen her and she collided with a pier when she entered the water. For seventeen years the Fitzgerald carried taconite from mines near Duluth, Minnesota, to iron works in Detroit, Toledo and other ports. As a &quot;workhorse&quot; she set seasonal haul records six different times, often beating her own previous record. Her size, record-breaking performance, and &quot;dee jay captain&quot; endeared the Fitzgerald to boat watchers. Captain Peter Pulcer was known for piping music day or night over the ship's intercom system while passing through the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers, and entertaining spectators at the Soo Locks with a running commentary about the Fitzgerald. With Captain Ernest M. McSorley in command and carrying a full cargo of taconite ore pellets, the Fitzgerald embarked on her final voyage from Superior, Wisconsin, on the afternoon of November 9, 1975. En route to a steel mill near Detroit, Michigan, she joined a second freighter, the SS Arthur M. Anderson. By the next day the two ships were caught in the midst of a massive winter storm, with near hurricane-force winds and waves up to 35 feet high. The Fitzgerald suddenly sank in Canadian waters approximately 17 miles (15 nautical miles; 27 kilometers) from the entrance to Whitefish Bay, at a depth of 530 feet (160 m). Although the Fitzgerald had reported being in difficulty earlier, no distress signals were sent before she sank. Her crew perished and no bodies were recovered. According to Gordon Lightfoot Song Lyrics answer these questions. 1..On November __AB___ 1975, an ore carrier the Edmund Fitzgerald sank in Lake Superior 2.At __C__ P.M. a main hatchway caved in.3.In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed, in the &quot;Maritime Sailors' Cathedral.&quot; The church bell chimed 'til it rang ____DE_times for each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald. 4.The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay if they'd put____F__more miles behind 'er.

The results of these alerts have left me thinking that I might need to come up early to MOGA to get some back road caching done.  Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

Why do some of my tulips only sprout leaves? Some of my tulips only sprout leaves, Its almost like the bulbs maybe down to deep so only a couple leaves appear. I'm not sure I dont know much about flowers. Should I maybe when they are done flowering bring them closer to the surface? any advice with them would be greatly appreciated! Also do they spread? seems like I have more and more every year! As a general rule of thumb, flowering bulbs should be both planted and spaced by measuring 3 times the height of the bulb. That means a bulb that measures 2 inches high should be planted at a depth of 6 inches and spaced 6 inches from surrounding bulbs. When measuring planting depth, measure to the bottom of the bulb. So, most tulips should be planted so that they will have about 5 inches of soil above them. Watering the garden during the hot summer to keep annuals and other plants above the tulips alive. Tulips do much better when grown hot and dry during the summers. The second most common problem is not growing the leaves properly - cutting them off too early (before they yellow) or any number of things that stop the leaves from producing energy for the bulb to form a bud. Yes, in the fall, you can dig them up and replant them again...but no deeper than the recommend planting height. Also, feed your tulips some bone meal when re-planting.&lt;br /&gt;

I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.</groundspeak:text>

Rocks are everywhere. Billions of years ago, as  erupted and moutains burst from the ground, many different kinds of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fi.edu/fellows/fellow1/oct98/create/&quot;&gt;rocks were formed&lt;/a&gt;. Rocks contain important clues about the events that shaped the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dsc.discovery.com/guides/planetearth/planetearth.html&quot;&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;. Geologists study them to look for these clues and to piece together the 4.5 billion years that make up our planet's history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rocks are an &lt;b&gt;aggregate&lt;/b&gt;, or combination, of two or more &lt;a href=&quot;http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/rxmin/mineral.html&quot;&gt;minerals&lt;/a&gt;. They come in all shapes, sizes, textures and weights. &lt;a href=&quot;http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/ask-a-geologist/index.html&quot;&gt;Geologists&lt;/a&gt; classify rocks by the process that formed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rocks are an important part of our world. This virtual tour will focus on how rocks are created, the different types of rock, characteristics of rocks, and rocks in everyday life. Come along as we explore the fascinating world of rocks. Learn how you can become a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fi.edu/fellows/fellow1/oct98/index2.html&quot;&gt;rockhound&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

41.24.AB2 W 092 56.CD8 Decimal Equivalents of AB=7/16 CD= 3/32
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When you read a tape measure a little knowledge of math is needed.
We know that 1/2 is the same as 4/8, 8/16, 16/32, etc. We could
refer to the 1/2&quot; mark as the 16/32&quot; mark but we usually use the
simplest numbers possible. Since we know that 16/32 is 1/2, when
looking for 15/32&quot; on the tape measure, for example, it is the
first 32nd before the 1/2&quot; mark. Actually, in the field a carpenter
refers to a 32nd as plus or minus a major fraction. For instance,
13/32 is 1/32 less than 14/32 or 7/16, so we say &quot;7/16 minus&quot; and
11/32 is 1/32 more than 10/32 or 5/16, so we say &quot;5/16 plus&quot;. This
is a fast way of reading the tape measure on the job when taking a
measurement of something to cut it to fit. What you should do is
memorize the common fractions down to sixteenths. Here they are:
1/16, 1/8, 3/16, 1/4, 5/16, 3/8, 7/16, 1/2, 9/16, 5/8, 11/16, 3/4,
13/16, 7/8, 15/16 and the inch mark. How to Read a Tape Measure
Notice the size of the graduations on the tape measure changes with
the fraction; 1/2 is the largest, then 1/4 and 3/4, then the
eighths, sixteenths and the smallest are the thirty-seconds. These
divisions are the most common, but you can get a tape measure in
tenths and hundredths. I have a framing square that divides an inch
into one hundredths. We use thirty-seconds in the stair calculator,
and other instances like that, just for accuracy because when
you're cutting 16 stair risers, if you are 1/16th inch out on each
stair, you are out a whole inch at the end. Even being 1/32&quot; out
gives an error of 1/2&quot;! Bring your own SHARPIE

Surrounded by the central business district, this park is the heart of the community. Its many tulip beds, flowering trees, cannon, Tulip Tower, 1900's fountain, Civil War statue, sundial, and windmill can be viewed by taking a leisurely stroll along the park's extensive sidewalk system lined with 19th century benches and lamp posts. The windmill also serves as an information center April through October. A city-sponsored band performs a concert behind the Tulip Tower on Thursday evenings in June and July.&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I drove way way way way way out of the way today to grab this cache.  Obviously I'm happy I did.  The reputation of the cache precedes it.  There is no doubt about that.  I've been nearby a few times, but today I came for the express purpose of seeing the famous 49 And Holding.  

There is no doubt an amazing set of minds is behind this cache.  This is a tremendous cache.  One of the best I have ever experienced.  I am so thankful to the Iowa cachers who have encouraged me to make the pilgrimage to do this cache.  Thanks to the cache creators for their genius and their hard work on putting this together.

While this cache is why I came up to Pella, I came up to Southern Iowa primarily for a series of events including Monkey Says, Digger’s Friday night meet and greet event, the CITO at Wapello County Lake, Dogs on Point, the Octoberfest Farewell Breakfast, and of course the 5th Annual Octoberfest event.  This was a great series of events with wonderful opportunity to visit friends from far and near.  While up for these events I was able to get a tremendous number of caches around the lake area.  Many of them were very creative.  I was also able to grab some caches elsewhere in the area.</groundspeak:text>

We grab over 30 puzzles, 30 letterboxes, and 42 first to finds at MOGA on the day. We signed our team name BBC (Big Bang Cachers). The weather was great, little windy at times, but nothing too bad you cant prepare yourself for. This was worth the stop! This was such an amazing cache! This is honesty what more caches should be like! Unique and super amazingly awesome! This a very well done cache! not just a simple park and grab, but a traditional cache with a lot of time, effort, work, and a ton of thought poured into the container. I loved how it was a journey and a mystery and a puzzle at the same time. We found the building but where to go from there, and then after one by one finding everything that we needed to find we found the cache. We took a pathtag as well. This rates as one of my favorite caches that i have been to. Very very very clever! This is going to be told to the local cachers in Springfield, MO about how great this cache is! Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

It was great to bounce into the cache owner at MOGA and thank them for all of their great caches out here.  I’ve done quite a few before on a previous trip, but even with this effort, I’m still going to have quite a few to mop up.  I’ll likely never get them all!</groundspeak:text>

The results of these alerts have left me thinking that I might need to come up early to MOGA to get some back road caching done.  Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

It was great to bounce into the cache owner at MOGA and thank them for all of their great caches out here.  I’ve done quite a few before on a previous trip, but even with this effort, I’m still going to have quite a few to mop up.  I’ll likely never get them all!</groundspeak:text>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a printable puzzle where each letter of the alphabet has been given a different numerical value between 1 and 26. Four numbers have already been entered in the solution area. Most of the remaining letters have an arithmetical clue shown below them which equates to the numerical value of the letter. Use the clues and your reasoning powers to match each letter with its correct numerical value. Symbols: (+) Plus (-) Minus (/) Divided by (x) Multiplied by (&amp;gt;) More than (&amp;lt;) Less than&lt;br /&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

It was great to bounce into the cache owner at MOGA and thank them for all of their great caches out here.  I’ve done quite a few before on a previous trip, but even with this effort, I’m still going to have quite a few to mop up.  I’ll likely never get them all!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’ve been monitoring the area for newly published caches for quite some time.  The results of these alerts have left me thinking that I might need to come up early to MOGA to get some back road caching done.  Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

&lt;p&gt;Curt and Brenda started caching a little over two
and a half years ago and were nice enough to get me hooked,
too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;There have been the....&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;quick park and grabs&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
and the...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&quot;holy crap, you want to hang off the side of that rock and go
down on a rope?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
trips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When we say we are only going to be gone 2
hours&lt;br /&gt;
and it ends up being &lt;b&gt;18&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

what we are doing.&lt;br /&gt;

Now they are trying to see how many days they can
find&lt;br /&gt;
at least 1 cache a day.&lt;br /&gt;
I don't know for sure what day they are on,&lt;br /&gt;
but it is over a &lt;b&gt;year&lt;/b&gt; straight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh yeah, they also built the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=9bc707c7-5d9f-4f20-9457-747e305561aa&quot;&gt;

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

It was great to bounce into the cache owner at MOGA and thank them for all of their great caches out here.  I’ve done quite a few before on a previous trip, but even with this effort, I’m still going to have quite a few to mop up.  I’ll likely never get them all!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The blossoms of Double Late Tulips have so many petals that their other name is Peony Tulips. The blossoms are extremely large; when fully open they can be as much as 4 inches (10 cm) across.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most people think (or like to think) that tulips are perennials.  In reality, many groups of tulips behave more like an annual rather than a perennial.  Some groups of tulips perennialize or come back each year with the same colorful blooms.  However, certain groups are considered annuals; they are spectacular in bloom the first year after planting but the following year's display is rather disappointing.  Because of this, these are generally treated as annuals, especially in places like public gardens where spring displays are the focal point.  These tulips are usually pulled up after bloom and replaced with summer-blooming flowers.  In the home garden, one has a tendency to accept them as they grow over the years, despite the color changes and lack of bold display.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If one prefers tulips that tend to perennialize and bloom consistently the same each year, plant species tulips.  These include the botanical, kaufmanniana, fosteriana, and greigii groups of tulips.  Those most likely to re-flower each year include the Darwin hybrids, lily-flowered, some fringed, and some single late tulips.  The rest of the tulip types tend to be considered annuals and are planted yearly.  In the fall, when considering varieties that will be reliable and will last in the garden, look for the word &quot;perennialize&quot; in the description in order to plant those that come back consistently.  Otherwise, enjoy the magnificent display of the other groups of tulips and plant them each fall!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Size: The largest lizard is the Komodo monitor. It can grow longer than a person. The smallest lizard is a tiny gecko.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characteristics: Most lizards have dry, scaly skin. They have four legs, clawed feet, and a long tail. You can see their outside ear opening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards have a weak tail. A small bump or tug will break it off. This will puzzle the enemy. The lizard can get away. Not all lizards have weak tails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizard tails help in balance and movement. Fat is stored in the tail. Losing the tail can be a big problem. Some lizards can grow a new tail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Food: Some lizards eat bugs and spiders. Others eat plants, small animals, or even other lizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most lizards use their eyes to look for food. Some use their sense of smell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards have jaws with teeth. They also have teeth on the roof of their mouth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Habitat: Lizards live in deserts, forests, prairies, marshes, and rocky areas. Most lizards live on the ground or in trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards are fun and easy to watch. They are most active on warm, summer days. On very hot days, some lizards hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most lizards sleep through the winter. On warm days, they sometimes come out to eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Locomotion: Most lizards can run, climb, and cling. A few can swim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People often see lizards dart over logs and rocks. They run quickly across the ground. However, some lizards have small, weak legs. These lizards move slowly.&lt;br/&gt;Reproduction: Most lizards put their eggs in a nest. Other lizards have live babies. The mother lizards do not care for their babies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies: The lizard has many enemies. Some lizards are eaten by birds. They are also eaten by animals, snakes, and other lizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defenses: Some lizards break off their tails to escape enemies. Other lizards may swell up, hiss, or move their tail or body to scare an enemy. Some lizards can change colors to hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few lizards are dangerous. But, be careful of lizards. Many lizards bite or have sharp spines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other Threats: Human are a probem for lizards. Some people eat lizards or lizard eggs. In the past, people killed lizards and sold their skin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lizard's habitat is sometimes destroyed by people building towns or farms.</groundspeak:long_description>

Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Size: The largest lizard is the Komodo monitor. It can grow longer than a person. The smallest lizard is a tiny gecko.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characteristics: Most lizards have dry, scaly skin. They have four legs, clawed feet, and a long tail. You can see their outside ear opening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards have a weak tail. A small bump or tug will break it off. This will puzzle the enemy. The lizard can get away. Not all lizards have weak tails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizard tails help in balance and movement. Fat is stored in the tail. Losing the tail can be a big problem. Some lizards can grow a new tail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Food: Some lizards eat bugs and spiders. Others eat plants, small animals, or even other lizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most lizards use their eyes to look for food. Some use their sense of smell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards have jaws with teeth. They also have teeth on the roof of their mouth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Habitat: Lizards live in deserts, forests, prairies, marshes, and rocky areas. Most lizards live on the ground or in trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards are fun and easy to watch. They are most active on warm, summer days. On very hot days, some lizards hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most lizards sleep through the winter. On warm days, they sometimes come out to eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Locomotion: Most lizards can run, climb, and cling. A few can swim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People often see lizards dart over logs and rocks. They run quickly across the ground. However, some lizards have small, weak legs. These lizards move slowly.&lt;br/&gt;Reproduction: Most lizards put their eggs in a nest. Other lizards have live babies. The mother lizards do not care for their babies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies: The lizard has many enemies. Some lizards are eaten by birds. They are also eaten by animals, snakes, and other lizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defenses: Some lizards break off their tails to escape enemies. Other lizards may swell up, hiss, or move their tail or body to scare an enemy. Some lizards can change colors to hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few lizards are dangerous. But, be careful of lizards. Many lizards bite or have sharp spines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other Threats: Human are a probem for lizards. Some people eat lizards or lizard eggs. In the past, people killed lizards and sold their skin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lizard's habitat is sometimes destroyed by people building towns or farms.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’ve been monitoring the area for newly published caches for quite some time.  The results of these alerts have left me thinking that I might need to come up early to MOGA to get some back road caching done.  Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Size: The largest lizard is the Komodo monitor. It can grow longer than a person. The smallest lizard is a tiny gecko.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characteristics: Most lizards have dry, scaly skin. They have four legs, clawed feet, and a long tail. You can see their outside ear opening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards have a weak tail. A small bump or tug will break it off. This will puzzle the enemy. The lizard can get away. Not all lizards have weak tails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizard tails help in balance and movement. Fat is stored in the tail. Losing the tail can be a big problem. Some lizards can grow a new tail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Food: Some lizards eat bugs and spiders. Others eat plants, small animals, or even other lizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most lizards use their eyes to look for food. Some use their sense of smell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards have jaws with teeth. They also have teeth on the roof of their mouth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Habitat: Lizards live in deserts, forests, prairies, marshes, and rocky areas. Most lizards live on the ground or in trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards are fun and easy to watch. They are most active on warm, summer days. On very hot days, some lizards hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most lizards sleep through the winter. On warm days, they sometimes come out to eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Locomotion: Most lizards can run, climb, and cling. A few can swim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People often see lizards dart over logs and rocks. They run quickly across the ground. However, some lizards have small, weak legs. These lizards move slowly.&lt;br/&gt;Reproduction: Most lizards put their eggs in a nest. Other lizards have live babies. The mother lizards do not care for their babies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies: The lizard has many enemies. Some lizards are eaten by birds. They are also eaten by animals, snakes, and other lizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defenses: Some lizards break off their tails to escape enemies.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

It was great to bounce into the cache owner at MOGA and thank them for all of their great caches out here.  I’ve done quite a few before on a previous trip, but even with this effort, I’m still going to have quite a few to mop up.  I’ll likely never get them all!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A crocodile is any species belonging to the family Crocodylidae (sometimes classified instead as the subfamily Crocodylinae). The term can also be used more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia: i.e. the true crocodiles, the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae) and the gharials (family Gavialidae), as well as the Crocodylomorpha which includes prehistoric crocodile relatives and ancestors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Member species of the family Crocodylidae are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodiles tend to congregate in freshwater habitats like rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water. They feed mostly on vertebrates like fish, reptiles, and mammals, sometimes on invertebrates like molluscs and crustaceans, depending on species. They first appeared during the Eocene epoch, about 55 million years ago.&lt;br/&gt;The word crocodile comes from the Ancient Greek ?????d???? (crocodilos), &quot;lizard,&quot; used in the phrase ho krokódilos ho potamós, &quot;the lizard of the (Nile) river.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several variant Greek forms of the word attested, including the later form ?????de???? (crocodeilos) found cited in many English reference works. In the Koine Greek of Roman times, crocodilos and crocodeilos would have been pronounced identically, and either or both may be the source of the Latinized form crocodilus used by the ancient Romans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crocodilos/crocodeilos itself is a compound of krokè (&quot;pebbles&quot;), and drilos/dreilos (&quot;worm&quot;). It is ascribed to Herodotus, supposedly to describe the basking habits of the Egyptian crocodile. However the word drilos is only attested as a colloquial term for &quot;penis&quot;. The meaning of krokè is explained as describing the skin texture of lizards (or crocodiles) in most sources,[citation needed] but is alternately claimed to refer to a supposed habit of (lizards or crocodiles) basking on pebbly ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The form crocodrillus is attested in Medieval Latin. It is not clear whether this is a medieval corruption or derives from alternate Greco-Latin forms (late Greek corcodrillos and corcodrillion are attested).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A (further) corrupted form cocodrille is found in Old French and was borrowed into Middle English as cocodril(le). The Modern English form crocodile was adapted directly from the Classical Latin crocodilus in the 16th Century, replacing the earlier form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of -y- in the scientific name Crocodylus (and forms derived from it) is a corruption introduced by Laurenti (1768).&lt;br/&gt;Crocodiles are similar to alligators and caiman; for their common biology and differences between them, see Crocodilia. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Crocodiles, like dinosaurs, have the abdominal ribs modified into gastralia.Crocodiles are among the more biologically complex reptiles despite their prehistoric look. Unlike other reptiles, they have a cerebral cortex; a four-chambered heart; and the functional equivalent of a diaphragm, by incorporating muscles used for aquatic locomotion into respiration (e.g. M. diaphragmaticus);[6] Their external morphology on the other hand is a sign of their aquatic and predatory lifestyle. A crocodile’s physical traits allow it to be a successful predator. They have a streamlined body that enables them to swim swiftly. Crocodiles also tuck their feet to their sides while swimming, which makes them faster by decreasing water resistance. They have webbed feet which, although not used to propel the animal through the water, allow it to make fast turns and sudden moves in the water or initiate swimming. Webbed feet are an advantage in shallower water where the animals sometimes move around by walking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crocodiles have a palatal flap, a rigid tissue at the back of the mouth that blocks the entry of water. The palate has a special path from the nostril to the glottis that bypasses the mouth. The nostrils are closed during submergence. Like other archosaurs, crocodilians are diapsid, although their post-temporal fenestrae are reduced. The walls of the braincase are bony but they lack supratemporal and postfrontal bones.Their tongues are not free but held in place by a membrane which limits movement; as a result, crocodiles are unable to stick out their tongues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crocodilian scales have pores that are believed to be sensory, analogous to the lateral line in fishes. They are particularly seen on their upper and lower jaws. Another possibility is that they are secretory, as they produce an oily substance that appears to flush mud off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crocodiles are very fast over short distances, even out of water. Since crocodiles feed by grabbing and holding onto their prey, they have evolved sharp teeth for tearing and holding onto flesh, and powerful muscles that close the jaws and hold them shut. These jaws can bite down with immense force, by far the strongest bite of any animal. The pressure of the crocodile's bite is more than 5,000 pounds per square inch (30,000 kPa), compared to just 335 pounds per square inch (2,300 kPa) for a rottweiler, 400 pounds per square inch (2,800 kPa) for a large great white shark, 800 pounds per square inch (6,000 kPa) to 1,000 pounds per square inch (7,000 kPa) for a hyena, or 2,000 pounds per square inch (10,000 kPa) for a large alligator[citation needed]. The jaws are opened, however, by a very weak set of muscles. Crocodiles can thus be subdued for study or transport by taping their jaws or holding their jaws shut with large rubber bands cut from automobile inner tubes. They have limited lateral (side-to-side) movement in their neck.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A crocodile is any species belonging to the family Crocodylidae (sometimes classified instead as the subfamily Crocodylinae). The term can also be used more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia: i.e. the true crocodiles, the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae) and the gharials (family Gavialidae), as well as the Crocodylomorpha which includes prehistoric crocodile relatives and ancestors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Member species of the family Crocodylidae are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodiles tend to congregate in freshwater habitats like rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water. They feed mostly on vertebrates like fish, reptiles, and mammals, sometimes on invertebrates like molluscs and crustaceans, depending on species. They first appeared during the Eocene epoch, about 55 million years ago.&lt;br/&gt;The word crocodile comes from the Ancient Greek ?????d???? (crocodilos), &quot;lizard,&quot; used in the phrase ho krokódilos ho potamós, &quot;the lizard of the (Nile) river.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several variant Greek forms of the word attested, including the later form ?????de???? (crocodeilos) found cited in many English reference works. In the Koine Greek of Roman times, crocodilos and crocodeilos would have been pronounced identically, and either or both may be the source of the Latinized form crocodilus used by the ancient Romans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crocodilos/crocodeilos itself is a compound of krokè (&quot;pebbles&quot;), and drilos/dreilos (&quot;worm&quot;). It is ascribed to Herodotus, supposedly to describe the basking habits of the Egyptian crocodile. However the word drilos is only attested as a colloquial term for &quot;penis&quot;. The meaning of krokè is explained as describing the skin texture of lizards (or crocodiles) in most sources,[citation needed] but is alternately claimed to refer to a supposed habit of (lizards or crocodiles) basking on pebbly ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The form crocodrillus is attested in Medieval Latin. It is not clear whether this is a medieval corruption or derives from alternate Greco-Latin forms (late Greek corcodrillos and corcodrillion are attested).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A (further) corrupted form cocodrille is found in Old French and was borrowed into Middle English as cocodril(le). The Modern English form crocodile was adapted directly from the Classical Latin crocodilus in the 16th Century, replacing the earlier form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of -y- in the scientific name Crocodylus (and forms derived from it) is a corruption introduced by Laurenti (1768).&lt;br/&gt;Crocodiles are similar to alligators and caiman; for their common biology and differences between them, see Crocodilia. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Crocodiles, like dinosaurs, have the abdominal ribs modified into gastralia.Crocodiles are among the more biologically complex reptiles despite their prehistoric look. Unlike other reptiles, they have a cerebral cortex; a four-chambered heart; and the functional equivalent of a diaphragm, by incorporating muscles used for aquatic locomotion into respiration (e.g. M. diaphragmaticus);[6] Their external morphology on the other hand is a sign of their aquatic and predatory lifestyle. A crocodile’s physical traits allow it to be a successful predator. They have a streamlined body that enables them to swim swiftly. Crocodiles also tuck their feet to their sides while swimming, which makes them faster by decreasing water resistance. They have webbed feet which, although not used to propel the animal through the water, allow it to make fast turns and sudden moves in the water or initiate swimming. Webbed feet are an advantage in shallower water where the animals sometimes move around by walking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crocodiles have a palatal flap, a rigid tissue at the back of the mouth that blocks the entry of water. The palate has a special path from the nostril to the glottis that bypasses the mouth. The nostrils are closed during submergence. Like other archosaurs, crocodilians are diapsid, although their post-temporal fenestrae are reduced. The walls of the braincase are bony but they lack supratemporal and postfrontal bones.Their tongues are not free but held in place by a membrane which limits movement; as a result, crocodiles are unable to stick out their tongues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crocodilian scales have pores that are believed to be sensory, analogous to the lateral line in fishes. They are particularly seen on their upper and lower jaws. Another possibility is that they are secretory, as they produce an oily substance that appears to flush mud off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crocodiles are very fast over short distances, even out of water. Since crocodiles feed by grabbing and holding onto their prey, they have evolved sharp teeth for tearing and holding onto flesh, and powerful muscles that close the jaws and hold them shut. These jaws can bite down with immense force, by far the strongest bite of any animal. The pressure of the crocodile's bite is more than 5,000 pounds per square inch (30,000 kPa), compared to just 335 pounds per square inch (2,300 kPa) for a rottweiler, 400 pounds per square inch (2,800 kPa) for a large great white shark, 800 pounds per square inch (6,000 kPa) to 1,000 pounds per square inch (7,000 kPa) for a hyena, or 2,000 pounds per square inch (10,000 kPa) for a large alligator[citation needed]. The jaws are opened, however, by a very weak set of muscles. Crocodiles can thus be subdued for study or transport by taping their jaws or holding their jaws shut with large rubber bands cut from automobile inner tubes. They have limited lateral (side-to-side) movement in their neck.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’ve been monitoring the area for newly published caches for quite some time.  The results of these alerts have left me thinking that I might need to come up early to MOGA to get some back road caching done.  Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Size: The largest lizard is the Komodo monitor. It can grow longer than a person. The smallest lizard is a tiny gecko.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characteristics: Most lizards have dry, scaly skin. They have four legs, clawed feet, and a long tail. You can see their outside ear opening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards have a weak tail. A small bump or tug will break it off. This will puzzle the enemy. The lizard can get away. Not all lizards have weak tails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizard tails help in balance and movement. Fat is stored in the tail. Losing the tail can be a big problem. Some lizards can grow a new tail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Food: Some lizards eat bugs and spiders. Others eat plants, small animals, or even other lizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most lizards use their eyes to look for food. Some use their sense of smell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards have jaws with teeth. They also have teeth on the roof of their mouth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Habitat: Lizards live in deserts, forests, prairies, marshes, and rocky areas. Most lizards live on the ground or in trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards are fun and easy to watch. They are most active on warm, summer days. On very hot days, some lizards hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most lizards sleep through the winter. On warm days, they sometimes come out to eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Locomotion: Most lizards can run, climb, and cling. A few can swim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People often see lizards dart over logs and rocks. They run quickly across the ground. However, some lizards have small, weak legs. These lizards move slowly.&lt;br/&gt;Reproduction: Most lizards put their eggs in a nest. Other lizards have live babies. The mother lizards do not care for their babies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies: The lizard has many enemies. Some lizards are eaten by birds. They are also eaten by animals, snakes, and other lizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defenses: Some lizards break off their tails to escape enemies. Other lizards may swell up, hiss, or move their tail or body to scare an enemy. Some lizards can change colors to hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few lizards are dangerous. But, be careful of lizards. Many lizards bite or have sharp spines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other Threats: Human are a probem for lizards. Some people eat lizards or lizard eggs. In the past, people killed lizards and sold their skin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lizard's habitat is sometimes destroyed by people building towns or farms.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

It was great to bounce into the cache owner at MOGA and thank them for all of their great caches out here.  I’ve done quite a few before on a previous trip, but even with this effort, I’m still going to have quite a few to mop up.  I’ll likely never get them all!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Darwin Hybrid Tulips are known for the HUGE size of their brilliantly coloured flowers. The blossoms are an almost perfect pyramid shaped when closed, but they can measure as much as 6&quot; (15 cm) in diameter when fully opened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most people think (or like to think) that tulips are perennials.  In reality, many groups of tulips behave more like an annual rather than a perennial.  Some groups of tulips perennialize or come back each year with the same colorful blooms.  However, certain groups are considered annuals; they are spectacular in bloom the first year after planting but the following year's display is rather disappointing.  Because of this, these are generally treated as annuals, especially in places like public gardens where spring displays are the focal point.  These tulips are usually pulled up after bloom and replaced with summer-blooming flowers.  In the home garden, one has a tendency to accept them as they grow over the years, despite the color changes and lack of bold display.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If one prefers tulips that tend to perennialize and bloom consistently the same each year, plant species tulips.  These include the botanical, kaufmanniana, fosteriana, and greigii groups of tulips.  Those most likely to re-flower each year include the Darwin hybrids, lily-flowered, some fringed, and some single late tulips.  The rest of the tulip types tend to be considered annuals and are planted yearly.  In the fall, when considering varieties that will be reliable and will last in the garden, look for the word &quot;perennialize&quot; in the description in order to plant those that come back consistently.  Otherwise, enjoy the magnificent display of the other groups of tulips and plant them each fall!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A crocodile is any species belonging to the family Crocodylidae (sometimes classified instead as the subfamily Crocodylinae). The term can also be used more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia: i.e. the true crocodiles, the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae) and the gharials (family Gavialidae), as well as the Crocodylomorpha which includes prehistoric crocodile relatives and ancestors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Member species of the family Crocodylidae are large aquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. Crocodiles tend to congregate in freshwater habitats like rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water. They feed mostly on vertebrates like fish, reptiles, and mammals, sometimes on invertebrates like molluscs and crustaceans, depending on species. They first appeared during the Eocene epoch, about 55 million years ago.&lt;br/&gt;The word crocodile comes from the Ancient Greek ?????d???? (crocodilos), &quot;lizard,&quot; used in the phrase ho krokódilos ho potamós, &quot;the lizard of the (Nile) river.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several variant Greek forms of the word attested, including the later form ?????de???? (crocodeilos) found cited in many English reference works. In the Koine Greek of Roman times, crocodilos and crocodeilos would have been pronounced identically, and either or both may be the source of the Latinized form crocodilus used by the ancient Romans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crocodilos/crocodeilos itself is a compound of krokè (&quot;pebbles&quot;), and drilos/dreilos (&quot;worm&quot;). It is ascribed to Herodotus, supposedly to describe the basking habits of the Egyptian crocodile. However the word drilos is only attested as a colloquial term for &quot;penis&quot;. The meaning of krokè is explained as describing the skin texture of lizards (or crocodiles) in most sources,[citation needed] but is alternately claimed to refer to a supposed habit of (lizards or crocodiles) basking on pebbly ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The form crocodrillus is attested in Medieval Latin. It is not clear whether this is a medieval corruption or derives from alternate Greco-Latin forms (late Greek corcodrillos and corcodrillion are attested).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A (further) corrupted form cocodrille is found in Old French and was borrowed into Middle English as cocodril(le). The Modern English form crocodile was adapted directly from the Classical Latin crocodilus in the 16th Century, replacing the earlier form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of -y- in the scientific name Crocodylus (and forms derived from it) is a corruption introduced by Laurenti (1768).&lt;br/&gt;Crocodiles are similar to alligators and caiman; for their common biology and differences between them, see Crocodilia. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Crocodiles, like dinosaurs, have the abdominal ribs modified into gastralia.Crocodiles are among the more biologically complex reptiles despite their prehistoric look. Unlike other reptiles, they have a cerebral cortex; a four-chambered heart; and the functional equivalent of a diaphragm, by incorporating muscles used for aquatic locomotion into respiration (e.g. M. diaphragmaticus);[6] Their external morphology on the other hand is a sign of their aquatic and predatory lifestyle. A crocodile’s physical traits allow it to be a successful predator. They have a streamlined body that enables them to swim swiftly. Crocodiles also tuck their feet to their sides while swimming, which makes them faster by decreasing water resistance. They have webbed feet which, although not used to propel the animal through the water, allow it to make fast turns and sudden moves in the water or initiate swimming. Webbed feet are an advantage in shallower water where the animals sometimes move around by walking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crocodiles have a palatal flap, a rigid tissue at the back of the mouth that blocks the entry of water. The palate has a special path from the nostril to the glottis that bypasses the mouth. The nostrils are closed during submergence. Like other archosaurs, crocodilians are diapsid, although their post-temporal fenestrae are reduced. The walls of the braincase are bony but they lack supratemporal and postfrontal bones.Their tongues are not free but held in place by a membrane which limits movement; as a result, crocodiles are unable to stick out their tongues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crocodilian scales have pores that are believed to be sensory, analogous to the lateral line in fishes. They are particularly seen on their upper and lower jaws. Another possibility is that they are secretory, as they produce an oily substance that appears to flush mud off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crocodiles are very fast over short distances, even out of water. Since crocodiles feed by grabbing and holding onto their prey, they have evolved sharp teeth for tearing and holding onto flesh, and powerful muscles that close the jaws and hold them shut. These jaws can bite down with immense force, by far the strongest bite of any animal. The pressure of the crocodile's bite is more than 5,000 pounds per square inch (30,000 kPa), compared to just 335 pounds per square inch (2,300 kPa) for a rottweiler, 400 pounds per square inch (2,800 kPa) for a large great white shark, 800 pounds per square inch (6,000 kPa) to 1,000 pounds per square inch (7,000 kPa) for a hyena, or 2,000 pounds per square inch (10,000 kPa) for a large alligator[citation needed]. The jaws are opened, however, by a very weak set of muscles. Crocodiles can thus be subdued for study or transport by taping their jaws or holding their jaws shut with large rubber bands cut from automobile inner tubes. They have limited lateral (side-to-side) movement in their neck.</groundspeak:long_description>

The results of these alerts have left me thinking that I might need to come up early to MOGA to get some back road caching done.  Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Size: The largest lizard is the Komodo monitor. It can grow longer than a person. The smallest lizard is a tiny gecko.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characteristics: Most lizards have dry, scaly skin. They have four legs, clawed feet, and a long tail. You can see their outside ear opening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards have a weak tail. A small bump or tug will break it off. This will puzzle the enemy. The lizard can get away. Not all lizards have weak tails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizard tails help in balance and movement. Fat is stored in the tail. Losing the tail can be a big problem. Some lizards can grow a new tail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Food: Some lizards eat bugs and spiders. Others eat plants, small animals, or even other lizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most lizards use their eyes to look for food. Some use their sense of smell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards have jaws with teeth. They also have teeth on the roof of their mouth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Habitat: Lizards live in deserts, forests, prairies, marshes, and rocky areas. Most lizards live on the ground or in trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards are fun and easy to watch. They are most active on warm, summer days. On very hot days, some lizards hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most lizards sleep through the winter. On warm days, they sometimes come out to eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Locomotion: Most lizards can run, climb, and cling. A few can swim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People often see lizards dart over logs and rocks. They run quickly across the ground. However, some lizards have small, weak legs. These lizards move slowly.&lt;br/&gt;Reproduction: Most lizards put their eggs in a nest. Other lizards have live babies. The mother lizards do not care for their babies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies: The lizard has many enemies. Some lizards are eaten by birds. They are also eaten by animals, snakes, and other lizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defenses: Some lizards break off their tails to escape enemies. Other lizards may swell up, hiss, or move their tail or body to scare an enemy. Some lizards can change colors to hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few lizards are dangerous. But, be careful of lizards. Many lizards bite or have sharp spines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other Threats: Human are a probem for lizards. Some people eat lizards or lizard eggs. In the past, people killed lizards and sold their skin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lizard's habitat is sometimes destroyed by people building towns or farms.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Seahorses are mainly found in shallow tropical and temperate waters throughout the world, and prefer to live in sheltered areas such as seagrass beds, estuaries, coral reefs, or mangroves. In Pacific waters from North America to South America there are approximately four species. In the Atlantic, the H. erectus ranges from Nova Scotia to Uruguay. H. zosterae, known as the dwarf seahorse, is found in the Bahamas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colonies have been found in European waters such as the Thames Estuary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three species live in the Mediterranean Sea: H. guttulatus (the long-snouted seahorse), H. hippocampus (the short-snouted seahorse) and H. fuscus (the sea pony). These species form territories; males stay within 1 square meter (11 sq ft) of their habitat while females range about one hundred times that&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seahorses are named for their equine appearance. Although they are bony fish, they do not have scales but rather thin skin stretched over a series of bony plates, which are arranged in rings throughout their body. Each species has a distinct number of rings. Seahorses swim upright, another characteristic that is not shared by their close pipefish relatives, who swim horizontally. Unusual among fish, seahorses have a flexible, well-defined neck. They also sport a coronet on the head, which is distinct for each individual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Guinness World Records 2009, H. zosterae (the dwarf seahorse) is the slowest moving fish, with a top speed of about 5 feet (150 cm) per hour.[4] They swim very poorly, rapidly fluttering a dorsal fin and using pectoral fins (located behind their eyes) to steer. Seahorses have no caudal fin. Since they are poor swimmers, they are most likely to be found resting with their prehensile tails wound around a stationary object. They have long snouts, which they use to suck up food, and eyes that can move independently of each other (like a chameleon).</groundspeak:long_description>

The results of these alerts have left me thinking that I might need to come up early to MOGA to get some back road caching done.  Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Size: The largest lizard is the Komodo monitor. It can grow longer than a person. The smallest lizard is a tiny gecko.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characteristics: Most lizards have dry, scaly skin. They have four legs, clawed feet, and a long tail. You can see their outside ear opening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards have a weak tail. A small bump or tug will break it off. This will puzzle the enemy. The lizard can get away. Not all lizards have weak tails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizard tails help in balance and movement. Fat is stored in the tail. Losing the tail can be a big problem. Some lizards can grow a new tail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Food: Some lizards eat bugs and spiders. Others eat plants, small animals, or even other lizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most lizards use their eyes to look for food. Some use their sense of smell.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards have jaws with teeth. They also have teeth on the roof of their mouth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Habitat: Lizards live in deserts, forests, prairies, marshes, and rocky areas. Most lizards live on the ground or in trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lizards are fun and easy to watch. They are most active on warm, summer days. On very hot days, some lizards hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most lizards sleep through the winter. On warm days, they sometimes come out to eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Locomotion: Most lizards can run, climb, and cling. A few can swim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People often see lizards dart over logs and rocks. They run quickly across the ground. However, some lizards have small, weak legs. These lizards move slowly.&lt;br/&gt;Reproduction: Most lizards put their eggs in a nest. Other lizards have live babies. The mother lizards do not care for their babies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies: The lizard has many enemies. Some lizards are eaten by birds. They are also eaten by animals, snakes, and other lizards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defenses: Some lizards break off their tails to escape enemies. Other lizards may swell up, hiss, or move their tail or body to scare an enemy. Some lizards can change colors to hide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few lizards are dangerous. But, be careful of lizards. Many lizards bite or have sharp spines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other Threats: Human are a probem for lizards. Some people eat lizards or lizard eggs. In the past, people killed lizards and sold their skin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lizard's habitat is sometimes destroyed by people building towns or farms.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

It was great to bounce into the cache owner at MOGA and thank them for all of their great caches out here.  I’ve done quite a few before on a previous trip, but even with this effort, I’m still going to have quite a few to mop up.  I’ll likely never get them all!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Crabs are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, and armed with a single pair of chelae (claws). Crabs are found in all of the world's oceans, while many crabs live in fresh water and on land, particularly in tropical regions. Crabs vary in size from the pea crab, a few millimetres wide, to the Japanese spider crab, with a leg span of up to 4 metres (13 ft).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 850 species of crab are freshwater, terrestrial or semi-terrestrial species;they are found throughout the world's tropical and semi-tropical regions. They were previously thought to be a monophyletic group, but are now believed to represent at least two distinct lineages, one in the Old World and one in the New World.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The earliest unambiguous crab fossils date from the Jurassic, although Carboniferous Imocaris, known only from its carapace, may be a primitive crab. The radiation of crabs in the Cretaceous and afterward may be linked either to the break-up of Gondwana or to the concurrent radiation &lt;br/&gt;Crabs typically walk sideways (a behaviour which gives us the word crabwise). This is because of the articulation of the legs which makes a sidelong gait more efficient. However, some crabs walk forwards or backwards, including raninids, Libinia emarginata and Mictyris platycheles. Some crabs, notably the Portunidae and Matutidae, are also capable of swimming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crabs are mostly active animals with complex behaviour patterns. They can communicate by drumming or waving their pincers. Crabs tend to be aggressive towards one another and males often fight to gain access to females. On rocky seashores, where nearly all caves and crevices are occupied, crabs may also fight over hiding holes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crabs are omnivores, feeding primarily on algae, and taking any other food, including molluscs, worms, other crustaceans, fungi, bacteria and detritus, depending on their availability and the crab species. For many crabs, a mixed diet of plant and animal matter results in the fastest growth and greatest fitness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crabs are known to work together to provide food and protection for their family, and during mating season to find a comfortable spot for the female to release her eggs.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’ve been monitoring the area for newly published caches for quite some time.  The results of these alerts have left me thinking that I might need to come up early to MOGA to get some back road caching done.  Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’m logging this cache as a part of a massive 6-day caching adventure, the centerpiece of which was MOGA 2012 at Honey Creek Resort at Lake Rathbun.  I came up to the area early to do some caching and visiting and stayed a while after most everyone went home as well.  The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

It was great to bounce into the cache owner at MOGA and thank them for all of their great caches out here.  I’ve done quite a few before on a previous trip, but even with this effort, I’m still going to have quite a few to mop up.  I’ll likely never get them all!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Seahorses are mainly found in shallow tropical and temperate waters throughout the world, and prefer to live in sheltered areas such as seagrass beds, estuaries, coral reefs, or mangroves. In Pacific waters from North America to South America there are approximately four species. In the Atlantic, the H. erectus ranges from Nova Scotia to Uruguay. H. zosterae, known as the dwarf seahorse, is found in the Bahamas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colonies have been found in European waters such as the Thames Estuary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three species live in the Mediterranean Sea: H. guttulatus (the long-snouted seahorse), H. hippocampus (the short-snouted seahorse) and H. fuscus (the sea pony). These species form territories; males stay within 1 square meter (11 sq ft) of their habitat while females range about one hundred times that&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seahorses are named for their equine appearance. Although they are bony fish, they do not have scales but rather thin skin stretched over a series of bony plates, which are arranged in rings throughout their body. Each species has a distinct number of rings. Seahorses swim upright, another characteristic that is not shared by their close pipefish relatives, who swim horizontally. Unusual among fish, seahorses have a flexible, well-defined neck. They also sport a coronet on the head, which is distinct for each individual.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to Guinness World Records 2009, H. zosterae (the dwarf seahorse) is the slowest moving fish, with a top speed of about 5 feet (150 cm) per hour.[4] They swim very poorly, rapidly fluttering a dorsal fin and using pectoral fins (located behind their eyes) to steer. Seahorses have no caudal fin. Since they are poor swimmers, they are most likely to be found resting with their prehensile tails wound around a stationary object. They have long snouts, which they use to suck up food, and eyes that can move independently of each other (like a chameleon).</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Lobsters are invertebrates with a hard protective exoskeleton. Like most arthropods, lobsters must molt in order to grow, which leaves them vulnerable. During the molting process, several species change color. Lobsters have 10 walking legs; the front three pairs bear claws, the first of which are larger than the others.[4] Although, like most other arthropods, lobsters are largely bilaterally symmetrical, they often possess unequal, specialized claws, like the king crab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lobster anatomy includes the cephalothorax which fuses the head and the thorax, both of which are covered by a chitinous carapace, and the abdomen. The lobster's head bears antennae, antennules, mandibles, the first and second maxillae, and the first, second, and third maxillipeds. Because lobsters live in a murky environment at the bottom of the ocean, they mostly use their antennae as sensors. The lobster eye has a reflective structure above a convex retina. In contrast, most complex eyes use refractive ray concentrators (lenses) and a concave retina.[5] The abdomen includes swimmerets and its tail is composed of uropods and the telson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lobsters, like snails and spiders, have blue blood due to the presence of haemocyanin which contains copper[6] (in contrast, vertebrates and many other animals have red blood from iron-rich haemoglobin). Lobsters possess a green hepatopancreas, called the tomalley by chefs, which functions as the animal's liver and pancreas.[7]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In general, lobsters are 25–50 centimetres (10–20 in) long, and move by slowly walking on the sea floor. However, when they flee, they swim backwards quickly by curling and uncurling their abdomen. A speed of 5 metres per second (11 mph) has been recorded.[8] This is known as the caridoid escape reaction.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’ve been monitoring the area for newly published caches for quite some time.  The results of these alerts have left me thinking that I might need to come up early to MOGA to get some back road caching done.  Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

The earliest known sharks date from more than 420 million years ago.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since that time, sharks have diversified into 440 species, ranging in size from the small dwarf lanternshark, Etmopterus perryi, a deep sea species of only 17 centimetres (6.7 in) in length, to the whale shark, Rhincodon typus, the largest fish, which reaches approximately 12 metres (39 ft) and which feeds only on plankton, squid, and small fish by filter feeding. Sharks are found in all seas and are common down to depths of 2,000 metres (6,600 ft). They generally do not live in freshwater, with a few exceptions such as the bull shark and the river shark which can live both in seawater and freshwater. They breathe through five to seven gill slits. Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites, and improves their fluid dynamics so the shark can move faster. They have several sets of replaceable teeth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well-known species such as the great white shark, tiger shark, blue shark, mako shark, and the hammerhead are apex predators, at the top of the underwater food chain. Their extraordinary skills as predators fascinate and frighten humans, even as their survival is under serious threat from fishing and other human activities.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A tree is a perennial woody plant. It most often has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground on a single main stem or trunk with clear apical dominance. A minimum height specification at maturity is cited by some authors, varying from 3 m to 6 m. some authors set a minimum of 10 cm trunk diameter (30 cm girth).Woody plants that do not meet these definitions by having multiple stems and/or small size are usually called shrubs, although many trees such as Mallee do not meet such definitions. Compared with most other plants, trees are long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old and growing to up to 115 m (379 ft) high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Trees are an important component of the natural landscape because of their prevention of erosion and the provision of a weather-sheltered ecosystem in and under their foliage. They also play an important role in producing oxygen and reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as well as moderating ground temperatures. They are also elements in landscaping and agriculture, both for their aesthetic appeal and their orchard crops (such as apples). Wood from trees is a building material, as well as a primary energy source in many developing countries. Trees also play a role in many of the world's mythologies (see trees in mythology).</groundspeak:long_description>

Starfish occur across a broad depth range from the intertidal to abyssal depths (&amp;gt;6000 m).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Starfish are among the most familiar of marine animals and possess a number of widely known traits, such as regeneration and feeding on mussels. Starfish possess a wide diversity of body forms and feeding methods. The extent that Asteroidea can regenerate varies with individual species. Broadly speaking, starfish are opportunistic feeders, with several species having specialized feeding behavior, including suspension feeding and specialized predation on specific prey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Asteroidea occupy several important roles throughout ecology and biology. Sea stars, such as the Ochre sea star (Pisaster ochraceus) have become widely known as the example of the keystone species concept in ecology. The tropical Crown of Thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) are voracious predators of coral throughout the Indo-Pacific region. Other starfish, such as members of the Asterinidae, are frequently used in developmental biology.</groundspeak:long_description>

The results of these alerts have left me thinking that I might need to come up early to MOGA to get some back road caching done.  Well, there has been so many caches put out, that I thought I better make a dent in advance of MOGA or I may not be able to find any time to spend at the lake.  

But I needed something else to pull me this direction.  How about Red Darling caches?  Oh, yes.  I’ve been looking forward to taking a few more of those on.  But, I still needed just one more reason that could justify the travel.  How about... Pizza Ranch?

Of course, Pizza Ranch.  I also needed to come to Ottumwa to check out the new Pizza Ranch that just opened on Monday.  I wanted to see what opening weekend would be like and take a run at the area’s newest cuisine.  Take a run I did.  I wasn’t alone, though.  Did the ranch around 2:30 yesterday and there was hardly a chair available.  Even though there was an assault on the Ranch, the staff kept up and the food was really good.  

But that wasn’t the only assault going on.  There was also an assault on... caches!  Rural caches.  Sneaky rural caches.  Caches fortified behind mud. Caches in tough terrain.  Caches buried beneath deep snow drifts.  But those challenges didn’t stop us.  I and my caching team, SBD [Silent But Deadly... Those were our initials, what were we going to do), took out after these caches with great abandon.  We drove with great haste.  We leaped giant chasms.  We dove face deep in freezing snow.  

I know, I know.  You say tripping and falling; I say dove.  Potato Pawtawto, right?

The point is that we went after these caches with abandon and found great success and great fun.  Thanks so much for the placement and for maintaining this cache.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">These tulips have petals which are topped with fringes that look like the frayed edge of a piece of satin fabric. Some garden centres may carry only two or three varieties of Fringed Tulips, but they are gradually becoming more popular, not only because the flowers look so elegant, but also because the blooms are quite long-lasting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most people think (or like to think) that tulips are perennials.  In reality, many groups of tulips behave more like an annual rather than a perennial.  Some groups of tulips perennialize or come back each year with the same colorful blooms.  However, certain groups are considered annuals; they are spectacular in bloom the first year after planting but the following year's display is rather disappointing.  Because of this, these are generally treated as annuals, especially in places like public gardens where spring displays are the focal point.  These tulips are usually pulled up after bloom and replaced with summer-blooming flowers.  In the home garden, one has a tendency to accept them as they grow over the years, despite the color changes and lack of bold display.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If one prefers tulips that tend to perennialize and bloom consistently the same each year, plant species tulips.  These include the botanical, kaufmanniana, fosteriana, and greigii groups of tulips.  Those most likely to re-flower each year include the Darwin hybrids, lily-flowered, some fringed, and some single late tulips.  The rest of the tulip types tend to be considered annuals and are planted yearly.  In the fall, when considering varieties that will be reliable and will last in the garden, look for the word &quot;perennialize&quot; in the description in order to plant those that come back consistently.  Otherwise, enjoy the magnificent display of the other groups of tulips and plant them each fall!</groundspeak:long_description>

The event really was great and nearly every cache we got along the way was as well.  The “we” in this case would be too many cachers to enumerate by name.  Some caches I got solo, but most were with groups.  One morning I was with the SCC (Sunday caching crew), that afternoon I was with the JC (Juggalo crew) and the next morning the RCC (Redemption caching crew – they just didn’t get many the previous day and wanted to redeem themselves).  You get the picture.  It was a whirlwind of frenzied caching activity with many great stories and adventures along the way.  I picked up a lot of caches I had not done before.  I also went down roads to visit caches a second or third time while friends made their first grabs.  Funny how this game will take you to the same spot multiple times sometimes.  This cache added to the fun and I greatly appreciate the work in putting it out and maintaining it.

It was great to bounce into the cache owner at MOGA and thank them for all of their great caches out here.  I’ve done quite a few before on a previous trip, but even with this effort, I’m still going to have quite a few to mop up.  I’ll likely never get them all!</groundspeak:text>

This food family includes Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts (filberts), macadamia nuts, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios and walnuts. It would be difficult to overestimate the potential health benefits associated with this food family. Walnuts not only taste great but are a rich source of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and an excellent source of those hard to find omega-3 fatty acids. Like most nuts, they can easily be added to your Healthiest Way of Eating.</groundspeak:long_description>

Its ears are wrapped in tightly bound lime hued husks with silks and a tassel that extend out from the tip. The yellow kernels are packed in tight almost uniform rows. A single ear of corn can contain up to 400 kernels. Freshly harvested yellow corn at its peak ripeness is sweet, offering flavors of almond and sugar, the kernels so succulent, the skin pops as you bite into it. As the corn matures, the kernels lose their milky consistency giving way to a starchy and doughy consistency. At this point, the corn is considered a grain crop and is best suited for processing or feedstock.</groundspeak:long_description>

An extremely ripe peach that is at room temperature will also have a sweet peach smell.</groundspeak:long_description>

In general, the fruit features dark green skin, crispy moisture rich flesh, and small edible seeds concentrated at its center. Like other squash members, cucumbers are best-harvested young, tender and just short of reaching maturity, at a stage when they taste sweet and have unique flavor.</groundspeak:long_description>

Geocaching&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This geocache is part of a series
placed within the Cannon River valley. Some of these caches were
meant to be accessed by boat (canoe, kayak, innertube, etc), some
by bicycle, and some by hiking. Look at the ratings and attributes
to determine which equipment you should be using.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache is located along the sandstone palisade on Byllesby
Lake. I highly advise against being in bare feet when snooping
around this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area is ripe for an earthcache or two but since I don't
know the best resource to find this kind of geological information,
you get the next best thing.. an old fashioned smiley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IF YOU SEEK THIS GEOCACHE, PLEASE BE
COGNIZANT OF MUGGLES, RIVER CURRENTS, AND WATER LEVELS. Rehide the
geocache in such a way to preserve it from all of these
risks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">My second trip to The Descent, one time over the waves, once over the ice. I have invested so must time an effort into this one that I am going to have to see the movie now. Guessing like in most cases, the geocache is better than the movie.

Visiting this time with caching heros, Trekkin n' birdin. It was fun chatting as we snowshoed out to the caves here. Couldn't believe how beautiful the landscape was. My camera wasn't working too well, but would have never captured the wonder anyways. It's worth the trip however/whenever you can get here.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Found it, 2 of 13, cache 2602 and a FTF!

I noticed this cache a couple days ago as I was looking at the &quot;newest in MN&quot;. These are the kind of caches I love. Loaded up the canoe (almost forgot the paddle) and headed out early this morning. The lake was weather was terrific and the lake beautiful and calm. There only sound was a trio of chainsaw cleaning up the drift wood on the shore.

Made my way to GZ and began to wonder. I spent some time circling to no avail. It took me a few moments to get the &quot;Shrinky Dinks&quot; idea out of my mind. After considering the cache page abit I decided to look somewhere else. Poked my nose in a few places until I saw something worth investigating. WooHoo! Found it.

What a thrill for me. An early morning paddle, far from home, a geocache and a FTF. Not bad. I spent some time here, STL and dropping in a TB along with some &quot;Wear It' PFD stickers. Wanting to share my find with someone, I sent a photo and text to the cache owner. I really appreciate these kind of caches and the effort that goes into hidding them. Thanks again. Replaced it as I found it.

Thanks for the adventure,

Kurt</groundspeak:text>

of two stages. Proceed to the listed coordinates to locate ten
unique gemstones. Once you find the gemstones, arrange them in the
proper sequence in order to locate the final pot-o-gold.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The final pot-o-gold can be found

&lt;p&gt;It is much easier to bring
yourself a pencil and sheet of paper than it is to try and rehide
the gemstones. But if you do happen to collect them, please note
exactly where you found them and put them back where they belong.
If you fail to properly stow the gemstones in their places, the
child catcher will be summoned to come take away your
young.&lt;/p&gt;

I met a gentleman while I was on the way to stage 2 who asked me if I was geocaching. He had a brown and white long-haired dog, and said that he helped place the caches here when they were set up. I was in a hurry because I suspected it might rain, so I left without even getting his name. Great hide here! TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Geocaching&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This geocache is part of a series
placed within the Cannon River valley. Some of these caches were
meant to be accessed by boat (canoe, kayak, innertube, etc), some
by bicycle, and some by hiking. Look at the ratings and attributes
to determine which equipment you should be using.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cache is located near the Cannon Valley
Trail. From April 1st though November 1st, there is a $3/day
or $20/year pass required for adults biking or rollerblading on the
trail. If you cross country ski on this trail when snow is on the
ground, The Great Minnesota Ski Pass is required. Otherwise it's
free to be on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In order to protect the resources of the Cannon Valley Trail,
and to ensure its safe use, users are required to follow the Trail
ordinance:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;No pets allowed, including those in baskets and/or
trailers&lt;br /&gt;
No motorized vehicles, including snowmobiles&lt;br /&gt;
No horses&lt;br /&gt;
No alcoholic beverages&lt;br /&gt;
Fires only in designated areas&lt;br /&gt;
No hunting&lt;br /&gt;
No weapons (including bows) unless unloaded and cased&lt;br /&gt;
Do not disturb any plant, flower, wildlife or other natural or
cultural resource.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ordinance applies to all Trail lands, usually 50 feet each
side of the trail centerline. Other regulations may apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remember to practice Trail etiquette and share the
trail:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Watch for and obey all signs&lt;br /&gt;
Look both ways at road crossings&lt;br /&gt;
Be in control of your bicycle at all times&lt;br /&gt;
Watch for hazards on or near the trail&lt;br /&gt;
Use the right hand side of the trail&lt;br /&gt;
Announce your presence when passing&lt;br /&gt;
Wear a helmet&lt;/blockquote&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;Located in the upper end of
Miesville Ravine Park. This area really is undiscovered and has
some very cool features.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;This geological feature MUST be added to your list while in the
area. When I first discovered this spot, I could hear voices inside
my head that kept whispering &quot;plant cache, plant cache, plant
cache&quot;. So, out of obligation to whatever geocaching spirits have
possessed my brain, I stopped the vehicle and immediately found the
best hiding spot I could muster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are searching for a standard sized container and should find
it with a fair amount of work. I stuffed it with a few things I had
remaining in the back of the truck at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though there is little chance that someone will
accidentially stumble upon this cache, please place the cache and
its cover materials EXACTLY the way you found it or better. The
cache should not be exposed at all by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This geocache was NOT meant to be too easy so if you're a whiner
or have physical limitations, you might want to pass on making the
find.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is hidden in the park which is near the location of the
old asylum.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
Hastings State Hospital was established by an act of the
legislature as the Second State Asylum for the Insane. The site of
Hastings, Minnesota was chosen. At its opening in 1900, it served
as a transfer asylum, admitting patients from other state
hospitals. It did not admit women until 1944 except for four years
staring in 1905. The hospital's name was changed to Hastings State
Asylum in 1919 and to Hastings State Hospital in 1937. Hastings
State Hospital was closed on May 1st, 1978. All patients were
either transferred or discharged to homes or other state hospitals
or facilities. The second state veterans home was established on
the site of the hospital.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Hastings State Hospital was the first in the state to discontinue
use of physical restraints for mentally ill patients, to implement
regional coordination, and to open a regional service for drug
dependency. It was also one of the leading hospitals in terms of
developing partial hospitalization, adolescent treatment services,
and education programs. At its closing, it was also one of the
first hospitals to offer benefits for its' workers. All employees
were offered employment in the Department of Public Welfare or
other state agencies with no loss of salary or benefits. Hastings
State Hospital was one of the two original state asylums in
Minnesota. Its architectural organization was according to the
cottage plan, which allowed for a cozier, more &quot;home-like&quot;
atmosphere for the patients. Many of these buildings are examples
of the Tudor Revival style and are more ornate than the plain brick
buildings at Anoka.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Believe it or not Hastings was the birthplace of
Gumby!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There was a plant next to the Smead plant called Echo Plastics that
mass produced them.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, Gumby wasn't the crusty New York comic portrayed on the
early &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; He was a Minnesotan, mass-produced in
Hastings until about 1971. And so was Pokey, his pony. The &quot;action
figure&quot; of Arthur Clokey's green clay boy was co-created in the
early 1960s by Roger Moseman, who made the injection mold at the
request of his boss, Murray Laub, owner of Echo Plastics in
Hastings. Laub, a self-described &quot;terrible artist,&quot; drew a stick
figure for Moseman, who took it from there to mold millions of
plastic Gumby and Pokey toys for fans of the animated-clay TV
show.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Long sleeves a must! Thorns, brush and Skeeters. This one is on a fenced County park property. You will have to cross a fence, and parking is available by the Port-a-potty. Property to the west is private and there is also a fence there. Do not cross the western fence with the white 'do not trespass' signs on the western perimeter.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache contains some garbage bags, please consider choosing to 'Cache in Trash out' as there is some trash in the area.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This cache is located in the 'Washington County Park' fenced in space. You can only see the sign on the corner of Grey cloud island drive and Grey cloud island trail. You will have to cross a fence while tracking this cache.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The long grass has many deer beds, and occasional outcrops of 4 foot tall brush and thorny areas. This park gets little usage due to its poor marking and small size, and relative isolation on Grey Cloud island. It is however a nice short hike you may enjoy. The isolation has left this small park space in a primitive state which some will find appealing.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Our GPS accuracy is +/- 30 feet from GZ. Plan on searching a 30 foot radius. It is a larger cache and should be easy to find. After wards relax and have a cold one (BYO and then CITO) as long as it is NA. (Alcohol is prohibited in Washington County Parks!)</groundspeak:long_description>

It is preferred that you check in at the Eagle Lodge Conference Center, but you don’t have to. If you do stop at the conference center, you can get a grounds map.  For this cache it is best to park in the hotel parking. You can then walk the gravel road towards the cabins and hop onto the cottage loop. The cache will be just off trail. Use the hint to help pinpoint it.  It will be in a medium sized container and when started, has been filled with lots of cool trinkets. If you have time, consider renting a Frisbee and getting in a game of disc golf, or sticking around for dinner at Pine Lodge.  This is a beautiful setting with lots to see and do!</groundspeak:long_description>

This one is located near a soccer field he used to play on. The cache is located just a few yards off a paved walking trail/sidewalk. Wild mint (Mentha sp. ~thanks beans72!) is present in the area, and you may notice the smell of it as you search.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I see a few log entries stating something about taking the &quot;long way&quot; and parking on residential property. Please keep in mind that if you drove here, you can park in the Mariner Mall lot and follow a paved sidewalk almost right to the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one is kid friendly ~there is a school with a playground nearby!.&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

The winter is getting pretty long so I thought I'd continue placing winter friendly caches to help make spring get here faster. It'll be a fun summer cache too, but it should make for a fun diversion from the winter blahs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bring your own writing stick and enjoy!</groundspeak:long_description>

The terrain is a bit steep at first and by the ravine, so you'll need to take your time getting to this one. The cache fits in its location perfectly so watch how you get it out so you can get it back in. We started it off with some swag and a dollar for FTF.</groundspeak:long_description>

The field has changed a lot and I was sad to see that the baseball field is all but gone. There is a trail through here with a tunnel and a great field to let the dog run in so take some time and pack a lunch for a relaxing break.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is excellent satellite signal until you get close so let me know how close your reading is to mine. To start it out there are a couple of swag items and a log &amp; pencil.</groundspeak:long_description>

You can park at the public ice rink and walk in from there. The gate is usually open on the road.

The area has grown in quite a bit over the past 30 years and the rock that used to be clearly visible from the train tracks is now a hidden fortress in the woods. We had a lot of fun playing on this rock and sitting on it while looking down on the city. There is an area to climb under and it was a lot smaller back then. We used to have to crawl in but now my daughter was able to climb in with no effort at all. The kids will especially enjoy this one. Have fun!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To start it out there several swag items, a log and a pencil. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The area needed another cache or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a NorWest Ontario Geocachers iron on patch for the first to find. There is also a couple of small containers included for someone to start out some caches of their own. I have no idea how this stand of Norway Pine came to be in this area but I'm sure someone does. Please take the time to read the history info in the nearby parking area, and if you think of it, bring along some bird feed to place in the many feeders that you will find along the way. A lot of these feeders were placed by young students as a school project.&lt;br/&gt;This nature trail is packed gravel in very good condition and can be accessed with a wheel chair but the last 50 feet or so is light bushwacking so some assistance would be required at that point.&lt;br/&gt;Enjoy the trail and the hunt.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I thought that we could use a few micro's around the city that could be found while out walking, biking or driving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is yet another located just off the city's walking trail which is actually a part of the street in this area. There is a nearby parking lot. You are looking for a camo'd weatherproof match container with a screw on top. The cache has just enough room for a log and small pencil but it would be a good idea to bring your own writing stick just in case. A dollar for the FTF is also included. Enjoy the scenery and always be alert for possible muggles.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is located in another of the city's old park areas. The area to the west has a great sliding hill for sleds in the winter and bike climbing in the summer. To the east are some swings, flag football field and an outdoor skating rink/skateboard area and change room. This area was repaired and repainted thanks to the generosity of Chris Pronger who was playing for the St. Louis Blues at the time. It has since been repainted again to reflect the Philadelphia Flyers colors. Chris, along with countless others have spent many hours playing shinny on this rink over the years.&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a small camo'd waterproof match container that has a log book and pencil in it. A dollar for the FTF is also included. Bring your own writing stick just in case and be alert for muggles. Enjoy the area where I grew up.&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Team Ffej for the FTF!!!</groundspeak:long_description>

You must have your own writing stick. I personally just hate these things myself but since I had a few laying around, I thought I would throw some out there. A pair of tweezers or long fingernails would be handy to have. Enjoy the hunt!!! &lt;br/&gt;Congrats to boyks for the FTF.</groundspeak:long_description>
