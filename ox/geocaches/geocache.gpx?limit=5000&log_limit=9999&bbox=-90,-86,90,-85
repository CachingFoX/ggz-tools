This cache was placed to bring you out to some lesser known parts of Apalachicola.

Have fun finding this one! If you have some time and want a wonderful view of the Apalachicola River where you can drive up to to the water and also see the train's bridge spanning the over the water, continue driving up the road and turn left where you see the blue Boat Ramp sign. Just follow the newly paved road to the end.

Here is some information that was Googled on the internet about the railroad: http://www.trainweb.org/eastrail/apnor.html</groundspeak:long_description>

coordinates will take you to public parking that is near the
location of the cache.
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Congratulation Kennedyblue on your promotion.
You will be missed in Panama City.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 This cache has been named to honor one of America’s great
inventors, Alexander Graham Bell. Some research will be required to
find parts of the coordinates for the location of this cache. The
coordinates are: 30 09.ABC N 085 39.DEF W A. G. Bell was born in
Edinburg, Scotland on March 3, 18A7. He invented the telephone in
187E. He received US Patent # 174,46D for this invention. There is
some mystery over whether or not Bell was the first to invent the
telephone. There are two other men that people claim invented the
telephone. Elisha ______(#1) filed a caveat, incomplete patent
application asking for more time, the same day that Bell filed his
patent. In 2002, the US House recognized ________(#2) Meucci as the
real inventor. He invented a prototype of the telephone almost 20
years before Bell. Research shows that he was too poor to pay for
the patent. Bell has several other inventions and patents. These
include a metal detector, improvements to the telegraph,
photophone, audiometer, a precursor to the iron lung, work on
alternative fuels and aeronautics. To find F, take the first letter
of the missing last name (#1) and add it to the first letter of the
missing first name (#2), (A,B,C=1,2,3 and so on). To find B &amp; C
go to the NE corner of Luverne Ave and 5th St. There is a time
capsule that was placed at this location by the Telephone Pioneers
of America. I have no idea what is in the capsule, and I am
curious. According to the plaque at the site, the capsule will be
opened in 20GH. I guess I will have to wait a little while to find
out. BC=GH +5. It should be a short walk to the cache location from
the time capsule. Good luck!&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: BMY69M - Bells Mystery&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

 This will have muggles around much of the time. But with proper
stealth techniques, you should go undetected. I did in hiding it.
This container is camoflauged and about the size of a film
container. It contains only a log so please bring your own
pen.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You MUST go after dark and have a bright flashlight to find this cache. I would also recommend that you go with a group (at least two). One person to look for the &quot;EYES&quot; that mark the path and the other to watch the path for &quot;critters&quot;. Also the ground is uneven and you should walk with caution. MINIMAL bushwacking is required, no digging is required, although standing water may have to be crossed.

UPDATE 06/26/2010: Went to check on cache and replace any missing &quot;eyes&quot;. The original pathway has brush grown up making this an even more adventurous trip. It hasn't rained much lately and the small lake is practically dry and can be crossed with no wading. Have posted some pics to guide you on this trip but of course you will be taking the trip at night and the pics will not help much.

The above coordinates will take you to the parking area. You will then begin sweeping your flashlight to look for the &quot;bright eyes&quot; that will be looking at you and guide you to the cache. The cache is a plastic camoflauged container that contains some swag, TB and log with pen. Please place it back as you find it. You will pass several sets of eyes along your journey and then you should see four eyes that are guarding the cache. It is about 0.2 mile from the parking and only takes about 5 minutes to walk in the daytime. But, you will be going at night and this should increase the search time. Please post your search time (be honest) as this will be interesting as to how difficult this truly is.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The coordinates listed above will not take you to the cache, but you must answer the questions to gain the correct coordinates of the cache. The cache is located at a small church where my son preaches. Some questions provide two numbers of the missing coordinates. 

This puzzle will require the use of a Bible and/or other reference material to look up the answers unless you are an extremely good Bible student. There will be a few hints below if you feel you need them.
The true coordinates are N30 AA BCC and W085 DD EEF

Question AA Number of generations from Abraham to David plus number of generations from David to the Exile minus number of generations from the Exile to Christ?

Question B Number of fish used to feed the 5,000?

Question CC How old was Moses when he appealed to Pharoah to free the Israelites?

Question DD Number of books in the Old Testament minus the number mentioned most often in Ephesians 4:4-6?

Question EE What verse in Psalms 119 contains the following quote, &quot;I will hasten and not delay to obey your commands&quot;?

Question F How many others were crucified with Jesus?

The fun is in searching the scriptures for the coordinates and then searching the coordinates for the cache. Cache is small so you should bring your own pen to sign log. Also BE CAREFUL when opening container as it is upside down and contents will spill.

You can check your answers for this puzzle on Geochecker.com.
</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>AA is Matthew 1:17
B is Mark 6: 38-44
CC is Exodus 7:7
DD no hint necessary

park has grown to include many new businesses, a few new caches and
now this new series of walking trails and park. You need to come
enjoy its beauty, take a walk in the woodlands and write your
experience in the online log.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; There are many trails through out this new park and
Osprey trail begins near the Visitor Center and proceeds northward
along the western boundary. Although this trail indicates that
bicycles are allowed I recommend that you have the proper tires as
the road/trail is sandy in spots. The Whitetail Trail is the third
trail you come to that will take you through the wetlands and pine
plantations back to eastern boundary. Another nice boardwalk that
crosses the wetlands.&lt;br/&gt;

Road (US 98).&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This cache is located about one mile north of the
Visitor Center at the junction of another trail. The trail is a
road but no motorized vehicles are allowed. While it is sandy in
spots I was able to ride my bicycle the entire distance to cache
location. You may want to linger at the cache location to learn
more about the trails and wildlife in this park. But do not sit for
long as others may want to use your spot.&lt;br/&gt;

There are two main trails that leave the Visitor

a trail on the western and another on the eastern border of the

recommend that you have the proper tires as the road/trail is sandy

&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in about the center of the
park trails. So there will be several approaches to this cache.
Maybe the map above will help you to decide which trail is
best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several types of wild animals in this
park of which wild hogs are one. Approach this cache container with
caution as you never know what could be in those bushes.&lt;/p&gt;

I recently made a camping/geocaching trip out of town and was
pleased to see this sign on my return and wanted to place a cache
here for all of us weary cachers that just have to stop for one
more find. There is also a benchmark nearby that you will want to
log as well. The container is a camoflauged small container that
has some swag and could hold small TB or coins. Although this is on
a remote section of this highway there is a house next door that
may contain muggles at times so care should be taken. Also note the
sign that indicates that you are under video
surveillance. So I guess muggles could be a problem.&lt;br/&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I grew up coming to this landing to fish with my dad and grandpa and never knew of the history here. It was only discovered while trying to &quot;google&quot; the park and see if there were any new rules for a camping trip my brother and I were planning. We thought it would be nice to share this piece of history.

One of the most significant incidents of the First Seminole War took place on March 13, 1818, just 12 miles by road from downtown Two Egg, Florida. Ekanachatte (&quot;Red Ground&quot;) was an noted Lower Creek village that stood at the site of Neal's Landing Park. The park, located off State Highway 2 where it intersects with the Chattahoochee River and the Georgia line, occupies a location rich in local history. In addition to the Indian village, it was also the site of a British camp during the American Revolution and later of a major steamboat landing that operated in the 19th and 20th centuries. When the First Seminole War erupted in 1817, Ekanachatte was a prominent and prosperous town. Led by the powerful chief Econchattimico (&quot;Red Ground King&quot;), the village had received a huge influx of refugees who left their homes in central Alabama fleeing the devastation of the Creek War of 1813-1814. Most of these individuals were fiercely anti-American, due to the losses they had suffered at the hands of the American armies that advanced through their nation. As a result and also because Econchattimico and his sub-chiefs feared the U.S. Armies might turn south, Ekanachatte was among the villages that formed an alliance with the British when they arrived on the Apalachicola River during the summer of 1814. The War of 1812 was then raging and the British were preparing for new campaigns in the South. They hoped that the thousands of Indian allies they recruited could be used as an irregular force to assist in subduing Georgia and the Mississippi Territory. The stunning American victory at the Battle of New Orleans stalled these plans, however, and the War of 1812 ended before the Indian forces could take part in major fighting. The British withdrew from the Apalachicola and the Creeks and Seminoles were left on their own. In November of 1817, however, U.S. troops from Fort Scott in today's Decatur County, Georgia, attacked the Lower Creek village of Fowltown. The attack was largely unprovoked and led to a massive uprising by the chiefs and warriors of the Creek and Seminole villages scattered across North Florida, Southwest Georgia and Southeast Alabama. Econchattimico and his warriors joined the war against the whites, taking part in the Battle of Ocheesee on the Apalachicola River on December 15-20, 1817. A dramatic drop of temperatures took place about that time, however, as one of the coldest winters in recorded history settled on the Two Egg area. The volcano Tambora in Indonesia had erupted the previous year, sending so much ash into the atmosphere that it temporarily changed the climate of much of the world. Snow was reported in New England in July and across Florida that winter, ice and snow were common. Running streams froze over and humans and animals alike suffered. Knowing that the Indians were huddled around fires in their villages, General Andrew Jackson took advantage of the severe weather to march an army south to the frontier. Thousands of troops were called to duty, among them 1,500 Creek Indians. Led by Brigadier General William McIntosh, the war chief of Coweta, these warriors had sided with U.S. forces during the earlier Creek War and agreed once again to fight against their relatives and tribesmen. Leaving Fort Mitchell, Alabama, in early March of 1818, McIntosh and his warriors started down the Chattahoochee. A sub-chief named Major Lovett was sent with 600 of these to scour the east bank of the river, while the main force moved down the west side of the Chattahoochee under McIntosh himself. Their objective was Econchattimico and his village near Two Egg. Conditions during the march were horrible. A heavy snow fell during early March of 1818 and the men had to break up ice in ponds and creeks in order to wade across. Despite such conditions, however, they continued forward. As he neared the Florida line, McIntosh left the main trail to prevent Econchattimico's scouts from detecting his approach. The plan succeeded. As the Creek force neared Ekanachatte on the night of March 12, 1818, none of Econchattimico's warriors knew they were coming. Swinging around the head of Irwin's Mill Creek and crossing into Florida, McIntosh spread his warriors into battle formation and attacked the village on the morning of March 13, 1818. The residents of Ekanachatte were taken completely by surprise. What feeble resistance they could offer was quickly snuffed out and McIntosh's warriors rounded up 53 captured men and 130 women and children. In the midst of the post-battle confusion, 20 of the captured warriors suddenly made a break for freedom. They were shot down by their captors.Econchattimico was not among them. Prisoners told McIntosh that he had left a day or two earlier with 30 warriors to round up a herd of cattle that was hidden along the upper Chipola River. Leaving one group of men to gather supplies and other booty, the general turned west on the old Pensacola-St. Augustine Road (which ran roughly parallel to today's State Highway 2) with the rest of his force. They caught up with the chief somewhere west of Malone and captured the herd of cattle in a second brief skirmish. Econchattimico and most of his warriors, however, escaped. Turning back to Ekanachatte, McIntosh had the houses, corncribs, council house and other structures of the village burned to the ground. He then proceeded on to Fort Scott with the surviving male prisoners, while the women and children were sent to the Creek villages up the Chattahoochee River. No marker or monument points out the site of Ekanachatte today, but the Chattahoochee River still flows past the site just as it did more than 190 years ago.

Only available during daylight hours 7 days a week. No night-time caching permitted. Parking on site. Not handicapped accessible due to gravel drive and placement. Peak muggle times 11a-1:30p Thur-Sat. 

No need to stray from normal public areas. Placed with permission of property owner. Please do not disturb the nearby wagon because it is authentic and therefore very old and fragile. The cache is not placed in that area. </groundspeak:long_description>

The coordinates above will take you to Stage 1. &lt;br/&gt; Stage 1 should take you directly in front of a Benchmark (BT0814) at a historic site. To get the coordinates for Final Satge you will need to gather two bits of information and plug them into the formula below. First, look for the Benchmark in the wall and get the date on the disk. Second, find the historic marker and get the date of construction for the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coordinates for Final Stage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Construction Date) – 1241 = answer1&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Benchmark Date) – 1571 = answer2&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;31° 12.

Located on a boundary of Landmark Park not too far off the nature trail. Placed after a geocaching workshop held by a County Extension Agent. It's just past the beaver pond boardwalk about half-way around the entire trail. We thought this location kind of represented the cache name.

Landmark Park is a 135-acre park built to preserve the natural and cultural heritage of southeast Alabama's Wiregrass Region. Please visit Landmark Park's website for details on hours and admission.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a simple cache with a short walk, very slight elevation
changes, and available only during daylight hours. This cache will
take you to see some old ruins used before technology advancement.
You are looking for a medium sized lock n' lock box. Please make
sure to recover the container since it’s apparent this is a local
social hangout area and forestation is practiced very close by. The
last container was destroyed by a controlled burn, and eventually
this one will be too, but until then, enjoy caching! Park at the
posted parking coords (32 27.439 85 37.380) and follow the arrow,
as it will lead you up the path to your destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;***NOTICE
-- Climbing the lookout tower is NOT allowed -- Grafitti and other
defacing is worthless and so unneccessary -- PLEASE respect the
area, and rehide the cache exactly as you found it, or as it is
described by the owner here -- THANK YOU***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A traditional straight forward 30 cal. ammo box cache located in
a very cool spot with a most amazing view of Lake Martin. You will
be thrilled as you arrive at the Fire Tower coordinates. The area
appears to have been a public park at some point, and there are
picnic tables, an old broken BBQ pit, and a walking trail that will
take you to nearby Sandy Creek Bluff, or even down to beautiful
Lake Martin. We did find one no tresspassing sign at the end of one
of the roads that lead to the site, but there are several ways to
approach the area. This cache can be done by car, boat, 4 wheeler,
or foot. The 4 star terrain rating is the worse case scenario, if
you park at the bottom of the mountain, on the land side, and walk
straight up, but there are logging roads, and service roads that
make it possible to drive to the area, if you have the right
vehicle (we were in a jeep, and someone else came up in a SUV while
we were there). We are starting this one off with a few trinkets, a
log book, and a couple of my copy-coin trackables. So enjoy your
visit!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;***NOTICE
-- Climbing the lookout tower is NOT allowed -- Grafitti and other
defacing is worthless and so unneccessary -- PLEASE respect the
area, and rehide the cache exactly as you found it, or as it is
described by the owner here -- THANK YOU***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

type road. During or just after precipitation will require a
4-wheel drive vehicle to drive to within .2 mile of the cache, but
there is also the option of walking in from about .7 of a mile,
when the roads are the worst.

&lt;p&gt;***UPDATE*** I visited the cache for maintenance today (10-3-08)
and was able to drive my Toyota Rav4 to within 50' of the cache.
I'm not sure this will always be the case, but just informing
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is in a really neat spot that not too many know about
other than the locals. Plan to spend some time and enjoy the
surrounding area. You are once again looking for a 50 cal. ammo box
as I have recovered the original container that was placed here in
2002. It is a straight forward GA hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***NOTE -- I originally posted this cache as being in Georgia,
to discourage you from approaching it from the Alabama side. It can
be done, but you might not like me, or any of my ancestors, if you
do it that way! -- This is a pleasant experience from the GA side,
but a booger from the AL side!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is an excellent opportunity for cache in, trash
out!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Here is a humble offering for those of you who like to discover
geocoins. Are you somehow interested in collecting icons? (The
goofy little pictures that show up on your profile pages?) Then
this is the cache for you.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; You are looking for a treasure chest hidden pirate style at the
above coordinates. PLEASE make sure and rehide exactly as you find
it. The hide is not meant to be so hard to find, but it is rated
3.5 difficulty because I know somewhere along the line there will
be someone who experiences it this way. If you like to discover
geocoins, I am making my collection available to you through this
cache. There is a gift for you inside, but please only take one,
please don't share it with anyone else, and if there is only one
left, please don't take it. There is another alternative, or I will
be glad to take care of you, just let me know. ~ I have also
included something special, with my name on it, for the
FTFer!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I want to dedicate this cache to all the poor players who have
nothing better to do with their time than argue about what I should
or shouldn't do on the forums. Also the ones that feel that they
should make the nasty comments about my fake copies of my geocoins
that I have circulated. It amazes me that so many people have the
mentality that they should decide what is right, and that they have
the right to control everyone else. But take solace in the fact
that you were successful. I have stopped making and releasing them.
You took all the fun out of it for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also dedicate this cache to the player(s) that take all the
geocoins out of my resort hotel and don't leave any to replace, and
say that it is a prison, and that you are rescuing them. You too
are real work of art, but hey, you are in control of me, and I hope
that makes you happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is also dedicated to the relatively local cacher who
takes the &quot;fake&quot; coins and puts them into his own cache, where they
conveniently disappear forever; unless you beat him to it, and get
them back [;D] and just find that they have been defaced with
someones dirty comments on the card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I don't sound bitter, because I'm not. Geocaching is too
great for that. I just wanted to take this opportunity to make fun
of you for a change. I really do get lots of great comments about
the copy coins and have shared my tips with many people who wanted
to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the treasure chest is out there waiting, and there are
many discoveries (PLEASE ONLY DISCOVER THEM) to be made as well as
some trackables to pick up and move. And if YOU ever need my help;
just let me know, because I love to help others get the most fun
out of this great sport!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a tribute to the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, who not
only provide us with so many wonderful nature areas to enjoy, but
also are good friends to us geocachers! We appreciate their
willingness to work with us and allow us to play our games on their
lands.

This cache is an unknown container, with no clues, only
coordinates. It is really my first attempt at an EMC, but we will
have to see if it really qualifies as such. I want to see how this
one goes, and of course, I would like as much feedback as possible
from my geobuddies out there! &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
I really think this one has become a little more difficult in
recent months so I'm bumping up the star levels. It started out as
a clever camo job, but that didn't last. A couple of people had
benefit of finding it while in the wide open, and brightly colored.
So we came up with another camo plan, and the same thing happened
all over again. Both times that I came here to do maintenance, I
found the cache without its clever camos. Here is my third attempt.
I truly hope that there are no DNFs on this one, because that is
not my intention. I just wanted to make a kinda EMC to present a
challenge.

You will understand why this is called the Stone Mountain Annex
when you see it! It is a fairly straight forward cache. But there
are 3 important rules that must be followed on this one. 1 -- Park
at the above coordinates! 2 -- This is a Nature Conservancy
protected area. Please do not alter anything at the site, as there
are endangered plant forms there. (No pets are allowed on this one,
nor motorized vehicles of any kind. Take as many memories as you
like, but leave everything else undisturbed!) 3 -- This cache is
perfectly safe for all members of the family as long as there is
close parental supervision at all times! There is the potential for
great danger here, but any reasonable person can visit this place
in perfect safety. JUST BE SMART!!! You will see many interesting
things in this area. Don't miss these: Something very solid...
(CAN'T MISS IT!) Something very wet... (YOU SHOULD BARELY MISS IT!)
and Something very sticky! (BETTER MISS THIS ONE!)

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Even though you are in the wide open for most of this cache, the rock seems to act as a reflector for the signals, and they bounce around a lot. When you get near the coordinates for the cache, you should be on the Northside of a thicket of bushes and trees, and on the edge of the giant hole. You are looking for a pvc tube about one foot long, and 1.5 inches in diameter. It is hidden vertically in a crevice.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I start my new career as a conductor for Norfolk Southern Railroad next week and Mama reluctantly gave me a kitchen pass so I could work on the Georgia Delorme challenge AND my personal &quot;All Counties Quest&quot;. I had a great time traveling the state and would like to thank all the locals who placed the caches on the route I traveled. BTW, how'd ya'll know I was coming down your road [;)]?? 

Ya'll helped me spend $240 dollars on gas [V], get a twitch in my back from sleeping in the back of my Expedition [|)], and eat more fast food than anybody should eat in two months [xx(]. BUT, in doing so, you also helped me complete 17 Delorme pages [^] and find caches in 47 new counties [:D]!! Thanks for making my &quot;break between careers&quot; more memorable!!

Very unique hide!  Took a few minutes for me to really &quot;see&quot; the cache but when I did it was obvious!  Cache is in excellent shape and ready for new cachers.  This area has got to be the best kept secret.  Very beautiful!!  T-Memories; L-Footsteps; SLTFTH

You are looking for numbers that will lead you to the 30 cal. ammo
can, hidden at the edge of the woods. All you need to do is locate
and identify the 5 Little Noles. There you will find a list of 35
single digit numbers. If you add all of these single digits
together, you will find the value of ABC to use in the following
formulas: N 33 - 16.167 - ABC = North Coords W 85 - 15.690 + ABC =
West Coords Happy Hunting!

you should be able to figure that out.

Park at N 33-16.839 / W 085-05.941 to begin your trek. If you like
history, you will want to visit this cache on Tuesdays or Thursdays
between the hours of 8:30 and 5:00, when you can tour the old
jailhouse built in 1912. It is filled with memorabilia of Heard Co.
history, and is quite interesting. Next, you can make your way
along a little over 1/2 mile of winding path, that runs along side
the Chattahoochee River. The trail is completed, although the area
is a work in progress. You will find the cache and the best view of
the river as you approach the far end of the trail.&lt;br/&gt;

so do I. The purpose of this series is to pay sincere tribute to
this areas Geocaching Hall of Famers.

I've had this idea for a while, and had already made out my short
list of those that I wanted to induct, and the reasons why; but I
also have done some informal surveys, where the participants did
not know that they were being surveyed. And when it comes to the
southside, there is one name that always comes up -- SOLAR! The
word on the street is &quot;this guy doesn't even know how to spell
DNF!&quot; One person said: &quot;there hasn't been a cache hidden that Solar
can't find.&quot; LZ33 lost his GPSr out in the woods; went back and
tried to find it, but couldn't; and Solar heard about the mishap,
then went out and found the thing based on just a phone call!
There's been a time or two when a cache or a stage was missing, and
Solar reported finding it 100-200 feet away; while most of us can't
find something if the coords are 40 feet off! If you look up his
stats, you will find that it says he logged 1174 caches, but you
will also notice that the last one was logged in August of 2005.
For some mysterious reason he no longer logs his finds on the
website. We joking say that it's not about the numbers, but Solar
proves it! There is no telling just how many cache logs he has
actually signed, or how many of them were FTFs. But then super
heroes usually do keep their true identity a secret!!! I am sure
that he wouldn't want the attention, but there are several of us
that think Solar is the best cacher of all time. Thanks for your
friendship, and your contribution to the game!

to the cache so there is no hiking required.

The cache is a pico container that is hidden by its cammo. There is
a very small log (please initial only) and no pen/pencil. Please be
careful to replace the cache just as you find it, so the next
person will have the same geo-experience that you do! Do not share
any giveaways in your log, or in your conversations with other
geocachers. There will be no special hints until there have been a
few finders. Have fun hunting!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is a waterproof pill fob containing only a log. It is an easy
find at a very interesting piece of local history. The neighbors
are accustomed to people stopping to check out the structure, so
when you are searching for the cache, simply do so while walking
around and looking at the building, and pick your moment.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Originally built by
W.E. Johnson in 1940, the Sweet Potato Curing and Storage House,
near Roopville, Georgia, incorporated a slated floor and sub-floor
heating ducts, to regulate airflow, temperature, and humidity to
cure sweet potatoes faster so that they would last through the
winter cold. The storage house with its brightly painted Coca-Cola
advertisements, is still one of the most photographed landmarks in
West Georgia. In the Springtime, the field just North of the
structure is planted with Sunflowers that are used in non-profit
fund raisers in the area.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A local man, along
with Coke officials arranged for the creation of a collectible
bottle honoring the Sweet Potato House. The bottles were sold for
$15.00 each, and all 960 of them were sold out within 35 minutes.
Sales of the bottle helped pay for the restoration project of this
local landmark, which certainly would not have lasted too much
longer as it was.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson’s
Sweet Potato Curing Shed also has another claim to fame in this
part of the state. The site used to be a drop-off point for area
students attending Berry College in Rome, and this resulted in US
27 being named Martha Berry Highway by the Georgia Department Of
Transportation. The locals around these parts just know that the
&quot;potato house&quot; is the coolest landmark for miles around!&lt;/p&gt;

I start my new career as a conductor for Norfolk Southern Railroad next week and Mama reluctantly gave me a kitchen pass so I could work on the Georgia Delorme challenge AND my personal &quot;All Counties Quest&quot;. I had a great time traveling the state and would like to thank all the locals who placed the caches on the route I traveled. BTW, how'd ya'll know I was coming down your road [;)]?? 

Ya'll helped me spend $240 dollars on gas [V], get a twitch in my back from sleeping in the back of my Expedition [|)], and eat more fast food than anybody should eat in two months [xx(]. BUT, in doing so, you also helped me complete 17 Delorme pages [^] and find caches in 47 new counties [:D]!! Thanks for making my &quot;break between careers&quot; more memorable!!

Quick and Easy find! Spotted the building as I was driving south to my last planned cache stop and the building immediately registered as having seen it before.  So I stopped and called the wife and she confirmed a cache would be there and gave me the coords.  Cache is in great shape and ready for the next logger!  T-Memories; L-Footsteps; SLTFTH

Coordinates will take you to possibly the sharpest FIRE/LOOKOUT
TOWER you will EVER see! Follow the directions below to find the
final cache coordinates. Located on Mt. Cheaha, Alabama's highest
elevation, this area is filled with breathtaking views, natural
beauty, and plenty of fresh air! Built by the CCC (Civilian
Conservation Corps) in the 1930's, this park is filled with great
rock work, and the Lookout Tower is as good as it gets! Much of the
time, the tower is open to the public, and you can climb and
observe for yourself. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
To find the final cache, go to the above coords and find the Tower.
In front, there are two signs as you approach the structure: &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Count the letters on the oval sign, and you will get a two digit
number. Multiply that number by 601.375 to find ABCD in the
coordinates below. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Now look to the left at the redwood sign. There is a multi-digit
number there. Add 6147 to this number to find EFGH. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Final Cache Coordinates: N 33-2A.BCD by W085-4EFGH The cache is not
meant to fool YOU, but please replace it carefully and hide it very
well, and make sure that NO ONE sees you remove or replace it. The
hint below is a complete spoiler so don't look unless you want to
know.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
*PLEASE NOTE* There is a $1.00 fee for each person to enter the
park (well worth it just to see the tower!) and the park is only
open during daylight hours.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">It's an election year; the candidates have their short lists; and
so do I. The purpose of this series is to pay sincere tribute to
this areas Geocaching Hall of Famers.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
I've had this idea for a while, and had already made out my short
list of those that I wanted to induct, and the reasons why; but
this one is a bit of a no-brainer... Who is the LEANEST, MEANEST,
CACHING MACHINE, IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA??? There is no doubt about
it; the caching couple from Acworth that is always SMILING! And I
do mean that literally. I've never seen these dear people that they
didn't greet me with a smile, and even talking to them over the
phone, or through e-mail you can feel that they really earn their
name. 
&lt;p&gt;The first time I met these two, they had only been geocaching
for 5 months; but I knew something was up, because they had already
signed over 800 logs at that time! Since that time, they have
visited over 6000 more caches, making them number one in the state
of Georgia! Most of this was done while they were both working full
time; but WATCH OUT because this dynamic duo are retired now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite story that I like to tell on Sam is that we were
geocaching one time, and came up on an awesome waterfall. Being
awestruck at the sight, I said &quot;Sam, isn't that a beautiful
waterfall?&quot; to which he replies without even slowing his pace &quot;I
DIDN'T COME UP HERE TO LOOK AT NO WATERFALL!&quot; -- It's really not
altogether true, and he's not quite that bad, but I will tell you
we've been caching together a few times, and it is a pace that will
wear you out! We've had some great fun out there, and I hope to get
to do it again soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt these people are SICK, and OBSESSED with their
geocaching, but there really is more to the story than that... I
don't know all the details (maybe someone will e-mail me with the
information) but I do remember a story about a geocacher that went
geocaching somewhere in the mountains by himself. When he didn't
show up at home when he was supposed to, his wife made some calls
to other geocachers; and when word got to Sam he dropped what he
was doing and headed for the hills to look for the missing
geocacher. I'm not sure what happened from there, and I think the
cacher was ok anyway, but that's enough of the story to show you
what an asset SIA is to geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">By special permission of Team PEZ, I am starting a series of copy
cat caches. I really enjoyed the catchy name of the Publix Enemy
cache, and so with proper credit given to the originator of said
catchy name, I want to hide microcaches at many of these locations,
for that is where I have been employed for the last 26+ years!

As the first in this copy cat series of caches, this one must be a
little special, because this is the exact location that I work at
most of the time (although I do travel around from time to time).
The coords above will get you to a certain starting point, then you
are on your own, without help from your GPSr. The location is
suggested by the following clue that should be really easy, I
think. But the sport comes in getting in and out, and not being
realized for the geoperson you really are. The micro-cache is the
familiar black magnetic key holder, and that should be a clue in
and of itself. Your clue for the find is: Be careful that Mr.
Whipple does not see you loitering in this place, or ULTRAmately he
might put the squeeze on YOU! ***PLEASE BE CAREFUL TO LEAVE THINGS
AS YOU FOUND THEM SO THAT MR. WHIPPLE WILL NOT FROWN ON OUR PLAYING
OUR GAMES IN HIS PLACE!*** No room for exchanges, just sign the log
book, and return here for the smiley. ***WARNING -- DO NOT DECRYPT
AND READ THE HINT BELOW, UNLESS YOU WANT A FULL DESCRIPTION OF
WHERE TO FIND THE CACHE. I KNOW THIS WILL TAKE ALL THE FUN OUT OF
IT, AND THAT SOME OF YOU WILL MAKE THE MISTAKE OF READING THIS
FIRST, BUT I, FOR ONE, CANNOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF YOUR MISSING THIS
ONE, BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND THE CLUE!***

&lt;p&gt;The posted coords are for the old lookout tower. This cache will
take you to the top of Horseblock Mountain with an elevation of
1444 ft. With plenty of parking and little elevation changes this
short hike on the old road will offer scenic views and old
technology that fought fires.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
 To find the find the ammo box you must find the benchmark Able
(DG1856) the highest point of the mountain and find benchmark Able
RM 2 (DG1857). The cache is 141 degrees from Able and 124 degrees
from RM 2. Remember this is a puzzle cache so please do not give
any hint or clues in your log so the next finder has the same
advantages as the FTF. Park at 33 33.663 085 42.283 and the old
road trailhead is just to the east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;***NOTICE
-- Climbing the lookout tower is NOT allowed -- Grafitti and other
defacing is worthless and so unneccessary -- PLEASE respect the
area, and rehide the cache exactly as you found it, or as it is

&lt;p&gt;This Fire Tower is located on the Shoal Creek Ranger District of
the Talladega National Forest. It is in great shape. The tower is
being used for radio equipment, as are many of these old
structures. The above coords are for the tower, and the geocache
itself is an offset cache. To find the cache box, start at the
above coords and then go 135.92 meters at a bearing of 236 degrees
and 6.5333 minutes. There you will find the 50 cal. ammo box
entombed.&lt;/p&gt;

Coordinates will take you to the end of Mountain Road, where you
will get a look at another fine specimen of the bygone Fire/Lookout
Tower days. There is also a breathtaking view of the town of
Jacksonville and the surrounding area. Much thanks to Nobodys Home
for his Overlook cache which brought me to this beautiful spot.
Whenever I can, I like to add the great old firetowers to the
series, so I just had to come back up here and show the wife and
whoever else will care to visit.&lt;br/&gt;

offset cache. To find the final cache, go to the above coords,
checkout the tower, and enjoy the view. Then proceed back down the
mountain &lt;b&gt;803.52 feet&lt;/b&gt; at a bearing of &lt;b&gt;201.81°&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Actually, it's easier if you work all that out before you leave
that computer you're sitting at right now! There are online and
software tools that will help you find another set of coords using
the above information, and you can check your figures using
GEOCHECKER below. We hope you enjoy this offering of the firetower
series!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

This is my first cache since getting back into Geocaching. There aren't any caches located in my local area... so I couldn't stand for that. This is a micro nano, BYOP!

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the stash that killed my cheap digital camera. This one&lt;br/&gt;combines a stash hunt and a maze game. The stash is hidden on the&lt;br/&gt;far side of a karst feature that consists of an approximately one&lt;br/&gt;to three acre maze of 20 to 40 foot high, tight narrow canyons that&lt;br/&gt;criss-cross and interconnect. Just to make life interesting, think&lt;br/&gt;about what you will get as far as satellite coverage while you're&lt;br/&gt;in there:) A compass might help... It's a 1.2 mile, flat and level,&lt;br/&gt;hike to Rock Town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, you could 'climb' the rocks and use your GPS, but that's&lt;br/&gt;up to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the lack of pictures! I'm going to be in the area&lt;br/&gt;this weekend and will try to get up there with a camera.&lt;/p&gt; 
</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Once you work your way through the maze, the stash is in a
crevice between two (three?) rocks that are each more or less the mass of an elephant.  There will be a small cave\rock shelter about 50 feet away and located about 15\20 feet up the cliff face (with a tree growing out of it) overlooking the stash.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow!!!  We were just thrilled to find such an old cache in such a great spot! We read the cache logs and said this is a cache we GOTTA get ......so we planned it so we could pick it up on our way to the fall Talladega race. Swing thru GA and get a few old ones, and this one has been on the list for quite some time.

We drove thru tornadoes in Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee. Literally.It was a mess. We stayed overnight in Chattanooga, TN where they had a huge tornado outbreak and the first ones in 13 years.  The next morning after the tornado mayhem, we drove about an hour south to this location in Georgia. We had no idea what we were in for.

The rain made all things super slick, roads, rocks, you name it. We had about a 4 hour window to get in, get out before the monsoon season returned. That &quot;historic&quot; storm wasn't going to stop us!  We hiked about 1/4 of the way back and realized - on no - we have no pen, no pathtags, nada. Thought you had it, thought you had it, nope!  So back to the truck.  When we did finally get there - we were like 2 kids on a playground. The moss was wet and slicker than snot.  But we had a great time.  We just walked around for hours. We have climbing friends at home that will get these coords for SURE.  The truck had a great time too.

Cache find just was the icing on the cake.  Glad you didn't make us climb up to that cave to get it [;)] But took the TB that was in the cache - to take to Nevada in a few weeks - and left our signature pathtag.  Thanks for one of our favorite caches of all time. We had a blast.

This was a rather easy one to find after the rocks of the nearby Earthcache and considering the FOAs and other near slips and misses at Iron Horse (GC89).  It was a very nice hike in.  The rock formations here are really cool!  It was fun watching all the rock climbers today.  TFTC!

Note: I only saw LZ33's copy coin in here today.  I didn't see any other TB's.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Shake Rag was a company town owned by McNabb Mines. Towns like this were common in the 19th and early 20th centuries. People who worked in the mines were paid in &quot;coal script&quot; company issued money, rather than US currency. As such, they were forced to rent their homes from the company and do their shopping in the company store. Many historians liken this type of work in American history to a form of slavery or servitude. Others contend that while it did tie workers to the company, it also allowed a higher standard of living than enjoyed by agricultural workers or factory workers.

Today the ruins of Shake Rag sit nearly forgotten on the side of a road in Marion County, Tennessee. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, these ruins are a reminder of Tennessee's past. Some of the ruins are very fragile. Please be careful!

Atomic number of Gallium.
Number of Hall of Fame Pitcher Ferguson Jenkins.
Number of flavors that Baskin Robbins is said to have.

Find the number these three have in common and you will find the cache.

***JUST A NOTE***

This is an easy micro just for the numbers. If you don't like micros and you are going to complain about it in your log, DON'T FIND IT! We've got over 50 ammo cans in the woods that don't get found that often, go find them!

Thanks and HAPPY CACHING!</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">• Fort Williams was ordered constructed in Glasgow in the spring of 1863. It was during the spring and summer of 1863 that the Union army began to build defensive works at strategic points in Kentucky to defend transportation networks and supply depots in the Commonwealth from Confederate raids.
• Fort Williams was constructed under the supervision of Lieut. Miles D. McAlister. who was Chief Engineer for the Department of the Ohio. He constructed a “figure 8 ” shaped redoubt, an enclosed fort, built to withstand attacks from all sides. The fort was armed with 24-pounder and 6-pounder cannon. The fort had several names but was finally officially named Fort Williams in November of 1863 in honor of Gen.Thomas Williams who was killed in battle. Glasgow was garrisoned by Union troops throughout the war. Glasgow ’s strategic importance was due to its location. It was the crossroads of several north-south and east-west roads and by June 1863 a branch of the L&amp;N Railroad.
• On October 6, 1863 the 25th Tennessee Infantry, C.S.A., attacked Fort Williams with 120 men commanded by Col. John M. Hughes. Hughes was ordered to Kentucky to collect deserters and enforce the Confederate conscription act, that is the draft of Confederate soldiers in Kentucky, which was technically a part of the Confederacy.
• The fort was garrisoned by the 37th Kentucky Mounted Infantry, U.S.A., commanded by Maj. Samuel Martin. The regiment numbered some 420 men. Fifty men were camped in the Court House square and 30 men were out on patrol. The men on the square were hit at dawn and then Col. Hughes attacked the fort. He reported, &quot;We killed 9, wounded 26 and captured 226, together with quartermaster’s stores in the amount of $250,000.00. My loss was 1 killed and 4 wounded.&quot;.


The cache is not hidden inside the fort.

It is hidden in a small strip of woods close to the fort.

Please be respectful of this historic place.

You will be looking for a well hidden lock and lock container about 4 inches by 8 inches.

It has a few trade items to trade.

This is a daytime only cache.
The gates close at dark.

The best place to park is at N36*59.904 W85*55.596</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
ARF's 1k Ammo Box (GC199TA)
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Anyone logging a &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;FIND&lt;/b&gt; on any ARF! Geocache or
Earthcache as their &lt;b&gt;ONE THOUSANDTH FIND&lt;/b&gt; and owns at least 10
hides will be awarded a &lt;b&gt;GOLDEN AMMO BOX&lt;/b&gt; to mark that
milestone!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
____________________________________________
________
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as
a thank you, for the first 144 visitors, there are &lt;b&gt;GOLDEN GEO
PINS&lt;/b&gt; inside the box. These are clip-ons and require no
piercings. Show your pride, wear your pin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To
locate this cache, park at Pineapple Chunks (GC1097E) and approach
the creek from the SE side. Before you reach the creek, you will
see a geo-trail through the tall grass. Follow this geo-trail and
it will become a hard trail once you enter the
woods.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow
the trail to the end, and to the cache. You'll be tempted to play
once you get there. Either in, or, on the other side of it. I know
I did, splash!.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
  
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Entry can
be marshy and trail may be slick after a rain (it slopes toward
creek). There's moss on the rocks. A hiking staff may be
prudent.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Enjoy The Trek!&lt;/i&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the same as my cache on geocaching.com, just testing out opencaching!&lt;p&gt;

You're looking for an RX bottle hidden in a slightly less common fashion in a public park. Parking is abundant 363 days of the year, may be a problem in the third weekend of September, when an Arts &amp; Crafts festival is held in the park. It's a great time to visit the park but I wouldn't suggest caching then.

I'm hiding this cache to populate Audubon Park, a nice little part of Louisville which I call home. It's an independent city developed in the early 20th century and best known for its golf course and annual dogwood festival in late April. The city was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district in 1996. The neighborhood was named for the naturalist and bird artist John James Audubon, and all but two of it's twenty streets were given names of birds.

It is a rather beautiful neighborhood, with tree-lined streets, deep front yards and small (by modern standards) houses chiefly of the crafstman and colonial revival styles. The neighborhood has a garden club which has been active for decades and a great many residents put incredible amounts of time into their yards and gardens.

Audubon Park was originally supposed to be twice as large, with Cardinal Drive, the street which runs alongside the country club, going all the way around the golf course, with an equal sized development on each side. However, Camp Taylor was built on the other side of the golf course during World War 1, forever scuttling plans for the completion of the developer's original dream.

The city incorporated in 1941 and a city hall was built near the golf course in the late 1980s. I have gathered that many people who moved into the neighborhood initially through the 1950s and 60s were foremen, engineers or even owners of industrial and manufacturing companies located in the Fern Valley area - Audubon Park being the nearest golf course community.

If you have a moment and like seeing houses with interesting stories behind them, walk about a tenth of a mile to the corner of Dove and Chickadee. There you will see an unusually small house for the neighborhood. It was originally a tiny train station! The developers began Audubon Park in 1906, and believe it or not would-be suburbanites were still not so sure about living in a neighborhood where they needed a car to get around. The developers therefore built a spur route of the Preston Street streetcar route that ran through the heart of Audubon Park and ended at this station, giving residents a convenient way to take the streetcar downtown to work or go shopping.

The streetcar spur didn't last, however, and was shut down by the 1920s. I've heard that it was just a promotional gimmick and once the lots were sold, the developer didn't see any point to keeping up the cost of maintaining a streetcar route. It's also quite possible there just wasn't a lot of interest in mass transit, as the revolutionary Model T arrived just after the lots went on sale, and nearly every home in the city has a driveway and a garage as a result. Some of the tracks actually remained long afterward, and were not removed from the park where the cache is until 1975.

Wernher von Braun (1912–1977) was one of the most important rocket developers and champions of space exploration during the period between the 1930s and the 1970s. As a youth he became enamored with the possibilities of space exploration by reading the science fiction of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and from the science fact writings of Hermann Oberth, whose 1923 classic study, Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen (By Rocket to Space), prompted young von Braun to master calculus and trigonometry so he could understand the physics of rocketry. From his teenage years, von Braun had held a keen interest in space flight, becoming involved in the German rocket society, Verein fur Raumschiffarht (VfR), as early as 1929. As a means of furthering his desire to build large and capable rockets, in 1932 he went to work for the German army to develop ballistic missiles. While engaged in this work, von Braun received a Ph.D. in physics on July 27, 1934.
The brainchild of von Braun’s rocket team operating at a secret laboratory at Peenemünde on the Baltic coast, the V–2 rocket was the immediate antecedent of those used in space exploration programs in the United States and the Soviet Union. A liquid propellant missile extending some 46 feet in length and weighing 27,000 pounds, the V-2 flew at speeds in excess of 3,500 miles per hour and delivered a 2,200-pound warhead to a target 500 miles away. First flown in October 1942, it was employed against targets in Europe beginning in September 1944. By the beginning of 1945, it was obvious to von Braun that Germany would not achieve victory against the Allies, and he began planning for the postwar era.

Before the Allied capture of the V–2 rocket complex, von Braun engineered the surrender of 500 of his top rocket scientists, along with plans and test vehicles, to the Americans. For fifteen years after World War II, von Braun worked with the U.S. Army in the development of ballistic missiles. As part of a military operation called Project Paperclip, he and his rocket team were scooped up from defeated Germany and sent to America where they were installed at Fort Bliss, Texas. There they worked on rockets for the U.S. Army, launching them at White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico. In 1950 von Braun’s team moved to the Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville, Ala., where they built the Army’s Jupiter ballistic missile.

Now that you know a little bit about Wernher von Braun, you'll have to think like him to obtain the final coordinates.
As for the cache, the cache is not located at the posted coordinates. In order to obtain these final coordinates, consider the related webpage:

-http://webalt.markworld.com/webalt.html

Then:

1. Take the peak altitude (including the decimal digit) [3 numbers] and add 428.2.

_ _ _ + 428.2 = ABC

2. Take the flight time (including the decimal digit on the end) [two numbers] and multiply by45.4166667.

_ _ X 45.4166667 = XYZ

The ammo box final is located here:
N 38* 17.ABC
W 085* 39.XYZ

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Historic Locust Grove is a 55-acre 18th century farm site and National Historic Landmark situated in eastern Jefferson County, Kentucky (now a part of Louisville Metro). The site is presently owned by the Louisville Metro government, and operated as a historic interpretive site by Historic Locust Grove, Inc.
The main feature on the property is the ca. 1790 Georgian mansion that was the home of the Croghan family and gathering place for George Rogers Clark, Lewis and Clark, and U.S. Presidents.

The site was founded in 1790 by William Croghan and his wife Lucy Clark Croghan. Lucy was the sister of the younger William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and the older George Rogers Clark, former surveying partner of William Croghan.
On November 8, 1806, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, tracing their way back from the Pacific Ocean, arrived at Locust Grove to a homecoming where Lucy Clark Croghan and her family welcomed them back from their journey. Locust Grove became the only residence still in existence west of the Appalachian Mountains to have sheltered Lewis and Clark. In the Fall of 2006, Locust Grove commemorated the 200th anniversary of Lewis and Clark's return.
George Rogers Clark lived at the site in the final years of his life, from 1809 to 1818.
The property was adjacent to Springfield, the home of Colonel Richard Taylor and his son, future U.S. President Zachary Taylor.
Following the death of William Croghan, the estate passed to John C. Croghan, notable for his purchase of Mammoth Cave in 1838.
In the winter of 1844, the farm was the site of the efforts of African-American slave Stephen Bishop to produce a map of Mammoth Cave. The resulting map was published in 1845, and remained the most complete and accurate map of the period until modern survey techniques were applied in 1908. A significant epilogue to Bishop's story occurred in 1972, when a long-sought route connecting the caves of Flint Ridge and Mammoth Cave Ridge was discovered in an area which Bishop had mapped, but which had in the interim been almost completely flooded by the construction of a dam on the surface nearby: the area of the 20th Century connection route is shown on Bishop's 19th century map.
It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986.
It is located at 561 Blankenbaker Lane in Louisville.

Henry's Ark. A Place Where People and Animals
Meet&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Henry's
Ark Is Located At 7801 Rose Island Road Prospect KY, 40059.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
_______________________________________________________
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Open to the Public Year Round From 9:00 a.m. to Sunset
&lt;b&gt;TUESDAY thru SUNDAY. 502 228-0746.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Henry's Ark is a free to the public petting zoo and a
child's wonderland, complete with an Outback, &lt;i&gt;mate!&lt;/i&gt;. Animals
roam freely about the property and parking lot. I was met by an Emu
at the Jeep window and it followed me until someone with food came
along and it lost interest (in me).&lt;br/&gt;
Henry's Ark, a.k.a. Moncada Farm, is a peculiar little farm with a
petting zoo featuring over a hundred animals. There's the usual
suspects such as goats, sheep, cattle, swans, ducks, geese and
others -- but also extremely exotic selections such as bison, water
buffalo, camels, emus, zebras, yak, elk, alpaca, porcupines,
capybara, etc. There's a beautiful albino peacock as well.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

_______________________________________________________
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The cache is hidden just outside the gate and is available
even if the zoo is closed. Park in the zoo parking lot if open and
at the gate if closed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

_______________________________________________________
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;BEWARE OF TRAFFIC!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also beware of the threshold at the entrance. It's
designed to keep the residents inside the property, but can be an
ankle eater.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

_______________________________________________________
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;You are looking for a centrifuge tube
@1600hrs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;




&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

_______________________________________________________
&lt;br/&gt;
I
enjoyed my visit and all the animals. I hope you will, too! My last
stop was at the Doe Nation station.&lt;br/&gt;

Just becuase I didn't know the little guy with the horns was a goat. We grew corn and beans not goats and chickens. Thanks for putting a cache here so we could wander around amongst the animals. Orale! and TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

Our goal this 'Father's Day' is to get to 900 caches. #4 of the day and #879. Quick and easy grab and what a great place. A woman gave us carrots so we had a little chat with the old camel there while he enjoyed them.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This 137 acre lake features fishing, camping, picnic areas, Hiking trails and CACHES! The little Kentucky River Watershed Conservancy District operates Lake Jericho. It has been opened for business since July 25th, 1969. A daily fee ($2.00 per adult) is charged to anyone visiting the park and the proceeds are used to maintain and operate the park. There is a boat launch fee ($4.00), and if you do not own a boat or wish to bring yours, there are boat rentals available.

The Park is open seasonally (April 1st through November 1st) from dawn to dark, pets are permitted on a leash. All my Lake Jericho caches have been placed with the knowledge and permission of the Park Management. While in the park, whether just there to pick up a few caches or looking to sweep the park in one trip, be sure to take the time to explore the park and it’s new trails, and be sure to stop at the administration building and thank them for supporting the sport of Geocaching.

Currently there are 30+ caches planned and in progress for the park, the first batch will be land accessible and the second batch will be water accessible caches. I have tried to make a good mix of difficulties and terrains so there is a little something for everyone.</groundspeak:long_description>

Yet another Geocache along the Southern Indiana Wine Trail. We now have a cache at all of the winery's. 

This should be an easy find and is a small lock box that can hold some trade items. Please put back where you found it because there is something there to hold it in place.

While there stop in and say HI and have a good time and enjoy beautiful Madison along the Ohio River!! 

Please limit caching during daylight hours.

Have fun caching...........The Madison Cachers</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;PATHTAG BONUS:&lt;br/&gt;
For a limited time!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To receive a Madison Bicentennial
pathtag, return to the starting spot and turn in your completed
sheet with your name and address on the back and when they arrive,
we will mail them to you as long as supplies last. There is a
limited supply of tags, and they will not be re-ordered so you will
be getting a piece of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visitors
center is open 9-5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went out to test the coords and
it took us a little over an hour to walk the whole trail and we
even stopped and check out the Miss Madison O'boy Orberto
Hydro-plane race boat who's offices you will pass along the
way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special thanks to the City of
Madison and the Bicentennial Committee for sponsoring this special
Geocache!&lt;br/&gt;
Enjoy and Happy Caching.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This cache should be an

small film canister like container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several caches
to collect as you work your way to the top.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello………….
This is an easy find in beautiful downtown Madison, Indiana.  While here, stop in and grab a great cup of coffee or your favorite coffee drink and say ‘HI’ to the owner.  They serve Seattle's Best Coffee and have some other goodie’s made in the Jefferson County area.  Also you might as well just go a couple of blocks south and take an easy walk along the Ohio River and enjoy the view of the Madison-Milton bridge. 
Thanks and enjoy the hunt…………..

The cache is accessible without having to move any of the stones and is easy to get too. Please put back the way you found it.

Hello..................

And welcome to Madison, Indiana. This should be an easy and quick find as you come into town from the west side. There is parking nearby at the motel. The cache is a camo-taped waterproof match container with a pencil and log but you might have a writing tool handy. Please put back as you found it to keep it hid for the next cachers.

There is a FTF prize: One of my ‘Rubicon’ Wooly pathtags. Please log tag at www.pathtags.com.

Thanks for caching and enjoy the find.................

Hide-Away..........&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a beautiful
hiking trail that starts along the Mighty Ohio River and works it
way to the Madison hill top and Clifty Fall State Park. The hike is
under two miles each way with most of it being a nice paved trail
or gravel path.&lt;br/&gt;
The place to park is at&lt;br/&gt;
 N 38 44.107&lt;br/&gt;
W 085 23.508&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is as you get
started up the trail. You are looking for a small camo'd
lock-n-lock box.&lt;br/&gt;
Please do not try this cache from HWY 56!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several caches
to collect as you work your way to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy and have fun in

&lt;p&gt;This is a 'Chirp' cache and the coords will lead you to its
location. Make sure your GPS'r is 'Chirp' enabled and has the
latest updates. You should recieve the new coords and the combo for
the lock on the cache. The cache is not far from this location and
is a nice walk from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Non 'Chirp' GPS'r users:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a container at this location, but you will have to look
for it. In it, there is the coords for the cache and the lock
combo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating is a 3/3 but can be higher when wet.........Have fun and
enjoy the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

Better make sure the shoelaces are tight and the hiking stick is handy. Some O2 and H2O at the top would be handy also. 

The cache is in the Splinter Ridge Wildlife Area with some great views from the top. You are looking for a medium size snap box that can hold some goodies in it.

Enjoy the cache  and area.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is off the main
trail just a&lt;br/&gt;
 bit, but if you follow this one, you will end up at Clifty Falls
State park..&lt;br/&gt;
 You are looking for a camo'd Tupperware container. There used to
be a cache here&lt;br/&gt;
 and we liked this spot so we will try again.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There are several caches to collect&lt;br/&gt;

You are looking for a medium snap box that can hold some goodies. This is nice hike in the trail(less) boonie area of Splinter Ridge Wildlife Area with some great views of the valleys and peaks you need to cross to get to the geocache. 

Looks like this used to be a nice cabin on the top of the hill.

As we sat at the end of the road trying to decide which way to go, I went up and put this one at the end of the trail (if you do the trail(less) TM the way we did) in the Splinter Ridge Wildlife area. 

Get your hiking stick ready, the shoelaces tight because you will need it for this cache. You are looking for a medium Staples snap box that can hold some goodies.

Enjoy the cache and the area........

The last two Geocaches put out for this event were hard to get to on hot and very wet days. This one is the easiest of the bunch to grab, but you will have to hike a little over a mile to grab.

You are looking for an Ammo can in the woods......And I will give the usually hints for caches put in forest settings, so be ready.

Please put cache back the way you found it and enjoy the hike and park.</groundspeak:long_description>

A quick grab and go at Madison’s public golf course. 

Sunrise Golf Course is a city owned course and is open to everyone. So get your GPS’r and golf clubs and do both. You are looking for a small waterproof match container close to the Pro Shop. There is a pencil in the cache, but you might have one handy just in-case. Stop in and say hi………….
 
You do not have to go on or interfere with any one on the golf course to get this cache but please be mindful of the golfers teeing off.  

Enjoy the hunt and have fun in Madison............</groundspeak:long_description>

'Ridge' Winery and Cache... 
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Grab
a cache and have some of Southern Indiana's best wine while you're
at it. This is one of our favorite stops along the beautiful Ohio
River while on our way to Belterra Casino. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Sit &amp; Sip on the
Beautiful Ohio River&quot;....and now grab a cache!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please only go after this one

&lt;p&gt;Monday - Friday&lt;br/&gt;
 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM&lt;br/&gt;
 Saturday&lt;br/&gt;
 10:00 AM to 8:00 PM&lt;br/&gt;
 Sunday&lt;br/&gt;
 11:00 AM to 6:00 PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1995, The Ridge Winery has
been producing and marketing award winning wines!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ridge Winery commemorates two
hundred years of American wine history by restoring the trade to
Switzerland County, home of America's first successful commercial
winery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Geocache is an ammo can that
is easy find and please put back as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owners have put a few 'FTF'
prizes in the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

This Geocache is a play on words and is in the spirit of Discovery Channel's 'Dirty Jobs' show hosted by Mike Rowe (or is that Micro??). You are looking for a container with a nano inside. Do not pour contents on ground!! 

This cache is between two businesses and you can try and figure out which oil you want.....

Please limit to daylight hours only and put cache back like you found it. At certain time this can be a high muggle area so use stealth.

Hello..........

I have lived here over 20 years and didn’t know this pond was back here. A very nice location in Madison, Indiana and it's a great place that needed a cache placed there. 

You are looking for a camo’d waterproof match container with only a log sheet in it. So please bring your own writing utensil and put back the way you found it. Please do only in the day time hours as requested by the manager.

Happy caching!!

This Geocache is a play on words and is in the spirit of Discovery Channel's 'Dirty Jobs' show hosted by Mike Rowe (or is that Micro??). You are looking for a container with a nano inside. Do not pour contents on ground!! 

I can remember when this area was the city dump and we're sure there has to be some toxic stuff around here somewhere (like in the container). 

Please limit to daylight hours only and put cache back like you found it. At certain time this can be a high muggle area so use stealth.

Happy Caching.........The Madison Cachers............</groundspeak:long_description>

This is a great cache for the whole family to enjoy.  Bring your putter along and do the 18-hole Putt-Putt course or take the short-clubs and play this beautiful 9-hole par 3 course.  There is also a driving range and the pro shop.  Stop in and say &quot;Hello&quot;.

The cache is an Ammo can and is hid so you do not have to interfere with anyone playing the course.  It is stocked with items from the pro shop and my usually stuff from the Alaskan Brewing Company.

The Cozy Acres owner has put more 'FREE' cards for the putt-putt course in the cache.  Please limit to one card per group so more get to use them.  Thanks.

So have fun, enjoy the hunt and just keep putt-putt puttin’ along.....</groundspeak:long_description>

Hello
Geocachers………………………&lt;br/&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The
owner had such good results with ‘Just Putt-Putt-Putting Along’
(GCXVOF) he asked me to put out another Geocache on the property.
So here it is at a great spot that is a little tougher to find and
get to, but well worth the trouble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two
rules to follow to get to this cache:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.
Please stay on the cart path at all times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.
Do not interfere with any of the golfers on the course and let them
play through instead of proceeding in front of
them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To
get to the cache, go toward the #7 tee box. After just crossing the
dam, go to the right, down the little path to the old, overgrown
cart path (not the one with the roll of fence on it. You’re still
too high). From here follow your GPS’r to the
cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please hide the cache
like you found it and enjoy the scenery. Bring your golf clubs and
play a round. It is a very nice Par 3 course. And if you see the
owner while you are there, stop in and say ‘HI’ and thank him for
letting us do this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks. ‘Rubicon’
Wooly……………………………&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;****************************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cozy Acres Golf Course owner has
donated six free cards. 2 each for the putt-putt course, the golf
course and the driving range. Please only take one per group to
spread the wealth. So there are 6 FTF prizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Little Cabin Along A Creek.........

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Dream Cabin In The Woods...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have always wanted a little place in the woods along a creek
so we finally built this little cabin that we use as a spring
rental place. Our 'Dream' house has a nice front deck and a
fireplace in its one great room. It is natural Cedar wood outside
with 'sky-blue' trim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is parking on the shoulder of the road right by the cache
site. Just follow the creek to the homestead and a good geocacher
will spot it right away.....The new tenants won't mind you looking
for the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please only cache in daylite hours. It is in the 'Back 40&quot; if
you know what I mean....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO NIGHT CACHING!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This is Indiana 'Redneck' country and you might get shot in the
dark (or if your driving an 'Office Shop' van)...Also
BYOP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put cache back the way you found it, and have a great time
caching.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

A nice county park in Jefferson County on what used to be Jefferson Proving Grounds, just north of Madison, Indiana.  The cache is an Ammo can that is about 15 feet off a small nature trail from the south end of the lake.  It is stocked with items from the Alaskan Brewing Company such as coasters, magnets, and other stuff.  Please hide cache so passers-by won't find it.  

Bring a fishing pole and just enjoy the park and geocaching.......

right about now.......................&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freddie's Nightmare&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This
is an easy cache in the daylite, by 'Krueger' Lake near Madison,
Indiana. But at night....How brave are you? What was the weird
sound coming from the woods? Was that somebody screaming? What did
I just trip over?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
coords will not lead you to the cache!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 Freddie's eyes are watching every move you make....He knows
where you want to go. Follow his eyes to find his grave and you
will find his cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This is not for the faint of heart. You will need a very good
flashlight and I would mark where you parked your car so you can
find your way back out....or else it will be the next cacher
finding your decaying body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This
night cache is in a very dark area with no lights, so when it gets
dark, it is black in the woods. Bring extra batteries!! You don't
want to go dead (GPS'r or Flashlight wise) while you are out there.
The coords will take you to the start of Freddie's old trail where
he used to hide his victim's. You are looking for four eyes
watching you at the start and then follow the two eyes from tree to
tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code:&lt;br/&gt;
4 eyes - Start&lt;br/&gt;
2 eyes - Straight (should be able to find next set of eyes from
these points)&lt;br/&gt;
3 eyes - Turn right&lt;br/&gt;
Moving Eyes - Critter...Don't follow!!&lt;br/&gt;
No Eyes - Turn around (wrong way)&lt;br/&gt;
You will know when you are at the final gravesite....Lots of
Eyes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good
luck finding your way out!! (We only get you there!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good
luck not running in to Freddie and have fun caching.....'Rubicon'
Wooly and Schwerin.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was the one cache in town that I just had to do. I had planned to do it around dusk, but Better Half Shell was feeling a little under the weather so I went in the woods in the daylight. Well with the trail grown up in areas this one became a challenge in the daytime. I was so worried about not finding freddie's eyes that I practically tripped over another cache in the area and did not realize it until I was heading back to the car. It amazing that at the time, I did not think I was that far in the wilderness until after I had found the cache and then had to find my way back, thanks goodness for breadcrumbs. I loved the way this cache is set up. Great final location. This is a must do if anyone is in this area.

Thanks for the fun. </groundspeak:text>

JPG - 50 Years of Service!! 
&lt;p&gt;1941 -
1991&lt;/p&gt;

The coords will lead
you to plaque commemorating 50 years of service that Jefferson
Proving Grounds gave to the good ol' US of A. 
&lt;p&gt;I lived out here for five years and worked for
the Air Guard for 17, so this place holds a lot of memories for us.
Our kids grew up playing around here on the softball field,
basketball and tennis court, and fishing at the creeks and lakes.
The biggest problem was having to watch out for all the deer
running around after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find this cache, stand in front of the plague,
and look over the top middle notch of the stones. It is roughly 70
feet away but an easy find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy caching and have fun in
Madison......'Rubicon' Wooly&lt;/p&gt;

Little is know about Prattsburg Cemetery.  I have not been able to find any information about churches operating in this part of the county.  What is more likely is that it started out as a family cemetery for the Pratt family since they owned the majority of the land in this area and most of the people buried there are members of that family.

The terrain is raited a three because the cemetery is located on top of a small hill with steep sides.  Also, the ground here can be soft, espically after a rain, so wheelchairs and strollers may have trouble getting around.  There is a small parking area that can accomodate 2-3 cars, so you can pull you car off the road.

While this is a low-muggle area there are those who maintain the cemeery.  Also, because of the number of veterans burried here (which include several from the Civil War and one from the Revolutionary War), the local VFW Honor Guard comes by here on Memorial Day between 11:00 am and 1:00 pm for a ceremony honoring them.

You are looking for a light-blue, transparent, plastic container with a water-tight seal containing a log book, pencil, and some toys for any kids that you bring with you.  During the spring, summer, and fall months, there will be a disposable camera, so feel free to take a pictures.  When the camera is full or in the later part of fall I'll develop the film and post the pictures on this page.

Please rehide the cache as good or better than you found it.  Please be respectful of those buried here and please, no night caching.

Prattsburg is a unique town in this list, because of all of the ghost towns that I talk about, Prattsburg was never really platted as a town in Ripley County.  The area known as Prattsburg was owned by Diah Pratt who ran a large saw mill.  He employed a number of people who settled in the area, drawing other businesses to Prattsburg such as a blacksmith, general store, cigar shop, shoe shop, and a harness shop.

Even though the town was never platted, that didn’t stop it from appearing in maps.  The first recorded appearance of the town in maps was in 1888 when plat maps of Ripley County were published.  Even today, you can enter Prattsburg, Indiana, into Google Earth and you will be brought to this location.

The cache is a water-tight match container painted a dark brown.  It only contains a log scroll, so be sure to bring a writing instrument with you.  While the cache is located along a country road, there is a spot near the cache where you can pull off the road.  This is also a fairly busy road, so some stealth may be needed.  Once you arrive at the site, it’ll be obvious where the cache is hidden, so no further hints will be given.

While that cache is on land that I own, please be respectful of the surrounding land owners and avoid caching at night.

In 1872, Adams Lutheran Church relocated their congregation to this site.  However, they continued to use the old cemetery for another 20 years, removing the old building to allow for the expansion.  In the 1890’s, the new cemetery was dedicated across the road from the current building and eventually the old cemetery became inactive.

You may have noticed that this is a partial second row.  This is known as the children’s row.  It was common to segregate children from the adults because a child’s coffin was smaller and didn’t need as much room lengthwise as an adult.  Burying children in rows separate from adults made more efficient use of the land.  In the old cemetery, you will see a number of rows that consist of only children.  The children’s row in the new cemetery hasn’t been used for a number of reasons.  Today’s advancement in medicine has done a lot to lessen childhood morbidity.  But there was also a request from a few parents to allow them to bury the child in the adult rows with spaces reserved next to the child for the parents to be buried in when their time comes.

The ground here is level and firm and it is possible for strollers and wheelchairs to get around here; however, a person in a wheelchair may need assistance to get to the cache.  The cache you’re looking for is a dark green plastic jar with a black lid.  It contains a log but no pencil, so bring your own writing instrument.  There’s also room for small trade items and trackables.  Since this is an active church and cemetery it is also a high-muggle area so plenty of stealth is needed.  Please refrain from caching during service times.  On Memorial Day a VFW Honor Guard stops here to honor the veterans laid to rest here.  Should they arrive while you are caching here, please stop your caching activity until after they have finished.  As always, please do not cache here at night.

The Rev. Dr. David Adams came to rural Indiana from Baden-Baden Germany in the 1850’s.  A minister, physician, and teacher, he worked as a teacher during the day and preached on Sundays.  In 1852, he founded a Lutheran church in this location.  There are those who say the church was named after Rev. Adams, but this is highly unlikely since church names are often derived from the location of the church, the name of a saint, or from a biblical reference.  It’s more likely that the church’s name was derived from its location, since this spot is in southwestern Adams Township.

The original church was a log structure located on the front part of the land while interments took place back of the building.  It was common at this time for people to be buried in the church yard because it was believed that to do so guaranteed the dearly departed would be received in heaven.  This structure was active for the next 20 years until a new brick structure was built down the road in 1872.

Only half of the land enclosed in the fence was part of the original church site.  The lower level to the north was overgrown and was purchased in the late 1990’s and cleaned up as part of a renovation project.  While the cemetery now includes more land, there’s no plan in reactivating this cemetery in the future.

The ground here is uneven with some of the graves having collapsed and the turf can be soft, especially after a rain, so wheelchairs and strollers may not be able to pass.  The cache you’re looking for is a dark green plastic jar with a black lid.  It contains a log but no pencil, so bring your own writing instrument.  There’s also room for small trade items and trackables.  While this is a low muggle area the grounds are well maintained so some stealth may be required.  On Memorial Day a VFW Honor Guard stops here to honor the veterans laid to rest here.  Should they arrive while you are caching here, please stop your caching activity until after they have finished.  As always, please do not cache here at night.

I've done a fair number of caches that use the ROT-13 method of encryption.  The only problem with that is that ROT-13 is so commonplace that apps have been developed to help decrypt them, making ROT-13 almost useless.  Because of that, I decided to use a different encryption system that is no more difficult to use than the ROT-13 system known as Caesar's Square.

I became acquainted with this system in one of Dan Brown's novels.  The system - said to have been developed by Caesar - starts with a message where the number of characters (no spaces) is a square of a number (such as 81 is the square of 9, 100 is the square of 10, 121 is the square of 11, etc).  This message is then written in a column format, meaning that each letter is written under the previous letter until you reach the square root of the message number (again, 9 for 81, 10 for 100, 11 for 121, etc) at which point you start a new column of letters.  The end result of a square with the same number of lines as columns.  The message is still readable if your start in the upper left-hand corner, read down the column of letters, working your way to the right.  Now you would transcribe this square of letters onto another piece of paper – line by line- until you have a string of characters that is totally unreadable.

To decode the message, you only need to count the number of letters in the message, calculate the square root, and start transcribing the message with the square root number of characters per lines as well as the number of lines.  Now the message can be read as described above.

(The are many websites devoted to the explanation of the Caesar's Square system, so if you still have question Google the phrase “Caesar's Square”.)

Once you understand how Caesar's Square works, you fill find the coordinates of the cache below.  All you will need is the Caesar's Square method.  Decipher the hint and go to those coordinates to locate the cache.  You'll need to bring your own pen to sign the log and possibly a tool to extract the log with.

 This one's for our 4yr old niece (just turned 4 this weekend) who is known in our family as the &quot;General&quot;. She's a little girl with a lot of spunk who has to keep up with two older sisters and knows what she likes and dislikes and is not afraid to tell you. 
We introduced her to geocaching this spring while we were all on vacation in Florida. We explained to her the object of the game was to find secret treasures...quietly. However, quietly to a 3yr old just isn't possible.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache was originally located a few blocks away and has recently moved. It is located in Packard Park.

Sloan and Sons Funeral Home. This cache is in the parking lot placed with the manager's permission. The cache will stay well hidden, even in the winter.

C.M. Sloan and Sons Funeral Home is one of the many historic buildings located on Wells Street. Built in the 1920's as a mineral fume spa, C.M. Sloan and Sons moved from West Berry Street to this location in 1934. Building has gone under many renovations since then but the original structure is still standing and in good condition.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A Tribute Cache to The Herd. 
This cache is a Magnetic Theme, due to the Magneticity that The Herd possesses. The cache is a three stage multi cache utilizing, magnets or the theory of how a Magnet works.

Seems Brad has moved on to bigger and better things. In turn, The Herd has to relocate. Amber,( Momma Herd ), especially, has grown on most of us that know her, she is most outgoing of the bunch, (Bigger Mouth I would Guess, my opinion only ), JUST KIDDING...  She will be missed by me,(NOT), Well, maybe a little,(probably not), O.K., She will be missed lot's by me too , as well as the rest of The Herd, who will be missed lot's by all of us as well. Boy can I write a book on this bunch. Sure going to miss all the abuse. What do you think Amber, Opposites Attract should be a good name for this one, especially after the comment from the waitress in Kendallville.
Again, this is a Magnet themed geocache. It uses magnets or the theory of how a magnet works. On the second stage, you will have to think out of the box a bit. Think about how a magnet works in order to find the coordinates to the next stage. You won't find them at the exact given coordinates, but you will figure it out if you think about how a magnet works. This will be very easy for some, and very hard for others... On the final stage, there is no container, only a unique log. Please bring your own Pen or Marker to sign the log and return it exactly as you found it. It only goes one way. It's placement has been marked so you know how to put it back. As with any cache, please keep an eye on the area for Muggles.

Cache is a rubbermaid container hidden on private property, Mine. It is within 15 feet of the edge of the City Park. It is nowhere close to a house, etc. Please be aware that this is by a Public City park so please watch for Muggles. Plan your trip for this one accordingly. There is plenty for the kids to do within 100' of the cache site, including a new play area that was just constructed. If you have time, stop and watch a ballgame if there is one going on at the time of your visit.... Please do not park in the housing addition and walk between the houses.

This cache site is the Hess Cemetery, a nice little place on the SouthWest side of Goshen which was donated to the city by the early pioneer Bolser Hess. While you are here have a look around at the unique stones and take in the history of the Hess Family as well as many others recently interred here.

Though I usually describe my cache containers this one will be left a surprise. But you are looking for a small well camoed container. Seasoned cachers will have little difficulty finding this one but our newer members should find it quite challenging.

As with each of my cemetery placements this cache is not near a headstone or memorial and is not in a bush.

Good luck! Please replace the cache exactly as you found it and do not post pictures of the find. Note also that this is a cemetery cache. Caches logged at night will be deleted with prejudice.   </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache recognizes the sacrifice of a Local Hero and an eight
year veteran of the Goshen Police Department. Take some time to
experience the quiet beauty of this small cemetery tucked away in
rural West Goshen. While here be sure to read the poem etched into
the officers memorial. It is quite moving. As with most cemetery's,
visitors are only allowed from dawn to dusk.

This is a four stage multi-cache. The first stage is a memorial to
local Heroes. The second stage leads you to a quiet cemetery where
our fallen hero rests. The third stage directs you to the memorial
while the fourth is the cache container. You will need to visit
them in listed order as each provides clues to the coordinates for
the next stage.

Be wary of muggles in the cemetery as it is a popular dog walking
area. A golf-course also borders the property to the west. Cemetery
staff are aware of this cache but will not assist you in finding
it. The walk is not difficult.

Note that this has been converted to a micro-cache. It is easier to
find and there should be no confusion with private property. As
with each of my cemetery placements this cache is not placed near a
headstone or memorial and is not in a bush.

Stage 1: Starting Coordinates

N 41.35.027 W 085.49.992

On arrival at stage 1 you will find the memorial to local Police
Officers who have given their lives in the line of duty. The
address number of the facility where the memorial is located
provides the west coordinates for stage 2 of the cache.

Stage 2: The Cemetery

N 41.34.758 W 085.51.xxx

Following a short drive from stage 1 you should be looking at a
sign which briefly documents the history of the cemetery. There are
three dates on this sign. To find the west coordinates for stage 3
subtract the first date from the third.

Stage 3: The Memorial

N 41.34.705 W 085.51.xxx

You should now be standing at the final resting place of our Fallen
Hero. Please take a moment to offer a prayer or spoken word of
thanks. Kindly remember to respect the memorial and do not touch or
remove anything from it. To find the coordinates for stage 4 and

Stage 4: The Cache

N 41.34.571 W 085.51.xxx

Please park at the Maintenance building before proceeding to stage
4. Do not drive up the hill as there is no turnaround and you could
easily damage headstones trying to back out.

You are looking for a dark green matchstick container which holds
the logbook and a double-sharpened pencil.

If you know of another local &quot;Fallen Hero&quot; who deserves recognition
just send me an email. I will do my best to put together a cache in
their honor.

PumpkinVine Trail. Fall colours are nice but Spring and Summer
finds are most rewarding.

Some thirty years ago, as a kid, I walked the Rock Run Creek
railroad tracks to school. As I grew up, I spent many hours
playing, fishing, trapping, and camping on and around the bridges
and banks of this small creek which winds its way through NorthEast
Goshen. Like many of the friends of my youth, the tracks are now
gone, replaced with these trails.

As you walk the trails let them take you back with me to those days
of backyard football games, bicycle rides, canepoles and wiggly
worms, my memories of this area.

Good luck on your search but don't be surprised if, from behind you
hear, the joyous laughter of a child, only to turn and find
no-one...

(for Dean)

This cache is placed along the Little Elkhart River near RiverBend Park in Middlebury.

Located at 511 East Warren Street on the east edge of Middlebury, Riverbend Park is one of the most used parks in the Middlebury Park system. It appeals to young and old alike and includes a nice balance of active playground for the youth and serene river views for adults. The park expanded in 2003 by a donation of 16.4 acres of adjoining land by Spring Valley Corporation to it’s current 24.4 acres. It is also used for an outdoor volleyball league as well as the Boys and Girls Club basketball league in the summer. It is within walking distance of many of Middlebury's featured attractions including the new &quot;Middlebury Museum&quot;. You could easily spend an entire day enjoying the scenic beauty in and around the town.

WARNING: The 2/4 difficulty rating of this cache is warranted because the cache is on the East bank of the river and is only accessable by crossing a 20' section of the river where a fallen tree lies. If you have any reservations about crossing the 3' deep river on a log which is only about 12&quot; wide, partially submerged, and often covered in slippery moss then please just use the coordinates to enjoy the park and trails. Do not attempt the find if you are concerned in any way about the crossing. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

For those of you so enclined; You are looking for a small camo taped container with a waterproof matchstick holder inside (double-bagged to keep the log dry).

Please place the cache exactly as you found it!

Have MUCH fun!   </groundspeak:long_description>

This spot was where Enbridge took their last stand to stop the oil spill before reaching the Marrow Lake Dam.  This is a great place to fish for small mouth bass once the river reopens.  There use to be a DNR boat launch here, but was not put back in when the bridge was replaced.  Enjoyed a lot of warm summer days fishing here.  Hope you enjoy the spot too!
Should be an easy cache to find.     

Best place to park is at the ball field at the school or across the street there is a small spot for a few vehicles at the north end of the bridge.

This cache is located along the Kalamazoo River.  This is a great place to fish for small mouth bass once the river reopens.  Small boats and kayaks are often seen here, throughout the summer months.(When the river is open)  Hope you enjoy this area!


Remember to keep clear of the water till the river reopens.

This community is just over 4 years old, might not be on some maps. Use stealth, since there are more than likely walkers or young muggles out and about, expecially on warmer days! 
There is a set of GLOW STICKS for the FTF. Once you find the cache, feel free to snap a photo and post to the caching website.

We look forward to seeing others enjoying our first cache! Congrats to Sweetke50 for the FTF!

Although not a requirement, you may want to tell your own proud papa (or proud mama) story after finding this cache!!! If you don't have children, that is ok, talk about the moment in your childhood that you made your parents proud, or just talk about if you want to have kids. Anything related to that will be great!!!!

Was out for the the day with Homebru in the Grand Rapids area.   Gee I do not know which things to list or where to start.  My children are in their thirties now so I have a lot to proud moments to pick from.  My son is a Eagle Scout and my daughter is a National Parks Ranger.  As these two items are not the only reasons I am so proud of them it is a couple of the ones that are close to the top of the list.  Now don't even get me started on my grand children as I am sure there is a limet on how long a posting can be.   Found it at 8:05pm for my 24th find of the day.  Thanks for the cache!.

After dropping the woman off at the mall I had a few hours to kill so what ever could I possible find to do. You got it. I was finding the caches in the area.  After reading about this one I was not so sure I was going to be able to get it.  I figured I had plenty of time I might just as well at least go and see what I was up against.  Got to the DZ and scoped it out.  Not wanting to give anything away I am just going to say, Yup I got it.  Logged it at 12:05pm.  Interesting cache hide.  TNLN.

 We won this &quot;ready-made&quot; cache at the WWFM III event. 
Long before Alpine Avenue was developed, this area was once Greenridge Country Club. When the kids and dad lived nearby for a while, we often explored this area. We stumbled upon the old tennis courts and lots of teenage &quot;hang-outs&quot;.

Should not be too difficult of a find. Coordinates are based on average of 500 readings with 13 foot accuracy.

Please rehide as well or better than you found it.

Went out with our good friends to get a few caches today in the GR area. We were working on the Frozen Tongues Series but was also getting others close by. Found at 3:35pm. TN L-SC.

My boys insisted that this be called &quot;Water Boy&quot; as it is located near a village water supply pump. This cache turned out to be a lot smaller than I had anticipated, but will fit very small items like the dollar and half dollar coins I started it out with. Hope you enjoy our cache! </groundspeak:long_description>

Pond Letterbox&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A scenic
stroll along the flooded banks of the Muskegon
River.&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;b&gt;About the
Location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Welcome to a picturesque view of Newaygo State Park's Hardy Dam
Pond.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The coordinates of this cache will bring to the start of your
journey to this letterbox treasure.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Newaygo State Park is a 99-site rustic campground, which sits atop
20-foot embankments overlooking the Hardy Dam Pond, a six-mile
flooding of the Muskegon River. The park caters primarily to
campers, anglers and recreational boaters. There are several picnic
sites overlooking the reservoir for day users. The campground is
nestled in oak and poplar forests and is noted for its large,
private sites and scenic beauty. There is a 20-30 foot forested
buffer between sites, and each site is provided with a picnic table
and a fire ring.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This park has welcomed geoacachers to it again with another event
planned for June, 2010. There are some terrific caches in this
park; please take some time to enjoy them.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;



&lt;b&gt;Clues to the
Cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In the spirit of letterboxing we don't give you the coordinates to
the cache but instead a series of clues or directions to find it.
You don't need to have a personal stamp &amp; personal log book to
seek this cache, but to stay with the intent of letterboxing a
personal stamp would be nice. You can get a stamp of your own at
most hobby stores, they aren't very expensive. &lt;b&gt;Please don't take
the stamp or ink pad from the cache; they are to stay in the
cache.&lt;/b&gt; To learn more about Letterboxing, visit
letterboxing.org.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The coordinates on this cache page will lead you to an erosion sign
just north-west of campsite #85.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Follow the foot path that heads west along the southern shore of
Hardy Pond. You will walk about 225 paces before reaching a dip in
the trail. Here you will see about a three foot drop in the trail's
elevation and immediately to the north, at a slightly lower
elevation, you will see signs of two springs that then trickle down
into the pond.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Continue west about another 100 paces. Here you will encounter a
large diameter oak tree, on the very south or left edge of the
trail. There are old tree steps nailed into the north-east side of
the tree. Rest assured, you are on the right track.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Continue west on the trail another 100 paces. Here you will find a
couple small pine trees a few feet below the north edge of the
cliff. The top of the first small pine is only eye-level. It would
be a nice spot to stop a take a photo of a caching buddy as you
also have a nice view of the pond.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Continue on another 100 paces. At the large lone 14&quot; pine, near the
cliff's edge, you need to look to the south or left of the trail.
Just twenty paces away you will find a down tree where caching
sense will lead you to the hide location. You will find this
Letterbox cache in a hollow log.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Once the cache is found should relax on the fallen tree trunk. Here
you can stamp your personal logbook with the stamp in the cache
(please place back in cache when done) and stamp our logbook with
your stamp. If you do not have a stamp, feel free to draw something
for us to enjoy. If you can't draw, please sign your name.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please replace stamp and logbook into each of their respective
ziploc bags to prevent the ink on the stamp from ruining the
logbook. Some wipes are provided in case it gets messy. Please
carefully return the cache as you found it for others to enjoy in
the future.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks to the folks at Rubberstamps.net for their quality
stamps.


&lt;br/&gt;




&lt;b&gt;What's the
Challenge?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The true challenge is staying on task as the cachers will be
distracted by the scenic views and wildlife. Take the time to savor
your surroundings on your return hike back to the campground.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please leave this site a little more pristine for the next cacher
by practicing C.I.T.O. as you return to your vehicle.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
