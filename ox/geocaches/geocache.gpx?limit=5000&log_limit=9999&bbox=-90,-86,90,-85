Most wouldn't know that the Apalachicola Northern Railroad even existed or that it has a long history in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache was placed to bring you out to some lesser known parts of Apalachicola.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have fun finding this one! If you have some time and want a wonderful view of the Apalachicola River where you can drive up to to the water and also see the train's bridge spanning the over the water, continue driving up the road and turn left where you see the blue Boat Ramp sign. Just follow the newly paved road to the end.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here is some information that was Googled on the internet about the railroad: http://www.trainweb.org/eastrail/apnor.html</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;St Andrew's State Park is a 1200 acre wildlife preserve and
state recreation area that sits on two barrier islands that form an
inlet between the Gulf of Mexico and the Grand Lagoon. The main
park is developed with amenities, roads and trails. The other half
of the park is Shell Island, accessible only by boat or ferry and
is undeveloped. The park has nearly two miles of beautiful white
sand beaches. There is an abundance of land and sea life. In the
1940s it was a military reservation used as a lookout point. It
became a state park in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an offset scuba cache. Scuba gear is required for
retrieving the first stage. For the first part you will be looking
for a Granite block placed in memory of a young man named Danny
McKinnon. The above coordinates should put you pretty close to it.
The block sits at a depth of 35'. I could not get exact coords as
my gps does not work well at 35'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the parking lot at the Kiddy Pool and jetty area to park.
Set up your equipment either in the parking lot or at the pavilion
area where there are picnic tables and shade available. Use the
boardwalk to access the beach and do a shore entry into the water
at the kiddy pool. I recommend you enter through a break in the
rocks towards the center of the Jetty. Once you cross over the
rocks the Granite block should be to the right approximately 15
yards at a depth of 35'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need the dates of Birth and Death on the granite block
to complete the following equation and ultimately find the final
location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Birth Month) = A&lt;br /&gt;
(Birth Day) + (3) = B&lt;br /&gt;
(Birth Month) - (5) = C&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Birth Day) - (1) = D&lt;br /&gt;
(Death Day) - (1) = E&lt;br /&gt;
(Death Month) - (1) = F&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
N30° 7.ABC&lt;br /&gt;
W085° 44.DEF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache was placed with permission from Saint Andrews State
park Manager - Brian Addison. Per Mr. Addison's request we
recommend caution when retrieving the final. Alligators and snakes
are known to frequent the surrounding area throughout the year.
Please be aware of your surroundings when looking for this or any
cache in the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Additional Information that may be useful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Park Fees:&lt;/strong&gt; Admission Fee--$8.00 per vehicle&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dive Rules:&lt;/strong&gt; Follow Florida State dive laws. Dive
flag required for diving anywhere outside the jetty tidal
pool.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Best time to dive:&lt;/strong&gt; At &quot;high slack tide&quot; (approx.
1-2hrs before high tide) Check local tide tables for time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dive Conditions:&lt;/strong&gt; strong currents can exist due to
incoming/outgoing tide. Best time for lowest current and best
visibility is at high slack tide. Depths to 65 feet in main
channel. Beware of boat traffic above and use a dive flag as
required by law.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations to Bulldog Duo for FTF!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;

coordinates will take you to public parking that is near the
location of the cache.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Congratulation Kennedyblue on your promotion.
You will be missed in Panama City.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 This cache has been named to honor one of America’s great
inventors, Alexander Graham Bell. Some research will be required to
find parts of the coordinates for the location of this cache. The
coordinates are: 30 09.ABC N 085 39.DEF W A. G. Bell was born in
Edinburg, Scotland on March 3, 18A7. He invented the telephone in
187E. He received US Patent # 174,46D for this invention. There is
some mystery over whether or not Bell was the first to invent the
telephone. There are two other men that people claim invented the
telephone. Elisha ______(#1) filed a caveat, incomplete patent
application asking for more time, the same day that Bell filed his
patent. In 2002, the US House recognized ________(#2) Meucci as the
real inventor. He invented a prototype of the telephone almost 20
years before Bell. Research shows that he was too poor to pay for
the patent. Bell has several other inventions and patents. These
include a metal detector, improvements to the telegraph,
photophone, audiometer, a precursor to the iron lung, work on
alternative fuels and aeronautics. To find F, take the first letter
of the missing last name (#1) and add it to the first letter of the
missing first name (#2), (A,B,C=1,2,3 and so on). To find B &amp; C
go to the NE corner of Luverne Ave and 5th St. There is a time
capsule that was placed at this location by the Telephone Pioneers
of America. I have no idea what is in the capsule, and I am
curious. According to the plaque at the site, the capsule will be
opened in 20GH. I guess I will have to wait a little while to find
out. BC=GH +5. It should be a short walk to the cache location from
the time capsule. Good luck!&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: BMY69M - Bells Mystery&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___</groundspeak:long_description>

Since pwcinpc was the first cacher I met from PC and this one was not a lampskirt, decided it would be the one.  Called the owner to see if he wanted to be there to see me make it (or fail) and then met him there.  I also hit GZ at the parking area, then said, &quot;Where would I hide a cache here?&quot;  After a few more minutes of nervously searching (since pwcinpc was watching), I spot it.  WOOHOO!  Find #1,000!!!  Therefore, I would name this Milestone Pond.  Thanks, Phil.</groundspeak:text>

 This will have muggles around much of the time. But with proper
stealth techniques, you should go undetected. I did in hiding it.
This container is camoflauged and about the size of a film
container. It contains only a log so please bring your own
pen.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">You MUST go after dark and have a bright flashlight to find this cache. I would also recommend that you go with a group (at least two). One person to look for the &quot;EYES&quot; that mark the path and the other to watch the path for &quot;critters&quot;. Also the ground is uneven and you should walk with caution. MINIMAL bushwacking is required, no digging is required, although standing water may have to be crossed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UPDATE 06/26/2010: Went to check on cache and replace any missing &quot;eyes&quot;. The original pathway has brush grown up making this an even more adventurous trip. It hasn't rained much lately and the small lake is practically dry and can be crossed with no wading. Have posted some pics to guide you on this trip but of course you will be taking the trip at night and the pics will not help much.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The above coordinates will take you to the parking area. You will then begin sweeping your flashlight to look for the &quot;bright eyes&quot; that will be looking at you and guide you to the cache. The cache is a plastic camoflauged container that contains some swag, TB and log with pen. Please place it back as you find it. You will pass several sets of eyes along your journey and then you should see four eyes that are guarding the cache. It is about 0.2 mile from the parking and only takes about 5 minutes to walk in the daytime. But, you will be going at night and this should increase the search time. Please post your search time (be honest) as this will be interesting as to how difficult this truly is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The coordinates listed above will not take you to the cache, but you must answer the questions to gain the correct coordinates of the cache. The cache is located at a small church where my son preaches. Some questions provide two numbers of the missing coordinates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This puzzle will require the use of a Bible and/or other reference material to look up the answers unless you are an extremely good Bible student. There will be a few hints below if you feel you need them.&lt;br/&gt;The true coordinates are N30 AA BCC and W085 DD EEF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question AA Number of generations from Abraham to David plus number of generations from David to the Exile minus number of generations from the Exile to Christ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question B Number of fish used to feed the 5,000?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question CC How old was Moses when he appealed to Pharoah to free the Israelites?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question DD Number of books in the Old Testament minus the number mentioned most often in Ephesians 4:4-6?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question EE What verse in Psalms 119 contains the following quote, &quot;I will hasten and not delay to obey your commands&quot;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Question F How many others were crucified with Jesus?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fun is in searching the scriptures for the coordinates and then searching the coordinates for the cache. Cache is small so you should bring your own pen to sign log. Also BE CAREFUL when opening container as it is upside down and contents will spill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on Geochecker.com.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>AA is Matthew 1:17

DD no hint necessary

&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As my cache placed in 2008 near the entrance to
this park states, there will be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencaching.com/#geocache/OX18TK8&quot;&gt;Bigger Things to Come&lt;/a&gt;. This new
park has grown to include many new businesses, a few new caches and
now this new series of walking trails and park. You need to come
enjoy its beauty, take a walk in the woodlands and write your
experience in the online log.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There are many trails through out this new park and
Osprey trail begins near the Visitor Center and proceeds northward
along the western boundary. Although this trail indicates that
bicycles are allowed I recommend that you have the proper tires as
the road/trail is sandy in spots. The Whitetail Trail is the third
trail you come to that will take you through the wetlands and pine
plantations back to eastern boundary. Another nice boardwalk that
crosses the wetlands.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache is located about one mile north of the

road but no motorized vehicles are allowed. While it is sandy in
spots I was able to ride my bicycle the entire distance to cache

more about the trails and wildlife in this park. But do not sit for

&lt;p&gt;There are several types of wild animals in this
park although bears are not listed. But apparently at one time this
mammal roamed these trails, hence the name of the trail in the
picture. Approach this cache container with caution as you never

I recently made a camping/geocaching trip out of town and was
pleased to see this sign on my return and wanted to place a cache
here for all of us weary cachers that just have to stop for one
more find. There is also a benchmark nearby that you will want to
log as well. The container is a camoflauged small container that
has some swag and could hold small TB or coins. Although this is on
a remote section of this highway there is a house next door that
may contain muggles at times so care should be taken. Also note the
sign that indicates that you are under video
surveillance. So I guess muggles could be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I grew up coming to this landing to fish with my dad and grandpa and never knew of the history here. It was only discovered while trying to &quot;google&quot; the park and see if there were any new rules for a camping trip my brother and I were planning. We thought it would be nice to share this piece of history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most significant incidents of the First Seminole War took place on March 13, 1818, just 12 miles by road from downtown Two Egg, Florida. Ekanachatte (&quot;Red Ground&quot;) was an noted Lower Creek village that stood at the site of Neal's Landing Park. The park, located off State Highway 2 where it intersects with the Chattahoochee River and the Georgia line, occupies a location rich in local history. In addition to the Indian village, it was also the site of a British camp during the American Revolution and later of a major steamboat landing that operated in the 19th and 20th centuries. When the First Seminole War erupted in 1817, Ekanachatte was a prominent and prosperous town. Led by the powerful chief Econchattimico (&quot;Red Ground King&quot;), the village had received a huge influx of refugees who left their homes in central Alabama fleeing the devastation of the Creek War of 1813-1814. Most of these individuals were fiercely anti-American, due to the losses they had suffered at the hands of the American armies that advanced through their nation. As a result and also because Econchattimico and his sub-chiefs feared the U.S. Armies might turn south, Ekanachatte was among the villages that formed an alliance with the British when they arrived on the Apalachicola River during the summer of 1814. The War of 1812 was then raging and the British were preparing for new campaigns in the South. They hoped that the thousands of Indian allies they recruited could be used as an irregular force to assist in subduing Georgia and the Mississippi Territory. The stunning American victory at the Battle of New Orleans stalled these plans, however, and the War of 1812 ended before the Indian forces could take part in major fighting. The British withdrew from the Apalachicola and the Creeks and Seminoles were left on their own. In November of 1817, however, U.S. troops from Fort Scott in today's Decatur County, Georgia, attacked the Lower Creek village of Fowltown. The attack was largely unprovoked and led to a massive uprising by the chiefs and warriors of the Creek and Seminole villages scattered across North Florida, Southwest Georgia and Southeast Alabama. Econchattimico and his warriors joined the war against the whites, taking part in the Battle of Ocheesee on the Apalachicola River on December 15-20, 1817. A dramatic drop of temperatures took place about that time, however, as one of the coldest winters in recorded history settled on the Two Egg area. The volcano Tambora in Indonesia had erupted the previous year, sending so much ash into the atmosphere that it temporarily changed the climate of much of the world. Snow was reported in New England in July and across Florida that winter, ice and snow were common. Running streams froze over and humans and animals alike suffered. Knowing that the Indians were huddled around fires in their villages, General Andrew Jackson took advantage of the severe weather to march an army south to the frontier. Thousands of troops were called to duty, among them 1,500 Creek Indians. Led by Brigadier General William McIntosh, the war chief of Coweta, these warriors had sided with U.S. forces during the earlier Creek War and agreed once again to fight against their relatives and tribesmen. Leaving Fort Mitchell, Alabama, in early March of 1818, McIntosh and his warriors started down the Chattahoochee. A sub-chief named Major Lovett was sent with 600 of these to scour the east bank of the river, while the main force moved down the west side of the Chattahoochee under McIntosh himself. Their objective was Econchattimico and his village near Two Egg. Conditions during the march were horrible. A heavy snow fell during early March of 1818 and the men had to break up ice in ponds and creeks in order to wade across. Despite such conditions, however, they continued forward. As he neared the Florida line, McIntosh left the main trail to prevent Econchattimico's scouts from detecting his approach. The plan succeeded. As the Creek force neared Ekanachatte on the night of March 12, 1818, none of Econchattimico's warriors knew they were coming. Swinging around the head of Irwin's Mill Creek and crossing into Florida, McIntosh spread his warriors into battle formation and attacked the village on the morning of March 13, 1818. The residents of Ekanachatte were taken completely by surprise. What feeble resistance they could offer was quickly snuffed out and McIntosh's warriors rounded up 53 captured men and 130 women and children. In the midst of the post-battle confusion, 20 of the captured warriors suddenly made a break for freedom. They were shot down by their captors.Econchattimico was not among them. Prisoners told McIntosh that he had left a day or two earlier with 30 warriors to round up a herd of cattle that was hidden along the upper Chipola River. Leaving one group of men to gather supplies and other booty, the general turned west on the old Pensacola-St. Augustine Road (which ran roughly parallel to today's State Highway 2) with the rest of his force. They caught up with the chief somewhere west of Malone and captured the herd of cattle in a second brief skirmish. Econchattimico and most of his warriors, however, escaped. Turning back to Ekanachatte, McIntosh had the houses, corncribs, council house and other structures of the village burned to the ground. He then proceeded on to Fort Scott with the surviving male prisoners, while the women and children were sent to the Creek villages up the Chattahoochee River. No marker or monument points out the site of Ekanachatte today, but the Chattahoochee River still flows past the site just as it did more than 190 years ago.

Please replace container exactly as you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache has been hidden with property owners permission. Feel free to stop in and say hello.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Rip Hewes Stadium is a 10,000-seat stadium located in Dothan, Alabama.  It is primarily used for high school football, as well as other sporting and community events. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;W.D. “Rip” Hewes was born in Lowell, Arizona. After graduating from high school in Wayne, Oklahoma, he attended Arkansas Tech and the University of Alabama. He played at Alabama and was roommate with the legendary Paul “Bear” Bryant. Hewes accepted a teaching/coaching position at Fort Deposit, Alabama in 1933. He moved to Dothan in 1936 as science teacher and football coach at Dothan High School. The 1937 Dothan High Tigers had a 9-0 season. He continued to coach the “Tigers” for 12 very successful years, except for a three-year tour of duty in the Navy. He served as the city of Dothan’s Recreation Director from 1950-1966. He was a charter member and organizer of the Dixie Youth Baseball Program. Coach Hewes was recognized for his contributions to his community with the naming of a softball field and, in 1964, the new football stadium was named “Rip” Hewes Football Stadium.</groundspeak:long_description>

There are several in the Dothan area but few have been left visible. This cache is a two-stage multi. The coordinates above will take you to Stage 1. &lt;br /&gt; Stage 1 should take you directly in front of a Benchmark (BT0814) at a historic site. To get the coordinates for Final Satge you will need to gather two bits of information and plug them into the formula below. First, look for the Benchmark in the wall and get the date on the disk. Second, find the historic marker and get the date of construction for the site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coordinates for Final Stage:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Construction Date) – 1241 = answer1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Benchmark Date) – 1571 = answer2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;31° 12. (answer1)&lt;br /&gt;85° 23. (answer2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Final Stage, like Stage 1, is a great location to see a play or get in touch with your artistic side.

Depending on what time of year you try to get this one the terrain rating could change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You could get muddy or wet if it has rained recently, so cacher beware. Also watch out for snakes and other seasonal critters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy caching! Now go get it!</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;
Donated by Coffeeandspiders.&lt;br /&gt;
-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I've always been partial to caches in graveyards. Day or night, they're always so tranquil and undisturbed.&lt;br /&gt;
This particular cemetery was the first in the city from what I understand. The land was donated by John Carmichael. Who also donated the land where the first store on this side of town and the first Methodist church were also built.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1982, there was a monumental plaque put up here at the front entrance in thanks to the man who donated so much land to the beginnings of what later became Enterprise.&lt;br /&gt;
I'll include pictures of the plaques in the gallery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you have any other information about this cemetery or have a love one buried here, please feel free to share with everyone in your log, and happy caching!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Cache is a painted lock-n-lock container capable of housing small travel bugs and small loot.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Some dreams are the result of necessity. Such was the case when it came to a means of supplying safe potable water to the rural citizens of Russell County. With the water table dropping and fresh water streams becoming more and more polluted, the establishment of a rural water system was inevitable. For Russell County that dream began with a small group, the county's elected commissioner, county attorney and an engineering firm, in 1972. That group - Commissioners Otis Taff, George Mitchell and Menza M. Dudley; County Attorney Roy Greene and Motisi Associated Engineers - took the first step to see that dream would be fulfilled by naming a rural water board which became the Ladonia-Crawford Water and Fire Protection Authority. The members of the first board were George Findlater, Henry Averett and H.L. Freeman. One year later the system began operation. With two deep wells capable of producing 300 gallons per minute of water and a million gallon storage reservoir, the system furnished water to 900 customers.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;HIDDEN: FN3Q01H - Final Location&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIDDEN: S13Q01H - Final Directions&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;This point tells you where to find the cache!</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Once at GZ, this should be pretty easy to retrieve.  Good luck getting up there!  This trail can be treacherous and I do not suggest doing it at night although it is possible.  Make sure you use the trail to get there, walking through the brush might be difficult! I sometimes visit this area to ride my bike and enjoy the outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;

I started this wish some swag and a small FTF prize.  Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;

Came back today.  We took the only obvious trail but don't think that was the trail we were supposed to take.  However, we made it to GZ.  Spotted the cache after a brief search.  We used our best stealth skills on site since we were so close to the house.  Found a shorter, though I am not sure it was easier, way out.  Glad that one is done.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;This is a simple cache with a short walk, very slight elevation
changes, and available only during daylight hours. This cache will
take you to see some old ruins used before technology advancement.
You are looking for a medium sized lock n' lock box. Please make
sure to recover the container since it’s apparent this is a local
social hangout area and forestation is practiced very close by. The
last container was destroyed by a controlled burn, and eventually
this one will be too, but until then, enjoy caching! Park at the
posted parking coords (32 27.439 85 37.380) and follow the arrow,
as it will lead you up the path to your destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;***NOTICE
-- Climbing the lookout tower is NOT allowed -- Grafitti and other
defacing is worthless and so unneccessary -- PLEASE respect the
area, and rehide the cache exactly as you found it, or as it is
described by the owner here -- THANK YOU***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A traditional straight forward 30 cal. ammo box cache located in
a very cool spot with a most amazing view of Lake Martin. You will
be thrilled as you arrive at the Fire Tower coordinates. The area
appears to have been a public park at some point, and there are
picnic tables, an old broken BBQ pit, and a walking trail that will
take you to nearby Sandy Creek Bluff, or even down to beautiful
Lake Martin. We did find one no tresspassing sign at the end of one
of the roads that lead to the site, but there are several ways to
approach the area. This cache can be done by car, boat, 4 wheeler,
or foot. The 4 star terrain rating is the worse case scenario, if
you park at the bottom of the mountain, on the land side, and walk
straight up, but there are logging roads, and service roads that
make it possible to drive to the area, if you have the right
vehicle (we were in a jeep, and someone else came up in a SUV while
we were there). We are starting this one off with a few trinkets, a
log book, and a couple of my copy-coin trackables. So enjoy your
visit!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;***NOTICE
-- Climbing the lookout tower is NOT allowed -- Grafitti and other
defacing is worthless and so unneccessary -- PLEASE respect the
area, and rehide the cache exactly as you found it, or as it is
described by the owner here -- THANK YOU***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

above, and use the information there to decipher the coordinates
for the final cache, which is in a small green ammo box.

In commemoration of American Independence Day, the 4th of July, we
found the grave of a Revolutionary War soldier. Pvt. James Langley
of Chambers County, Alabama, served in the North Carolina Militia
during the American Revolution, and is buried at the Mount Pisgah
Primitive Baptist Cemetery in Chambers County. Of course it is neat
to run across a grave that old which has a nice stone that can be
read. It is also an honor to find the grave of one of the brave men
who fought to give our country her independence. But this grave is
also special because Mr. Langley lived to be 106 years old!!! I
just couldn't help but honor this man by bringing some attention to
his memorial and thus his life! Find his grave using the above
coordinates. Then use the information on his marker stone to solve
the following, and find the final cache coordinates: 1. Count the
total number of letters on the marker and multiply that number by
33.3 = ABC 2. Add the sum total of all the numbers on the marker,
double that number, and then add 10 = DE N 33-03.ABC W 085-20.0DE
HAPPY HUNTING!

type road. During or just after precipitation will require a
4-wheel drive vehicle to drive to within .2 mile of the cache, but
there is also the option of walking in from about .7 of a mile,
when the roads are the worst.

&lt;p&gt;***UPDATE*** I visited the cache for maintenance today (10-3-08)
and was able to drive my Toyota Rav4 to within 50' of the cache.
I'm not sure this will always be the case, but just informing
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is in a really neat spot that not too many know about
other than the locals. Plan to spend some time and enjoy the
surrounding area. You are once again looking for a 50 cal. ammo box
as I have recovered the original container that was placed here in
2002. It is a straight forward GA hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***NOTE -- I originally posted this cache as being in Georgia,
to discourage you from approaching it from the Alabama side. It can
be done, but you might not like me, or any of my ancestors, if you
do it that way! -- This is a pleasant experience from the GA side,
but a booger from the AL side!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is an excellent opportunity for cache in, trash
out!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Here is a humble offering for those of you who like to discover
geocoins. Are you somehow interested in collecting icons? (The
goofy little pictures that show up on your profile pages?) Then
this is the cache for you.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You are looking for a treasure chest hidden pirate style at the
above coordinates. PLEASE make sure and rehide exactly as you find
it. The hide is not meant to be so hard to find, but it is rated
3.5 difficulty because I know somewhere along the line there will
be someone who experiences it this way. If you like to discover
geocoins, I am making my collection available to you through this
cache. There is a gift for you inside, but please only take one,
please don't share it with anyone else, and if there is only one
left, please don't take it. There is another alternative, or I will
be glad to take care of you, just let me know. ~ I have also
included something special, with my name on it, for the
FTFer!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I want to dedicate this cache to all the poor players who have
nothing better to do with their time than argue about what I should
or shouldn't do on the forums. Also the ones that feel that they
should make the nasty comments about my fake copies of my geocoins
that I have circulated. It amazes me that so many people have the
mentality that they should decide what is right, and that they have
the right to control everyone else. But take solace in the fact
that you were successful. I have stopped making and releasing them.
You took all the fun out of it for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also dedicate this cache to the player(s) that take all the
geocoins out of my resort hotel and don't leave any to replace, and
say that it is a prison, and that you are rescuing them. You too
are real work of art, but hey, you are in control of me, and I hope
that makes you happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is also dedicated to the relatively local cacher who
takes the &quot;fake&quot; coins and puts them into his own cache, where they
conveniently disappear forever; unless you beat him to it, and get
them back [;D] and just find that they have been defaced with
someones dirty comments on the card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I don't sound bitter, because I'm not. Geocaching is too
great for that. I just wanted to take this opportunity to make fun
of you for a change. I really do get lots of great comments about
the copy coins and have shared my tips with many people who wanted
to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the treasure chest is out there waiting, and there are
many discoveries (PLEASE ONLY DISCOVER THEM) to be made as well as
some trackables to pick up and move. And if YOU ever need my help;
just let me know, because I love to help others get the most fun
out of this great sport!&lt;/p&gt;

only provide us with so many wonderful nature areas to enjoy, but
also are good friends to us geocachers! We appreciate their
willingness to work with us and allow us to play our games on their
lands.

This cache is an unknown container, with no clues, only
coordinates. It is really my first attempt at an EMC, but we will
have to see if it really qualifies as such. I want to see how this
one goes, and of course, I would like as much feedback as possible
from my geobuddies out there! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I really think this one has become a little more difficult in
recent months so I'm bumping up the star levels. It started out as
a clever camo job, but that didn't last. A couple of people had
benefit of finding it while in the wide open, and brightly colored.
So we came up with another camo plan, and the same thing happened
all over again. Both times that I came here to do maintenance, I
found the cache without its clever camos. Here is my third attempt.
I truly hope that there are no DNFs on this one, because that is
not my intention. I just wanted to make a kinda EMC to present a
challenge.

You will understand why this is called the Stone Mountain Annex
when you see it! It is a fairly straight forward cache. But there
are 3 important rules that must be followed on this one. 1 -- Park
at the above coordinates! 2 -- This is a Nature Conservancy
protected area. Please do not alter anything at the site, as there
are endangered plant forms there. (No pets are allowed on this one,
nor motorized vehicles of any kind. Take as many memories as you
like, but leave everything else undisturbed!) 3 -- This cache is
perfectly safe for all members of the family as long as there is
close parental supervision at all times! There is the potential for
great danger here, but any reasonable person can visit this place
in perfect safety. JUST BE SMART!!! You will see many interesting
things in this area. Don't miss these: Something very solid...
(CAN'T MISS IT!) Something very wet... (YOU SHOULD BARELY MISS IT!)
and Something very sticky! (BETTER MISS THIS ONE!)

            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Even though you are in the wide open for most of this cache, the rock seems to act as a reflector for the signals, and they bounce around a lot. When you get near the coordinates for the cache, you should be on the Northside of a thicket of bushes and trees, and on the edge of the giant hole. You are looking for a pvc tube about one foot long, and 1.5 inches in diameter. It is hidden vertically in a crevice.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Ya'll helped me spend $240 dollars on gas [V], get a twitch in my back from sleeping in the back of my Expedition [|)], and eat more fast food than anybody should eat in two months [xx(]. BUT, in doing so, you also helped me complete 17 Delorme pages [^] and find caches in 47 new counties [:D]!! Thanks for making my &quot;break between careers&quot; more memorable!!

Very unique hide!  Took a few minutes for me to really &quot;see&quot; the cache but when I did it was obvious!  Cache is in excellent shape and ready for new cachers.  This area has got to be the best kept secret.  Very beautiful!!  T-Memories; L-Footsteps; SLTFTH

You are looking for numbers that will lead you to the 30 cal. ammo
can, hidden at the edge of the woods. All you need to do is locate
and identify the 5 Little Noles. There you will find a list of 35
single digit numbers. If you add all of these single digits
together, you will find the value of ABC to use in the following
formulas: N 33 - 16.167 - ABC = North Coords W 85 - 15.690 + ABC =
West Coords Happy Hunting!

you should be able to figure that out.

Park at N 33-16.839 / W 085-05.941 to begin your trek. If you like
history, you will want to visit this cache on Tuesdays or Thursdays
between the hours of 8:30 and 5:00, when you can tour the old
jailhouse built in 1912. It is filled with memorabilia of Heard Co.
history, and is quite interesting. Next, you can make your way
along a little over 1/2 mile of winding path, that runs along side
the Chattahoochee River. The trail is completed, although the area
is a work in progress. You will find the cache and the best view of
the river as you approach the far end of the trail.&lt;br /&gt;

so do I. The purpose of this series is to pay sincere tribute to
this areas Geocaching Hall of Famers.

I've had this idea for a while, and had already made out my short
list of those that I wanted to induct, and the reasons why; but I
also have done some informal surveys, where the participants did
not know that they were being surveyed. And when it comes to the
southside, there is one name that always comes up -- SOLAR! The
word on the street is &quot;this guy doesn't even know how to spell
DNF!&quot; One person said: &quot;there hasn't been a cache hidden that Solar
can't find.&quot; LZ33 lost his GPSr out in the woods; went back and
tried to find it, but couldn't; and Solar heard about the mishap,
then went out and found the thing based on just a phone call!
There's been a time or two when a cache or a stage was missing, and
Solar reported finding it 100-200 feet away; while most of us can't
find something if the coords are 40 feet off! If you look up his
stats, you will find that it says he logged 1174 caches, but you
will also notice that the last one was logged in August of 2005.
For some mysterious reason he no longer logs his finds on the
website. We joking say that it's not about the numbers, but Solar
proves it! There is no telling just how many cache logs he has
actually signed, or how many of them were FTFs. But then super
heroes usually do keep their true identity a secret!!! I am sure
that he wouldn't want the attention, but there are several of us
that think Solar is the best cacher of all time. Thanks for your
friendship, and your contribution to the game!

near Roopville, Georgia, incorporated a slated floor and sub-floor
heating ducts, to regulate airflow, temperature, and humidity to
cure sweet potatoes faster so that they would last through the
winter cold. The storage house with its brightly painted Coca-Cola
advertisements, is still one of the most photographed landmarks in
West Georgia. In the Springtime, the field just North of the
structure is planted with Sunflowers that are used in non-profit
fund raisers in the area.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A local man, along
with Coke officials arranged for the creation of a collectible
bottle honoring the Sweet Potato House. The bottles were sold for
$15.00 each, and all 960 of them were sold out within 35 minutes.
Sales of the bottle helped pay for the restoration project of this
local landmark, which certainly would not have lasted too much
longer as it was.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson’s
Sweet Potato Curing Shed also has another claim to fame in this
part of the state. The site used to be a drop-off point for area
students attending Berry College in Rome, and this resulted in US
27 being named Martha Berry Highway by the Georgia Department Of
Transportation. The locals around these parts just know that the
&quot;potato house&quot; is the coolest landmark for miles around!&lt;/p&gt;

I start my new career as a conductor for Norfolk Southern Railroad next week and Mama reluctantly gave me a kitchen pass so I could work on the Georgia Delorme challenge AND my personal &quot;All Counties Quest&quot;. I had a great time traveling the state and would like to thank all the locals who placed the caches on the route I traveled. BTW, how'd ya'll know I was coming down your road [;)]?? 

Ya'll helped me spend $240 dollars on gas [V], get a twitch in my back from sleeping in the back of my Expedition [|)], and eat more fast food than anybody should eat in two months [xx(]. BUT, in doing so, you also helped me complete 17 Delorme pages [^] and find caches in 47 new counties [:D]!! Thanks for making my &quot;break between careers&quot; more memorable!!

Quick and Easy find! Spotted the building as I was driving south to my last planned cache stop and the building immediately registered as having seen it before.  So I stopped and called the wife and she confirmed a cache would be there and gave me the coords.  Cache is in great shape and ready for the next logger!  T-Memories; L-Footsteps; SLTFTH

Coordinates will take you to possibly the sharpest FIRE/LOOKOUT
TOWER you will EVER see! Follow the directions below to find the
final cache coordinates. Located on Mt. Cheaha, Alabama's highest
elevation, this area is filled with breathtaking views, natural
beauty, and plenty of fresh air! Built by the CCC (Civilian
Conservation Corps) in the 1930's, this park is filled with great
rock work, and the Lookout Tower is as good as it gets! Much of the
time, the tower is open to the public, and you can climb and
observe for yourself. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To find the final cache, go to the above coords and find the Tower.
In front, there are two signs as you approach the structure: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Count the letters on the oval sign, and you will get a two digit
number. Multiply that number by 601.375 to find ABCD in the
coordinates below. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now look to the left at the redwood sign. There is a multi-digit
number there. Add 6147 to this number to find EFGH. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Final Cache Coordinates: N 33-2A.BCD by W085-4EFGH The cache is not
meant to fool YOU, but please replace it carefully and hide it very
well, and make sure that NO ONE sees you remove or replace it. The
hint below is a complete spoiler so don't look unless you want to
know.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
*PLEASE NOTE* There is a $1.00 fee for each person to enter the
park (well worth it just to see the tower!) and the park is only
open during daylight hours.

so do I. The purpose of this series is to pay sincere tribute to
this areas Geocaching Hall of Famers.

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
I've had this idea for a while, and had already made out my short
list of those that I wanted to induct, and the reasons why; but
this one is a bit of a no-brainer... Who is the LEANEST, MEANEST,
CACHING MACHINE, IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA??? There is no doubt about
it; the caching couple from Acworth that is always SMILING! And I
do mean that literally. I've never seen these dear people that they
didn't greet me with a smile, and even talking to them over the
phone, or through e-mail you can feel that they really earn their
name. 
&lt;p&gt;The first time I met these two, they had only been geocaching
for 5 months; but I knew something was up, because they had already
signed over 800 logs at that time! Since that time, they have
visited over 6000 more caches, making them number one in the state
of Georgia! Most of this was done while they were both working full
time; but WATCH OUT because this dynamic duo are retired now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite story that I like to tell on Sam is that we were
geocaching one time, and came up on an awesome waterfall. Being
awestruck at the sight, I said &quot;Sam, isn't that a beautiful
waterfall?&quot; to which he replies without even slowing his pace &quot;I
DIDN'T COME UP HERE TO LOOK AT NO WATERFALL!&quot; -- It's really not
altogether true, and he's not quite that bad, but I will tell you
we've been caching together a few times, and it is a pace that will
wear you out! We've had some great fun out there, and I hope to get
to do it again soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt these people are SICK, and OBSESSED with their
geocaching, but there really is more to the story than that... I
don't know all the details (maybe someone will e-mail me with the
information) but I do remember a story about a geocacher that went
geocaching somewhere in the mountains by himself. When he didn't
show up at home when he was supposed to, his wife made some calls
to other geocachers; and when word got to Sam he dropped what he
was doing and headed for the hills to look for the missing
geocacher. I'm not sure what happened from there, and I think the
cacher was ok anyway, but that's enough of the story to show you
what an asset SIA is to geocaching!&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">By special permission of Team PEZ, I am starting a series of copy
cat caches. I really enjoyed the catchy name of the Publix Enemy
cache, and so with proper credit given to the originator of said
catchy name, I want to hide microcaches at many of these locations,
for that is where I have been employed for the last 26+ years!

As the first in this copy cat series of caches, this one must be a
little special, because this is the exact location that I work at
most of the time (although I do travel around from time to time).
The coords above will get you to a certain starting point, then you
are on your own, without help from your GPSr. The location is
suggested by the following clue that should be really easy, I
think. But the sport comes in getting in and out, and not being
realized for the geoperson you really are. The micro-cache is the
familiar black magnetic key holder, and that should be a clue in
and of itself. Your clue for the find is: Be careful that Mr.
Whipple does not see you loitering in this place, or ULTRAmately he
might put the squeeze on YOU! ***PLEASE BE CAREFUL TO LEAVE THINGS
AS YOU FOUND THEM SO THAT MR. WHIPPLE WILL NOT FROWN ON OUR PLAYING
OUR GAMES IN HIS PLACE!*** No room for exchanges, just sign the log
book, and return here for the smiley. ***WARNING -- DO NOT DECRYPT
AND READ THE HINT BELOW, UNLESS YOU WANT A FULL DESCRIPTION OF
WHERE TO FIND THE CACHE. I KNOW THIS WILL TAKE ALL THE FUN OUT OF
IT, AND THAT SOME OF YOU WILL MAKE THE MISTAKE OF READING THIS
FIRST, BUT I, FOR ONE, CANNOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF YOUR MISSING THIS
ONE, BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND THE CLUE!***

&lt;p&gt;The posted coords are for the old lookout tower. This cache will
take you to the top of Horseblock Mountain with an elevation of
1444 ft. With plenty of parking and little elevation changes this
short hike on the old road will offer scenic views and old
technology that fought fires.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 To find the find the ammo box you must find the benchmark Able
(DG1856) the highest point of the mountain and find benchmark Able
RM 2 (DG1857). The cache is 141 degrees from Able and 124 degrees
from RM 2. Remember this is a puzzle cache so please do not give
any hint or clues in your log so the next finder has the same
advantages as the FTF. Park at 33 33.663 085 42.283 and the old
road trailhead is just to the east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;***NOTICE
-- Climbing the lookout tower is NOT allowed -- Grafitti and other
defacing is worthless and so unneccessary -- PLEASE respect the
area, and rehide the cache exactly as you found it, or as it is
described by the owner here -- THANK YOU***&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It was several inches under the leaves and ground debris. We shot the needed angles and made a quick find. We removed some ammunition from the cache that didn't belong and took Terrier's #37 wooden signiture coin. A great hide! Thanks for the fun!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;This Fire Tower is located on the Shoal Creek Ranger District of
the Talladega National Forest. It is in great shape. The tower is
being used for radio equipment, as are many of these old
structures. The above coords are for the tower, and the geocache
itself is an offset cache. To find the cache box, start at the
above coords and then go 135.92 meters at a bearing of 236 degrees
and 6.5333 minutes. There you will find the 50 cal. ammo box
entombed.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is the fourth of a series that we have
been planning for awhile. This is based on the nursery school
counting rhyme. According to Henry Bolton, collector of counting
rhymes in the 1880s, the rhyme was used in Wrentham, Massachusetts
as early as 1780. We will be using versions that were popular in
1805 and 1810. The lines have varied slightly over the years. These
are your basic run of the mill caches that were placed to closely
resemble the line of the rhyme which they represent.
&lt;p&gt;This one was a stretch for us as we had a hard
time finding something to go with &quot;straight&quot;. Straight as an Arrow
was as close as we could get.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

liked this cache and would like to see others in the series...
check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/bookmarks/view.aspx?guid=5f8cdf56-25fc-4de5-9de4-2e71c38bd5b7&quot;&gt;
bookmark list&lt;/a&gt;. If you are interested in
placing a cache in this series, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=6b12888a-9575-43b4-93fe-32fa34cdaa8b&quot;&gt;
AFT&lt;/a&gt; page for more
information.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Coordinates will take you to the end of Mountain Road, where you
will get a look at another fine specimen of the bygone Fire/Lookout
Tower days. There is also a breathtaking view of the town of
Jacksonville and the surrounding area. Much thanks to Nobodys Home
for his Overlook cache which brought me to this beautiful spot.
Whenever I can, I like to add the great old firetowers to the
series, so I just had to come back up here and show the wife and
whoever else will care to visit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is not however, at the posted coordinates. This is an
offset cache. To find the final cache, go to the above coords,
checkout the tower, and enjoy the view. Then proceed back down the
mountain &lt;b&gt;803.52 feet&lt;/b&gt; at a bearing of &lt;b&gt;201.81°&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Actually, it's easier if you work all that out before you leave
that computer you're sitting at right now! There are online and
software tools that will help you find another set of coords using
the above information, and you can check your figures using
GEOCHECKER below. We hope you enjoy this offering of the firetower
series!&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; While walking the trail I came across this
interesting feature. Most of the terrain is paved walking track
except for the last 30ft or so. Could be slippery on the hillside
so use caution. Please do not attempt to retrieve this from the
highway or the backroad as tempting as it may be. It will be easier
to walk the track than scale the hill. I have listed parking
coordinates and shouldn't take more than a few minutes to approach
this one correctly. This is a small container suitable for small
trade items or trackables. Logbook and pen

You are looking for a smaller ammo box just off cemetery grounds. The cache is very kid friendly and full of new swag. Please exchange fairly and make sure to cover and hide the cache back exactly as you found it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a stamp book and log book plus a stamper for your book as well if you have one. There is also a first to find gift card in the log book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Go to the cords and park. Get out and find the Twin Mooney Towers - they interestingly look like the NY Twin Towers from 9/11. You will know it when you see them. When standing behind the towers, face South and go 13 paces - square up to the West: you will see the only CSA tombstone in the graveyard - of Pvt Baxter. Subtract the last 2 digits of his death from the last 2 digits of his birth. Go that many feet into the wooded area heading west from behind the soldier's headstone to find the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Could be a challenge for a beginner or even a novice. Evil? You be the judge of that! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back road caching is some of the best caching around! This road sees very little travel which makes it a good place to place a cache! As we were making our way down the road I noticed the sign inside the fence. I knew then a cache must be placed. Pull off as best as you can so the road is not blocked incase there were a car or tractor to come by. Happy Caching!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Please leave something if you take something. Please replace just as you found it so it will stay here. Keith also made some homemade twisty style cache containers and put logs already in them, ready to go. Please take one of them as well and go hide it for us to find. We are always wanting to go caching. There is a travel bug ready to be moved as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache used to be located on Hwy 411 until our hiding place was bulldozed and the cache was no longer to be found. Now it is in a new place and a bit smaller, but still will serve the same purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the stash that killed my cheap digital camera. This one&lt;br /&gt;combines a stash hunt and a maze game. The stash is hidden on the&lt;br /&gt;far side of a karst feature that consists of an approximately one&lt;br /&gt;to three acre maze of 20 to 40 foot high, tight narrow canyons that&lt;br /&gt;criss-cross and interconnect. Just to make life interesting, think&lt;br /&gt;about what you will get as far as satellite coverage while you're&lt;br /&gt;in there:) A compass might help... It's a 1.2 mile, flat and level,&lt;br /&gt;hike to Rock Town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, you could 'climb' the rocks and use your GPS, but that's&lt;br /&gt;up to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry about the lack of pictures! I'm going to be in the area&lt;br /&gt;this weekend and will try to get up there with a camera.&lt;/p&gt; 
</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Once you work your way through the maze, the stash is in a
crevice between two (three?) rocks that are each more or less the mass of an elephant.  There will be a small cave\rock shelter about 50 feet away and located about 15\20 feet up the cliff face (with a tree growing out of it) overlooking the stash.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Only one car in the lot when we got there but many more when we returned to the truck.. Made the short trip to GZ and made a quick find before doing a bit of climbing ourselves. Enjoyed our trip to the area. The round trip went faster than expected and plenty of time to cache our way back to Alabama. Took the Admin Brick geocoin that mtn-man left behind. A cherished addition to our collection! Left an unactivated geocoin for those who follow. This is the oldest cache that we have found so far! SL TFTC</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Wow!!!  We were just thrilled to find such an old cache in such a great spot! We read the cache logs and said this is a cache we GOTTA get ......so we planned it so we could pick it up on our way to the fall Talladega race. Swing thru GA and get a few old ones, and this one has been on the list for quite some time.

We drove thru tornadoes in Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee. Literally.It was a mess. We stayed overnight in Chattanooga, TN where they had a huge tornado outbreak and the first ones in 13 years.  The next morning after the tornado mayhem, we drove about an hour south to this location in Georgia. We had no idea what we were in for.

The rain made all things super slick, roads, rocks, you name it. We had about a 4 hour window to get in, get out before the monsoon season returned. That &quot;historic&quot; storm wasn't going to stop us!  We hiked about 1/4 of the way back and realized - on no - we have no pen, no pathtags, nada. Thought you had it, thought you had it, nope!  So back to the truck.  When we did finally get there - we were like 2 kids on a playground. The moss was wet and slicker than snot.  But we had a great time.  We just walked around for hours. We have climbing friends at home that will get these coords for SURE.  The truck had a great time too.

Cache find just was the icing on the cake.  Glad you didn't make us climb up to that cave to get it [;)] But took the TB that was in the cache - to take to Nevada in a few weeks - and left our signature pathtag.  Thanks for one of our favorite caches of all time. We had a blast.

&lt;h4&gt;(This is a True Story)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;On November 2, 1967, the real Johnny Cash&lt;/b&gt; and his
entourage were passing through Lafayette on their way to a concert
date in Chattanooga. This is a true account of what happened.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A retired Georgia deputy who locked up an inebriated Johnny
Cash&lt;/b&gt; over 40 years ago laughed as he recalled how the country
music star later became a generous benefactor for the
community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I got a call from a dispatcher that a guy was trying to get in
a ladys house', former Walker County deputy Bobby Edwards
remembered. 'He was standing on her front porch and leaning up
against her screen door and kind of shaking it'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards said he didnt recognize Cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Not at first. He was too slim. Id say 135 to 140 pounds at the
time', Edwards said. 'I got me a handful of pills. I knew they were
prescription pills. Black. Red and yellow. I never saw so many
colors. They were in his shirt up against his belt'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards said Cash was woozy and didnt know where he was when he
was picked up the afternoon of Nov. 2, 1967. Cash later said he
thought he was at a friends house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former deputy said that coming on down the road, he said,
`My name is Johnny Cash. I said, `My name is Bobby Edwards. Glad to
meet you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took him down to the jail. After I got down there, he had
$1,200 or $1,300, a bunch of credit cards. I said `Hey, maybe this
~is~ Johnny Cash! All the inmates starting hollering `Hey, you've
got Johnny Cash!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards said after he put Cash in a cell he must have slept 24
hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Sheriff Ralph Jones recalled privately talking to Cash
the next morning in his office:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I said I'd like to know something for my own personal
satisfaction. What would make a person like you that has the
potential of going to the top in your profession, why would you let
these pills throw you in a hog wallow and make a nobody out of you?
I'd just like to know'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could tell he was nervous, Jones said. He stood there for a
few minutes looking at me and said `Sheriff, I promise you I will
never take another one. Of course to me that went in one ear and
out the other. Jones said he released him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former sheriff said a community booster club trying to raise
money to build a band room and field house at Walker County High
School a short time later asked him to contact Cash, but he
refused. Jones said that when club members contacted Cash anyway,
he asked for the sheriff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'He asked me if we could meet him at the Ryman Auditorium the
next day at noon', Jones said. 'Some of the club members and I went
and met him'. He called his agent in and told him to book a benefit
show for LaFayette, Ga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The show took place Aug. 13, 1970 at the Ramblers
football field.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I had made him a gold-plated honorary deputy sheriff's badge
and had it mounted on a plaque', Jones recalled. 'He and June
(Carter Cash) were singing their last song and I walked up on the
stage to present him the badge and June looked around and said
`Look out, honey, here he comes again'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The concert raised more than $25,000&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Thank you Johnny Cash!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The &lt;b&gt;first&lt;/b&gt; cache container was authentic, as the story
goes. A pill bottle disguised with electrical tape. That container
has since been replaced several times.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please replace it as found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Please be aware of those who are aware of you! And WALK THE
LINE!&lt;/h4&gt;

We doubled back and found a suitable spot and made the short walk to GZ. Funny, Beep~Beep and Rooster let out a &quot;FOUND IT&quot; at almost the exact same time. It appears one of the last cachers in the area couldn't find it and dropped a replacement 10ft from the original. We found them both. We took the replacement with us to avoid further confussion.

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Shake Rag was a company town owned by McNabb Mines. Towns like this were common in the 19th and early 20th centuries. People who worked in the mines were paid in &quot;coal script&quot; company issued money, rather than US currency. As such, they were forced to rent their homes from the company and do their shopping in the company store. Many historians liken this type of work in American history to a form of slavery or servitude. Others contend that while it did tie workers to the company, it also allowed a higher standard of living than enjoyed by agricultural workers or factory workers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today the ruins of Shake Rag sit nearly forgotten on the side of a road in Marion County, Tennessee. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, these ruins are a reminder of Tennessee's past. Some of the ruins are very fragile. Please be careful!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache is an ammo box with various trade items inside.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When you reach ground zero of this virtual cache, you will be standing where history really happened! Back in the fall of 1863, Chattanooga was the prize which both the Federals and the Confederates were trying to win. The Confederates held both Orchard Knob and Missionary Ridge. As the Federals approached from the west, they first had to conquer Orchard Knob before going on to attack Missionary Ridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Federals did capture Orchard Knob in a relatively small skirmish. A few days later, Federal General Grant moved his headquarters to Orchard Knob to oversee the Battle of Missionary Ridge. I had always figured that that was a wise move, but until I actually got out to Orchard Knob I didn't realize HOW wise of a move that was! Orchard Knob really is a Knob, and on Orchard Knob one is significantly higher than the rest of the city. Missionary Ridge is indeed very close and visible from the Knob, and Lookout Mountain isn't that far away either. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, Orchard Knob is an almost forgotten piece of the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park. There is not a whole lot of parking, so you'll want to take that into consideration. The park is open sunrise to sunset, and it doesn't cost a cent to get in. There is not a lot of interpretive material, but there are many nice historical markers and statues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three gigantic monuments at Orchard Knob. Only one of these monuments can you actually walk through. To verify that you actually found this virtual, enter the name of the state that erected/whoose name is on this walk-through monument for the code phrase for this virtual cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Come to Orchard Knob and discover some awesome yet mostly unknown history! &lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well I have cached my way during my spring break to Chattanooga, TN all the way from Springfield, MO. This was a pretty neat cache to come across, i dont think i have ever came across a cache like this before. When trying to find it i keep thinking where is it, it cant be this close to my car, maybe these bushes, but then i would be to far off. this is how that went in my head a couple of times, then i stopped thinking since my gps signal was bouncing, so it was kinda useless to me at that point and then put it in my pocket and right then i found the cache container, and then need my gps device to give me the information that i need in order to open the cache box. I think i might have to bring this cache idea back to springfield so the caches can add a new cache container to their skillset. Checked out the TB's that were there, and picked up some TB's to take back on my home to Springfield.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">• Fort Williams was ordered constructed in Glasgow in the spring of 1863. It was during the spring and summer of 1863 that the Union army began to build defensive works at strategic points in Kentucky to defend transportation networks and supply depots in the Commonwealth from Confederate raids.&lt;br/&gt;• Fort Williams was constructed under the supervision of Lieut. Miles D. McAlister. who was Chief Engineer for the Department of the Ohio. He constructed a “figure 8 ” shaped redoubt, an enclosed fort, built to withstand attacks from all sides. The fort was armed with 24-pounder and 6-pounder cannon. The fort had several names but was finally officially named Fort Williams in November of 1863 in honor of Gen.Thomas Williams who was killed in battle. Glasgow was garrisoned by Union troops throughout the war. Glasgow ’s strategic importance was due to its location. It was the crossroads of several north-south and east-west roads and by June 1863 a branch of the L&amp;N Railroad.&lt;br/&gt;• On October 6, 1863 the 25th Tennessee Infantry, C.S.A., attacked Fort Williams with 120 men commanded by Col. John M. Hughes. Hughes was ordered to Kentucky to collect deserters and enforce the Confederate conscription act, that is the draft of Confederate soldiers in Kentucky, which was technically a part of the Confederacy.&lt;br/&gt;• The fort was garrisoned by the 37th Kentucky Mounted Infantry, U.S.A., commanded by Maj. Samuel Martin. The regiment numbered some 420 men. Fifty men were camped in the Court House square and 30 men were out on patrol. The men on the square were hit at dawn and then Col. Hughes attacked the fort. He reported, &quot;We killed 9, wounded 26 and captured 226, together with quartermaster’s stores in the amount of $250,000.00. My loss was 1 killed and 4 wounded.&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is not hidden inside the fort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is hidden in a small strip of woods close to the fort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please be respectful of this historic place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You will be looking for a well hidden lock and lock container about 4 inches by 8 inches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has a few trade items to trade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a daytime only cache.&lt;br/&gt;The gates close at dark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best place to park is at N36*59.904 W85*55.596</groundspeak:long_description>

I will have to say that this hill gave me as much up as the nearby Goat's Hill. I started off on the west side and worked my way across a ledge to the East side, I then made my way to the top from there. Great secluded place for a cache at the top then to keep things interesting I made my way down on the East side. Very steep I might add. I left 3 Travel Bugs to tempt some poor traveler off the highway. Thanks for another 313.</groundspeak:text>

This is the trail that the Scout shall know,&lt;br /&gt;
Where knightly qualities thrive and grow.&lt;br /&gt;
The trail of HONOR, TRUTH and WORTH,&lt;br /&gt;

Through the toughest tangle, the deepest maze.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Above Coordinate is Just
Wrong!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;It's actually: N 37° 48.212 W 085° 45.601
(Shhh..)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;To log this cache you could first determine the location
of the waypoint as illustrated on the map below which could be
tough, but accurate. Then, when you arrive there, walk 25 paces on
a bearing of 310-degrees and you will find the cache in one of
several geobvious spots.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Like in a vertical crevice behind that
big WHITE CROSS you can see from I-65, a mile
away).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

Great to meet him, he is quite a cacher running up and down this mountain like a mountain goat. Did I mention Mountain Goat? As it turns out Buffalo bob got a good look at the illusive phantom goat and even got to snap a few photos of it. This cache a gave us fits then while employing no less than 5 sets of eyes SherpaRon came up with the prise.

&lt;b&gt;ARF's 1k Golden Ammo Can&lt;/b&gt;
(You may want to contact me before you try)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are three geocache finds I will &lt;i&gt;ALWAYS&lt;/i&gt; remember!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;#1,000&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;To commemorate my 1,000th find (Fabulous Winner by Quiddler - GCH4V8) I was given a &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;GOLDEN AMMO BOX!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; It was the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Achievement TROPHY of Geocaching&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and I was darn proud of it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;I hid the box on a high ridge with a view of the Ohio River and it stayed there for a couple of years. Then geocaching was evicted from the area by the IDNR.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The box was stuck under a seat in the Jeep where it rode for a year while I considered suitable places in&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

You are seeking a GOLDEN AMMO BOX with an engraved emblem on the side. It's hidden with a great view of the Ohio Valley.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it could become someone's 1st, 100th or even 1000th find!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch for the mysterious black goat that roams these hills. He may be watching you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ooo-RAH!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
___________________________________________ ________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please replace and cover well enough, there's a &lt;b&gt;GOAT TRAIL&lt;/b&gt; nearby.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Take a camera for the MILESTONE and also to capture a pic of the elusive GOAT!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Golden Ammo Box &lt;u&gt;Award&lt;/u&gt; has been discontinued&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
However, log an ARF! Geocache or Earthcache as your &lt;b&gt;1,000th FIND&lt;/b&gt; and your &lt;b&gt;VIRTUAL GOLDEN AMMO BOX&lt;/b&gt; can be posted on the 'wall of fame' below (just give me a heads-up). &lt;b&gt;No hides are required!&lt;/b&gt; Open to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;CONGRATULATIONS to EVERYONE on 1000 finds, wherever they may be!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

______________________________________________

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
On August
17, 2004, I found my 1,000th geocache. The name of the cache was
&lt;b&gt;FABULOUS WINNER&lt;/b&gt;. It's since been retired. This is a copy of
that cache.
&lt;br /&gt;
_____________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The
listed coordinates are for the container. However, should you
choose to hunt this as a hybrid letterbox, do the following: From
the yellow sign at the parking coordinate, proceed on a course of
58 degrees for 100 Roman paces until you see the log bridge. From
there, continue on a course of 351 degrees for 631 paces until you
see a large split tree on left of trail. The container is
inside.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
_____________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are
seeking a container atop a greenspace adjacent to KY 313. The climb
is steep, but the ridge trail is
level.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;There
are five caches on Hill 313. While it may be a &lt;i&gt;BUSY DAY&lt;/i&gt;, it
will not necessarily be a long
one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bring
your smallest stamp.

&lt;br /&gt;
Please place a note on your dash or under windshield wiper
that says &lt;b&gt;GEOCACHING&lt;/b&gt; so the ranger will
know.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
If you are &lt;b&gt;HALFWAY&lt;/b&gt; up you have yet to be &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;SLAP
WORE OUT.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Expect an immediate and strenuous elevation gain of 110' over a
distance of about .25/mi on a gravel fire road before you reach the
top, collecting HALFWAY enroute.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The
cache is a medium container hidden very near the fire road (read
logs). Catch your breath here, you are &lt;b&gt;HALFWAY&lt;/b&gt; to the
top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I
recommend doing the caches on one side going out, the other side
coming back, to simulate a 'loop'.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Expect a 12 mile round
trip!&lt;/b&gt; Clear your GPSr odometer and post your mileage in your
log if you complete them all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;None
of these caches were placed to be difficult&lt;/b&gt; and after
the initial climb you can expect an enjoyable caching experience.
It was not my intent to&lt;b&gt;'hide them better than you can find
them'&lt;/b&gt;, but I only hid them once. Only one may make you scratch
your head, but it's in a can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

_________________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;All
caches are hidden with prior &lt;i&gt;permission, and suggestions(!)&lt;/i&gt;
from Bernheim Forest management. I provided them with a list of all
caches in the park and a detailed topo map showing their locations
with a promise to update on request.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;_________________________________________________________&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bicycles are permitted here on gravel fire roads. &lt;b&gt;Just
don't leave the gravel road on a bike!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This part of the

&lt;b&gt;You are expected to be a good steward of the forest.&lt;/b&gt; Don't
wander or explore. Stay on the fire road or trails, do not litter,
and remove any litter that you may encounter and can carry
out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don't enter the

Basil Duke had a battle fragment removed while staying at a building that was located here during the Christmas Raid. Read the sign at the cache for more information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series is a work in progress; I have placed caches on all the signs in my area, and I encourage others to use the same format and continue this series in your area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To complete this cache, who's picture is in the Left Bottom corner?</groundspeak:long_description>

I
was night caching in the foothills of the mountains in northern
Georgia with friends. We climbed so many 3.5 hills that we were
exhausted. One of the guys commented that he was, &lt;b&gt;'Slap Wore
Out'&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you reach the top of this hill you may be &lt;b&gt;Slap Wore Out&lt;/b&gt;
as well. Take a break, find a cache. Or find it on the way
back.&lt;br /&gt;

I did not have enough time to put up much of a search on Halfway and I could see the dark clouds moving in from the Northwest so I moved in on this one. At first this one gave ma a little trouble but then I started to think a little more like ARF and there the cache was. Thanks for the reward for pushing my bike up that hill.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;b&gt;Cycopath!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I
spent seven hours on my mountain bike stacked with ammo cans and
other containers. &lt;b&gt;Does that make me a Cycopath? &lt;i&gt;I hope
so,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; this sure was a great (gravel) fire trail to go cyco
on!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is
a decon container, lightly camoed and secure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Terrain
rating reflects initial effort required to reach top of hill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;None
of these caches were placed to be difficult&lt;/b&gt; and after
the initial climb you can expect an enjoyable caching experience.
It was not my intent to&lt;b&gt;'hide them better than you can find
them'&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;but I only hid them once!&lt;br /&gt;

Knowing that this would probably be my last one for the day I ran up on this one and at first passed it by. After reading the hint I spotted the likely spot and there it was. As I got back to the bike I looked in the direction of Jeepstaff's Way and I took a picture of the nearby pond and of the road North at about this same time I saw a flash. Let see... Lightning strikes the highest points of a ridge and in fact looks as if it had struck in the area of this cache at one time, So I got on my bike and headed for the car. Just before I got to the big hill the rain started coming down. I made it down without getting too wet, but I think I now need ABS brakes on the Geocycle. Thanks for the fun.</groundspeak:text>

Jeepstaff
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of my
very first experiences at tackling multiple hides simultaneously
came at Fort Duffield located at West Point. Not only does it have
one of the most spectacular views I've ever seen, &lt;b&gt;(The Ohio
Valley In Kentucky - GC19AVT)&lt;/b&gt; but it got me totally hooked on
woodland caches.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My
favorite there was named &lt;b&gt;A CACHE&lt;/b&gt;. The first log read, 'A
LOG'. I grinned all day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I waded
through greenbriers most of the way to this cache site just like
many of Jeepstaff's. &lt;i&gt;You may find an easier
way&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Cache
is a .30 caliber ammo box with stuff in it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Terrain
rating reflects initial effort required to reach top of hill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Forest Pond
&lt;br /&gt;

Located a
very short distance from the road near a nearly-dried pond. May be
full after rain, who knows.....&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Bear In The Woods
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Cache is located a short distance off fire road and hidden
in a traditional 'box-in-the-woods' fashion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are seeking a .30 caliber ammo box 'stuft' with animals and a
logbook.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you were to continue on this road, it would empty onto Harrison
Fork Road between creek crossings #3 &amp; #4, many miles from your
vehicle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Terrain
rating reflects initial effort required to reach top of hill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;None
of these caches were placed to be difficult&lt;/b&gt; and after
the initial climb you can expect an enjoyable caching experience.
It was not my intent to&lt;b&gt;'hide them better than you can find
them'&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;but I only hid them once!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

_________________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;NOTICE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;All caches are hidden with prior
&lt;i&gt;permission, and suggestions(!)&lt;/i&gt; from Bernheim Forest
management. I provided them with a list of all caches in the park
and a detailed topo map showing their locations with a promise to
update on request.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;_________________________________________________________&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bicycles are permitted here on gravel fire roads. &lt;b&gt;Just
don't leave the gravel road on a bike!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

_______________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Notice!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This part of the
forest is extremely remote. Visiting this area is a
&lt;i&gt;privilege&lt;/i&gt; reserved for these caches only. It is NOT open to
the general public.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;You are expected to be a good steward of the forest.&lt;/b&gt; Don't
wander or explore. Stay on the fire road or trails, do not litter,
and remove any litter that you may encounter and can carry
out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don't enter the
gate off KY 245, you can't get here from
there.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If your
approach is from Ky 733, you must cross this creek to find the
cache. There is no bridge so you must drive -through- the
creek.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do -NOT- attempt a creek crossing if the water is up and swift.
Just wait a few minutes and a local will come through and you'll
see how to cross. Proceed accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is typically the shallowest of the four crossings, but there
is a relatively steep incline after you cross which is more
mud(slide) than gravel&lt;br /&gt;
.&lt;br /&gt;
If you just washed your vehicle, proceed to the WILSON CREEK WHEEL
WASH for assistance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are seeking an Rx bottle secluded just a scant few feet from
the road. Please re-hide and disguise as found.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I
-love- pineapple chunks (dipped in Miracle Whip, yum)!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Certain
'DOE' pineapple containers make great geo-containers! Much easier
to clean than peanut butter jars, and they have a gasket in the lid
to prevent moisture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This pineapple jar is located on a hillside in a newly acquired
section of Bernheim Forest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the cache was hidden, there was bush-hog 'trail' from GIMME
SHELTER that would take you to within a few dozen feet of the
cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There's a nice view of the valley from the cache
site.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is located in a newly acquired section of
Bernheim along Wilson Creek Road (a.k.a. Harrison Fork, Mt. Carmel
Church Rds). The area was a farm at one time and there is still
evidence that a house stood here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's between the 3rd and 4th &lt;i&gt;creek crossings&lt;/i&gt; if coming from
Ky 245.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are seeking a camoed jar containing a log with room for gold
coins an $100 bills, etc. &lt;i&gt;No need to enter the crumbling storm
cellar.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Parking is where you find it. The road here is narrow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The terrain rating is due to the creek crossings required to get
here.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Along Harrison Fork Road (from 245) or Mount Carmel Church Road
(off 733) there are four bridgeless creek crossings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I placed caches at each. Today was a good day to wade a bit and I
did. In the broiling heat of summer it'll be even better.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The sign says it all. You -MUST NOT- attempt a crossing if the
water is high.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;HEADS UP!! I spent some time at the Bernheim office with staff.
They told me that Bernheim has contacted residents along this rural
lane to consider the probability that the road will be closed from
both sides at the park boundary. DEAD END signs will be erected on
733 and 245. No more thru traffic, someday.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you encounter these DEAD END signs, please say so in your log so
I can update the page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is no date set for this to happen, but when it does it's
forever. The road runs right through the mid-section of Bernheim.
Make this drive while you can, it's scenic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are seeking an Rx bottle with a log in a z-lok, or whatever was
last placed there by helpers. Please replace as found so it won't
fall out.&lt;br /&gt;

The creek directly to your right as you go over the creek is the area where the park folks rerouted the creek to zig zag (see Google Map on this page), not sure of why but that is why those guys are paid the big bucks.</groundspeak:text>

Mount Carmel Church Road&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This is
the third creek crossing coming from Ky 245. It's also the deepest,
maybe a foot, after a dry spell.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's also the roughest. That concrete incline across the creek had
about a 5-inch drop where it met the creek.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I did not use 4WD.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The smoothest, shallowest way is to stay close to the downsteam
boulders. STAY TO THE RIGHT from 245 and to the LEFT from
733.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can see the cache site, but you just gotta cross that creek to
get it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The terrain rating is due to the creek. Be careful.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This is a quickie. You didn't come here to toil over an entrance

The cache is placed to mark the entrance to Knobs State Forest.
When you pass the brown mobile home on the right with the flag

down the gravel road on the right.&lt;br /&gt;

The road (and public access) continues 1.64 miles farther down this

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Isaac W. Bernheim established Bernheim Arboretum and
Research Forest in 1929.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I. W. Bernheim (1848-1945) was a German immigrant who settled in
Kentucky. From a humble beginning as a peddler, he became
successful in the whiskey distilling business where he established
the I.W. Harper brand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Grateful for his good fortune, he gave Bernheim Arboretum and
Research Forest to the people of Kentucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;As a gift.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

kindred cultural subjects, and for educational purposes, and as a
means of strengthening their love and devotion to their state and
country.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is located near The Firetower at Bernheim
Forest.&lt;br /&gt;
There is a $5.00 admission fee per car on weekends, weekdays are
free.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The original hide was destroyed by the Master Muggle, so it's been
replaced with a peanut jar in a geobvious spot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you are lucky the tower may be open and staffed. If so, you can
climb up and enjoy the view! Take a pic and post it here!&lt;br /&gt;

downright 'earthy'.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To locate the cache, simply go to the coordinate of the
marker on the map and then proceed 456 feet on a heading of 231
degrees. There you will find the container located behind 'an
Eagle's Nest'.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;The final does not require pinpoint accuracy. It's pretty
obvious. Tie a shoe.&lt;/h6&gt;

Cemetery&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The founder of West Point was
James Young, a young Virginian, who owned the land grant on which
the town was established.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In fact he owned every lot and even the streets in the town.&lt;/i&gt;
He also owned the ferry which crossed the Salt River and the hotel
(which still stands today) at the old ferry landing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Following several lawsuits over the existing overlapping land
grants, the courts ultimately recognized him as &lt;b&gt;The Proprietor
of West Point&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Young lived practically his entire life in West Point and amassed
quite a fortune in his various business enterprises.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today there is a river walk along the banks of the Ohio River named
in honor of James Young, as well as the bridge that carries the
U.S. 31W highway traffic across the Salt River. Young was one of
the investors that built the original turnpike that connected
Louisville and Nashville, Tennessee (see Bridges To The
Past).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don't hide caches in cemeteries so
the final coordinate will be a very short walk from Mr. Young and
outside the cemetery wall.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To locate this cache, find the stone of
James Young and determine the year of his death. From that number,
subtract 1783 to determine the bearing in degrees. From that same
number, subtract 1795 to determine the distance, in feet, you need
to travel to locate the hide.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are seeking an Rx bottle containing a zlok and
log.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; This location is near an
active railroad line. Parking coordinates are provided which will
eliminate any reason to go near the track.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;DO NOT APPROACH THE
TRACK!&lt;/b&gt;

The cache is rated a five star terrain due to special equipment required to access it.   All property along this lake except for 100 feet above summer pool which encompasses this WMA is private property, so you must use a boat to safely and legally access the hide.  Best access is via Possum Ridge boat ramp located at N38' 01.536 W085 16.385.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are seeking a camoed container a bit larger than a 35mm which is coathanger wired to a fixed object.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOTE:  The container contains a waterproof vinyl log and is meant to withstand being submerged.  A permanent marker (sharpie) is best for logging.  Pencils or ball points won't work.  If the log is wet, wipe it off and sign.  f you are signing as part of a listed paddle event, log once for all participants &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NOAA reported a lake elevation of 547.2 feet on the day the caches were placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coordinates were averaged 200 times to an accuracy of 12 feet on a rainy day.

W85° 50.502 for shortest route.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The name of this cache was the reading on my GPSr trip odo when I
got to the hiding spot. I carried two ammo boxes for over a mile,
this one for 1.9 miles. You may not need to hike that distance.
Depends on your route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 .50 cal ammo box full of apothecary products. &lt;b&gt;FIRST AID
HERE!&lt;/b&gt; Take a first aid kit. Spread some around the various
caches.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I hadn't seen this cache in a few years but hiked out from
Bearcamp Road with the CanAm Team on 10/1/09. The tree which hid
this cache is now a horizontal log slightly downhill and it
apparently dented the ammo box when it went down. You can't kill an
ammo can, and all's well.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A deer trail can be found on the way here. So can a high spring.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cache was originally hidden with a cluster of others in 2005
as 'Flo's Gold Cap'. Later it became 'It's a Jungle'. On 3/30/09 it
was freshened up and became Under Armor (for a reason).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The trail up here is not much more than a deer trail, but I think
deer are pretty smart (like ascending at an angle) so it's not near
as steep as Cache Mountain. But brier hell lies ahead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Go left and you'll save some blood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: Somewhere near here in 2005 I lost my digital camera.
I believe the brier patch attacked the wrist strap and pulled it
from its holder. It's a VIVITAR Model 3826, bright silver in color
and will likely be lying on the ground or hanging on a brier in
plain sight. It's fun to watch for. If you find it, buy a lotto
ticket and I'll pay for it. Contact me at AirRaidFan@gmail.com.
&lt;i&gt;Thanks&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You'll find the convenient ATV trail on up the hill.</groundspeak:long_description>

I found a nice approch to the mountain and escaped with only one battle scar. As I creasted the hill I could her alot of noise from the steep side of the hill. Could it be a groundhog? Maybe a Deer, nope it was Sacagawea going though some large brairs. He had at least one battle scar on his arm by the time he creasted the hill. He was armed with the clue and found the cache before I did, but he saved the find for me so I could get my heart to quite skipping evey other beat. All good to go now. I left him somewhere on that ridge and returned the way I came up. Thanks, this Flo got my attention.</groundspeak:text>

Parking is available where you find it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial ascent to the plateau is a bit strenuous,&lt;br/&gt;but once on top you'll find a wide and flat trail credited solely to those prohibited machines we love to hate: the ATV. Bless their hearts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache itself is a .30 cal ammo box hidden exactly one&lt;br/&gt;mile from my parking spot (quite coincidentally) and contains mostly air.  Contributions and signature items are encouraged. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no reason to leave the well-defined trail except to traverse similar terrain. In other words, stay on the ridges, they'll eventually get you there. Only one cache here requires a descent and re-ascent and it's duly noted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please return the cache to it's original position so the next searcher can have the same experience as you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache may contain FTF prize or TB.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h4&gt;Afflictions Sore For Years I Bore&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Physicians Were In Vain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;At Length GOD Pleased To Give Me Pass&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;And Freed Me From My Pain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

_________________________________________________________________________
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Such are the words inscribed on one of two center stones in
the small Seaton Cemetery near where the town of Seatonville once
stood.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

_________________________________________________________________________
&lt;p&gt;Stand at the entrance gate and face the blacktop road and
consider these points of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Look left beyond the bridge over Floyd's Fork creek. There is
a white house in the curve. This was the Seatonville blacksmith
shop back in the day. The blacksmith hanged himself from a tree in
the front yard and lies here within these walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Look directly ahead at the bottoms of Floyd's Fork creek.
Three-tenths of a mile down the creek, on the left, is the family
plot of the founders of this area with stones dating to the
mid-1700's. It is only accessible by canoe or similar
floatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Look to your right. Beyond the cemetery there is a large
wooden cross. Here is where the Seatonville schoolhouse stood back
in the day. If you listen closely you may hear the sounds of
panicked horses, for it is there that the remains of the horses
which perished in the Rock Creek Riding Stable fire at Seneca Park
are buried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Look directly behind you. This was the now-defunct
Seatonville Springs Country Club. Families gathered, golf was
played and weddings took place. This gravel, gated road was the
entrance. Nature has reclaimed all features of the links. Time
marches on...&lt;/p&gt;

_________________________________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;There is no need to enter the cemetery. Like any of my
cemetery-related caches, the container is not inside. The cache is
an Rx bottle, lightly camo'd and situated outside. It contains a
log only. Please replace as found with the top slightly elevated so
moisture does not accumulate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No stopping after dark. This is a cemetery. Please be
respectful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

TFTH! Thanks For The Hide! Thanks to those who take the time. This
mud's for you! (May be muddy after a rain). Park at your geo-drive
and follow deer trax along ridge or go low. I saw a flock of deer
and a herd of quail along the ridge trail. I used some other stuff
I found along the way. Wave at the 50mph muggles if you wish, they
won't care.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;
Pineapple
Chunks. Like peanut butter, there always seems to be a jar or two
in the pantry. These jars make great cache containers because they
have a leakproof seal inside the lid. &lt;i&gt;No leaks, no
moisture.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This cache serves also to mark the parking spot for
the trail which leads to four more caches including
&lt;b&gt;ARF's
5k Ammo Box, Serenity Now, Gated Community and,&lt;/b&gt; Rockin' The
House For ARF's 10k.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is an urban wilderness area and the trails, while
mostly defined by deer, are easily recognizable. Expect a 1.8 mile
round trip to grab all four beyond this one with minimal
bushwacking. A waterfall awaits!
&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Long awaited (by who?), it's now here. The newly extended
Hurstbourne Parkway is completed from Fern Valley Road to Bardstown
Road. It slices through farmland and rural areas never before seen.

&lt;p&gt;That will change quickly as developers do their thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for now there's an opportunity to see the 'BEFORE' prior to
the 'AFTER'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I placed two caches. One at this end, and one about two miles
away at the other end, before the development begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these are done in tandem, you'll see what this 'used' to look
like when a turtle does his 'Do You Remember Series' 20 years from
now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park where you want, but I chose 20 feet away.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I was hunting an INDY DIVER cache up in Indiana recently and
happened upon 'Buck' along the way. Buck checked me out pretty
closely and allowed me to touch him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to hunt with a rifle, but now I've switched to a Canon. I
prefer close shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I hid this cache I parked close. As an incentive to
continue, I tossed my keys up first (a modern-day version of
burning the bridges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Your results may vary!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Cache is a camo'd container hidden near edge of corn where Buck
would bed down.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I was starting to get hungry for egg rolls so I plowed through all the underbrush like a land tortoise in it's shell to get to this one. I made it back to the car in record time and got on down to the InKy.

Thanks for the hunt.</groundspeak:text>

Mary J. Stowers
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
____________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The
listed coordinate will bring you to Stowers Cemetery where some of
the earliest residents of this Louisville suburb are resting. The
oldest stone here represents &lt;b&gt;Mary J., Wife of Patrick Stowers,
Born Mar 13 1797, Died Feb 14 1879&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Not a
current photo&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
_____________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This small
family plot contains members of the Stowers, Groom and Raggard
families. It has seen better days.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
____________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

A single
gnarly cemetery tree looms large.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
_____________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There's an
access gate at the corner of the cemetery and visitor parking is on
the street.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To determine
the final coordinate, locate the stone which represents &lt;b&gt;the
youngest Groom&lt;/b&gt; and subtract the &lt;b&gt;DOB YEAR&lt;/b&gt; from the &lt;b&gt;DOD
YEAR&lt;/b&gt;. To that, &lt;b&gt;add the number of bolts holding the stone
together.&lt;/b&gt; Let the product be &lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do
this to resolve the final coordinate:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;To
'x', add 133 to get ABC&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;From 456,
&lt;b&gt;subtract x&lt;/b&gt; to get DEF.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The final can
be found here:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;N 38*
11.ABC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;W 085*
49.DEF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are
seeking a container about the size of a 35mm. It's not in, but
near, the cemetery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good
luck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;____________________________________________&lt;/b&gt;

______________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Louisville Metro built two canoe parks along Floyd's Fork.
One is in Miles Park, 6.1 miles upstream. This is the other.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Neither is actually very 'paddler-friendly' and are seldom, if
ever, used by enthusiasts. While there is a 'ramp' at the water's
edge, the access 'trail' is posted off. It's over 100 yards to the
ramp from parking and you'll have to carry everything from there. I
use the ATV trails along South Pope Lick road and drive to the
water's edge in my Jeep.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache
is hidden away from the parking area and nearby homes, but traffic
may appear suddenly. Park closes at dusk.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:
Wasps have been reported here. See logs. Take heed especially if
you are &lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;ALLERGIC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt; to stings!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;Veterans Park&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Static Tactical Unit Display&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Veteran's Park is a very well planned community park with a
paved walking trail, short wooded paths along the creek and
sheltered picnic areas.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a static military display including a tank, AA
guns, a tank with a cache, a chopper, a torpedo (new) and a
tank....with a micro cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache container is a small square, and is in the last place
you'll look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;No need to climb on the tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very popular park. Many muggles about! You will feel
suspicious, but try not to look that way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park is VERY well kept and clean, please do your part to
help keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Hey, this is my &lt;i&gt;first and only&lt;/i&gt; tank
hide!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The park is open dawn to dusk. Park once, do $SIX$! And two are
surprisingly near one another! Another RECYCLED area!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be respectful and mindful of the reason for the park. You
are here because of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Park&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Peter Pan?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

_______________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I grew up on Peter Pan. Still love PP today.
&lt;br /&gt;
Cache requires a couple hundred feet of light bushwacking.
There may be a path but it was all under water when I originally
hid it (consider that) and the tree trimmers left all their
trimmings behind so expect a bit of high-stepping. &lt;b&gt;DO NOT ENTER
CREEK, it's in the PARK!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are seeking a container containing a container with a
log.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please take the time to replace as found.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a &lt;b&gt;'park-once, do SIX'&lt;/b&gt; opportunity and is another
recycling of the park in an effort to keep caching near and
economical. There's now a &lt;b&gt;Where I Go&lt;/b&gt; cache located
here!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Take a walk along the nice foot trail. All hides are quick and easy
and great for kids with adult supervision. &lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Park open
dawn to dusk. Please be aware of those who are aware of you!
Replace as found!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Remember: I only hid it once, you will hide it
last!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;BlackAcre Preserve&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Blackacre is a 271-acre historic homestead&lt;/b&gt; in
Louisville. Kentucky which features rolling fields, streams,
forests, and a homestead dating back to the 18th century. For
visitors, the preserve features several farm animals including
horses, goats, and cows, hiking trails, and a visitor's center in
the 1844-built Presley Tyler home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;There is no admission fee.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is located along the Tyler Trace Trail which is adjacent
to (but outside of) the state nature preserve.&lt;br /&gt;
The Blackacre State Nature Preserve is a wonderful place to visit
and hike. I recommend it, but caching is not allowed.&lt;br /&gt;
You are seeking an Rx bottle with a log only.&lt;br /&gt;
These caches are NOT located on the State Nature Preserve where I
was told caching would not be allowed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cache in this HUGE evergreen tree is dedicated to every
cacher who ever hid an evergreen or bush cache which I am allergic
to. Good luck and itch on!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

_________________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not a Multi &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a multi, but no more. Now it's just
named 'NOT A MULTI but still carries it's old
classification.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Difficult cache when basketball court is in use.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Camoed pill bottle with just a log in a z-lok.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;All caches in this park are great for beginners! There's a mix
of containers and hides, some just a bit more difficult than
others, but none that will frustrate. Here you can park once and
log six.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please be aware of OTHERS who are aware of you! This
container has been replaced so many times I'm no longer sure what
it is....heh heh!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;BlackAcre Preserve&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blackacre is a 271-acre historic homestead in Louisville.
Kentucky which features rolling fields, streams, forests, and a
homestead dating back to the 18th century.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For visitors, the preserve features several farm animals including
horses, goats, and cows, hiking trails, and a visitor's center in
the 1844-built Presley Tyler home. The farmhouse is open to the
public on Sundays, 1:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m., from March through
November. The trails are open every day - weekdays from 3 p.m. to
dusk, and on weekends from dawn to dusk. There is no
admission.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is located along the Tyler Trace Trail which is adjacent
to (but outside of) the state nature preserve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Blackacre State Nature Preserve is a wonderful place to visit
and hike. &lt;b&gt;I recommend it, but caching is not allowed
there.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are seeking an Rx bottle with a log only.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These caches are NOT located on the State Nature Preserve where I
was told caching would not be allowed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Veterans Park&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt; &amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Elevated walkway and historic limestone bridge&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There's a very nice paved walking trail and a great new feature of
the park just down the trail. The dugout cache is on this same
walkway.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a very nicely manicured community park. Please help keep it
that way!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Hide it and they will come! PLAY.....Ball?&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This is an addition to Veteran's Park where you may park
once and do SIX.&lt;br /&gt;
The hides here were recycled occasionally to keep caching near and
economical, but KY geo'mgmt put a stop to that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They are not intended to be difficult, but enjoyable as you take a
walk. Enjoy the park.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have a seat and tie your shoe. But don't wait for the game. Not
here!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;BlackAcre Preserve&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Blackacre and Tyler Trace Entrance&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Blackacre is a 271-acre historic homestead&lt;/b&gt; in
Louisville, Kentucky. The preserve features rolling fields,
streams, forests, and a homestead dating back to the 18th century.
For visitors, the preserve features several farm animals including
horses, goats, and cows, hiking trails, and a visitor's center in

&lt;br /&gt;
The farmhouse is open to the public on Sundays, 1:00 p.m. - 5:00
p.m., from March through November. The preserve and homestead are
open every day - weekdays from 3 p.m. to dusk, and on weekends from
dawn to dusk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;There is no admission.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a camo'd Rx bottle hidden in plain geo-sight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;These caches are NOT located on the State Nature Preserve&lt;/b&gt;
where I was told caching would not be allowed.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;BlackAcre Preserve&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tyler Trace Trail&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tyler Trace parking and Trailhead&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tyler Trace Trail&lt;/b&gt; is an easy walk in the woods with
no sudden or severe elevation changes. The only creek crossing is
via bridge. Estimate an hour if you don't stop and smell the
roses.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Blackacre is a 271-acre historic homestead&lt;/b&gt; which features
rolling fields, streams, forests, and a homestead dating back to
the 18th century.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For visitors, the preserve features several farm animals including
horses, goats, and cows, hiking trails, and a visitor's center in
the 1844-built Presley Tyler home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The trails are open every day - weekdays from 3 p.m. to dusk,
and on weekends from dawn to dusk.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;There is no admission.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is located along the Tyler Trace Trail which is adjacent
to (but outside of) the state nature preserve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Blackacre State Nature Preserve is a wonderful place to
visit and hike. I recommend it, but caching is not allowed
there.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;You are seeking an Rx bottle with a log only.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These caches are NOT located on the State Nature Preserve where I
was told caching would not be allowed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the same as my cache on geocaching.com, just testing out opencaching!&lt;p&gt;

You're looking for an RX bottle hidden in a slightly less common fashion in a public park. Parking is abundant 363 days of the year, may be a problem in the third weekend of September, when an Arts &amp; Crafts festival is held in the park. It's a great time to visit the park but I wouldn't suggest caching then.

I'm hiding this cache to populate Audubon Park, a nice little part of Louisville which I call home. It's an independent city developed in the early 20th century and best known for its golf course and annual dogwood festival in late April. The city was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district in 1996. The neighborhood was named for the naturalist and bird artist John James Audubon, and all but two of it's twenty streets were given names of birds.

It is a rather beautiful neighborhood, with tree-lined streets, deep front yards and small (by modern standards) houses chiefly of the crafstman and colonial revival styles. The neighborhood has a garden club which has been active for decades and a great many residents put incredible amounts of time into their yards and gardens.

Audubon Park was originally supposed to be twice as large, with Cardinal Drive, the street which runs alongside the country club, going all the way around the golf course, with an equal sized development on each side. However, Camp Taylor was built on the other side of the golf course during World War 1, forever scuttling plans for the completion of the developer's original dream.

The city incorporated in 1941 and a city hall was built near the golf course in the late 1980s. I have gathered that many people who moved into the neighborhood initially through the 1950s and 60s were foremen, engineers or even owners of industrial and manufacturing companies located in the Fern Valley area - Audubon Park being the nearest golf course community.

If you have a moment and like seeing houses with interesting stories behind them, walk about a tenth of a mile to the corner of Dove and Chickadee. There you will see an unusually small house for the neighborhood. It was originally a tiny train station! The developers began Audubon Park in 1906, and believe it or not would-be suburbanites were still not so sure about living in a neighborhood where they needed a car to get around. The developers therefore built a spur route of the Preston Street streetcar route that ran through the heart of Audubon Park and ended at this station, giving residents a convenient way to take the streetcar downtown to work or go shopping.

The streetcar spur didn't last, however, and was shut down by the 1920s. I've heard that it was just a promotional gimmick and once the lots were sold, the developer didn't see any point to keeping up the cost of maintaining a streetcar route. It's also quite possible there just wasn't a lot of interest in mass transit, as the revolutionary Model T arrived just after the lots went on sale, and nearly every home in the city has a driveway and a garage as a result. Some of the tracks actually remained long afterward, and were not removed from the park where the cache is until 1975.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where Ampere and Technology meet.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;I have never been keen on CEMETERY or MORTARLESS STONE WALL
caches.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Headstones are not hiding places for our pastime, and non-gated
plots must not be entered.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Cemetery caches can be respectfully done, and most are, but
I'll never hide one inside. Thus, the &lt;i&gt;'NOT IN'&lt;/i&gt; series, if
you can call it a series.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don't seek out cemeteries, but this little well manicured plot
has all the elements mentioned above:,br&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cemetery. No gate. Stone wall.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This cache is not inside the cemetery. Do not go over the fence.
Do not disturb the stone wall. And if you move anything, move it
back.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It -is- resting (if you will) in a nice weatherproof spot.
Please be mindful of the windows about you.....watching.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Cemetery Rules Apply&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Patrick Henry Hughes Field&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UofL Campus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Louisville, KY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewers of the Feb. 17 episode of ABC’s &lt;b&gt;“Extreme
Makeover: Home Edition,”&lt;/b&gt; which featured University of
Louisville Marching Band member &lt;b&gt;Patrick Hughes&lt;/b&gt; and his
family, saw hardworking volunteers demolish and rebuild the
family’s home into one more accessible to Hughes, who is
blind and uses a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also watched renovation of an unlighted UofL intramurals
athletic field into a well-lighted one with an arched, iron
gateway, football-field markings and amenities that include
multiple water fountains, a storage shed, a shelter and additional
handicapped parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This cache is located at the entrance to that
field.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just inside the gate on the right there is a plaque which
dedicates the field to &lt;b&gt;Patrick Henry Hughes&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
It is truly an inspirational story.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entrance is located adjacent to a large parking lot sharing
the same entrance so be prepared for potential onlookers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;There is no need to enter the field to find the
cache!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are seeking a magnetic key holder underneath the ironwork on
the right side of the gate, down low. I parked across the gate so
my Jeep blocked the view from the gatehouse across the way and
pretended to take pictures of the plaque...and tie my shoe. If you
can't block, the cache will likely be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was there at 1:30pm and all was quiet. When classes are
dismissed it will be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Farmington Plantation Home&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;________________________________________________________________&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmington is a 14-room Federal-style home that was the center
of the 19th-century hemp plantation of John and Lucy Speed.
Designed from a plan by Thomas Jefferson and completed in 1816
using slave labor, the house is newly restored with original paint
colors, historic wallpaper and carpets, and furnished with Kentucky
furniture and other antiques from the period. Abraham Lincoln, a
close friend of John Speed's son Joshua, spent about three weeks at
Farmington in 1841.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No house in Kentucky more gracefully embodies Federal
architecture than Farmington. Striking Jeffersonian features of its
perfectly proportioned 14 rooms include two octagonal rooms, the
adventurously steep and narrow &quot;hidden&quot; stairway, and the fanlights
between the front and rear halls. Exquisite reeded doorways, carved
mantels, and marbleized baseboards add special elegance to the
interior. Most of the structure, including the woodwork, glass and
brass, in original and still in excellent condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present 18-acre site also includes an elaborate early 19th
century garden, stone springhouse and barn, cook's quarters and
kitchen, blacksmith shop, apple orchard, museum store, and
remodeled carriage house which may be rented for special
events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a small container camoed to match
surroundings. Best parking is at the gift shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Welcome to The Club, we think.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;No Running. No Diving. No Food In The Pool!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This old rock quarry was once a swim location many, many years
ago, perhaps by the owners of the farms which surrounded it before
the bulldozers came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered it by my exploratory (snoopy) nature. I was
surprised at what I found. Overgrown and &lt;b&gt;cluttered&lt;/b&gt;, it's
past is evidenced by a swim platform which once sported two diving
boards, concrete stairways to the bottom, and ladders for climbing
out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old dam near the diving platform is terraced for sitting and
sunbathing. Graffiti, some unpleasant, is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding the cache requires crossing the creek which runs through
it and the use of the facilities installed for the 'pool'
(climbing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PARKING.&lt;/b&gt; At the end of the Target bldg closest to the
corner where the guardrails meet. Park near the corner closest to
the home store and enter there, alongside the short retaining wall.
Watch for traffic! Follow it to the swim platform and stairs to the
'bottom', then good luck! Many brambles in there! Hiking boots!
Waders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are seeking a 35mm container stuck in a hole. It will be
obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;THE AREA IS PRONE TO FLOODING AFTER A RAIN!
BEWARE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

I'm also glad that I waited for a cool (65 degrees) day so I could wear long pants and good sturdy boots.  Day 358 of 365 consecutive days.

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Air Devil's Inn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Oldest Neon Sign In Louisville&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The building was formerly the Maple Grove Elementary School,&lt;/b&gt;
hence the school bell tower that remains on the roof to this
day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Established in 1934&lt;/b&gt; by proprietor D.W. Baird, &lt;i&gt;Air Devils
Inn was opened immediately after the repeal of prohibition.&lt;/i&gt;
After 70 years of continuous operation in the same building, &lt;i&gt;ADI
is perhaps the oldest bar in Louisville!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;First time I was here&lt;/b&gt; was with my dad, a member of the 101st
Airborne. Probably 47 years ago. We listened to Cawood Ledford (UK
sports) on the transistor radio and watched the touch 'n go
activity across the street. I wanted to fly and eventually
would.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Today ADI is a Louisville landmark.&lt;/b&gt; Once known as a biker
bar, it's now better known for supporting local musicians.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The wrapped mural at the Air Devil's Inn is a historic depiction
in art.&lt;/b&gt; Lest we forget. &lt;i&gt;View that which occurred in your
lifetime.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;The Sound of Music&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Thursday nights offer a special treat when the devil brings the
bikes out&lt;/b&gt; to show their stuff, weather permitting. These rides
average $50k+ and energize the area with their 'music'. Truly
intoxicating. Jesse James and West Coast Choppers are always well
represented as are the local chop shops. Art in motion. Try to get
a seat on the deck and watch the show. They only come out on
Thursday.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The cache is a small container&lt;/b&gt; placed above Bull Durham, who
also was a rider. Have fun!</groundspeak:long_description>
            <groundspeak:encoded_hints>NOTE:  This is *NOT* a guardrail cache.  Containers hidden in guardrail to replace a find will be DELETED!  Read the description!</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bowman Field is the longest continually operating airport in
the United States.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the decades, Bowman Field has played a vital role in the
growth and evolution of our country's aviation industry. It
officially began on May 12, 1920, when A.H. Bowman formed a
partnership with flier Robert H. Gast and set up operations at the
site on Taylorsville Road. Shortly thereafter, Gast left Louisville
to pursue a more adventurous aviation career. He would be lost in
the China Sea in 1934.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above coordinates will bring you to the flag pole and
historical marker located near the entrance to the Bowman Field
Terminal building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is inside.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your GPSr will not update inside the terminal, so the
&lt;b&gt;FAMOUS&lt;/b&gt; names in the pictoral display may help you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Junius Jones&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Robert H. Gast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is quite a gallery of vintage aircraft here as well. Once
you have browsed &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of the pictures, you have likely
seen the cache although it is &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;not part&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of any
pictoral or static display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE CACHE IS NOT PART OF ANY PHOTO OR
DISPLAY ITEM - DO NOT TOUCH!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;However, the cache location &lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;IS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt; spelled out
in one letter from each of the names in the above list reading from
top to bottom (you have a better chance of winning the
lotto).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend this as an evening or weekend visit, after
traditional office hours. The terminal is relatively small and open
to the public. There are occasional formal gatherings here and an
excellent french cuisine restaurant (Le Relais) shares the
premises!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;DO NOT DISTURB ANY WALL HANGINGS OR DISPLAYS. NO NEED TO
TOUCH THEM! IT'S NOT THERE!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
_____________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Always replace a cache exactly as you
found it. The next cacher's experience is only as good as you leave
it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

_____________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Much of the early history of aviation in Louisville and
indeed the state is a result if the Aero Club of Louisville. The
club's founding fathers included pilots returning from World War 1
who found that there was no place to continue their passion for
flying, and businessmen who saw the potential of aviation beyond
military applications.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Aero Club ran Bowman Field for the first six years of its
existence. The members took care of maintenance, building, and
anything that arose. In 1923 they put on the first air show in
Louisville with an attendance estimated by the Courier-Journal at
12,000. By 1928 it was clear that Bowman field was outgrowing its
volunteer status, and that the members of the Aero Club could no
longer keep it maintained and manned as it needed to be.&lt;br /&gt;
The state Legislature created the Louisville and Jefferson County
Air Board and by 1947 the new Louisville airport, Standiford Field
(SDF) was in business.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located at the members-only crew quarters. The area
can be busy at times. Please do not disturb any runway lights or
electric service. The cache is below the sign pictured above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Happy Tailwinds, 3000/1 forever!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

__________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;NEAR the (old) Kentucky Department Fish Wildlife, Louisville
Field Office - Bowman Field.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;When I applied for a guide license back in the 80's I was
interviewed at this office by Buck.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Buck! What a name for a conservation officer, eh? Nice guy,
too!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Today I stopped by to see Buck and discuss geocaching in
Kentucky. Buck was retiring soon and this field office was closing.
Buck said his last official act as the local KDFW guy would be to
give permission for a cache to be placed NEAR this very office! (it
use to be under the PORCH, Ooo-Rah!)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KDFW Field Office has moved and the building is currently
occupied by &lt;b&gt;Kentucky Vehicle Enforcement&lt;/b&gt; personnel so don't
approach this &lt;b&gt;Police Station!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Instead, drive down the lane in the rear of the building and you
can park within 100 feet of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is &lt;b&gt;(NOW)&lt;/b&gt; an &lt;b&gt;Rx bottle&lt;/b&gt; hidden in sight of
the Kentucky License Bureau where parents kiss their car keys
goodbye and say hello to sleepless nights. Kentucky State Police
are present there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is accessible 24/7. Be aware of the license bureau
traffic. There are student drivers about. You'll see if you come
early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;NOTE: Please do not gangbang this cache! One or two at a
time only! This is an &lt;i&gt;AIRPORT&lt;/i&gt; and crowds of people doing
strange things will draw QUICK ATTENTION!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;There is an abundant garden of POISON IVY on the trunk of this
tree.&lt;/b&gt; I am so allergic to the stuff I wouldn't get within 10
feet. You shouldn't, either.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Lexington Herald-Leader (KY)&lt;/b&gt; - November 2, 2003 &lt;b&gt;EMISSIONS
TESTING ENDS IN LOUISVILLE, ADVOCATES OF PROGRAM HOPE TO REVIVE IT
IN THE COURTS&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;LOUISVILLE&lt;/b&gt; -- Louisville's 20-year-old
Vehicle Emissions Testing program expired Friday (11.2.2003)
despite a flurry of last-minute legal efforts to keep it alive. A
Jefferson County judge will consider a last-gasp effort to
reinstate the VET program on Monday. If the measure is defeated,
drivers in Jefferson County will not face an annual inspection of
their cars for the first time since the 1980s. &quot;I think it's been
an extreme waste,&quot;said...EVERYONE WHO EVER SAT IN A LONG LINE,
BREATHNG CARBON MONOXDE, waiting to pony-up their $8 to have their
(sometimes) brand new cars tested&quot;. Ahem. Your tax dollars paid for
this building. It would've made a nice airplane hanger but no one
could afford it. So now it's home to this geocache.
&lt;b&gt;YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK!&lt;/b&gt; Beware of Metro Cruisers
which park here or near. Cache can be very easy or a DNF. But it's
there.
&lt;b&gt;DO NOT OPEN ANYTHING ELECTRICAL! I WILL NEVER PLACE A
CACHE INSIDE ELECTRIC SERVICE! YOU NEED NOT OPEN ANYTHING TO FIND
THIS CACHE! PROMISE! Cache contains log only, no trades.

Rapid R said he was having problems trying to find this, so I suggested that we try looking for it together.  While I was walking around searching for the cache, I get a call, from my brother about my cache in Iowa.  As I am talking to him, I reach up &amp; grab the cache.  I don't know what surprised Rapid R more - that I found the cache, or I did while talking on the phone.

Sneaky,[}:)] but very nice hide.

Also it combines aspects of Letterboxing, as instead of coordinates, clues and directions are given. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyway, here is a breif history lesson along with the directions to find the first ever &quot;Cardbox&quot;. :http://cardboxing.webs.com/tyler-park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Happy Caching/Boxing!&lt;br/&gt;-502mtb</groundspeak:long_description>

When we got to the final, an Airport Security truck was setting 15 feet from where we needed to look. We went over to another area and waited for him to finally pull away. We then looked high and low, but no cache. Hopefully the guard did not take the cache because we could not find it. It probably is there, I did not get a chance to do a through search before the guard came back.</groundspeak:text>

________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This cache is located along a trail in the extreme
southern tip of Cherokee Park.&lt;br /&gt;
It's a quick grab (a camo'd PB jar) in the
pie-hole, er, &lt;i&gt;PORTHOLE&lt;/i&gt; of a reposed
halloween tree.&lt;br /&gt;
This trail can be busy, &lt;i&gt;and users may appear suddenly, quietly
and without warning!&lt;/i&gt; Cyclists appear frequently here and while
foot travel has the right-of-way, please be aware of those around
you and &lt;i&gt;be safe!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;_______________________________________________________&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I thought long and hard about putting a cache in front of our
house. I know several cache families who have done it and the
reviews are mixed. Some enjoy watching the hunt but others have
wondered who the heck that was in a black Jeep oozing down their
street late at night emitting a strange glow from within and then
poking about with an LED light before finally zooming off into the
night..?&lt;br /&gt;
I know it would be fun for me but our neighbors might not
appreciate the sudden increase in strangers and traffic in the
area, and Kim was concerned about being there alone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;But I knew I had to finally decide whether to do it or
not.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;So I did...! (decide, that is)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

The container was immediately obvious from the trail but I had to duck MBX traffic to reach in and grab it.  All is well, thanks for the fun.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Or, The Day ARF! Became A Muggle??&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;b&gt;This is the first, or last, cache before
hitting/leaving&lt;br /&gt;
Seneca Park Road and the bike/hike trail (which starts/ends
behind&lt;br /&gt;
the big bush).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This section of the trail is blindly crooked and caution should
be&lt;br /&gt;
exercised to avoid point blank encounters with trail users coming
from the other direction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You know, be SNEAKiER Than Them!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache as averaged 100+ times to an accuracy of 12-feet.
Your&lt;br /&gt;
results may vary. There's a home nearby so be SNEAKY and
cover&lt;br /&gt;
appropriately before leaving.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Mallard Male&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mallards
occupy this creek is fairly large numbers (which also flows behind
my home) and will winter here as long as the stream isn't comletely
iced over. I've had over 100 mallards at the feeder in my back
yard!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Female Mallard and Young&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mallards
mate and nest in April and their young can be viewed from here. The
survival rate of their young is less than 40% due to predators,
which include man.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache
is a camoed.. thingy.. located along the picturesque banks of the
stream. Convenient parking at the rear of the office building
within 200' of cache. Check out the historic marker which is seldom
read.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Mallards Caching&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You'll
hunt in relative privacy here (an urban rarity) and wonder why the
heck is all this stuff here? Should be fairly
straightforward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please
return cache where/how found. It makes the hint work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Always replace a cache exactly as you found it. The
next cacher's experience depends on your placement, not
mine!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Or, The Day ARF! Became A Muggle??&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;b&gt;As I was cycling along the trail an object suddenly
entered my space, ricocheted off a nearby tree, glanced off the
handlebar, barely grazed my cap (uh, HELMET) and landed
nearby.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I got off, stepped over and picked it up. Hmmm, a Titleist Pro V1.
Someone will come for this, I thought to myself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sure 'nuf, a nine iron came probing through the brush and attached
at the OTHER end was &lt;i&gt;The Hunter&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He ignored me, so I asked, 'Whatcha lookin' for'?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'A ball', he said snippishly.&lt;br /&gt;
'A ball?' 'What's it look like?' I asked snoopingly.&lt;br /&gt;
He half-glared,'It's white'.&lt;br /&gt;
'White, eh?', I said, 'What do you do when you find it? Do you keep
it or just put it back'?&lt;br /&gt;
'Well, it's mine', he said confusedly, 'so I play it'.&lt;br /&gt;
'Play it'? I asked? 'How do you play it'?&lt;br /&gt;
'I drive it down the course', he said curtly, quite annoyed.&lt;br /&gt;
'And then what?', I asked, quizzically, peering closely where his
iron was probing.&lt;br /&gt;
'I go find it'.&lt;br /&gt;
'What if you can't find it?, I asked.&lt;br /&gt;
'I play another'.&lt;br /&gt;
'Is that expensive?'&lt;br /&gt;
'Costs me a stroke'.&lt;br /&gt;
'A STROKE? Is that like a HEART ATTACK?'&lt;br /&gt;
'No, it's much worse' he said sarcastically, standing up
straight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
About that time I heard someone calling, 'Biff? Biff, are you
there? Did you find your ball, Biff?'&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Time to go, I thought. 'See ya', Biff. Good luck with the balls and
your stroke!'&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So I pedalled on down the trail, and, you guessed it. Another ball
bounced nearby from over a rise, bounced through the green, across
the trail and into the high weeds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Without slowing down I reached into my pocket, retrieved the
Titleist Pro V1 and lobbed it about 35 feet to the green. It rolled
to a stop about three feet from the cup. A bird shot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There, I thought, my good deed for the day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Anyway, that may not be exactly how it happened if it
happened at all, but back while I was watching Biff I spied a spot
and hid a cache.&lt;br /&gt;
And, no, it's not golf related.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Cache was averaged over 100 times to less than 12-feet accuracy
under thick canopy. Your results may vary.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The above coordinate will lead you to Willow Park, but
not this cache.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;TO LOCATE THE CACHE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cherokee Park&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Louisville is well known&lt;/b&gt; for its system of local parks.
There are more than 120 public parks in the metro area alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though each park in the city has its own unique appeal,
&lt;b&gt;Cherokee Park&lt;/b&gt; in Louisville remains one of the most popular
among both residents and travelers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With amenities like a 2.4 mile scenic loop, a fenced dog park,
and a bird sanctuary, the 409-acre Cherokee Park entertains close
to 500,000 visitors a year, making it one of the 50 most-visited
parks in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cherokee Park&lt;/b&gt; is located in the Highlands neighborhood of
the East End of Louisville. The park’s official address is
745 Cochran Hill Road, though there are entrances to the park in
the Cherokee Triangle, Bonnycastle, Crescent Hill, and Seneca
Gardens neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting Around:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Navigating Cherokee Park&lt;/b&gt; can be fairly confusing. The
best advice for navigating the park while driving on the Scenic
Loop is to &lt;i&gt;turn left to stay in the park and turn right to
leave.&lt;/i&gt; Additionally, you'll want to use your map (GPSmap) so
that you can figure out where you are when you exit the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Solution:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To determine the coordinate and attempt to locate the cache
just do the math problem on the page. When you have determined the
accuracy of the math (and you will), simply use the math as the
ending North coordinate and a U+3003 for the West.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Or, made simple, complete the following:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;N 38' 14.xxx/ W 085' 42.xxx,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;The cache is located in Cherokee Park on level terrain with
moderate cover but no briers or poison plants that I encountered (I
wore shorts). Parking is nearby. &lt;i&gt;It may not be an easy find.&lt;/i&gt;
But after you do it'll be obvious. Please leave covered as found.
Any suspected decoy sites should be left as found as well,
please.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;b&gt;There may be a residentially-challenged person sleeping on a
bench or on the ground nearby. He was nearby when I did&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;FIRE
WALK WITH ME&lt;/i&gt; and is not a threat. The cache is not hidden on
him, so please leave him alone.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Slow To Hide&lt;/i&gt; can be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I decided to unload some &lt;i&gt;Slow To Hide&lt;/i&gt; stuff I had in the
Jeep (for longer than I care to admit) and this is one of those
containers. When I pulled it out from under the passenger seat
another fell from the back seat to take its place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is hidden off the trails in one of the &lt;i&gt;top 50
most-visited urban parks in America.&lt;/i&gt; I'm always amazed at how
many people are on the trails at any given time during the
seasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trail users may appear suddenly, quietly and without warning so
please be aware and search accordingly. Enjoy the hunt, and if you
don't want to be seen, don't be....&lt;i&gt;SLOW TO HIDE!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The above coordinate is pointless. And while it &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt;
take you to a Focal Point, it won't result in a find, which is the
point.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://photobucket.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What's the point? It's probably pointless to many. But
if you get the point, it's a point of interest.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;After all, this is a game of points. Some high, some low,
some in between.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;b&gt;It is not necessary to visit the points on the map to
complete this cache. They are points of reference only and are
provided to make the solution easy and fun.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;After all, that's the point.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;I found an interesting piece of wood, shaped like a
dipper, in Illinois and brought it here. But now it's either gone
or grown over, see logs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The container itself is a 35mm and is now tucked into a spot that
is not as interesting as the dipper I brought from 200 miles away,
but a SMILIE just the same. Still don't worry about stealth.
&lt;i&gt;Look as villainous as possible!&lt;/i&gt; If they can find it they can
have it! I have more! Just please wedge it back in so it doesn't
fall out. Obviously the holder is the functional part of the
hide.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;You'll likely hear this before you see it. Sometimes the
neatest stuff is just out of sight.&lt;br /&gt;

Please don't go poking where you can't see without poking first.
There's evidence of critters here.&lt;br /&gt;

And, as always, don't touch stone walls. They were here before you,
let 'em be.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Along a trail which encircles the golf course at SENECA
PARK. It's a 2.4 mile loop and is pretty well cached.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I made a nice lob shot here. Maybe some day I'll try the
game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please be respectful of the GREEN SPACES and don't deviate
unnecessarily from the great trail. We've struck a deal; we don't
trek on the greens and they don't cart on our trek. Fair
enough.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

___________________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This cache is a camo'd PB jar containing a 35 with a paper and
vinyl log. It's about 40 feet off the trail on a path and hidden
under a brick. &lt;i&gt;Please replace brick.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please bring a sharpie or similar permanent marker for all hides
along the trail. Ballpoints and pencils won't work on
vinyl.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I've heard the term &lt;i&gt;jackleg&lt;/i&gt; many times and never
really understood what it was, until now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Meet Jack. Kinda.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While riding my bike along this trail and dropping a few caches, I
found one in my pack.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Read it. This is a jackleg, hidden near a dogleg.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a narrow trail and like many trails in Seneca/Cherokee
Park, cyclists are common, frequent and silent.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;They will appear suddenly, quietly and without warning.
&lt;u&gt;Please be aware and be safe!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Things are not always what you think.....
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I hid my very first cache in this great exercise park seven
years ago. It was simple, a 35mm film can with a log that
frequently got damp and was replaced often.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a lightly camo'd common item hidden in plain geo-sight. You
don't need to move anything to see it (depending on how the last
finder left it for you).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There's a logbook contained in an Rx bottle which should be
moisture-proof.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just for nostalgic reasons, I shot the coords with my first GPSr, a
2001 Magellan SporTrak Map and it returned the exact same waypoint
as that very first hide. Imagine that!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
...........or are they?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please exercise some degree of stealth, this is a popular
park for walkers and ducksters alike. You will search in relative
seclusion (there's a path by the sign), but try and look like
you're feeding ducks or something (Fang?) and no one will give you
a second look.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And, of course, replace the cache as found to prevent scavaging and
to guarantee following cachers the same fun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Oh, and be mindful of where you reach. Someone reported
seeing a...spider....around here. Plus Fang will be watching, so be
prepared. He was here first...and he'll be here last. You just
never know where Fang might be...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Keep your log non-descriptive and please indicate if all is well.
Any nature photos you may have are welcome!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;You must determine if you can replace the cache as found
before you go for it. You may not want to.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Crazed Wabbit
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
_____________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;AS I was riding my bike along this trail a herd of
ROAD&lt;br /&gt;
RAGED RABBITS emerged from my right without warning and failed to
yield the right of way, forcing me into an uncontrolled swerving
panic skid and collision with the cable barrier.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;'You're STEW'!, I screamed as they thundered across the
hareway.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The only thing I had handy was an Rx bottle so I threw it in their
direction and It disappeared into a wabbit hole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Beware the hare-brained hotheads. I'd swear one of 'em gave me
a&lt;br /&gt;
fuzzy flip-off.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;NOTE: log requires a sharpie or similar permanent

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cherokee Park. Louisville, KY.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sandwich&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;As a NOUN:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A sandwich is a food item made of two or more slices of leavened
bread with one or more layers of filling, typically meat or cheese,
with the addition of vegetables or salad. The bread can be used as
is, or it can be coated with butter, oil, mustard or other
condiments to enhance flavor and texture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Or, as a VERB:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To insert (one thing) tightly between two other things of differing
character or quality.&lt;br /&gt;
Or, to 'sandwich' a geocache in a sliver of available space
bordered by three other geocaches.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

___________________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cache is sandwiched in a very narrow gap with mere
inches existing on either side. Now, &lt;i&gt;That's&lt;/i&gt; a
sandwich!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Call it maximizing utilization of available cachescape.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;You are looking for a, well, SANDWICH in a, um, SANDWICH BAG
hidden low and obvious. Please return as found to maintain
moistureproofing.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache was averaged 200 times to an accuracy of 12 feet under
heavy canopy. Your results may vary.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;WARNING: Nettles about!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Hidden along a trail which encircles the golf course.
It's a 2.4 mile loop and is cached with old and new hides.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Beware of cyclists or hikers who may appear suddenly, quiely and
without warning. This is a narrow trail and has blind curves but
also long straightaways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also be aware that two log obstacle course challenges and a bridge
exist&lt;br /&gt;
along the trail near THE LONG CUT cache. Both obstacles are on a
downhill slope and if you finally see them at speed on a bike,
well, tell us about it in your log, Evel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache is an Rx bottle containing a log inside a zlok an is
adjacent to the trail.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;One Man's Junk is Another Man's....JUNK!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Junk drawers are fascinating things. Everything in there
is so valuable....and so worthless.&lt;br /&gt;
I was looking for cache swag and decided I couldn't do any better
than worthless valuables from the coveted junk drawer.&lt;br /&gt;
Something for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hey, it's a flea market in a box!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;___________________________________________________&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This cache is hidden off a trail in Cherokee Park. The
first container is an ammo box (well, kinda) with the precise
(really!) distance and bearing to the final which is
nearby....kinda.&lt;br /&gt;
Replace the container exactly as found, please!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Continue to final, where there is a container full of valuable
worthlessness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thick As A Brick&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Really don't mind if you sit this one out.&lt;br /&gt;
My word's but a whisper -- your deafness a&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;SHOUT.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I may make you feel but I cant make you think.&lt;br /&gt;
Your mind's in the gutter -- your love's in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;
So you ride yourselves over the fields&lt;br /&gt;
and you make all your animal deals,&lt;br /&gt;
and your wise men don't know how it feels,&lt;br /&gt;
to be&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thick...as a Brick!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;-Jethro Tull, &lt;u&gt;THICK AS A BRICK,&lt;/u&gt; 1972&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This cache is hidden off a trail along Beargrass Creek
in Cherokee Park. The terrain is 1.5 until a burst of 3.0 in the
last few feet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are so many trails in the park that it's difficult to find a
spot out of sight of hikers or bikers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;So I made my own!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;___________________________________________________&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Cache contains a log in an Rx bottle inside a PB jar. It use to
be a phony brick, but because it was repeatedly not replaced as
found, it was ruined. Now it has a plastic logbook so I won't have
to replace it after every use. Bring a permanent marker
(sharpie).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please replace as found!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Coordinate was averaged 100 times and accuracy was less than 17ft
under summer canopy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Initial historical research found that the wall fountain
set in the steep bank near the park’s Lexington Road
entrance, was given in 1901 by Margarethe Christensen in memory of
her mother, Paulina, who had died suddenly in the spring of
1899.&lt;br /&gt;
Using Miss Christensen’s $1,000 donation, the Board of Park
Comissioners sought advice from the Olmsted firm on appropriate
design and placement for such a monument.&lt;br /&gt;
Although it served for many years as a watering trough for horses,
the unique sculpture suffered from vandalism and decay in the 1970s
and ‘80s. Attempts to repair the dragon boat using concrete
and other materials were unfaithful to the original design, and
many stones were missing or had fallen from their initial
positions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was restored in 2004 and hasn't been vandalized,
yet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rx bottle, log in z-bag. Please zip and replace as found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;If you see Vandalism In Progress, report it. It's
&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;YOUR&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt; property!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perry Wilkes - Medal of Honor Recipient&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;WILKES, PERRY Rank and Organization: Pilot, U.S. Navy. Entered
Service At: Indiana. Born: 6 June 1830, Indiana. G.O. No.: 45, 31
December 1864.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Citation:&lt;br /&gt;
Served as pilot on board the U.S.S. Signal, Red River, 5 May 1864.
Proceeding up the Red River, the U.S.S. Signal engaged a large
force of enemy field batteries and sharpshooters, returning their
fire until the ship was totally disabled, at which time the white
flag was ordered raised. Acting as pilot throughout the battle,
Wilkes stood by his wheel until it was disabled in his hands by a
bursting enemy shell.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Perry Wilkes is interred with his family at Cave Hill Cemetery
in Louisville, KY. Below is the family Monument (Note Pilot's Wheel
center/top), Perry Wilke's MOH marker is behind it. Monument is
visible from road.&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;One side of this monument is engraved:&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hettie Louise,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;&lt;u&gt;Daughter of Perry and Mary L. Wilkes.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;To reveal the coordinates of the final location, do this
subtraction:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Year of Birth - 963 = xxx&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Year of Death - 1440 = yyy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The final can be located at:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;38* 14.XXX&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;085*42.YYY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;You are searching for a camoed Rx bottle contained in a
decorated decon container sheltered inside a black tent. Please be
careful to replace as found.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;I recommend this as a daytime cache only!&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Please be aware of those who are aware of you!&lt;/h3&gt;

We worked our way over to the final and had a lot of trouble with  GPS bounce but eventually things sealed down and we were able to locate this one.

If the Beargrass is cooperative you may cross the concrete crosstie

NOT recommended as a office-clothes grab unless you like the scent

&lt;br /&gt;
________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The cache most likely to be &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;IGNORED&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is...&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.....the type you dislike the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone dreads a certain cache-type or hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some, it's &lt;b&gt;where&lt;/b&gt; it's hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some it's the stuff/swag they find inside caches, or...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;trade items left by others. They seem useless, worthless,
dangerous or, well, just stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you dislike a hide location. Guard rails, lamp skirts or
anything Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wet moldy logs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbreviations, TFTC, TNLN, SL, etc?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stupid L-O-N-G hints? If it's longer than the description, it's
too long! Try 30 characters or less!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's a long hike in a stupid forest to find a stupid ammo
box in a spot with a stupid view of the stupid beautiful valley
below with stupid birds singing and stupid deer looking on through
a stupid fog-shrouded spring sunrise with stupid dew glistening on
stupid new growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, brother, how I feel your pain! &lt;b&gt;Press the BUTTON!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here's mine:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The description says, &lt;b&gt;'CACHE CONTAINS LOG ONLY, BYOP' and be
STEALTHY. NO TRADE ITEMS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I use stealth, grab cache, pop it open.....&lt;b&gt;AND STUPID SIG
ITEMS GO EVERYWHERE!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cards, buttons, labels, pathtags, rocks, beads, stars, erasers,
coupons, YOU NAME IT! &lt;b&gt;BAM! Everywhere!&lt;/b&gt; How can I be stealthy
when a sig-bomb just went off and I'm clambering about trying to
collect all the sig-debris?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, said another way, why does your sig-stuff become my
maintenance stuff? What, did you flunk LOGBOOK 101? Don't
understand NO TRADE ITEMS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahem. Ok, enough. That's mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;To log this cache you &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;SHOULD&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt; describe any ONE
thing about caching/caches that you dislike. Be brief and use no
names. Failure to air your gripe may (not) result in your log being
DELETED. Name only in the logbook inside the cache.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;NO TRADE ITEMS, NO STUPID LABELS, NO SIG ITEMS!&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular cache is a stupid Rx bottle in a tree. A stupid
tree that's green all year. With stupid needles. Right next to a
stupid road. Another stupid P/G. Contains log only. No STUPID sig
items!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Birthday Song at Cave Hill&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Welcome to beautiful Cave Hill Cemetery.
Hours of operation are 0800 - 1645 daily.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The coordinates will bring you to the entrance at the
belltower (left). There you can set your GPSr aside.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whether you are a cacher with thousands of finds or a
beginner with only a few, you are created equal within these
walls.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I optimized this series beginning with site #1. Start
anywhere you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;All sites are within sight of a lane, some closer than
others. In fact, you'll park within just a few feet of most if you
make the correct decisions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bring a loaf of bread for the waterfowl, they'll certainly be
expecting it!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enjoy the tour, and the cache! The cemetery is a fun and
beautiful experience, but there's a little ARF! in there!
Ooo-RAH!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Top Images, Left to Right&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Sign at the entrance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Cemetery Office Building.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(Site #1) Square stone - Sec. A, 699. Characters in first name
minus two = A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(Site #2) Three stones - Sec. G, 96 Grave 8. Characters in last
name = B.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lower row, Left to Right&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(Site #3) Tiffany Vase - Sec.N. 6-2_,1893 = C.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(Site #4) Male Bust -Sec. 33, 57. Numbers in triangle summed,
minus four = D.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(Site #5) Black Obelisk Sec. 37, 271. First name plus last name
minus two = E.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;(Site #6) Girl w/Dove Sec. 42, 7. Nickname minus three =
F.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Final Coordinates are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;38* 14.ABC&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;085* 42.DEF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geochecker.com/index.php?code=efa8fff42b7d8cb4e00c54eee93942b0&amp;amp;action=check&amp;amp;wp=474358545451&amp;amp;name=53696e672074686520534f4e47&quot;&gt;
Geochecker.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When the container was placed, the contents were as
follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Five sealed envelopes. The content of each is identical. The
first five loggers, whether an individual or a team, are entitled
to one envelope only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two geo-coins, courtesy IndyDiver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;A DVD, reserved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;A BOOBY PRIZE (I'm sure it will never leave.
:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;A YJTB (Collectible!)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;A GJTB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;ARF's Cub Scout TB&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;ARF's Gold 5k TB Dogtag Dogtag&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache-In, Trash-Out Geo-Coin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;A logbook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;And a mechanical pencil 'under the hood'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When you arrive at the final, notice that you are in an open
area and exposed to a trail, a road and bush. Stealth doesn't work
here. When you see the challenge, please check the road and trail
to be sure they are clear and execute quickly. You may want to move
out of sight with the container and check for muggles before
returning it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;I recommend the final as a daytime cache
only!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The final has been FLUFFED as of 3/27/08. Missing components
have been replaced. If you get here and find you can't quite get
across the goal line, please review the description and you'll

&lt;p&gt;Metro Parks built a dog park at Cochran Hill in Cherokee Park.
They limited the number of permits to 750 so the dog park is never
crowded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park has every dog ammenity imaginable on the three-acre
site. It's divided into two parts to keep small dogs from eating
large ones. There is running water, sheltered sling chairs,
auto-feeders, alpoo vending machines, doggie afterburner sanitary
care-stations, and a code-entry gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But something was missing. Oh, I see. There is no male-dog rest
area. Yep, no &lt;b&gt;fire plug&lt;/b&gt;. So I added one (now gone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a camoed Rx bottle with a log in a z-lok.
Please zip up when finished and replace as found. Don't displace
the fire plug (someone took it)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a popular bike trail nearby, please watch for
cyclists!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Should you choose to take a tour with your Geo-Hound,
please proceed to the gate address, 2795.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;The BRONZE of Cave Hill&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Welcome to beautiful Cave Hill Cemetery. Gates are
open from 0800 - 1645 daily.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What may well be Louisville’s best example of
karst topography&lt;/b&gt; is the old section of Cave Hill Cemetery
— complete with limestone outcroppings, a quarry lake, a
spring-fed stair-step stream and several classic examples of
sinkholes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
final stop for hundreds of notable Louisvillians also doubles as an
arboretum for &lt;i&gt;most every tree able to thrive in this
climate.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;History of Cave Hill Cemetery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The city fathers did not have a cemetery in mind&lt;/b&gt; when
they acquired part of the old farm that the Johnson family had
called Cave Hill. The farm had a &lt;i&gt;good spring&lt;/i&gt; emanating from
&lt;i&gt;a cave&lt;/i&gt;, but its &lt;i&gt;stone quarries&lt;/i&gt; were of principal
interest, particularly because the proposed Louisville and
Frankfort Railroad was supposed to run through the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;As almost an afterthought,&lt;/b&gt; a few flat acres were to be
surveyed off to balance the burying privileges at the west end of
Jefferson Street.&lt;/p&gt;
____________________________________________
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;They certainly did not envision&lt;/b&gt; Cave Hill Cemetery
becoming one of &lt;i&gt;the most beautiful arboretums and garden
cemeteries in all of America!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

_______________________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Cave Hill Cemetery is one of the&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SEVEN WONDERS OF LOUISVILLE!&lt;/b&gt;

__________________________________________________________________________________________

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;At the following coordinates you will find the information
to answer the questions which will determine the final
location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

___________________________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;38' 14.711 85' 43.002&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Tower Bell&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This bell sat atop a tower in section ?? until 1991. It
was rung each time a funeral procession passed and could be heard
for quite some distance. It was moved after the tower became old
and unstable.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Let ?? minus 5 equal &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

______________________________________________________________________________

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;38' 14.850 85' 42.575&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Harry Collins&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Harry Collins, with sleight of hand, needed only ??
casters on his magic stand.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Let ?? plus 1 equal B&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

______________________________________________________________________________

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Best Friends&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;38' 14.680 85' 42.815&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Bo's best buddy stares intently at his friend, wondering
whenever they will play again?&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let the number of characters in Bo's dog's name plus five
equal&lt;/b&gt; C&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;

______________________________________________________________________________

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;38' 14.691 85' 42.822&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Brittany's Wish&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Read the wish. No more to say.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Let Brittany's age minus 15 equal D.&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
BTW, one of the sculptures is Brittany, can you tell which?&lt;br /&gt;

______________________________________________________________________________

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;38' 14.847 85' 42.947&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sam's Rock&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nothing to add here.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;So, let the number of handprints equal E.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

______________________________________________________________________________

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;38' 14.690 85' 42.460&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Boy-Boy&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Here in bronze, stands little Boy-Boy. What is the name
of his favorite toy-toy?&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Let the number of characters in the toy's name equal
&lt;b&gt;F.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;


______________________________________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The HINT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;38' 14.664 85' 42.555&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Happiness&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;And finally, this sculpture will show you the container
you are seeking.&lt;br /&gt;
The number of butterflies multiplied by 4 equal the number of feet
from the paved walkway where the container is
hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;







&lt;br /&gt;

_____________________________________________________________________
&lt;b&gt;The FINAL location is &lt;i&gt;here:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;N 38' 14.ABC&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;W 085' 43.DEF&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A+B+C+D+E+F = 33&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

______________________________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I do not hide physical caches in cemeteries. When you
complete the information required, it will direct you to a location
somewhere outside the Cave Hill Property. It's not far, but it
cannot be accessed directly from within the
cemetery.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

________________________________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Enjoy The BRONZE!&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;i&gt;a cave&lt;/i&gt;, but its &lt;i&gt;stone quarries&lt;/i&gt; were of principal
interest, particularly because the proposed Louisville and
Frankfort Railroad was supposed to run through the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;As almost an afterthought,&lt;/b&gt; a few flat acres were to be
surveyed off to balance the burying privileges at the west end of
Jefferson Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;They certainly did not envision&lt;/b&gt; Cave Hill Cemetery
becoming one of &lt;i&gt;the most beautiful arboretums and garden
cemeteries in all of the United States!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Cave Hill Cemetery is one of the&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Seven Wonders of LOUISVILLE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This milti-stop cache will guide you around the beautiful
arboretum and garden cemetery that is Cave Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more to see. For now be happy that you are just passing
through. You may want to stop by the office and pick up a GUIDE TO
CAVE HILL, it's free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please understand and abide by the rules of Cave Hill
and enjoy your visit!&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Built in &lt;b&gt;1892&lt;/b&gt; for $565 as a Watchman's Shelter House, it is
covered in oak bark in St. Andrew's cross pattern. It is one of the
oldest examples of rustic architecture in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;
Let the number of times the 'X' pattern occurs on the structure,
minus 2, equal &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;br /&gt;
Lawyer, legislator, soldier, and governor, he was born on Jan. 3,
1817, in present Clinton County. During Civil War he raised and was
colonel of 3rd Ky. Union Inf. In 1862, Pres. Lincoln appointed him
US Dist. Attorney for Ky. The next year he became governor after an
election rife with Union military interference. (reverse) Governor
until 1867, he supported pardons for ex-CSA and fought Freedmen's
Bureau, 14th and 15th constitutional ammend. Estab. Ag. and Mech.
College, forerunner to
&lt;b&gt;UNIVERSITY of KENTUCKY.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the last number of the year of his death plus 4 equal
&lt;b&gt;B.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Hugh Haynie's style was clean lined and heavily inked, and somewhat
reminiscent of Al Capp. Haynie regularly penned in his wife's name
&quot;Lois&quot; into his drawings. At one time he was syndicated in over 80
newspapers.
&lt;p&gt;For most of his 36 years we saw &lt;i&gt;Lois&lt;/i&gt;. Suddenly Lois was
gone from his work.&lt;br /&gt;
Haynie died in 1999. I expected more (after all that time) than a
single, stark and lonely stone which READS 'Beloved American
&lt;i&gt;-blank-&lt;/i&gt;. Hugh Smith Haynie, Sr., beloved by many, is buried
here, alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the number of letters in &lt;i&gt;-blank-&lt;/i&gt;, minus one, equal
&lt;b&gt;C.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

[Note] BTW, &quot;Lois&quot; appears at least twice in this sketch, can
you find just one?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Confederate Gray&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Nicola Marschall (1829–1917) was a German-American artist who
supported the Confederate cause during the American Civil War.
&lt;i&gt;He designed the original Confederate flag, the STARS and
&lt;b&gt;BARS&lt;/b&gt;, as well as the official gray uniform of the
Confederate army.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His wife encouraged Marschall to take part in the competition to
create the new flag destined to represent the &lt;i&gt;Confederate States
of America&lt;/i&gt;. Marschall's design became &lt;i&gt;the first Confederate
flag,&lt;/i&gt; with one of its first appearances at the Ben Johnson
House in Bardstown, Kentucky. After the War he returned to Marion,
Alabama but moved to Louisville later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Let the number of times that 'CSA' appears on his stone
(all sides) plus 6 equal &lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;b&gt;OVER 500 species of GREEN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cave Hill is Louisville's only arboretum&lt;/i&gt; and maintaining
the trees undisturbed is difficult because of the nature of the
cemetery business. Root damage is prevalent and trees die from this
damage as well as lightning, wind damage and old age.&lt;br /&gt;
Many of the plants are labeled with green, engraved plastic signs
which are easily visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the largest, and most interesting plantings here is a
maidenhair tree, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;planted in 1830 – eighteen years
before the area was dedicated as a cemetery.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Now with a
spread of 130ft and a circumference around the trunk of 18ft it has
grown into a splendid specimen – with &lt;i&gt;one unexpected
quirk.&lt;/i&gt; It mutated and now bears both male &lt;u&gt;and&lt;/u&gt; female
fruit!&lt;br /&gt;
While parked here I suddenly remembered my elementary school locker
combination, 0-24-4. I also remembered where I put my keys, and the
name of my new neighbor.... Why was that?&lt;br /&gt;
I took a pic with a Jeep parked there to show the relative size of
the tree. Trust me, it's a memorable place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the number of letters in the name on the &lt;b&gt;GREEN&lt;/b&gt; tag,
minus four, equal &lt;b&gt;E.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;The Douglass Lot&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Douglass family sold 49 acres of land surrounding their
family lot to the cemetery in 1863 with the agreement the fence
would remain. It's the only fence enclosing a plot in the 296-acre
cemetery. No others are permitted. There are other names in the
Douglass family plot. Of particular interest is George Carter seen
at rest in the sea shell. What is George Carter's middle name?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the number of characters in the middle name, minus four,
equal &lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

____________________________________________________________________________

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The final location for this multi is located here:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;N 38' 14.ABC&lt;br /&gt;
W 085' 43.DEF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm happy that you were just passing through!&lt;/p&gt;

____________________________________________________________________________
&lt;b&gt;I don't place physical caches in cemeteries so the final is
located just outside a gate, but not far. Parking is available just
feet from the hide (depending on your approach and
route).&lt;/b&gt;

The above
coordinate may take you to a rock quarry, but it's not going to
float your boat. Instead, you need to visit the the site of the
&lt;b&gt;Canot Rouge&lt;/b&gt; at the reference point listed
below.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A boat
is not required to complete this cache....but this one will make it

Everyone
who paddles knows the importance of 'picking a line' through fast
water. Sometimes if the current is slow you can stop and study.
Sometimes you have to scout on the fly. Either way, if you make a
wrong decision, you could become &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alfred!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This
cache is all about picking a line, or a length. Pick correctly,
grab a grin. Pick wrong, try again! Simple stuff,
eh?
&lt;br /&gt;

______________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;To find the
cache:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Locate Canot Rouge and make a simple determination of it's
length. Then, if the length is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;12'6&quot;
Then 400 feet at 310 degrees&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;13'2&quot;
Then 417 feet at 001 degrees&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;14'3&quot;
Then 190 feet at 163 degrees&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;15'0&quot;
Then 178 feet at 045 degrees&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Whole Food (Lion?) Store, St.
Matthews&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Bomb Retrieval Robot&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

_______________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Story of Vigilance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once
upon a time in Gallatin, Tennessee an &lt;b&gt;Evil Black Jeep&lt;/b&gt; pulled into a grocery store
parking lot at dawn seeking a geocache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At
first glance, the lot was empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After
some searching the cache was located, logged and replaced as
found.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as it turned out, the lot was empty &lt;u&gt;except a
doughnut delivery van&lt;/u&gt; parked around back. The delivery
guy saw what he thought was a bomb being hidden and contacted
authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authorities arrived, followed closely by satellite news
trucks. It became 'breaking news' on local TV and radio stations.
The immediate area was evacuated. Roadblocks were positioned. An
APB was transmitted with a description of the suspect's vehicle,
a Black Jeep Rubicon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;'FIND IT!'&lt;/b&gt;, was the order of the day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the news was being broadcast, the Jeepster listened with
interest while sipping a cup of Krispy Kreme coffee and signing the
log of a cache just found at the nearby State Police Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a bomb squad robot was sent in to extract the
suspicious container which was taken to a remote site and destroyed
with explosives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the detonation, the remnants were collected and examined
for clues and evidence. A tattered piece of paper was found with
writings that began &lt;b&gt;'IF YOU FOUND THIS CONTAINER..&lt;/b&gt;'. Another
piece had what seemed to be a list of code names, like AirRa**F**
and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local news followed the story right up to the eventual
conclusion that taxpayer dollars had financed the retrieval and
destruction of a geocache. The Evil
Black Jeep was never located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This cache, including the name, is a duplicate of that
(archived) hide.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Watch out for a doughnut dude.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;This is a fictional account and is

similarities between people or places, real or imagined, is purely
coincidental and should be completely disregarded.
Ooo-RAH!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Always replace a cache exactly as you found it. The next
cacher's experience is only as good as you leave it, or don't leave
it.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;The above coordinate is bogus, and useless.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;You parked and marked your vehicle, twice. You went down the
trail and then offtrail. It became overcast and rain began. Then
darkness fell. And then your batteries failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;But you remembered to look for a landmark before striking out
and you marked your map. It was Old And Broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are you a NAVIGATOR?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://s225.photobucket.com/albums/dd107/airraidfan/?action=view&amp;amp;current=NavigatorFinal.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;You are seeking a camo'd plastic 24oz container hidden in an
obvious spot.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Coords were accurate to ~20' under heavy overcast skies at
dark when I marked my position with the GPSr as the batteries
died.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Only navigators will find this cache.&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;A Note About EVINCE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;There are situations where it's possible, because of the nature
of the calculations, that a &lt;u&gt;correct&lt;/u&gt; answer is not
necessarily an &lt;u&gt;exact&lt;/u&gt; answer. For &lt;b&gt;Navigator&lt;/b&gt; caches,
I've opted for the Evince &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Horseshoes and Atom Bombs&lt;/u&gt;
method&lt;/b&gt;, because close enough should be good enough. How close
your solution is may range from ten to two-hundred feet depending
on the particular cache. The rest is up to you. Trust your
solution.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This is a &lt;i&gt;REALLY COOL&lt;/i&gt; place!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;And as art galleries are wont to do, they've moved the
display so the wall is basically....blanc. So the name of this
cache has changed once again as well. Same location, same
container, same coords. And yet again, there's a hint in the
name.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a school of artfish above the courtyard. You won't see
&lt;i&gt;THAT&lt;/i&gt; everyday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are pieces of art everywhere. Even for us outdoors types,
and you won't see &lt;i&gt;THOSE&lt;/i&gt; everyday!.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's even a 'piece' by me. And you won't see &lt;i&gt;THAT&lt;/i&gt;,
either! Not immediately, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come especially if you enjoy art! There are dozens of studios to
explore&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and a small selection of eateries with excellent menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don't disturb the wall hangings except to appreciate them
as art and perhaps a clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache is not part of, or hidden behind, any art
display!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you do spot it, please take a 'cell call' and look around
first. After all, this &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a mall and patrons may appear
suddenly and without warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your time, have a seat, it's not going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring your usual tools. Just in case...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;The 38-acre Beargrass Creek Greenway at Irish Hill&lt;/b&gt; and its
associated 1.5 mile bike path extend from the corner of Lexington
Road and Grinstead Drive. Located on land initially acquired by the
Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, the BCG is protected as an area
dedicated to passive recreation under the Keep America Beautiful
program.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://photobucket.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTICE: The cache is hidden just inches below the platform
on the mast of a billboard. You must, or may, sit on the platform
to reach the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you suffer from acrophobia, vertigo, motion sickness,
cryptophobia, arphobia or just phobophobia, then BUMMER!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever flown into LAX at night with 160mph Santa Anna
crosswinds buffeting the aircraft on approach and you didn't hold
your hands high above your seat and scream, you may want to hit the
IGNORE button now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever been tossed overboard from a cruise ship during a
hurricane at night with no life vest, drifted amongst sharks for
three days in 30-foot seas and were picked up by a USCG rescue
chopper after being spotted six miles away by a trained pigeon and
DID NOT run back to the front of the cruise &lt;b&gt;LINE&lt;/b&gt;, this may
not be for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you aren't, and you DID, and you &lt;b&gt;still&lt;/b&gt; want
to squeeze just a T-A-D bit more endorphin from this big ol' scream
we call LIFE, then what the heck, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;u&gt;IF&lt;/u&gt; you got up there and had to call the local cat rescue
squad to bring you down in a basket while you breathed into a brown
paper bag because you freaked-out, &lt;i&gt;PLEASE&lt;/i&gt; share that
experience in your log! You've been WARRENED!&lt;/h3&gt;

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;b&gt;SQUIRES, JOHN C.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rank and Organization: Sergeant (then Private First Class),
U.S. Army, Company A, 30th Infantry, 3d Infantry Division. Place
and Date Near Padiglione, Italy, 23-24 April 1944. Entered Service
at: Louisville, Ky. Birth: Louisville, Ky. G.O. No.: 78, 2 October
1944.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Citation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life
above and beyond the call of duty.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
At the start of his company's attack on strongly held enemy
positions in and around Spaccasassi Creek, near Padiglione, Italy,
on the night of 23-24 April 1944, Pfc. Squires, platoon messenger,
participating in his first offensive action, braved intense
artillery, mortar, and antitank gun fire in order to investigate
the effects of an antitank mine explosion on the leading platoon.
Despite shells which burst close to him, Pfc. Squires made his way
50 yards forward to the advance element, noted the situation,
reconnoitered a new route of advance and informed his platoon
leader of the casualties sustained and the alternate route. Acting
without orders, he rounded up stragglers, organized a group of lost
men into a squad and led them forward. When the platoon reached
Spaccasassi Creek and established an outpost, Pfc. Squires, knowing
that almost all of the noncommissioned officers were casualties,
placed 8 men in position of his own volition, disregarding enemy
machinegun, machine-pistol, and grenade fire which covered the
creek draw. When his platoon had been reduced to 14 men, he brought
up reinforcements twice. On each trip he went through barbed wire
and across an enemy minefield, under intense artillery and mortar
fire. Three times in the early morning the outpost was
counterattacked. Each time Pfc. Squires ignored withering enemy
automatic fire and grenades which struck all around him, and fired
hundreds of rounds of rifle, Browning automatic rifle, and captured
German Spandau machinegun ammunition at the enemy, inflicting
numerous casualties and materially aiding in repulsing the attacks.
Following these fights, he moved 50 yards to the south end of the
outpost and engaged 21 German soldiers in individual machinegun
duels at point-blank range, forcing all 21 enemy to surrender and
capturing 13 more Spandau guns. Learning the function of this
weapon by questioning a German officer prisoner, he placed the
captured guns in position and instructed other members of his
platoon in their operation. The next night when the Germans
attacked the outpost again he killed 3 and wounded more Germans
with captured potato-masher grenades and fire from his Spandau
gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sgt. Squires was killed in a subsequent action shortly before
the war would end. It is his image which stands atop the MoH
sculpture in downtown Louisville, KY (and below).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache begins in beautiful Zachary Taylor National
Cemetery, with the final nearby but not inside these
walls.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;To determine the final coordinates, consider the
following:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;At A-1361 lies Wallace G. Do this math to ascertain the
final location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOB - 1555 = XXX&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOD - 1307 = YYY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The final is located here:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;38* 16.XXX&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;085* 38.YYY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;SANDLIN, WILLIE Rank and Organization: Sergeant, U.S. Army,
Company A, 132d Infantry, 33d Division. Place and Date: At
Bois-de-Forges, France, 26 September 1918. Entered Service At:
Hyden, Ky. Birth: Jackson, Ky. G. O. No.: 16, W.D., 1919.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Citation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;He showed conspicuous gallantry in action by advancing alone
directly on a machinegun nest which was holding up the line with
its fire.&lt;/b&gt; He killed the crew with a grenade and enabled the
line to advance. Later in the day he attacked alone and put out of
action 2 other machinegun nests, setting a splendid example of
bravery and coolness to his men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Willie Sandlin is buried in Zachary Taylor National Cemetery
at the address in the hint. Saturation rules prevented me from my
original plan. You are seeking a log contained in a camoed Rx
bottle secluded inside a decorated decon container sheltered in a
black tent.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Please be aware of those who are vigilant!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;There is a dogtag affixed to the front of each container. If
it's missing, look on the ground beneath the cache. If you find it,
place it inside the container. The dogtags are not trade items&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;** NOTICE
**&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This hike can only be made if
river conditions allow safe passage. The lower gauge must be 12
feet or less. The &lt;i&gt;UPPER SPILLWAY GATES&lt;/i&gt; &lt;u&gt;MUST&lt;/u&gt; be closed
completely, NO EXCEPTION (and NO POSSIBILITY EITHER,
actually)!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For an instant
up-to-the-minute NOAA McAlpine Dam lower gauge forecast, click on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crh.noaa.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=lmk&amp;amp;gage=mlpk2&amp;amp;view=1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1&amp;amp;toggles=10,7,8,2,9,15,6&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;RIVER
LEVEL&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So long as that green dotted line is
marching at the ~10-foot mark, &lt;i&gt;you're good to
go!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;SAFETY MUST BE THE FIRST
CONSIDERATION!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

____________________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
Logs that indicate swimming will be
deleted!
&lt;br /&gt;

_______________________________________________________
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;** NOTICE
**&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Call this number: (502) 775-5056
and listen to the one-minute recording.
&lt;br /&gt;
You will hear critical information on
the river level above and below the dam.&lt;br /&gt;
When the upper gauge is 'at pool', the
level will be 12.8 feet (or less). The 'lower level' (below the
dam) **MUST** be 12.0 feet or *LESS* or you must not attempt this
cache!&lt;br /&gt;
UNDERSTAND the three-day forecast from
the National Weather Service! It will advise the trend of the lower
river level. If the forecast is for a rising river, even by tenths
of a foot, beware! PLEASE understand that the river level can
change dramatically and violently with very little
notice!&lt;br /&gt;
DO THIS CACHE ON A STATIONARY OR FALLING
FORECAST ONLY!&lt;br /&gt;
When there is to be a change in gate
position and water flow/level, there will be a &lt;b&gt;FIVE MINUTE
CONTINUOUS SOUNDING OF THE SIREN&lt;/b&gt;. ONCE THE SIREN GOES SILENT,
THERE WILL BE A 30-MINUTE PAUSE BEFORE THE GATES RAISE (or lower,
do you remember the forecast?). So, it's wise to time your hike.
Once you are 30 minutes away from crossing the upper gates you're
in no-man's land. You're on your own from here. Note: most gate
changes occur at the lower spillway during September and
&lt;i&gt;early&lt;/i&gt; October. But hurricanes change
everything!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bring your camera! Your friends will
never, ever top this!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Okay, the
DON'Ts:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;MOST IMPORTANT! Don't attempt this
cache alone! IT AIN'T COOL TO BE A FOOL! Seriously, if you sink
knee-deep in river mud, and you're alone, you're done. Have a
partner!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't walk near the water on
ANYTHING other than rock or FOSSIL BED without testing first! River
mud is deceptive, looks like water-packed sand. And it loves you,
doesn't want to let you go, and it won't! Walk on HIGH
GROUND!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't step on the cracked
ground. It's mud with a sandy disguise.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't attempt this with less
than three legs. If you have less than three, you'll likely damage
one or two. Use a STAFF!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't attempt to cross swift
water! Smooth, swift water is dangerous and can (and will) sweep
you off your feet in an instant!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't stare at moving water
while crossing, you'll lose your balance! Look off briefly to
maintain perspective. Rocks with moss are slick!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't interact with the orange
or metallic water.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don't be on the other side when
the sun sets. Get out an hour before. Else you may risk a night at
the Patch Reef KOA!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The MUST
DO's:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;DO bring your
moonwalk. You'll need it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO bring your creek legs and
sand feet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO be prepared to be
knee-deep-wet and sandy. This is, after all, a
beach!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO cross near the upper gates
ONLY. You'll see broken steps by gate #1 leading to the concrete
deck. This was my access. DO NOT step onto the deck if the upper
dam is open or you &lt;i&gt;WILL BE&lt;/i&gt; a goner! See pics.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO be prepared to cross moving
water. If the lower gauge is around 10.0 feet or lower, current is
minimal.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO bring a camera. Sure, you may
fall and ruin it, but if you don't the pics are
priceless!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO look at the attached pics,
they tell a lot more.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO forgive me for the length of
this description, but this can be a dangerous, unforgiving
place.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Your
opinion about disposable plastic products (bottles) will be forever
changed as you pass through the Cottonwoods and
Willows.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finally, this cache isn't meant
to be difficult to find, and isn't. An attempt has been made to
protect it from battering when the water rises. Please leave it at
least as protected as you found it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also, the description of the
possible difficulties associated with this cache is to raise
awareness. Carelessness can result in pain here. Crossing moving
water is required twice out, twice back. If you choose your
approaches correctly, you will leave with wet shoes only. If you
choose wrong, tell us in the log, MUDPUPPY!.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;_________________________________________________________&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">ATTENTION: THE CACHE IS NOT AT THE LISTED COORDINATES- SEE THE LARGE DESCRIPTION FOR THE FINAL.&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to Sac-KY for FTF!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wernher von Braun (1912–1977) was one of the most important rocket developers and champions of space exploration during the period between the 1930s and the 1970s. As a youth he became enamored with the possibilities of space exploration by reading the science fiction of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and from the science fact writings of Hermann Oberth, whose 1923 classic study, Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen (By Rocket to Space), prompted young von Braun to master calculus and trigonometry so he could understand the physics of rocketry. From his teenage years, von Braun had held a keen interest in space flight, becoming involved in the German rocket society, Verein fur Raumschiffarht (VfR), as early as 1929. As a means of furthering his desire to build large and capable rockets, in 1932 he went to work for the German army to develop ballistic missiles. While engaged in this work, von Braun received a Ph.D. in physics on July 27, 1934.&lt;br/&gt;The brainchild of von Braun’s rocket team operating at a secret laboratory at Peenemünde on the Baltic coast, the V–2 rocket was the immediate antecedent of those used in space exploration programs in the United States and the Soviet Union. A liquid propellant missile extending some 46 feet in length and weighing 27,000 pounds, the V-2 flew at speeds in excess of 3,500 miles per hour and delivered a 2,200-pound warhead to a target 500 miles away. First flown in October 1942, it was employed against targets in Europe beginning in September 1944. By the beginning of 1945, it was obvious to von Braun that Germany would not achieve victory against the Allies, and he began planning for the postwar era.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the Allied capture of the V–2 rocket complex, von Braun engineered the surrender of 500 of his top rocket scientists, along with plans and test vehicles, to the Americans. For fifteen years after World War II, von Braun worked with the U.S. Army in the development of ballistic missiles. As part of a military operation called Project Paperclip, he and his rocket team were scooped up from defeated Germany and sent to America where they were installed at Fort Bliss, Texas. There they worked on rockets for the U.S. Army, launching them at White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico. In 1950 von Braun’s team moved to the Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville, Ala., where they built the Army’s Jupiter ballistic missile.&lt;br/&gt;_________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now that you know a little bit about Wernher von Braun, you'll have to think like him to obtain the final coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;As for the cache, the cache is not located at the posted coordinates. In order to obtain these final coordinates, consider the related webpage:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-http://webalt.markworld.com/webalt.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.

Take the flight time (including the decimal digit on the end) [two numbers] and multiply by45.4166667.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;_ _ X 45.4166667 = XYZ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ammo box final is located here:&lt;br/&gt;N 38* 17.ABC&lt;br/&gt;W 085* 39.XYZ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can check your answers for this puzzle on Geochecker.com.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Historic Locust Grove is a 55-acre 18th century farm site and National Historic Landmark situated in eastern Jefferson County, Kentucky (now a part of Louisville Metro). The site is presently owned by the Louisville Metro government, and operated as a historic interpretive site by Historic Locust Grove, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;The main feature on the property is the ca. 1790 Georgian mansion that was the home of the Croghan family and gathering place for George Rogers Clark, Lewis and Clark, and U.S. Presidents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site was founded in 1790 by William Croghan and his wife Lucy Clark Croghan. Lucy was the sister of the younger William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and the older George Rogers Clark, former surveying partner of William Croghan.&lt;br/&gt;On November 8, 1806, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, tracing their way back from the Pacific Ocean, arrived at Locust Grove to a homecoming where Lucy Clark Croghan and her family welcomed them back from their journey. Locust Grove became the only residence still in existence west of the Appalachian Mountains to have sheltered Lewis and Clark. In the Fall of 2006, Locust Grove commemorated the 200th anniversary of Lewis and Clark's return.&lt;br/&gt;George Rogers Clark lived at the site in the final years of his life, from 1809 to 1818.&lt;br/&gt;The property was adjacent to Springfield, the home of Colonel Richard Taylor and his son, future U.S. President Zachary Taylor.&lt;br/&gt;Following the death of William Croghan, the estate passed to John C. Croghan, notable for his purchase of Mammoth Cave in 1838.&lt;br/&gt;In the winter of 1844, the farm was the site of the efforts of African-American slave Stephen Bishop to produce a map of Mammoth Cave. The resulting map was published in 1845, and remained the most complete and accurate map of the period until modern survey techniques were applied in 1908. A significant epilogue to Bishop's story occurred in 1972, when a long-sought route connecting the caves of Flint Ridge and Mammoth Cave Ridge was discovered in an area which Bishop had mapped, but which had in the interim been almost completely flooded by the construction of a dam on the surface nearby: the area of the 20th Century connection route is shown on Bishop's 19th century map.&lt;br/&gt;It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986.&lt;br/&gt;It is located at 561 Blankenbaker Lane in Louisville.&lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Third in the series: Ceratosaurus. Cache is a micro-type container.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congratulations to navygeo0916 for FTF&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ceratosaurus nasicornis&lt;br/&gt;Ceratosaurus was a fairly typical theropod, with a large head, short forelimbs, robust hind legs, and a long tail.&lt;br/&gt;The skull of Ceratosaurus was quite large in proportion to the rest of its body. Each premaxilla contained only three teeth, and each maxilla (the main tooth-bearing bones in the upper jaw) held between twelve and fifteen flattened, exceptionally long teeth. Each dentary (the main tooth-bearing bone in the lower jaw) bore eleven to fifteen teeth. The prominent nose horn is formed from protuberances of the nasal bones. A juvenile specimen is known in which the two halves of the horn are not yet fused together. In addition to the large nasal horn, Ceratosaurus possessed smaller hornlike ridges in front of each eye, similar to those of &lt;br/&gt;Allosaurus. These ridges were formed by enlargement of the lacrimal bones.</groundspeak:long_description>

You will have to get your feet wet to retrieve the cache, so I recommend bringing duck boots, crocks, old tennis-shoes, etc. The stone structure that you will see, believe it or not, used to be an old highway bridge. Many years ago, this bridge connected two roads, Woodside Road, and another road to the north. This road was later closed and demolished to make way for I-71. All that remains are these pillars of rocks and mortar. The structure is in the middle of ankle-deep water in the creek. You will have to wade the creek or walk along the muddy bank to get to it. As with almost any creek, I wouldn't try to hunt this cache before or after periods of high rain, and bring a net if you like, there are plenty of minnows and crawdads just waiting to be caught.</groundspeak:long_description>

We have placed a few of what we call our &quot;signature coins&quot; (Green token w/paw print) and a coin I brought back from South Africa in the container along with a couple of wooden crosses.  We will keep a close on this one since it is our first. If you bring trade items, think what my 8 year old might like?</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This 137 acre lake features fishing, camping, picnic areas, Hiking trails and CACHES! The little Kentucky River Watershed Conservancy District operates Lake Jericho. It has been opened for business since July 25th, 1969. A daily fee ($2.00 per adult) is charged to anyone visiting the park and the proceeds are used to maintain and operate the park. There is a boat launch fee ($4.00), and if you do not own a boat or wish to bring yours, there are boat rentals available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Park is open seasonally (April 1st through November 1st) from dawn to dark, pets are permitted on a leash. All my Lake Jericho caches have been placed with the knowledge and permission of the Park Management. While in the park, whether just there to pick up a few caches or looking to sweep the park in one trip, be sure to take the time to explore the park and it’s new trails, and be sure to stop at the administration building and thank them for supporting the sport of Geocaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently there are 30+ caches planned and in progress for the park, the first batch will be land accessible and the second batch will be water accessible caches. I have tried to make a good mix of difficulties and terrains so there is a little something for everyone.</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Some times when traveling you find yourself in a place and you might even buy yourself a t-shirt with the slogan Been There Done That on it to prove that you were in a particular place. Well after finding and easy way to Deermark’s Tornado Challenge, the been there done that gang decided to make things interesting and take a challenging way out of the valley. Well we might not have left a t-shirt for you to prove you were here, but we left a cache for you to sign.
&lt;p&gt;We highly encourage you to take a picture of your group and especially just where this cache is hidden because we do not want it to be difficult to find. The hard part will be getting there.  It will not be for just anyone but you must go there to become a part of the been there done that gang.&lt;/p&gt;

container inside a rainsuit inside a camoed container inside a tree
(yawn). Easy enough?

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; An addition to an excellent cache series by Deermark along the Shaw
Lake trail. This cache will bring you to the end of public access
on a remote trail. Elevation is 1000'msl. 
&lt;p&gt;You'll find two rest areas (proceed to the second one) and a
nearby cache. The view here may be great in the winter, and the
foliage must be beautiful in the fall, but summer canopy may erode
reception by your GPSr.&lt;/p&gt;
I didn't name this place, but you'll love it. You'll see. 
&lt;p&gt;When you reach the area please acknowledge the &lt;b&gt;PRIVATE
PROPERTY&lt;/b&gt; sign and don't trespass. The cache is located within a
public access area but you must return on the trail you trekked in
on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;HORSE TRAIL RATING: Rugged&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
- Rugged trails are designed for single file riding (hiking) over
extremely steep grades, dramatic topography, native rock and
frequently changing trail surfaces. Obstacles such as rock ledges,
fallen trees and creek crossings may be encountered. 
&lt;p&gt;SAC$ for FTF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: Bow hunting season is in progress for deer. Gun season
starts 11/12. Take appropriate precautions. Wear an orange vest.
Announce your presence. Be vigilant.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

extremely steep grades, dramatic topography, native rock and
frequently changing trail surfaces. Obstacles such as rock ledges,
fallen trees and creek crossings may be encountered. 
&lt;p&gt;Six other neat caches along the trail!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: Bow hunting season is in progress for deer. Gun season
starts 11/12. Take appropriate precautions. Wear an orange vest.
Announce your presence. Be vigilant.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Schwerin showed up and off we went to do some hiking. All I heard was how she hated going up the hills all day as we got 18 caches.

&lt;br /&gt;
Located off the Shaw Lake trail. After that hill, the trail
is a little flatter and much friendlier.&lt;br /&gt;
Cache is located 120 feet off trail in a hardwood forest. Coords
will lead you to within 4 feet, but you'll recognize it well ahead
of that.

#2000th FIND!! Only took me 8 years, 1 month, and 10 days to finally get it. 'Wife' said ARF should give us an ammo box for our find since he gave her such a hard time at the 'WWFM V Shake it or Split it' last month. She was being so nice to him and he was just leading her on and on.................sad, sad( ok...it was in fun). 

Nice cache....liked the hike to it and it was just a beautiful day to grab this one with Schwerin. 'Wife' would have loved to do this hike and be a part of this find. 

Again, I need to thank Alaskan Brewing Co. who have supplied with me the great goodies we leave in as many caches as we can and helping me with my 'good' habit for so many years. And of course to all the other geocachers who have put out all the caches we have found and will find in the future. 

I could have a worse habit, but I really love this one...........

For the 2,000th time....Quick and easy find.

L- What else...Alaskan Brewing Co. Goodies I had just receive yesterday.

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madison Bicentennial Geocaching Treasure Hunt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multi-caches is being set up
for our 200th Bicentennial party to be held from June 6-14, 2009 in
beautiful Madison, Indiana.&lt;br /&gt;
1809-2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must show up between 9-5 at
the coords and go inside and take the playing card. On the card are
10 historical buildings locations in town to visit and a question
to be answered at each. Once completed return to starting spot and
sign log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PATHTAG BONUS:&lt;br /&gt;
For a limited time!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To receive a Madison Bicentennial
pathtag, return to the starting spot and turn in your completed
sheet with your name and address on the back and when they arrive,
we will mail them to you as long as supplies last. There is a
limited supply of tags, and they will not be re-ordered so you will
be getting a piece of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visitors
center is open 9-5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went out to test the coords and
it took us a little over an hour to walk the whole trail and we
even stopped and check out the Miss Madison O'boy Orberto
Hydro-plane race boat who's offices you will pass along the
way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special thanks to the City of
Madison and the Bicentennial Committee for sponsoring this special
Geocache!&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy and Happy Caching.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Is this one
tree or two???????&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a beautiful
hiking trail that starts along the Mighty Ohio River and works it
way to the Madison hill top and Clifty Fall State Park. The hike is
under two miles each way with most of it being along a nice paved
trail or gravel path.&lt;br /&gt;
The place to park is at&lt;br /&gt;
 N 38 44.107&lt;br /&gt;
W 085 23.508&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache should be an
easy find as you get started up the trail. You are looking for a
small film canister like container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several caches
to collect as you work your way to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy and have fun in
Madison........TMC&lt;/p&gt;

They serve Seattle's Best Coffee and have some other goodie’s made in the Jefferson County area.  Also you might as well just go a couple of blocks south and take an easy walk along the Ohio River and enjoy the view of the Madison-Milton bridge. &lt;br/&gt;Thanks and enjoy the hunt…………..&lt;br/&gt;‘Rubicon’ Wooly</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a beautiful
hiking trail that starts along the Mighty Ohio River and works it
way to the Madison hill top and Clifty Fall State Park. The hike is
under two miles each way with most of it being a nice paved trail
or gravel path.&lt;br /&gt;
The place to park is at&lt;br /&gt;
 N 38 44.107&lt;br /&gt;
W 085 23.508&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is as you get
started up the trail. You are looking for a small camo'd
lock-n-lock box.&lt;br /&gt;
Please do not try this cache from HWY 56!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several caches
to collect as you work your way to the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Chirp' GPS'r users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a 'Chirp' cache and the coords will lead you to its
location. Make sure your GPS'r is 'Chirp' enabled and has the
latest updates. You should recieve the new coords and the combo for
the lock on the cache. The cache is not far from this location and
is a nice walk from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Non 'Chirp' GPS'r users:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a container at this location, but you will have to look
for it. In it, there is the coords for the cache and the lock
combo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rating is a 3/3 but can be higher when wet.........Have fun and
enjoy the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

This was my first Chirp cache and very cool! Special thanks to Wooly for letting RipKam and I borrow his GPS so we could see how this thing is REALLY supposed to work! Lots of fun! TN but dropped in a P4H pathtag or two for future finders.

&lt;p&gt;The cache is along Heritage Trail and you don't even have to get off it to find this one. We started at the bottom of the trail and worked our way to the top placing Geocaches along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a good hike up a nice paved trail all the way to the top. Cache is a 35mm with a log only container. This cache was .10 miles from the next caches on either side, so this is where we put it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of wild life along the way such as deer, turkey and foxes............................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please put the cache as you found it so the next cacher can find it.....and enjoy the trail........TMC&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View From The
Top..........&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a beautiful
hiking trail that starts along the Mighty Ohio River and works it
way to the Madison hill top and Clifty Fall State Park.&lt;br /&gt;
The hike is under two miles each way with most of it&lt;br /&gt;
 being a nice paved trail or gravel path.&lt;br /&gt;
The place to park is at&lt;br /&gt;
 N 38 44.107&lt;br /&gt;
W 085 23.508&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is off the main
trail just a&lt;br /&gt;
 bit, but if you follow this one, you will end up at Clifty Falls
State park..&lt;br /&gt;
 You are looking for a camo'd Tupperware container. There used to
be a cache here&lt;br /&gt;
 and we liked this spot so we will try again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several caches to collect&lt;br /&gt;
 as you work your way to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy and have fun in
Madison........TMC&lt;/p&gt;

Helped put this one out. Very nice trail to hike anytime of the year with quite a few caches on it now. I was first to find on the old cache that used to be here. Too nice a place not to have a cache.

SL and put back........Thanks.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Does A Train Get Over This?????&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is kinda on Heritage Trail along the old Madison Incline railroad tracks. We started at the bottom of the trail and worked our way to the top placing Geocaches along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a nice hike up the old tracks to the top. Cache is a small lock-n-lock container with some goodies in it container. It is right beside the tracks and should be an easy find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of wild life along the way such as deer, turkey and foxes............................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please put the cache as you found it so the next cacher can find it.....and enjoy the trail........TMC&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should be an easy find. You are looking for a 35mm with a log only. This is a little off the trail on the road around the hospital/prison and there are several ways to get to the cache. One is the Heritage Trail, the other is the Cat Steps, and the last is to follow the trail of caches. Or you can drive most of the way on the top of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a hint, you might want to stay away from the woman's prison...it's the fence with the razor wire............................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We're this close so lets do it! She always knows the answer I am wanting to hear!

Nice hide! Deermark made the find, we signed in and then headed back up the trail. We had to head  back to the event check in so that we could try to win a few prizes! Seems Daggy &quot;won&quot; a walking stick that may or may not have been commandeered by another cacher....</groundspeak:text>

'Ridge' Winery and Cache... 
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Grab
a cache and have some of Southern Indiana's best wine while you're
at it. This is one of our favorite stops along the beautiful Ohio
River while on our way to Belterra Casino. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Sit &amp; Sip on the
Beautiful Ohio River&quot;....and now grab a cache!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please only go after this one
during business hours:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday - Friday&lt;br /&gt;
 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;
 Saturday&lt;br /&gt;
 10:00 AM to 8:00 PM&lt;br /&gt;
 Sunday&lt;br /&gt;
 11:00 AM to 6:00 PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1995, The Ridge Winery has
been producing and marketing award winning wines!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ridge Winery commemorates two
hundred years of American wine history by restoring the trade to
Switzerland County, home of America's first successful commercial
winery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Geocache is an ammo can that
is easy find and please put back as you found it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owners have put a few 'FTF'
prizes in the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure and get
your 'Wine Trail' stamp while you're here!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Caching and enjoy the

Stop in and say &quot;Hello&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is an Ammo can and is hid so you do not have to interfere with anyone playing the course.  It is stocked with items from the pro shop and my usually stuff from the Alaskan Brewing Company.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cozy Acres owner has put more 'FREE' cards for the putt-putt course in the cache.  Please limit to one card per group so more get to use them.  Thanks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So have fun, enjoy the hunt and just keep putt-putt puttin’ along.....</groundspeak:long_description>

Hello
Geocachers………………………&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The
owner had such good results with ‘Just Putt-Putt-Putting Along’
(GCXVOF) he asked me to put out another Geocache on the property.
So here it is at a great spot that is a little tougher to find and
get to, but well worth the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two
rules to follow to get to this cache:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.
Please stay on the cart path at all times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.
Do not interfere with any of the golfers on the course and let them
play through instead of proceeding in front of
them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To
get to the cache, go toward the #7 tee box. After just crossing the
dam, go to the right, down the little path to the old, overgrown
cart path (not the one with the roll of fence on it. You’re still
too high). From here follow your GPS’r to the
cache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please hide the cache
like you found it and enjoy the scenery. Bring your golf clubs and
play a round. It is a very nice Par 3 course. And if you see the
owner while you are there, stop in and say ‘HI’ and thank him for
letting us do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks. ‘Rubicon’
Wooly……………………………&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;****************************************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cozy Acres Golf Course owner has
donated six free cards. 2 each for the putt-putt course, the golf
course and the driving range. Please only take one per group to
spread the wealth. So there are 6 FTF prizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Little Cabin Along A Creek.........

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Dream Cabin In The Woods...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have always wanted a little place in the woods along a creek
so we finally built this little cabin that we use as a spring
rental place. Our 'Dream' house has a nice front deck and a
fireplace in its one great room. It is natural Cedar wood outside
with 'sky-blue' trim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is parking on the shoulder of the road right by the cache
site. Just follow the creek to the homestead and a good geocacher
will spot it right away.....The new tenants won't mind you looking
for the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please only cache in daylite hours. It is in the 'Back 40&quot; if
you know what I mean....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO NIGHT CACHING!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is Indiana 'Redneck' country and you might get shot in the
dark (or if your driving an 'Office Shop' van)...Also
BYOP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put cache back the way you found it, and have a great time
caching.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freddie's Nightmare&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This
is an easy cache in the daylite, by 'Krueger' Lake near Madison,
Indiana. But at night....How brave are you? What was the weird
sound coming from the woods? Was that somebody screaming? What did
I just trip over?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
coords will not lead you to the cache!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Freddie's eyes are watching every move you make....He knows
where you want to go. Follow his eyes to find his grave and you
will find his cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is not for the faint of heart. You will need a very good
flashlight and I would mark where you parked your car so you can
find your way back out....or else it will be the next cacher
finding your decaying body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This
night cache is in a very dark area with no lights, so when it gets
dark, it is black in the woods. Bring extra batteries!! You don't
want to go dead (GPS'r or Flashlight wise) while you are out there.
The coords will take you to the start of Freddie's old trail where
he used to hide his victim's. You are looking for four eyes
watching you at the start and then follow the two eyes from tree to
tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code:&lt;br /&gt;
4 eyes - Start&lt;br /&gt;
2 eyes - Straight (should be able to find next set of eyes from
these points)&lt;br /&gt;
3 eyes - Turn right&lt;br /&gt;
Moving Eyes - Critter...Don't follow!!&lt;br /&gt;
No Eyes - Turn around (wrong way)&lt;br /&gt;
You will know when you are at the final gravesite....Lots of
Eyes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good
luck finding your way out!! (We only get you there!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good
luck not running in to Freddie and have fun caching.....'Rubicon'
Wooly and Schwerin.&lt;/p&gt;

I had planned to do it around dusk, but Better Half Shell was feeling a little under the weather so I went in the woods in the daylight. Well with the trail grown up in areas this one became a challenge in the daytime. I was so worried about not finding freddie's eyes that I practically tripped over another cache in the area and did not realize it until I was heading back to the car. It amazing that at the time, I did not think I was that far in the wilderness until after I had found the cache and then had to find my way back, thanks goodness for breadcrumbs. I loved the way this cache is set up. Great final location. This is a must do if anyone is in this area.

Thanks for the fun. </groundspeak:text>

JPG - 50 Years of Service!! 
&lt;p&gt;1941 -
1991&lt;/p&gt;

The coords will lead
you to plaque commemorating 50 years of service that Jefferson
Proving Grounds gave to the good ol' US of A. 
&lt;p&gt;I lived out here for five years and worked for
the Air Guard for 17, so this place holds a lot of memories for us.
Our kids grew up playing around here on the softball field,
basketball and tennis court, and fishing at the creeks and lakes.
The biggest problem was having to watch out for all the deer
running around after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find this cache, stand in front of the plague,
and look over the top middle notch of the stones. It is roughly 70
feet away but an easy find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy caching and have fun in
Madison......'Rubicon' Wooly&lt;/p&gt;

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Looking for a regular-size cache in a rural Indiana cemetery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Little is know about Prattsburg Cemetery.  I have not been able to find any information about churches operating in this part of the county.  What is more likely is that it started out as a family cemetery for the Pratt family since they owned the majority of the land in this area and most of the people buried there are members of that family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The terrain is raited a three because the cemetery is located on top of a small hill with steep sides.  Also, the ground here can be soft, espically after a rain, so wheelchairs and strollers may have trouble getting around.  There is a small parking area that can accomodate 2-3 cars, so you can pull you car off the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this is a low-muggle area there are those who maintain the cemeery.  Also, because of the number of veterans burried here (which include several from the Civil War and one from the Revolutionary War), the local VFW Honor Guard comes by here on Memorial Day between 11:00 am and 1:00 pm for a ceremony honoring them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a light-blue, transparent, plastic container with a water-tight seal containing a log book, pencil, and some toys for any kids that you bring with you.  During the spring, summer, and fall months, there will be a disposable camera, so feel free to take a pictures.  When the camera is full or in the later part of fall I'll develop the film and post the pictures on this page.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please rehide the cache as good or better than you found it.  Please be respectful of those buried here and please, no night caching.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is also available oin geocaching.com:  GC2TGTW</groundspeak:long_description>

The area known as Prattsburg was owned by Diah Pratt who ran a large saw mill.  He employed a number of people who settled in the area, drawing other businesses to Prattsburg such as a blacksmith, general store, cigar shop, shoe shop, and a harness shop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though the town was never platted, that didn’t stop it from appearing in maps.  The first recorded appearance of the town in maps was in 1888 when plat maps of Ripley County were published.  Even today, you can enter Prattsburg, Indiana, into Google Earth and you will be brought to this location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache is a water-tight match container painted a dark brown.  It only contains a log scroll, so be sure to bring a writing instrument with you.  While the cache is located along a country road, there is a spot near the cache where you can pull off the road.  This is also a fairly busy road, so some stealth may be needed.  Once you arrive at the site, it’ll be obvious where the cache is hidden, so no further hints will be given.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While that cache is on land that I own, please be respectful of the surrounding land owners and avoid caching at night.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is also available on geocaching.com:  GC2TGV4 </groundspeak:long_description>

Bring your own writing instrument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1872, Adams Lutheran Church relocated their congregation to this site.  However, they continued to use the old cemetery for another 20 years, removing the old building to allow for the expansion.  In the 1890’s, the new cemetery was dedicated across the road from the current building and eventually the old cemetery became inactive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may have noticed that this is a partial second row.  This is known as the children’s row.  It was common to segregate children from the adults because a child’s coffin was smaller and didn’t need as much room lengthwise as an adult.  Burying children in rows separate from adults made more efficient use of the land.  In the old cemetery, you will see a number of rows that consist of only children.  The children’s row in the new cemetery hasn’t been used for a number of reasons.  Today’s advancement in medicine has done a lot to lessen childhood morbidity.  But there was also a request from a few parents to allow them to bury the child in the adult rows with spaces reserved next to the child for the parents to be buried in when their time comes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ground here is level and firm and it is possible for strollers and wheelchairs to get around here; however, a person in a wheelchair may need assistance to get to the cache.  The cache you’re looking for is a dark green plastic jar with a black lid.  It contains a log but no pencil, so bring your own writing instrument.  There’s also room for small trade items and trackables.  Since this is an active church and cemetery it is also a high-muggle area so plenty of stealth is needed.  Please refrain from caching during service times.  On Memorial Day a VFW Honor Guard stops here to honor the veterans laid to rest here.  Should they arrive while you are caching here, please stop your caching activity until after they have finished.  As always, please do not cache here at night.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is also available on geocaching.com:  GC2TGVH</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Small cache with log and room for small trackables.  Bring your own writing instrument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Rev. Dr. David Adams came to rural Indiana from Baden-Baden Germany in the 1850’s.  A minister, physician, and teacher, he worked as a teacher during the day and preached on Sundays.  In 1852, he founded a Lutheran church in this location.  There are those who say the church was named after Rev. Adams, but this is highly unlikely since church names are often derived from the location of the church, the name of a saint, or from a biblical reference.  It’s more likely that the church’s name was derived from its location, since this spot is in southwestern Adams Township.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The original church was a log structure located on the front part of the land while interments took place back of the building.  It was common at this time for people to be buried in the church yard because it was believed that to do so guaranteed the dearly departed would be received in heaven.  This structure was active for the next 20 years until a new brick structure was built down the road in 1872.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only half of the land enclosed in the fence was part of the original church site.  The lower level to the north was overgrown and was purchased in the late 1990’s and cleaned up as part of a renovation project.  While the cemetery now includes more land, there’s no plan in reactivating this cemetery in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ground here is uneven with some of the graves having collapsed and the turf can be soft, especially after a rain, so wheelchairs and strollers may not be able to pass.  The cache you’re looking for is a dark green plastic jar with a black lid.  It contains a log but no pencil, so bring your own writing instrument.  There’s also room for small trade items and trackables.  While this is a low muggle area the grounds are well maintained so some stealth may be required.  On Memorial Day a VFW Honor Guard stops here to honor the veterans laid to rest here.  Should they arrive while you are caching here, please stop your caching activity until after they have finished.  As always, please do not cache here at night.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is also available on geocaching.com:  GC2TGVA</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">*** NOTE:  THE COORDINATES LISTED IS NOT THE LOCATION OF THE CACHE ***&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've done a fair number of caches that use the ROT-13 method of encryption.  The only problem with that is that ROT-13 is so commonplace that apps have been developed to help decrypt them, making ROT-13 almost useless.  Because of that, I decided to use a different encryption system that is no more difficult to use than the ROT-13 system known as Caesar's Square.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I became acquainted with this system in one of Dan Brown's novels.  The system - said to have been developed by Caesar - starts with a message where the number of characters (no spaces) is a square of a number (such as 81 is the square of 9, 100 is the square of 10, 121 is the square of 11, etc).  This message is then written in a column format, meaning that each letter is written under the previous letter until you reach the square root of the message number (again, 9 for 81, 10 for 100, 11 for 121, etc) at which point you start a new column of letters.  The end result of a square with the same number of lines as columns.  The message is still readable if your start in the upper left-hand corner, read down the column of letters, working your way to the right.  Now you would transcribe this square of letters onto another piece of paper – line by line- until you have a string of characters that is totally unreadable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To decode the message, you only need to count the number of letters in the message, calculate the square root, and start transcribing the message with the square root number of characters per lines as well as the number of lines.  Now the message can be read as described above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(The are many websites devoted to the explanation of the Caesar's Square system, so if you still have question Google the phrase “Caesar's Square”.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once you understand how Caesar's Square works, you fill find the coordinates of the cache below.  All you will need is the Caesar's Square method.  Decipher the hint and go to those coordinates to locate the cache.  You'll need to bring your own pen to sign the log and possibly a tool to extract the log with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This cache is also listed on geocaching.com:  GC2MD0W&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are the true coordinates:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LRINEITEEROTNTIXEDNOCHEEGMIEPN&lt;br/&gt;ATDEHIGGOETHENTNHTITIIGPNBTHNW&lt;br/&gt;ORSOIYYITONTEINWFRFMNYVNEEITOI&lt;br/&gt;ONETSSVEUN  </groundspeak:long_description>

Lots of bounce today and the forest floor is starting to get thicker and thicker with growth. I'll have to come back in the late fall or during the winter when there isn't any snow. Thanks for the hunt, I'll be back!</groundspeak:text>

This means that we get down here quite a bit.  When visiting relatives on the South side, it is hard to get an internet connection as they live out in the &quot;sticks&quot; and the only connection this have is dial up.  So I will often drive to a location very close to this cache and jump on the free Anderson Wi-fi.  I wanted to place one at my usual stopping place, but there were just too many caches too close to make it happen.  So I made it as close as I can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please hide the cache as you found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, I used the Waypoint Averaging tool in my Garmin Oregon 450 for the first time to place this cache, so please let me know if the coordinates are off.</groundspeak:long_description>

QUEST”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Indiana Spirit Quest series of
geocaches will take you to a number of &lt;i&gt;historic cemeteries&lt;/i&gt;
built by Hoosier Pioneers. In just two years, the quest has grown
to over four hundred fifty caches hidden in Indiana, as well as
Ohio and Michigan, and the hiders have grown to over twenty-five
cacher teams, most of which of which are comprised of &lt;i&gt;Dogs and
their Humans.&lt;/i&gt; Over 950 cacher teams have
logged over 10,700 finds. One of many cache machines found 102 ISQ
caches in a single day (daylight hours only).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;INDIANA SPIRIT QUEST
#442&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Clem-demonium!&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Clem
Cemetery located in Madison County, Union Township, Anderson,
Indiana. The map may trick you as the cemetery lies right next to
I-69, however there is quite a bit of backtracking to get to this
cemetery as it is tucked away in very rural Madison
County.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO NOT STOP ON I-69 TO GET
THIS CACHE!!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This is illegal and you CANNOT reach the cache from the
Interstate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Named for the family who originally owned
and donated the land and who had the first burials here, the Clem
Cemetery now overlooks busy I-69. Isaac, 1804-1872, and Mary,
1810-1898, Clem were settlers to the southern area of Union
Township. What started as the Clem family graveyard was also used
by neighboring farming families, one of whom were the Bensenbowers.
Christeain Benzenbauer, 1808-1895, was the patriarch of this
immigrant family. The Benzenbauer name is an excellent example of
how new arrivals from foreign lands would anglicize (make English)
the spelling over time. Having a name spelled as it sounds in
English made immigrants feel less like newcomers. The Hoppes and
Poor families, later settlers to the area, also utilized the Clem's
services. The Clem Cemetery is still being used and can be seen, if
not traveling too quickly, while driving in the south lane of
I-69.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The earliest confirmed burial here is
listed on July 3, 1851. She was Anna Clem, the 6 year old daughter
of Isaac and Mary. She only lived for 6 years, 9 months, 19 days.
Three years later, Isaac and Mary buried another daughter. Her name
was Anna C. Clem and she lived for 6 years, 9 months, 10
days.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was really interesting for me to take a tour of this
cemetery as it is the family plot for my wife's family. Isaac Clem
(see picture above) is my wife's great, great, great, great
grandfather according to my father-in-law.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This cemetery is the resting spot for Samuel H.
Mills. He served in the 140th Indiana Infantry, Company H during
the Civil War. Some of the skirmishes the 140th was involved in
were:&lt;br /&gt;
Engagements of the 140th Indiana Infantry&lt;br /&gt;
* Fourth Battle of Murfreesboro, Tennessee- December 7, 1864&lt;br /&gt;
* Skirmish near Fortress Rosecrans, Murfreesboro, Tennessee-
December 13, 1864&lt;br /&gt;
* Assault on Fort Anderson, near Wilmington, North Carolina-
February 18-19, 1865&lt;br /&gt;
* Battle of Town Creek Bridge, near Wilmington, North Carolina-
February 19-20, 1865&lt;br /&gt;
* Skirmish at Gulley's Station, North Carolina- March 31,
1865&lt;br /&gt;
Samuel served his country and came home to live to a ripe old age
of 73. He died on May 19, 1903 and was laid to rest
here.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;FIND LOGS ON THIS CACHE THAT INDICATE NIGHT CACHING
WILL BE DELETED WITHOUT
NOTICE!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache container is a
decon container.&lt;/b&gt; The cache is not located near a grave... If
you find a fallen US flag, please stick it back in the ground. You
must sign the cache log to claim a find. As always, please be
respectful, and cache in, trash out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I only rate it difficult because of the need for being a certified diver and having equipment.

The bridge will most likely impact the quality of your GPS signal so good luck! &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It sits in the middle of quite a few small businesses and has a business parking lot around it. Rumor has that a old chinaman lived there and refused to sell the house to the city due to a underground stream that ran underneath the home. This stream was supposed to have &quot;spiritual and healing powers&quot;. I have been entertained by the various materials that have been used to hold the house together as age decays it slowly: aluminum, vinyl, brick, tarps, vegetation, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Update 4/21/10: The Chinaman's house was completed bulldozed today. There is not even a trace of this house left. It would seem the city of Marion is planning to use this prime property spot very soon. Get this cache while you can because the location may not last [:(] &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Update 12/1/12: It would seem the sluggish economy has enabled this area to continue undeveloped. The geocache remains for future finders.</groundspeak:long_description>

Please plan to bring items to recycle or pick up mis-dropped recyclable items and place them in the appropriate drop bin. CITO!. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recycling History&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although recycling may seem like a modern concept introduced with the environmental movement of the 1970s, it's actually been around for thousands of years. Prior to the industrial age, you couldn't make goods quickly and cheaply, so virtually everyone practiced recycling in some form. However, large-scale recycling programs were very rare -- households predominantly practiced recycling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mass production of the industrial age is, in many ways, the very reason we need to worry about large-scale recycling. When products can be produced (and purchased) very cheaply, it often makes more economic sense to simply throw away old items and purchase brand new ones. However, this culture of &quot;disposable&quot; goods created a number of environmental problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the 1930s and 40s, conservation and recycling became important in American society and in many other parts of the world. Economic depressions made recycling a necessity for many people to survive, as they couldn't afford new goods. In the 1940s, goods such as nylon, rubber and many metals were rationed and recycled to help support the war effort. However, the economic boom of the postwar years caused conservationism to fade from the American consciousness. It wasn't until the environmental movement of the 1960s and 70s, heralded by the first Earth Day in 1970, that recycling once again became a mainstream idea. Though recycling suffered some lean years -- due to public acceptance and the market for recycled goods not growing -- it has generally increased from year to year. The success of recycling traces to wide public acceptance, the improved economics of recycling and laws requiring recycling collections or enforcing recycled content in certain manufacturing processes. &lt;br/&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Found with MutherAndSun, super_cacher, and Texican Space Cowboy during the great Team Jeep celebration trip to the Fort Wayne area. We all had something to celebrate this weekend and we had an awesome time together exploring the area. Thanks to NEI-GEO area for all the great caches.</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A moment of serenity in an otherwise hectic city.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since I now work on this side of town, I have been looking things over looking for new places to hide some caches.  While doing so I stumbled across this location and knew I had to put a cache here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the GPS was averaging the waypoint, I took a moment to look and listen to my surroundings.  To my surprise, the road noise was nearly gone.  In fact, most noise of the city just seemed to vanish while I was here.  And I was reminded of a cache I found out in Los Angeles where I was in a small valley near an interstate, but because of the valley, I could not here it.  I was intrigued by the fact that if you had just dropped me in that spot and told me I was in Los Angeles, I would have called you a liar!  That is until I left the park and was greeted by about 1 million people on their commute home!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This spot is reminiscent of that experience because things just seemed to slow down and the city seemed to vanish.  I got to hear the animals rustling in the nearby wetlands.  I got to hear the soft breeze through the pines.  And I got to smell the rich smell of the Earth.  A nice break from the hustle and bustle of real life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope that you get the chance to feel all of that as well while you are here!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cache should be an easy find once you get to ground zero.</groundspeak:long_description>

Well, if you Geocache, I'm willing to bet you get that feeling quite a bit!  Well, with this cache you should DEFINITELY get that feeling!  Why?  Well, because I can see this cache from my desk at work!  Which means that if you search for this cache during work hours, there is a pretty good chance that I will be watching you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So while looking for this cache, take a moment and look at the building to the south.  Somewhere on the second floor of that builing is my office and where I will be watching you!!!! Of course it will only be fun if you hunt this cache during normal business hours on Monday through Friday. But I completely understand if you cannot make it during those times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DO NOT STOP ON THE HIGHWAY FOR THIS CACHE!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You cannot access the cache from the highway and this stretch of the highway has a TON of traffic and is dangerous! Instead, please use common sense to find the SAFE route to the cache.</groundspeak:long_description>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Happy 12-12-12 Day!!  And despite popular belief, today is NOT the end of the world.  According to the Mayans, the end o the world will be on December 21, 2012 because that is when their calendar &quot;ends.&quot;  Truth be told, it is jus the end o a cycle of their calendar which is what we do every year on December 31!  But anyway, today is not that day.

Today, however is a special day as it will be a hundred years before we are able to see a date that repeats 5 times (12/12/12 at 12:12).  So what better way to celebrate this unique grouping of numbers than to get out and Geocache.  Plus you get a cool souvenir for finding a cache today!  So that is just what I did over my lunch break.  I decided to attend the 12:12pm flash mob event today rather than the 12:12am flash mob event because I have a career and three kids and sleep is a little more valuable to me during the work week than a smiley!  So I skipped it last night, but grabbed it today.

Well, on my way to the event, I noticed that I left a little early and had some time to kill.  So since this cache was so close to the event and since I have had my eye on it for a while now, I decided to swing in and make a quick grab.  I did remove the empty insulin vial (and disposed of it properly) that was in the cache as I felt that this was not proper swag!!  ;-)

Found the cache quickly and in perfect working order.  Took the empty insulin vial, left nothing.  Signed log.  Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is an unofficial Traveling Cache. Do NOT visit the above
coordinates. You will not find a geocache there.
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=7fe356e4-4697-49a4-8415-322ec9b850ca&quot;&gt;
Secret Squirrels&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=25fb16d8-e2d5-410f-b6ac-e213b6de9cde&quot;&gt;
Enos Shenk&lt;/a&gt; was the first traveling cache in Fort Wayne. It was
washed away with the flood waters of '05. Since I was the last one
to have possession of the cache, and Enos has disappeared, I felt
that I should replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Son of Secret Squirrels is located in the city of Fort Wayne, no
more then 6 feet from another, existing geocache. The cache
container is a decon container. I would like to have made it more
like the original Secret Squirrels container, but I do not have an
available container that big nor do I have the camo strips that
will just fall off anyway!! And a decon container is much better
against the elements than the original tupperware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way this cache is intended to work is if you find it, you
take the entire container and peruse its contents at your leisure.
However, by taking the container, you are obligated to find it a
new home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, Son of Secret Squirrels cannot be placed more
then 5 feet away from any pre-existing geocache. Please do not bury
it, put it way up in a tree, or anything unfair. Please also try
not to place it in obvious areas where it might be stolen. Also,
this seems obvious but do not post what geocache Secret Squirrels
is hidden near. Please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jerico616@yahoo.com?subject=Son%20Of%20Secret%20Squirrels%20Location&quot;&gt;
email me&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jerico616@yahoo.com?subject=Son%20Of%20Secret%20Squirrels%20Location&quot;&gt;
jerico616@yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt; when you get the chance to hide this
somewhere, and let me know its new location in case of any
problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;Use the pictures attached to this cache, in the order they are numbered, to solve for the coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cache has had to be moved slightly. Once you get the coordinates, add the following correction factor: N -00 00.011 W -00 00.005.&lt;/p&gt;     </groundspeak:long_description>

So fast that after going Geocaching with me for all these years, they now want to place their own caches!  Well, who am I to say, &quot;No,&quot; to that???&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So Princess Elwood and I had to run a quick errand this evening.  I had scouted out this spot some time ago, but haven't gotten around to place a cache here.  Well tonight we did.  And Princess picked out where and how she wanted to hide this one!  Made me a proud Geocaching dad!</groundspeak:long_description>

High muggle activity on the porch and don't forget about the
muggles on the other side of the windows. When blinds are pulled
they can see out but you can't see in so they will be watching too.
So please use extreme stealth.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;The original &quot;Off Your Rocker&quot; cache was placed by overover in
Titusville, Fl. on 8/8/2003. This cache was placed in an effort to
continue the series in the great Hoosier State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most difficult part in finding this cache is the amount of
stealth that will be necessary during the busy times of the
day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container is a small magnetic key holder. It only contains
the log, so bring a writing stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please honor the managements request that you search for the
cache during store's normal hours of operation. The store is open
Sunday through Thursday 6am-10pm and Friday &amp; Saturday
6am-11pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, bring your own pencil as I didn't have one small enough
to fit in the cache.&lt;/p&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

QUEST”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Indiana Spirit Quest series of
geocaches will take you to a number of &lt;i&gt;historic cemeteries&lt;/i&gt;
built by Hoosier Pioneers. In just two years, the quest has grown
to over four hundred fifty caches hidden in Indiana, as well as
Ohio and Michigan, and the hiders have grown to over twenty-five
cacher teams, most of which of which are comprised of &lt;i&gt;Dogs and
their Humans.&lt;/i&gt; Over 950 cacher teams have
logged over 10,700 finds. One of many cache machines found 102 ISQ
caches in a single day (daylight hours only).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;INDIANA SPIRIT QUEST
#570&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Park Here&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Parker
Cemetery located in Allen County, Saint Joseph Township, Fort
Wayne, Indiana.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Named for the family who originally owned
and donated the land and who had the first burials here, the Parker
Cemetery now overlooks the busy intersection of Saint Joe Road and
Saint Joe Center Road. Peter and Elizabeth Parker donated this land
back in 1850. The land became an official cemetery in 1866 and the
it is still in use today.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;As you look for this cache, please take a
moment to look at all the veterans who rest here. I found veterans
from the following wars:&lt;br /&gt;
World War I&lt;br /&gt;
World War II&lt;br /&gt;
Korea&lt;br /&gt;
Spanish American War&lt;br /&gt;
Civil War&lt;br /&gt;
There could even be others that I missed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;FIND LOGS ON THIS CACHE THAT INDICATE NIGHT CACHING
WILL BE DELETED WITHOUT
NOTICE!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache container is a
waterproof matchstick container.&lt;/b&gt; The cache is not located near
a grave... If you find a fallen US flag, please stick it back in
the ground. You must sign the cache log to claim a find. As always,
please be respectful, and cache in, trash out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

QUEST CACHE**&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;“INDIANA SPIRIT
QUEST”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Indiana Spirit Quest series of
geocaches will take you to a number of &lt;i&gt;historic cemeteries&lt;/i&gt;
built by Hoosier Pioneers. In just two years, the quest has grown
to over four hundred fifty caches hidden in Indiana, as well as
Ohio and Michigan, and the hiders have grown to over twenty-five
cacher teams, most of which of which are comprised of &lt;i&gt;Dogs and
their Humans.&lt;/i&gt; Over 950 cacher teams have
logged over 10,700 finds. One of many cache machines found 102 ISQ
caches in a single day (daylight hours only).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;INDIANA SPIRIT QUEST
#411&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;BINGO!&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to St. Paul
Lutheran Cemetery (also known as Coldwater Lutheran Cemetery and
Ludwig Cemetery) located in Allen County, Washington Township, Fort
Wayne, Indiana. Many local cachers may recognize this location as
the former home to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=3db3c668-f8d7-49c4-ae80-3bfc6bcacea0&quot;&gt;
BINGO!&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=55ce5091-0431-408c-ad3a-07997285d1f2&quot;&gt;
Lord Padishar&lt;/a&gt; , which is where the name for this ISQ comes
from. BINGO! lived a good life with many hits from local cachers
and cachers traveling down Interstate 69. It was a sad day when it
came up missing. With permission from Lord Padishar, I decided to
keep the location and the spirit of BINGO! alive in the form of an
Indiana Spirit Quest cache.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The earliest confirmed burial here occurred
in 1844. Not much is known about this little cemetery other than it
was part of the St. Paul Lutheran Church, which is no longer in
existence.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;At some point in 1920, the school and the
surrounding land was sold to the state to make way for the
Interstate 69 and highway 27 interchange. That same interchange is
why there is a lot of noise here. Luckily the historical society
stepped in to preserve this cemetery in its very unlikely
place.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's been a mystery as to why BINGO!
disappeared. However, when I scouted this cemetery, I quickly
learned why. There have been some major clean up and restoration
projects occurring here. The trees and the bushes surrounding the
cemetery used to be overgrown and out of control. Now everything is
trimmed back and looking good. Well, this process also exposed the
location of the BINGO! cache. My guess is that the grounds crew
threw it away figuring it was just a piece of trash.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;FIND LOGS ON THIS CACHE THAT INDICATE NIGHT CACHING
WILL BE DELETED WITHOUT
NOTICE!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache container WAS an
Altoids Chewing Gum container, but is now a camo'd soda bottle
preform. Please bring your own pencil as I couldn't fit one in the
container.&lt;/b&gt; The cache is not located near a grave... If you find
a fallen US flag, please stick it back in the ground. You must sign
the cache log to claim a find. As always, please be respectful, and
cache in, trash out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

Found with MutherAndSun, super_cacher, and Texican Space Cowboy during the great Team Jeep celebration trip to the Fort Wayne area. Today we celebrate TSC's complete recovery, MutherAndSun's 1 yr caching anniversary, my B-day, some caching milestones, and most importantly friendship. Thanks to NEI-GEO area for all the great caches.

name. I couldn't think of anything so I moved on to thinking up the
dummy coordinates for this cache. That's when it hit me. Puzzle
caches need dummy coordinates, so let's just call this &quot;Dummy
Cache&quot;. And the name stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to do four things to claim a find on this

1. Solve the puzzle.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Find the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Sign the logbook.&lt;br /&gt;
4. (Not required, but it would be cool if you did!)Post part or all of your online log using the same code below.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
 Haunted Indiana is a series of caches meant to bring cachers to
local haunted locations across the state. Started in Fort Wayne, I
hope this series will one day span a great deal of the state, much
like the Indiana Spirit Quest caches. If you're interested in
hiding a cache for this series, just send me an e-mail through
gc.com and I'll give you a number for your cache.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Welcome to Chapman Road north of Fort Wayne. The story for this
haunted Indiana location says that if you stop at the very bottom
of the valley in the road and place your car in park a mysterious
force will pull your vehicle back up the hill. There's not much
traffic on this road, so if you wanted to you could probably try
this, just watch for cars coming over the hill on both sides. I
wasn't able to give this a try since gravity tends to tip you over
when you stop with a 2-wheeled vehicle. The cache is a medium sized
Lock-and-Lock container located in the ROW right across the street
from the ACRES Land Trust headquarters.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A Tribute Cache to The Herd. &lt;br/&gt;This cache is a Magnetic Theme, due to the Magneticity that The Herd possesses. The cache is a three stage multi cache utilizing, magnets or the theory of how a Magnet works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seems Brad has moved on to bigger and better things. In turn, The Herd has to relocate. Amber,( Momma Herd ), especially, has grown on most of us that know her, she is most outgoing of the bunch, (Bigger Mouth I would Guess, my opinion only ), JUST KIDDING...  She will be missed by me,(NOT), Well, maybe a little,(probably not), O.K., She will be missed lot's by me too , as well as the rest of The Herd, who will be missed lot's by all of us as well. Boy can I write a book on this bunch. Sure going to miss all the abuse. What do you think Amber, Opposites Attract should be a good name for this one, especially after the comment from the waitress in Kendallville.&lt;br/&gt;Again, this is a Magnet themed geocache. It uses magnets or the theory of how a magnet works. On the second stage, you will have to think out of the box a bit. Think about how a magnet works in order to find the coordinates to the next stage. You won't find them at the exact given coordinates, but you will figure it out if you think about how a magnet works. This will be very easy for some, and very hard for others... On the final stage, there is no container, only a unique log. Please bring your own Pen or Marker to sign the log and return it exactly as you found it. It only goes one way. It's placement has been marked so you know how to put it back. As with any cache, please keep an eye on the area for Muggles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: FS141PQ - Final locatuion at guard rail&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Final location at guard rail, magnetic log with permanent marker&lt;br/&gt;HIDDEN: SS141PQ - Parking lot with coordinates for final stage&lt;br/&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br/&gt;Second stage, coordinates for final stage.</groundspeak:long_description>

We call it 9/80, because you work 80 hours in 9 days, instead of 10, so you get the tenth day off. Today was a 9/80 day for me. Since Lady Elwood had to work and the kids were all at the babysitter, I decided that a long overdue trip up to Auburn to go Geocaching was in order. I look to see who else was available to join me and Busymom23 was more than happy to come along.

Wet got soaked in the rain, filthy in the mud and dried out in the sun. All in all, it was a GREAT day for Geocaching!

I started this cache a long time ago, but couldn't complete it as there was a family reunion going on at stage 2. Today there was nobody around and i was able to get all of the stages! Very creative and unique!

I got up early and grabbed some in my area and planned on spending the evening grabbing a bunch around the Anderson area. But lady Elwood wouldn't let me do that. So I onl ended up with 4 finds today. Oh well.

As I approached the cache, I got so see the lazy cache owner doing nothing but sitting on his butt. Imagine that.

;-)

But I did stay and chat with him for a while and got to meet his bird. Yes, Mark likes birds. He's really making me wonder: he drives a Barbie Jeep and he likes birds.... I'll let you draw your own conclusions!

While you are here have a look around at the unique stones and take in the history of the Hess Family as well as many others recently interred here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though I usually describe my cache containers this one will be left a surprise. But you are looking for a small well camoed container. Seasoned cachers will have little difficulty finding this one but our newer members should find it quite challenging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with each of my cemetery placements this cache is not near a headstone or memorial and is not in a bush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck! Please replace the cache exactly as you found it and do not post pictures of the find. Note also that this is a cemetery cache. Caches logged at night will be deleted with prejudice.   </groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache recognizes the sacrifice of a Local Hero and an eight&lt;br/&gt;year veteran of the Goshen Police Department. Take some time to&lt;br/&gt;experience the quiet beauty of this small cemetery tucked away in&lt;br/&gt;rural West Goshen. While here be sure to read the poem etched into&lt;br/&gt;the officers memorial. It is quite moving. As with most cemetery's,&lt;br/&gt;visitors are only allowed from dawn to dusk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a four stage multi-cache. The first stage is a memorial to&lt;br/&gt;local Heroes. The second stage leads you to a quiet cemetery where&lt;br/&gt;our fallen hero rests. The third stage directs you to the memorial&lt;br/&gt;while the fourth is the cache container. You will need to visit&lt;br/&gt;them in listed order as each provides clues to the coordinates for&lt;br/&gt;the next stage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be wary of muggles in the cemetery as it is a popular dog walking&lt;br/&gt;area. A golf-course also borders the property to the west. Cemetery&lt;br/&gt;staff are aware of this cache but will not assist you in finding&lt;br/&gt;it. The walk is not difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that this has been converted to a micro-cache. It is easier to&lt;br/&gt;find and there should be no confusion with private property. As&lt;br/&gt;with each of my cemetery placements this cache is not placed near a&lt;br/&gt;headstone or memorial and is not in a bush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage 1: Starting Coordinates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 41.35.027 W 085.49.992&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On arrival at stage 1 you will find the memorial to local Police&lt;br/&gt;Officers who have given their lives in the line of duty. The&lt;br/&gt;address number of the facility where the memorial is located&lt;br/&gt;provides the west coordinates for stage 2 of the cache.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage 2: The Cemetery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 41.34.758 W 085.51.xxx&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following a short drive from stage 1 you should be looking at a&lt;br/&gt;sign which briefly documents the history of the cemetery. There are&lt;br/&gt;three dates on this sign. To find the west coordinates for stage 3&lt;br/&gt;subtract the first date from the third.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage 3: The Memorial&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 41.34.705 W 085.51.xxx&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You should now be standing at the final resting place of our Fallen&lt;br/&gt;Hero. Please take a moment to offer a prayer or spoken word of&lt;br/&gt;thanks. Kindly remember to respect the memorial and do not touch or&lt;br/&gt;remove anything from it. To find the coordinates for stage 4 and&lt;br/&gt;the cache simply add our heroes age in years to the number of years&lt;br/&gt;he served our community. Subtract this number from his badge number&lt;br/&gt;to get your new West Coordinates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stage 4: The Cache&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N 41.34.571 W 085.51.xxx&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please park at the Maintenance building before proceeding to stage&lt;br/&gt;4. Do not drive up the hill as there is no turnaround and you could&lt;br/&gt;easily damage headstones trying to back out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a dark green matchstick container which holds&lt;br/&gt;the logbook and a double-sharpened pencil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you know of another local &quot;Fallen Hero&quot; who deserves recognition&lt;br/&gt;just send me an email. I will do my best to put together a cache in&lt;br/&gt;their honor.&lt;br/&gt; </groundspeak:long_description>

Fall colours are nice but Spring and Summer&lt;br/&gt;finds are most rewarding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some thirty years ago, as a kid, I walked the Rock Run Creek&lt;br/&gt;railroad tracks to school. As I grew up, I spent many hours&lt;br/&gt;playing, fishing, trapping, and camping on and around the bridges&lt;br/&gt;and banks of this small creek which winds its way through NorthEast&lt;br/&gt;Goshen. Like many of the friends of my youth, the tracks are now&lt;br/&gt;gone, replaced with these trails.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As you walk the trails let them take you back with me to those days&lt;br/&gt;of backyard football games, bicycle rides, canepoles and wiggly&lt;br/&gt;worms, my memories of this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Good luck on your search but don't be surprised if, from behind you&lt;br/&gt;hear, the joyous laughter of a child, only to turn and find&lt;br/&gt;no-one...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(for Dean)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are looking for a dark green 7.62mm Ammo Can.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As usual please feel free to exchange items but do be kind to the&lt;br/&gt;next cacher and trade even, or trade up! Please do not leave&lt;br/&gt;money.   </groundspeak:long_description>

It appeals to young and old alike and includes a nice balance of active playground for the youth and serene river views for adults. The park expanded in 2003 by a donation of 16.4 acres of adjoining land by Spring Valley Corporation to it’s current 24.4 acres. It is also used for an outdoor volleyball league as well as the Boys and Girls Club basketball league in the summer. It is within walking distance of many of Middlebury's featured attractions including the new &quot;Middlebury Museum&quot;. You could easily spend an entire day enjoying the scenic beauty in and around the town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WARNING: The 2/4 difficulty rating of this cache is warranted because the cache is on the East bank of the river and is only accessable by crossing a 20' section of the river where a fallen tree lies. If you have any reservations about crossing the 3' deep river on a log which is only about 12&quot; wide, partially submerged, and often covered in slippery moss then please just use the coordinates to enjoy the park and trails. Do not attempt the find if you are concerned in any way about the crossing. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those of you so enclined; You are looking for a small camo taped container with a waterproof matchstick holder inside (double-bagged to keep the log dry).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please place the cache exactly as you found it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have MUCH fun!   </groundspeak:long_description>

I didn't have this in the gps, but the others did and they led me to it. We opened the cache only to find a spider the size of a silver dollar sitting in the middle of a web it had made in the box. This caused &quot;gie&quot; of johngie to leave pretty quickly lol We shooed the spider out and signed the log TSMT (Tri State Marker Tour) to save log space. Thanks for the cool cache, that's a new container for me!</groundspeak:text>

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So last night I get an email asking if I would like to participate in a World Famous PJ's RoadTrip™. A quick check of the weather shows rain, rain, and a little more rain...sure why not! 
Some quick facts:
Distance-407 Miles round trip
Time: 13 hours
States: 3
Caches: 4 earthcaches in two states, a virtual, benchmark, multi and 30 traditionals!

As we pulled into the parking area and get out of the vehicle I did a quick scan of the area for a large cache container but none was to be found.  We wandered around a little more thinking that if we can't find a LARGE container with a 1/1.5 rating that we need to place our GPSr's in the next cache we can find and then go get a different hobby.  We didn't see it and headed out to go grab the 151 cache by the same owner.  As we pulled up there was the cache and all the swag being carried to the house!! It appears that the box was broken and the owner had JUST got back from picking it up.  Thank you Bucket Brigade for allowing us to log this as a find...I am sure I would have found it, if it were actually there!!!

Took a TB and left a different TB along with a JetMonkey sig nickel.

Remember to keep clear of the water till the river reopens.  Remember to BYOP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This spot was where Enbridge took their last stand to stop the oil spill before reaching the Marrow Lake Dam.  This is a great place to fish for small mouth bass once the river reopens.  There use to be a DNR boat launch here, but was not put back in when the bridge was replaced.  Enjoyed a lot of warm summer days fishing here.  Hope you enjoy the spot too!&lt;br/&gt;Should be an easy cache to find.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Best place to park is at the ball field at the school or across the street there is a small spot for a few vehicles at the north end of the bridge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Congrats to Moldslug on the G.C.

Moderate-length walk down a railroad trail in rural Michigan between Vermontville and the Maple Valley High School. The cache is located at the halfway point of the trail -- find it on the west side of the refurbished &quot;Trestle Bridge&quot;, an old railway bridge spanning the Thornapple River.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The new footbridge was built by students in the building trades program at the nearby high school, making safe a river crossing that had for many years been a potentially dangerous iron remnant of the lone-gone railroad. By decking over the existing iron bridge supports and adding a railing, the river is now able to be safely crossed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The bridge and trail are part of the Eaton County Parks system, so be sure to have a leash for any pets, and be sure to respect the plants and wildlife.</groundspeak:long_description>

I always figured myself for a tough guy who could handle most anything. I didn't cry. And then my first child was born. I cried more than the baby.  I had no idea the joy that my children would bring me.  

Then the birth of my first grandchild came and it happened all over again.  I have three kids, 2 girls and 1 boy, and two grandsons.  I love them all very much.</groundspeak:text>

Was out for the the day with Homebru in the Grand Rapids area.   Gee I do not know which things to list or where to start.  My children are in their thirties now so I have a lot to proud moments to pick from.  My son is a Eagle Scout and my daughter is a National Parks Ranger.  As these two items are not the only reasons I am so proud of them it is a couple of the ones that are close to the top of the list.  Now don't even get me started on my grand children as I am sure there is a limet on how long a posting can be.   Found it at 8:05pm for my 24th find of the day.  Thanks for the cache!.

After dropping the woman off at the mall I had a few hours to kill so what ever could I possible find to do. You got it. I was finding the caches in the area.  After reading about this one I was not so sure I was going to be able to get it.  I figured I had plenty of time I might just as well at least go and see what I was up against.  Got to the DZ and scoped it out.  Not wanting to give anything away I am just going to say, Yup I got it.  Logged it at 12:05pm.  Interesting cache hide.  TNLN.

Cache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache you are looking for is not at the posted coordinates.
Instead the posted coordinates will take you to a trail marker.
This will be your starting point.

 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When you arrive at the trail head you will notice six or seven
evergreen trees.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Walk amongst these trees.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You just might hear a bird singing a song.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That song will tell you where the Geocache is hidden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you know where to find the cache please walk back to the trail
head and use the trail.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This Geocache makes use of a device known as a Garmin Chirp. In
order to &quot;hear&quot; the Garmin Chirp you will need a compatible Garmin
device with the latest firmware update.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Garmin devices that currently communicate with Chirp are the
Oregon, Dakota and GPSMAP models. The latest firmware for these
devices can be acquired using Garmin's Webupdate tool.
Compatibility can be checked here:&lt;a href=&quot;https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=74811&amp;amp;ra=true#productTab&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Good Luck and Have Fun!&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

We took a canoe to hide this one and that worked well. Getting there is half the fun! The FTF just gets 25cents. Not accessible by land!

There is a few other caches in the area if you haven't done them yet you should take the time to do them. The trail here is just over a mile long. Happy hunting :)</groundspeak:long_description>

Please park off the road, there is a pull off available directly behind the village limit sign. Watch your little ones, the road can be quite busy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My boys insisted that this be called &quot;Water Boy&quot; as it is located near a village water supply pump. This cache turned out to be a lot smaller than I had anticipated, but will fit very small items like the dollar and half dollar coins I started it out with. Hope you enjoy our cache! </groundspeak:long_description>

Now Snow Bible is a mile down the road. But as an old timer, this will always be Snow Bible cemetery when the name is actually Idlewild Cemetery.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache should be pretty easy to find. It is a recycled container. I made this from two pieces of PVC fittings. DO NOT PRESS TOGETHER TOO TIGHTLY or the next person will not get it open. You can feel the air pressure build as you put it together. It is quite a good container for this use.</groundspeak:long_description>

When heading north, I usually take Spruce to M-82 and turn right or left. Today I went north and there was a place to hide a cache. I was ON THE FENCE about where to hide it. But it was like I was MAGNETICALLY drawn to the Clouse Star. However, my container would not stick around the star so I had to find a different spot close by. I tried a couple spots but it was a little too obvious but then I tried one spot and it tucked in just RIGHT and is out of sight. I STUCK to that spot and hope you will put it back there. &lt;br/&gt;I don't like to MICRO-manage my hides but sometimes a little extra effort will put it where it needs to be.  I'm sure when this cache POSTs, you will run right out and get it.</groundspeak:long_description>

Pond Letterbox&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A scenic
stroll along the flooded banks of the Muskegon
River.&lt;/b&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;b&gt;About the
Location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome to a picturesque view of Newaygo State Park's Hardy Dam
Pond.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The coordinates of this cache will bring to the start of your
journey to this letterbox treasure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Newaygo State Park is a 99-site rustic campground, which sits atop
20-foot embankments overlooking the Hardy Dam Pond, a six-mile
flooding of the Muskegon River. The park caters primarily to
campers, anglers and recreational boaters. There are several picnic
sites overlooking the reservoir for day users. The campground is
nestled in oak and poplar forests and is noted for its large,
private sites and scenic beauty. There is a 20-30 foot forested
buffer between sites, and each site is provided with a picnic table
and a fire ring.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This park has welcomed geoacachers to it again with another event
planned for June, 2010. There are some terrific caches in this
park; please take some time to enjoy them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;



&lt;b&gt;Clues to the
Cache:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the spirit of letterboxing we don't give you the coordinates to
the cache but instead a series of clues or directions to find it.
You don't need to have a personal stamp &amp; personal log book to
seek this cache, but to stay with the intent of letterboxing a
personal stamp would be nice. You can get a stamp of your own at
most hobby stores, they aren't very expensive. &lt;b&gt;Please don't take
the stamp or ink pad from the cache; they are to stay in the
cache.&lt;/b&gt; To learn more about Letterboxing, visit
letterboxing.org.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The coordinates on this cache page will lead you to an erosion sign
just north-west of campsite #85.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Follow the foot path that heads west along the southern shore of
Hardy Pond. You will walk about 225 paces before reaching a dip in
the trail. Here you will see about a three foot drop in the trail's
elevation and immediately to the north, at a slightly lower
elevation, you will see signs of two springs that then trickle down
into the pond.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Continue west about another 100 paces. Here you will encounter a
large diameter oak tree, on the very south or left edge of the
trail. There are old tree steps nailed into the north-east side of
the tree. Rest assured, you are on the right track.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Continue west on the trail another 100 paces. Here you will find a
couple small pine trees a few feet below the north edge of the
cliff. The top of the first small pine is only eye-level. It would
be a nice spot to stop a take a photo of a caching buddy as you
also have a nice view of the pond.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Continue on another 100 paces. At the large lone 14&quot; pine, near the
cliff's edge, you need to look to the south or left of the trail.
Just twenty paces away you will find a down tree where caching
sense will lead you to the hide location. You will find this
Letterbox cache in a hollow log.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once the cache is found should relax on the fallen tree trunk. Here
you can stamp your personal logbook with the stamp in the cache
(please place back in cache when done) and stamp our logbook with
your stamp. If you do not have a stamp, feel free to draw something
for us to enjoy. If you can't draw, please sign your name.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please replace stamp and logbook into each of their respective
ziploc bags to prevent the ink on the stamp from ruining the
logbook. Some wipes are provided in case it gets messy. Please
carefully return the cache as you found it for others to enjoy in
the future.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks to the folks at Rubberstamps.net for their quality
stamps.


&lt;br /&gt;




&lt;b&gt;What's the
Challenge?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The true challenge is staying on task as the cachers will be
distracted by the scenic views and wildlife. Take the time to savor
your surroundings on your return hike back to the campground.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please leave this site a little more pristine for the next cacher
by practicing C.I.T.O. as you return to your vehicle.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;




&lt;b&gt;First To
Find:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
FTF congratulations to ... &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=&quot;&gt;Perhaps You&lt;/a&gt;!

Reason for both ratings is due to winter,this one will be rough to do to since they do not plow road, Not to mention it's down a hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is located in Lake City ( Best 4th in the North) at Goose Lake campground (fourths its name) This is a place we come to camp a few times a year,great camp ground and fishing/swimming. This is open all year BUT winter it is not maintained so 4X4 will be needed in winter months. Slealth will be needed due to campers. The walk down the hill to cache will not kill you but the walk back up might,I know I was winded when done,lol. You will have to come into Goose Lk campground follow the road around and go around back lake/camp (Long Lake Campground) and head back to Goose Lk. Camp, ( reason for that is cause after awhile it turns into a one way drive so you have to head back around then back up to cache.)&lt;br/&gt;F.T.F goes to  baseballtraveler......Congrats.</groundspeak:long_description>

Having enjoyed so many in the area myself I thought it was only fair to give back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You'll find the cache located just off the edge of a seasonal road that runs between Hobbs Hwy N. and Rennie Lake Rd.  Those traveling down Hobbs Hwy N. planning to head East on Supply road can cut just about 3 miles off of their trip if they take this shortcut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cache may be un-accessible in the winter time unless you plan to ski or snow shoe in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a PathTag prize for the First To Find.  The rest has been stocked nicely with some Betty Boop pens, some toys, a flash light compass, some pins and a few travel bugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A nice sized log book so please leave your story.

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We are in the TC area this week and I saw this one pop up and asked the wife if she was interested in a FTF attempt,  &quot;Sure&quot;.  Got the cache loaded and off we went.  Arrived at the cache location to find no one around, we did a search of the area, found a likely spot, open the container, sure enough the log book was blank. We both joined in a little FTF dance and then signed the log.  Found it at 3:00pm for our 1st find of the day.  Thanks for the cache!. And also the FTF Pathtag.
