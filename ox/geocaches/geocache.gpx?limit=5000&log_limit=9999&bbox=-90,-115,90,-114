            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">7,735-foot Sam’s Rock [previously unnamed] is an attention-getting mass of bare granite visible from Interstate 80 between Wells and Wendover, Nevada. If you’re eastbound at Pequop Pass (mile post 373), Sam’s Rock is the pinnacle you see on the far skyline as you head down from the summit. As you continue on past Oasis to the Shafter exit (m.p. 387), the view of the Rock from the south reveals two summits, the rounded one on the west being the higher by perhaps 20 feet. Driving westbound from Wendover, your view of the Rock is blocked by the southern masses of the Toano Range until you come to the Shafter exit.

To get to Sam’s Rock, take the Shafter exit and turn onto the frontage road that parallels the freeway on the north side. Immediately after the first cattle guard, turn left and follow the desert road north. High clearance is a good idea, but many passenger cars can make it if driven very carefully. At 3.1 miles, turn left onto the next road you come to; and in another 3/10 of a mile, bear to the right. Just over a mile farther, take the little-used but good road to the right and park at the top of the rise.

From where you park, you’ll see a wooded draw that goes up diagonally between the two summits. The draw is choked with trees and brush, so the easiest way is to make you way across the draw to the wall of the Rock itself, where you’ll find the going steep but relatively easy. Near the top you’ll suddenly come to the Crack, where the Rock is literally split in two. Except for a 6-foot ledge, it’s an easy scramble up the crack and suddenly you’re looking down the north face of the rock.

As you scout the west wall of the Crack, you’ll see a couple of possible climbing routes; but the easiest route begins right at the north end of the Crack. Simply step across some tree branches to an overhung ledge and go up on your hands and knees. Soon you come out on top of the Crack and find that you’re separated from the summit block by a broken-up ridge that resembles the back of a Stegosaurus. It looks a bit chancy, but is fairly easy to work across. The summit block itself presents a 30-foot broken wall with one obvious route to begin with. Two-thirds of the way up, you can scout for a way over the top. At the far right (north) is a fairly easy route both up and down, though with exposure to the north wall.

The summit itself is a wonderful place to experience; and the view is amazingly scenic—Pilot Peak (10,716 ft.) to the east, Bonneville Salt Flats to the southeast, and many long views and high ranges. At the high point (7,735 ft.) there’s a rock cairn. The cache is easy to find. It’s a 4-inch ABS pipe with a screw-on cap. After you’ve logged in, screw on the cap just snug; if you crank it down too tight, it will be hard for the next finder to open. Replace the cache with the screw-top downhill to help ensure that water from rain or snow doesn’t seep in.

Be warned that reaching the cache at the summit of Sam’s Rock is not a scramble and a quick grab. It’s about 700 vertical feet from where you park to the summit. The approximately 100 vertical feet from the Crack to the summit involves solid Class 4 rock climbing. In most places there are good holds on coarse granite, but it’s not for the faint-of-heart or anyone afraid of heights, and good physical condition is a must. Wear a helmet and boots suitable for climbing. Take your time and be safe! Don’t tackle it if it really is beyond your abilities.

Good luck!  </groundspeak:long_description>

Going &quot;in the hole&quot; is the railroader slang term for when a lower priority train has to wait in a siding for a higher priority train to pass. On May 28th 2011 we were stuck in Pequop siding waiting for another train to go by. I had time to go for a little walk and drop a geocache. FYI: If you are not a railroader: There is no need to get close to the railroad tracks to find this cache and if trains or maintainance workers are close please stay away from the tracks and trains. 

the terrain rating is due largely to the remoteness of this cache. please plan your trip accordingly.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">done numerous caching trips together, as have many others in the Magic Valley. 

Yesterday when I went to see her in the hospital the first words out of her mouth were to ask how I was doing; not a word of complaint, no bemoaning her condition or what she was going through. Corky is a tower of strength for others to emulate when difficulities befall them.

The location of this cache is a spot I picked out last year to place a cache if ever I found a good enough reason to place one here. That reason has arrived sooner than I would have wished. This cache is a tribute to quietbreezes and the challenges she faces. And getting this cache will be a challenge to those who don’t like heights or rock climbing; and, yes, I fit in that group.

This is a strictly MOJO cache. It is a small container that will hold a number of MOJOs. It will be easy to find once you get to the top. Just be very careful climbing up and back down, it would be a bad landing if you should slip.

There are two ways you can log this cache. First, obviously, is to find the cache, sign the log and leave a MOJO if you have one. NO TRADES!!! Corky likes collecting people’s MOJOs, so if the distance is too great for you to travel or you have an unconquerable fear of heights, you can send your personal MOJO to me at: Dennis Frisby, 1424 Alpine Drive, Jerome, ID 83338 and log the cache as found. The whole purpose of this cache is to collect MOJOs to present to Corky in a ‘treasure chest’ as a tribute to her.

Since the container is small, when it is apparent it is nearly full of MOJOs it would be great if someone would empty it and drop them off at the above given address. If that isn’t possible, be sure to note in your log that the container is almost full so I can empty it so more can be collected.

The family car can make most of the trip; at least to these coordinates: N43 08.564 W114 46.5811. Beyond that point if would be wiser to either hike or use a high-clearance vehicle. The hike took me approx. ½ hr; that included the climb up the rock.

Good luck, be safe, and pray for a quiet breeze to be blowing when you go after this one; it can get pretty hot out here in the summer.

NOTE: The Gooding City of Rocks is a Wilderness Study Area. As such, it is requested if you find evidence that there is beginning to be too much traffic to any of the caches located there, i.e., human trails being formed, you contact the owner of the cache so it can either be moved to a new location or archived. Natural game trails and cattle trails are not to be considered as human impact trails.
No off-roading with motorcycles, ATVs or other motorized vehicles. Practice CITO while hiking in this area so it can be enjoyed by all who come to this unique place.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When I got out of the car to go place this cache there was a calp of thunder in the distance, the wind was blowing pretty strong, and there were dark, ominous rolling clouds headed my way. But, I remembered Corky’s determination in solving puzzles and facing life in general and decided to push on. 

Corky (Quietbreezes) was an amazing person in a number of ways. She had the compassion, understanding and patience of Aunt Bee on the Andy Griffth Show and the spunk, courage and loyalty of Miss Kitty on Gunsmoke; for those of you who can remember that far back. She suffered in silence without complaint and never looked for glory for her achievements. One of her greatest attributes was being a friend in a time when people are too busy to take the time to become friends.

Corky seemed to thrive in the outdoors and cherished the times when others would take her along on caching trips. She enjoyed the beautiful new sights that geocaching took her to and if you paid attention you would see a smile on her face as she viewed a new vista.

This cache was placed with the thought of how she would have reacted had she been able to make it to the cache site. It will be a challenge for the over 50 crowd and a smaller challenge for the under 40 crowd. It is probably as much of a climb as ETD: On Top of the World (GC12NB0), but longer. The view from the cache site is of Thorn Creek Ranch, the ponds and fields, all the way to Nevada on a clear day; a view I’m sure Corky would have wanted to sit and look at for every detail she could find. Unlike most of us, Corky was content to take in her surroundings at a cache site so she could relive them over and over, something she taught me to do.

The cache should be really easy to find. You only have to remove one rock, so don't tear the whole thing apart to find it.

There is a beaded medicine pouch for the FTF and 5 other smaller medicine pouches for trades. Please, no dollar store trades. I would normally fill these small medicine pouches with dried sage as the Native Americans did, but I’ll leave that to each of those who get one so they can appreciate the experience.

BTW, raindrops just started to splatter on the windshield as I started the car to leave; an answer to a silent prayer. Thanks for going along, Corky; you will be missed.</groundspeak:long_description>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Yes, it is about time that I placed a cache. I have found 1500+ and was starting to feel guilty. I walk in this area frequently so will be able to keep an eye on it and maintain when needed. The waypoint was averaged about 100 times so should be fairly accurate. I would suggest that you park in the American Legion parking lot (where the Mavericks play) on Maverick LN just east of Tower St. Oh yes, bring your own writing device. I hope you enjoy!

                    <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well I needed a bit of adventure and the snow and ice covered roads certainly provided plenty. After heading west from 22, the snow seemed to deepen. I decided not to head up the driveway to the community centre, and instead parked on the side of the road. The short 200 metre walk to the cache site was just what I needed. The find came quickly due to the terrific hint - what a neat spot! Simply a nice spot and hide - TFTH and fun!</groundspeak:text>

            <groundspeak:long_description html="True">One day on our way into Edmonton, I showed my grandson the first wellsite I surveyed in the Slave Lake area when I moved to this area in 1991. He said &quot;You worked in the bush?!?!&quot; You see he is 14 years old and he never saw me survey in the field. He thought that was pretty cool. This cache is hidden on the access road to that wellsite I surveyed long, long ago. This area has been hit with two forest fires since then and is quite open. In 1991 this was solid bush.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I used a compass, not a GPS, to navigate and flag the boundary of the access road from the wellsite to the west of the cache, in to the wellsite I had surveyed with a Theodolite, EDM, and chain. It was in the evening and I was out there by myself much like I am now when caching. I remember singing quite loudly as I flagged through the bush to alert any bears and other wildlife that I was in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The access road is gravel and will be quite slippery when wet, or after a rain. If it is wet you do not want to drive down the hill from the T intersect (approx 60m west of the cache) to the cache. Turn off of the highway at N55° 13.743' W114° 27.566'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DO NOT PARK ON THE HIGHWAY.
